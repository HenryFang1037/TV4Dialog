<1-3,Villager>We've got six pallets worth of patients.

<1-4,Sebastian>I've got some very special medicine here.

15
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,860
<1-4,Sebastian>是从宾州的荷西搞来的
<1-4,Sebastian>It's from Hershey,Pennsylvania.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,020
<1-4,Sebastian>一人一支
<1-4,Sebastian>One per person,one per person.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,280
<1-5,Villager 2>救命啊，塞阪大夫
<1-5,Villager 2>Help,help,Dr. Sebastian

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,780
<1-5,Villager 2>快来
<1-5,Villager 2>Come quickly.

19
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,680
<1-5,Villager 2>我儿子，他跌倒了，他摔在这里了
<1-5,Villager 2>My son,he fell. He fell on this log.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,540
<1-5,Villager 2>我们在等他的药
<1-5,Villager 2>We were just waiting for his meds.

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,530
<1-6,Sebastian>左侧我听不到呼吸声了
<1-6,Sebastian>I got no breath sounds on the left.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,090
<1-6,Sebastian>那个给我
<1-6,Sebastian>Give me that.

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,880
<1-6,Sebastian>对，他会没事的
<1-6,Sebastian>Yeah,he's gonna be okay.

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,500
<2-1,Sebastian>摔跤并没把肺摔出来
<2-1,Sebastian>The fall didn't cause him to drop a lung

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,210
<2-1,Sebastian>是肺的毛病导致了他跌倒，
<2-1,Sebastian>The lung caused him to fall. TB chewed it up.

26
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,180
<2-1,Sebastian>如果再活一年就够运气的了
<2-1,Sebastian>He'll be lucky to live another year.

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,280
<2-1,Sebastian>这是萨尼
<2-1,Sebastian>This is Sarni.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,420
<2-1,Sebastian>我自己拿了支架的标签
<2-1,Sebastian>I picked up the tab for the back brace myself.

29
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,640
<2-1,Sebastian>可笑的是
<2-1,Sebastian>The funny thing is,

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,330
<2-1,Sebastian>支架比他们赖以活命的药
<2-1,Sebastian>is that the brace cost more than the medicine

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,180
<2-1,Sebastian>要贵不少
<2-1,Sebastian>that would've prevented her from needing it.

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,850
<2-1,Sebastian>那是你们的药
<2-1,Sebastian>It's your medicine.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,570
<2-1,Sebastian>所有我们需要的抗生素
<2-1,Sebastian>All of the antibiotics that we need

34
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,460
<2-1,Sebastian>都在这里，你们的仓库
<2-1,Sebastian>are right here in your warehouses

35
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,770
<2-1,Sebastian>工厂里面

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,940
<2-3,Sebastian>但……不够
<2-3,Sebastian>Wh--which is not enough.

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,250
<2-4,Jerry>你知道我们想多贡献,但我们受制于人
<2-4,Jerry>You know we'd love to do more,,but our hands are tied.

39
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,540
<2-5,Sebastian>新车，杰?
<2-5,Sebastian>New car,Jerry?

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,080
<2-5,Sebastian>我进来时看见了，漂亮
<2-5,Sebastian>I saw it on the way in. Looks beautiful.

41
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,100
<2-6,Jerry>别私人化
<2-6,Jerry>Don't make this personal.

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,490
<2-7,Sebastian>一路从德国运来的
<2-7,Sebastian>All the way from Germany,too.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,020
<2-7,Sebastian>我知道会有很多红带子
<2-7,Sebastian>I know that's a lot of red tape.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,020
<2-8,Jerry>我不象你
<2-8,Jerry>I'm not like you.

45
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,630
<2-8,Jerry>我不以享乐为耻
<2-8,Jerry>I'm not ashamed of making a living.

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,890
<2-9,Sebastian>我也知道你主修化学不只为赚钱
<2-9,Sebastian>And I know you didn't become a ,chem major for the money.

47
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,720
<2-9,Sebastian>那样就使我们目标一致了
<2-9,Sebastian>Now,you want the same things that I want.

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,030
<2-9,Sebastian>你只……

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,790
<2-9,Sebastian>你得再努力……
<2-9,Sebastian>You just have to push a little--

51
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,220
<2-9,Sebastian>你得再努力点
<2-9,Sebastian>You have to push a little...bit harder.

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,640
<2-9,Sebastian>再努力
<2-9,Sebastian>Harder for it.

53

<2-12,Cuddy>Really?

63

<2-13,House>在他自我重压下倒塌了吗?
<2-13,House>Crushed under the weight of his own ego?

64
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,400
<2-14,Cuddy>哇
<2-14,Cuddy>Wow.

65

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,950
<2-16,Cuddy>他认为是脑结核（TA）
<2-16,Cuddy>He thinks it's TB.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,910
<2-17,House>他好在不是个梅毒专家
<2-17,House>Good thing he's not the syphilis expert.

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,140
<2-18,Cuddy>他需要验证意见
<2-18,Cuddy>He wants a second opinion.

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,130
<2-19,House>验证他自己，好啊
<2-19,House>Second to his own. Okay.

<3-2,Foreman>你过去从未有过这样的情形吗?
<3-2,Foreman>You've never had an episode like this before?

78
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,380
<3-3,Sebastian>没有。他上月死了
<3-3,Sebastian>No. He died last month.

79

<3-3,Sebastian>愚蠢的跟他表兄分药吃
<3-3,Sebastian>Stupidly tried to share his meds with his cousin

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,250

<3-11,House>How can you sleep at night?

<3-12,Sebastian>在非洲有人死于我们可以治……
<3-12,Sebastian>There's people dying in Africa of a disease ,that we cured--

<3-13,House>I saw the concert.

97
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,290
<3-13,House>但是认真点，我们算算
<3-13,House>But seriously,let's see.You sleep six hours

98
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,350
<3-13,House>每晚你睡六个小时，那就是杀了...
<3-13,House>That means every night you kill...

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,170
<3-10,Sebastian>1,440 个人
<3-10,Sebastian>1,440 people.

100
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,310
<3-13,House>我猜你还是要睡觉的，但是拜托
<3-13,House>I guess you gotta get some sleep,but come on

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,560
<3-13,House>如果你再浪费个10分钟……
<3-13,House>If you'd stayed up another ten minutes,

102
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,600
<3-13,House>该可以救活40个人
<3-13,House>you could've saved 40 lives.

103
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,580
<3-13,House>今早你给家人们发消息了吗?
<3-13,House>Do you send notes to the families in the morning?

104
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,240
<3-13,House>那至少要花10分钟
<3-13,House>That's gonna take at least ten minutes

105
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,500
<3-13,House>那就是说又会有40个死，40个消息得发
<3-13,House>So that's another 40 dead,another 40 notes.

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,050
<3-13,House>干嘛你不回自己屋里用自疚拷打自己去呢?
<3-13,House>Why don't you go rack yourself with ,guilt in your own room?

107
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,350
<3-14,Sebastian>不，谢谢，我留下

110
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,330
<3-15,House>告诉这位医生为什么患者
<3-15,House>Tell the doctor why it's not a good idea

111
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,730
<3-15,House>不宜呆在这里
<3-15,House>for the patient to be here.

112
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,040
<3-16,Cameron>他是免疫学家也是脑结核专家
<3-16,Cameron>He's an immunologist and a TB expert.

113
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,890
<3-17,House>如果我们想听人说“这是TB”
<3-17,House>That'll be very useful if we need somebody

114
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,350
<3-17,House>会很有用
<3-17,House>to say the words,"I think it's TB."

115
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,720
<3-17,House>那是什么味?
<3-17,House>What is that?

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,500
<3-18,Sebastian>哦，那个……
<3-18,Sebastian>Oh,that. I'm sorry.That's,uh--

117
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,520
<3-18,Sebastian>是我的爽身粉
<3-18,Sebastian>That's my body powder.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,700
<3-18,Sebastian>是我能找到唯一
<3-18,Sebastian>It's the only thing I found

119
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,440
<3-18,Sebastian>在撒哈拉有用的
<3-18,Sebastian>that works in the Sahara

120
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,190
<3-18,Sebastian>我习惯了
<3-18,Sebastian>I'm kinda used to it

121
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,490
<3-18,Sebastian>已经闻不到了
<3-18,Sebastian>I don't even notice it.

122
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,890
<3-19,House>还有人觉得象大象的粪味吗?
<3-19,House>Who thinks it smells like an ,elephant dung smoothie?

123
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,120
<3-20,Cameron>我觉得还行
<3-20,Cameron>It smells okay to me.

124
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,510
<3-21,House>那正是病人不能在这的原因
<3-21,House>That is exactly why the patient ,shouldn't be in the room.

125
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,880
<3-21,House>如果你没法告诉一个男人,他的古龙水让你想吐
<3-21,House>If you can't tell a man that his cologne ,makes you want to puke,

126
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,730
<3-21,House>你又怎么能告诉他他是白痴呢?
<3-21,House>how are you gonna tell him that he's an idiot?

127
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,270
<3-22,Cameron>他不是白痴
<3-22,Cameron>He's not an idiot.

128
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,540
<3-23,House>当然你那么说，他在屋里啊
<3-23,House>Sure,you say that now. While he's in the room.

129
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,220
<3-24,Sebastian>我功夫这样
<3-24,Sebastian>I don't have time for this

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,760
<3-24,Sebastian>-是 TB ,-不是
<3-24,Sebastian>-It's TB ,-Nope

131
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,950
<3-25,House>症状太杂
<3-25,House>Symptoms are too varied.

132
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,040
<3-26,Sebastian>如果你没见过10,000个病例
<3-26,Sebastian>Well,if you haven't seen 10,000 cases,

133
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,490
<3-26,Sebastian>我同意你的意见
<3-26,Sebastian>I agree that's what you'd think.

134
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,770
<3-27,House>我告诉你了他是白痴
<3-27,House>I told you he's an idiot.

135
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,450
<3-27,House>你说你要验证意见
<3-27,House>You said you wanted a second opinion.

136
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,690
<3-28,Sebastian>其实不要
<3-28,Sebastian>No,actually.

137
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,310
<3-28,Sebastian>我的赞助商们要
<3-28,Sebastian>My backers wanted a second opinion.

138
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,970
<3-28,Sebastian>对
<3-28,Sebastian>Yeah

139
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,280
<3-29,House>穿着有商标的鞋死掉
<3-29,House>Doesn't look good if you drop dead

140
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,340
<3-29,House>不好看啊
<3-29,House>while wearing your shoe sponsor's logo.

141
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,360
<3-30,Sebastian>是TB，而且我不会死
<3-30,Sebastian>It's TB. And I'm not dying.

142
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,720
<3-30,Sebastian>我需要你们给我植入PPD
<3-30,Sebastian>I'm gonna want you to plant a PPD

143
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,850
<3-30,Sebastian>引流痰液验证TB
<3-30,Sebastian>and induce a sputum to confirm the TB

144
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,010
<3-30,Sebastian>成像可确定进展
<3-30,Sebastian>Imaging studies will determine the progress

145
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,950
<3-30,Sebastian>然后，我想再给我肺
<3-30,Sebastian>And,uh,I think we should probably

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
<3-30,Sebastian>做个CT扫描吧
<3-30,Sebastian>take a CT scan of my lungs,

147
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,900
<3-30,Sebastian>那样有人就不会怀疑了吧?
<3-30,Sebastian>just so that nobody second-guesses us?

148
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,390
<3-31,House>不想那样
<3-31,House>Wouldn't want that.

149
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,750
<3-31,House>喂?
<3-31,House>Hello?

150
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,000
<3-32,Sebastian>不，我觉得好多了
<3-32,Sebastian>No,I'm feeling much better

151
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,470
<3-32,Sebastian>你做你能做的
<3-32,Sebastian>Well,what you can do is, you can,uh,get your board

152
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,780
<3-32,Sebastian>争取同意更多药品运输量……
<3-32,Sebastian>to approve the increased med shipments,that--

153
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,300
<3-32,Sebastian>抱歉，别试
<3-32,Sebastian>Sorry.Uh-huh. Uh-huh. No,don't--don't try.

154
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,970
<3-32,Sebastian>别尽力
<3-32,Sebastian>Whatev--no,don't-- Don't do your best.

155
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,110
<3-32,Sebastian>只做到，好吗?
<3-32,Sebastian>Just get it done,okay?

156
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,530
<3-32,Sebastian>是斯塔克
<3-32,Sebastian>That's Stoia Tucker.

157
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,300
<3-32,Sebastian>他们是好制药商
<3-32,Sebastian>And they're the nice pharmaceutical company.

158
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,350
<3-33,Cameron>对不起，这违反医院规则
<3-33,Cameron>I'm sorry,but it's against hospital regs.

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,130
<3-34,Sebastian>哦，我需要电话
<3-34,Sebastian>Oh,I need the phone.

160
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,780
<3-35,Chase>我们干嘛不集中对付你的健康问题呢?
<3-35,Chase>Why don't we focus on getting you ,better right now?

161
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,090
<3-36,Sebastian>那，你要干嘛，扔我出去吗?
<3-36,Sebastian>Well,what do you do?Throw me out?

162
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,110
<3-37,Foreman>不，只是电话而已
<3-37,Foreman>No,just the phone

163
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,110
<3-38,Chase>对不起，我们有急诊
<3-38,Chase>Sorry,we've got an emergency.

<3-38,Chase>赶紧走
<3-38,Chase>Gotta go.

165
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,980
<3-39,Cameron>你房间里有电话
<3-39,Cameron>There's a phone in your room.

166
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,420
<3-40,Sebastian>对，我猜也是
<3-40,Sebastian>Yeah,I figured that there would be.

167
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,030
<3-41,Cameron>对，我想……
<3-41,Cameron>Right,I...I just thought--

168
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,130
<3-41,Cameron>这不象你在非洲惯呆的医院
<3-41,Cameron>It's not like the hospitals you may be ,used to in Africa.

169
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,880
<3-41,Cameron>我不知道是否便捷……
<3-41,Cameron>Um,I don't know what the facilities were like,so--

170
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,840
<3-42,Sebastian>谢谢你
<3-42,Sebastian>Thank you.

171
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
<3-43,Cameron>不要客气
<3-43,Cameron>You're welcome.

172
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,280
<3-44,Sebastian>谢谢支票
<3-44,Sebastian>And thanks for that check.

173
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,510
<3-45,Cameron>我得走了
<3-45,Cameron>I should go.

174
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,050
<4-1,House>有面无名的可怜虫
<4-1,House>The nameless poor have a face

175
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,020
<4-1,House>华而不实的白人
<4-1,House>and it's a pompous white man.

176
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,200
<4-2,Cameron>对啊，这混蛋
<4-2,Cameron>Yeah,what a jerk.

177
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,160
<4-2,Cameron>敢那样救人
<4-2,Cameron>Saving all those lives like that.

178
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,050
<4-3,Foreman>什么急事?
<4-3,Foreman>What's the emergency?

179
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,640
<4-4,House>我忘了怎么遛狗了
<4-4,House>I can't remember how to do walk-the-dog.

180
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,390
<4-4,House>那家伙病了，快死了
<4-4,House>The guy's sick.Maybe dying

181
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,860
<4-4,House>我们还没做症状鉴别呢
<4-4,House>We've forgotten all about doing ,a differential diagnosis.

182
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,480
<4-5,Cameron>你派我们去给他做……
<4-5,Cameron>You just sent us off to test him for--

183
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,200
<4-6,House>嗯，我得把他轰出去啊
<4-6,House>Well,I had to get him out of there.

184
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
<4-6,House>现在我们可以坐一起骂他混蛋了
<4-6,House>Now we can all sit around and call him an idiot.

185
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,370
<4-6,House>谁先?
<4-6,House>Who wants to go first?

186
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,170
<4-6,House>他是对的
<4-6,House>He's right

187
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,830
<4-7,Cameron>结核的症状很多
<4-7,Cameron>Tuberculosis could present hundreds ,of different ways.

188
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,860
<4-8,House>用那个逻辑
<4-8,House>Well,by that logic

189
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,440
<4-8,House>医院里所有人都该治疗
<4-8,House>everyone in the hospital should be treated.

190
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,350
<4-9,Foreman>并不是医院所有人在过去的20年里
<4-9,Foreman>Not everybody in the hospital's been exposed to it

191
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,540
<4-9,Foreman>都暴露在那样的环境中啊
<4-9,Foreman>for the last 20 years.

192
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,350
<4-10,House>TB用数年致人死命
<4-10,House>TB takes years to kill you.

193
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,010
<4-10,House>两周前他还很健康
<4-10,House>Two weeks ago,he was perfectly healthy.

194
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,840
<4-10,House>现在却有多的可以写满白板的症状
<4-10,House>Now he's got a whiteboard full of symptoms.

195
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,850
<4-11,Chase>是不是代谢问题?
<4-11,Chase>What about something metabolic?

196
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,510
<4-12,House>欢迎登陆“马屁精号”
<4-12,House>Welcome aboard the good ship Ass-Kisser.

197
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,810
<4-12,House>航行的好天气啊
<4-12,House>Nice day for a sail. Pucker up,me hardies.

198
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,090
<4-13,Cameron>不是代谢
<4-13,Cameron>It's not metabolic.

199
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,370
<4-13,Cameron>肾、肝、甲状腺都正常
<4-13,Cameron>Kidney,liver,and thyroid are all normal.

200
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,260
<4-13,Cameron>没糖尿病
<4-13,Cameron>No diabetes.

201
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,510
<4-14,Chase>他的心脏呢?
<4-14,Chase>What about his heart?

202
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,650
<4-15,House>明显的，跟其他户外爱好者一样大
<4-15,House>Obviously,big as all outdoors.

203
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,130
<4-16,Chase>反常心律
<4-16,Chase>Abnormal heart rhythm.

204
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,730
<4-16,Chase>震动形式显示P-R的可变性
<4-16,Chase>Wave forms show P-R variability.

205
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,740
<4-17,House>很微小，但有
<4-17,House>It's subtle,but it's there.

206
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,860
<4-18,Foreman>你觉得是心脏?心窦综合症？
<4-18,Foreman>You think it's his heart? Sick sinus syndrome?

207
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,700
<4-19,House>没准
<4-19,House>Loose throttle.

208
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,700
<4-19,House>心跳时快时慢
<4-19,House>Sometimes beats too fast,sometimes too slow.

209
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,070
<4-20,Chase>导致昏倒
<4-20,Chase>Causing him to pass out.

210
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,580
<4-21,Cameron>该可以导致这情形
<4-21,Cameron>It would account for the episode.

211
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,490
<4-21,Cameron>我要给他带遥感器
<4-21,Cameron>I'll put him on telemetry

212
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,440
<4-21,Cameron>做压力测试和超声波
<4-21,Cameron>do a stress test and an echocardiogram.

213
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,900
<4-22,House>对待他同于其他住院病人一样
<4-22,House>Treat him like every other hospital patient.

214
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:05,050
<4-22,House>我要看到那个尽责的,满身擦粉的家伙穿上睡袍晃
<4-22,House>I want to see that pious,body-powdered ,tush hanging out of his gown.

215
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,550
<5-1,Sebastian>你能帮我弄这个吗?
<5-1,Sebastian>Could you give me a hand with this thing?

216
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,960
<5-1,Sebastian>我不记得要求做
<5-1,Sebastian>I don't recall asking

217
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,450
<5-1,Sebastian>压力试验和超声波
<5-1,Sebastian>for a stress test or an echocardiogram.

218
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,710
<5-2,Cameron>那你要怎样，离开吗?
<5-2,Cameron>What are you gonna do,walk out?

219
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,570
<5-2,Cameron>社团赞助商不喜欢那样
<5-2,Cameron>Corporate sponsors aren't gonna like that.

220
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,770
<5-2,Cameron>伸胳膊
<5-2,Cameron>I need your forearm.

221
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,270
<5-3,Sebastian>豪斯怎么想?
<5-3,Sebastian>What's House thinkin'?

222
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,780
<5-4,Cameron>心窦综合症
<5-4,Cameron>Sick sinus syndrome.

223
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,810
<5-5,Sebastian>那可比TB严重多了
<5-5,Sebastian>Well,that's a lot more serious than TB.

224
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,680
<5-5,Sebastian>那是PPD吗?
<5-5,Sebastian>Is that a PPD?

225
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,630
<5-6,Cameron>如果48小时内变颜色……
<5-6,Cameron>If it changed color in the next 48 hours--

226
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,350
<5-7,Sebastian>对，如果 House不认为是TB
<5-7,Sebastian>Yeah,if,uh,if House doesn't think it's TB,

227
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,910
<5-7,Sebastian>干嘛他不让你做呢?
<5-7,Sebastian>why would he have you test for that?

228
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,370
<5-8,Cameron>只是要掩盖所有基本吧，我猜
<5-8,Cameron>Just...covering all his bases. I guess.

229
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,460
<5-9,Sebastian>嗯
<5-9,Sebastian>Uh-huh.

230
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,870
<5-9,Sebastian>他不是那么干的人
<5-9,Sebastian>He doesn't seem like a guy who--who does that.

231
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,480
<5-10,Cameron>我们安排你10:30 回声检查
<5-10,Cameron>We have you scheduled for a 10:30 echo.

232
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,570
<5-11,Sebastian>干的好
<5-11,Sebastian>Good for you.

233
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,140
<6-1,House>我们一旦拒绝爱,
<6-1,House>Every minute that we refuse to love one another,

234
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,170
<6-1,House>就会有只小狗掉眼泪
<6-1,House>another puppy cries another tear.

235
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,440
<6-2,Wilson>你生气是因为
<6-2,Wilson>You're just mad because he's closer

236
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,950
<6-2,Wilson>他比你接近诺贝尔奖
<6-2,Wilson>to a Nobel Prize than you are.

237
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,440
<6-3,House>我还没钉上足够的瑞典人
<6-3,House>And yet I've nailed more Swedish babes.

238
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,920
<6-3,House>疯狂，疯狂的世界
<6-3,House>Crazy,crazy world.

239
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,510
<6-4,Wilson>你知道那不止是去一趟斯德哥尔摩
<6-4,Wilson>It's not just a trip to Stockholm,you know.

240
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,560
<6-4,Wilson>是现金奖赏
<6-4,Wilson>It comes with a cash prize.

241
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,480
<6-5,House>真的?
<6-5,House>Seriously?

242
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,640
<6-5,House>怪不得有那么多人追那个叫“和平”的玩意
<6-5,House>No wonder everybody's going after ,that "peace" thing.

243
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,370
<6-6,Wilson>他每年救活千把人
<6-6,Wilson>He cures thousands of people every year.

244
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,620
<6-6,Wilson>你治愈多少,30?
<6-6,Wilson>You cure-- What,30?

245
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,010
<6-7,House>麦当劳比你妈妈做更好吃的汉堡
<6-7,House>McDonald's makes a better hamburger ,than your mother

246
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,500
<6-7,House>因为他们做的多吗?
<6-7,House>because they make more?

247
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,010
<6-8,Wilson>哦，我明白了
<6-8,Wilson>Oh! I see.

248
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,470
<6-8,Wilson>你恨他因为他救的生命
<6-8,Wilson>So you hate him because the lives he saves

249
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,640
<6-8,Wilson>不如你救的值钱？
<6-8,Wilson>aren't as good as the lives you save.

250
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,670
<6-9,House>对，那是原因
<6-9,House>Yeah. That's the reason.

251
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,340
<6-9,House>诺贝尔发明了炸药，我不要他粘血的钱
<6-9,House>Nobel invented dynamite. I won't accept ,his blood money.

252
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,340
<7-1,Mandy>我的头顶要我的命
<7-1,Mandy>The top of my head's killing me.

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
<7-1,Mandy>嗯
<7-1,Mandy>Mm.

254
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,230
<7-2,House>我们在解剖学时花一周时间对付“头顶”
<7-2,House>We spent a week doing "top of head" in anatomy.

255
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,450
<7-2,House>我知道那个位置
<7-2,House>I know just where it is.

256
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
<7-2,House>哇
<7-2,House>Ow!

257
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,310
<7-3,Mandy>那不是我的头顶
<7-3,Mandy>That is not the top of my head.

258
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,170
<7-4,House>对临床来说够近了
<7-4,House>Ah,close enough for a clinic.

259
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,170
<7-4,House>你的窦阻塞了
<7-4,House>Your sinuses are clogged.

260
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,130
<7-4,House>根据你手臂的划痕来看,
<7-4,House>Judging by the scratches on your hands,

261
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,870
<7-4,House>我猜是只新猫
<7-4,House>I'm guessing a new cat.

262
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,660
<7-5,Mandy>是我妈妈的，她死了
<7-5,Mandy>It was my mother's. She's dead.

263
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,840
<7-6,House>你养死猫?
<7-6,House>You keep a dead cat?

264
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,210
<7-7,Mandy>不，我妈妈死了
<7-7,Mandy>No. My mother's dead.

265
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,420
<7-8,House>哦，可怜的猫
<7-8,House>Oh. Poor cat.

266
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,510
<7-8,House>你过敏了
<7-8,House>You're allergic

267
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,230
<7-8,House>我们可以用抗组胺药控制
<7-8,House>We can control it with antihistamine

268
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,490
<7-8,House>一天一片
<7-8,House>One pill a day.

269
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,220
<7-9,Mandy>药片?
<7-9,Mandy>Pills?

270
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,040
<7-10,House>你不喜欢吞咽
<7-10,House>You don't like to swallow.

271
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,200
<7-10,House>不奇怪
<7-10,House>Not surprised.

272
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,680
<7-10,House>不要药片了
<7-10,House>Forget the pills.

273
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,880
<7-10,House>我给你开个鼻腔喷雾器
<7-10,House>I'm gonna give you a nasal spray.

274
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,710
<7-11,Mandy>类固醇?
<7-11,Mandy>Steroids?

275
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,960
<7-11,Mandy>还有别的能给我吗?
<7-11,Mandy>Is there something else you can give me?

276
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,430
<7-12,House>如果你住在河边,
<7-12,House>Well,if you lived by the river,

277
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,670
<7-12,House>我有袋子
<7-12,House>I've got a bag.

278
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,590
<8-1,Foreman>嘿，压力试验正常
<8-1,Foreman>Hey. Stress test was normal.

279
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,050
<8-2,House>但EKG不正常
<8-2,House>But his EKG was not normal.

280
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,740
<8-3,Foreman>回声检查正常
<8-3,Foreman>Echo's normal.

281
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,610
<8-4,House>给你两分，给我一分
<8-4,House>Two for you,one for me.

282
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,080
<8-4,House>我们得找个解扣的
<8-4,House>We need a tiebreaker.

283
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,430
<8-5,Foreman>回声和压力很可信
<8-5,Foreman>Echo and stress test are way more reliable.

284
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,060
<8-6,House>倾斜试验
<8-6,House>Tilt table test.

285
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,780
<8-7,Foreman>从来就无效
<8-7,Foreman>That never works.

286
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,390
<8-8,House>跟你打赌一周的门诊工作时间，有效
<8-8,House>Bet you a week's clinic duty it does.

287
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,760
<8-9,Foreman>好
<8-9,Foreman>You're on

288
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,530
<9-1,House>喜欢这家伙吗?
<9-1,House>Like this guy?

289
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,980
<9-2,Foreman>你老说我们的观点与病人无关
<9-2,Foreman>You always tell us our opinion of ,the patient's irrelevant

290
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,800
<9-3,House>医学上，无关
<9-3,House>Medically,it's irrelevant.

291
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,740
<9-3,House>但却与你有关
<9-3,House>It says something about you.

292
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,750
<9-4,Foreman>你认为
<9-4,Foreman>You figure anybody

293
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,460
<9-4,Foreman>任何关心非洲人生死的人
<9-4,Foreman>who gives a crap about people in Africa

294
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,830
<9-4,Foreman>就有关了吗?
<9-4,Foreman>must be full of it?

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,940
<9-5,House>对
<9-5,House>Yes.

296
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,420
<9-5,House>我们关心自己的亲友
<9-5,House>There's an evolutionary imperative ,why we give a crap about

297
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,140
<9-5,House>有进化理论作为理由
<9-5,House>our family and friends

298
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,590
<9-5,House>同样有进化理由支持我们
<9-5,House>And there's an evolutionary imperative

299
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,850
<9-5,House>对其他人漠不关心
<9-5,House>why we don't give a crap about anybody else.

300
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,710
<9-5,House>如果我们无任爱人
<9-5,House>If we loved all people indiscriminately

301
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,370
<9-5,House>我们就失去功效了
<9-5,House>we couldn't function,Mm

302
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,910
<9-6,Foreman>所以伟大的人道主义者跟我们一样自私?
<9-6,Foreman>So the great humanitarian's as selfish ,as the rest of us?

303
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,090
<9-7,House>只是不象表现的那么热衷
<9-7,House>Just not as honest about it.

304
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,720
<9-8,Foreman>你也老说动机不相干
<9-8,Foreman>Well,you also always tell us motives ,are irrelevant.

305
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,350
<9-8,Foreman>查医生,你的心脏对付
<9-8,Foreman>Dr. Charles,your heart's handling the changes

306
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,020
<9-8,Foreman>倾斜功能发挥正常
<9-8,Foreman>in orientation just fine.

307
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,560
<9-8,Foreman>EKG上没有停顿
<9-8,Foreman>No pauses on your EKG.

308
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,150
<9-8,Foreman>而豪斯就要对他的赌注...
<9-8,Foreman>And House drives in for the lay-up and...

309
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,480
<9-8,Foreman>不，反对！
<9-8,Foreman>No! Rejected!

310
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,610
<9-9,House>这个按钮是干什么的?
<9-9,House>What does this knobby thing do?

311
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,340
<9-10,Foreman>我在可受范围之内
<9-10,Foreman>I'm within protocol range,you're not gonna get

312
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,300
<9-10,Foreman>你得不出不同答案
<9-10,Foreman>a different result.

313
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,930
<9-11,House>我想的是,
<9-11,House>The way I figure it is,

314
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,680
<9-11,House>如果这个东西在6就能显示问题...
<9-11,House>if this could show you problems at six...

315
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,360
<9-11,House>想像一下如果到10会发生什么？
<9-11,House>imagine what it'll tell you if you ,crank it to ten.

316
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
<9-12,Sebastian>豪斯? 是你吗?
<9-12,Sebastian>House? Is that you?

317
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,840
<9-13,House>能到11吗?
<9-13,House>Does it go to 11?

318
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,140
<9-14,Foreman>停止好吗？
<9-14,Foreman>Would you stop?You lost

319
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,350
<9-14,Foreman>我被安排周四和周五出诊
<9-14,Foreman>I'm scheduled for clinic duty Thursday and Friday.

320
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,290
<9-15,Sebastian>好了，我开始觉得恶心了
<9-15,Sebastian>All right,I'm beginning to feel nauseous.

321
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,010
<9-16,Foreman>你别弄了会坏的
<9-16,Foreman>Would you turn the damn thing off ,before you break it?

322
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,580
<9-17,Sebastian>好吧，我开始头晕了
<9-17,Sebastian>Okay,I'm getting dizzy

323
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,900
<9-17,Sebastian>我看不见了，而且快晕过去了
<9-17,Sebastian>I can't see,and I'm gonna pass out.

324
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,560
<9-18,House>我赢了
<9-18,House>I win.

325
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,720
<9-19,Foreman>那样的速度连宇航员也会晕
<9-19,Foreman>Those speeds,astronauts throw up.

326
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,790
<9-20,House>我说的不是恶心
<9-20,House>I'm not talking about the nausea.

327
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,180
<10-1,Foreman>是相关试验结果
<10-1,Foreman>The test revealed the problem

328
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,190
<10-2,Sebastian>是吗? 豪斯疯了?
<10-2,Sebastian>Yeah? House is insane?

329
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,120
<10-2,Sebastian>他刚做的是……
<10-2,Sebastian>What he just did--

330
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,050
<10-3,Foreman>滥用和非专业的，但是...
<10-3,Foreman>Abusive and unprofessional.But...

331
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,250
<10-3,Foreman>如果没那么做，我们就不会发现问题
<10-3,Foreman>if hadn't have done it,we wouldn't,have seen the problem.

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,050
<10-3,Foreman>你有一个反常的P-R间歇
<10-3,Foreman>You've got an abnormal P-R interval.

333
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,540
<10-3,Foreman>可能很危险
<10-3,Foreman>Could be dangerous.

334
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,570
<10-3,Foreman>可能致命,尤其是在非洲
<10-3,Foreman>Possibly fatal,particularly if you're in Africa,

335
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,100
<10-3,Foreman>远离先进的医疗系统
<10-3,Foreman>away from advanced medicine.

336
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,640
<10-4,Sebastian>我需要起搏器吗?
<10-4,Sebastian>I'm gonna need a pacemaker?

337
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,150
<10-5,Foreman>我们安排你今天下午做手术了
<10-5,Foreman>We've scheduled you for surgery this afternoon.

338

<10-5,Foreman>我们可以在任意地点维持你的起搏器
<10-5,Foreman>We'll be able to maintain your ,pacemaker from anywhere

339
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,310
<11-1,Cameron>你只需要一段时间找个电话线
<11-1,Cameron>you just need to get yourself to a ,phone line every few months

340
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,390
<11-2,Sebastian>或者你可以加入我们的门诊
<11-2,Sebastian>Or better yet,you could join me at ,one of my clinics.

341
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,570
<11-3,Cameron>我被宠坏了
<11-3,Cameron>I'm kinda spoiled.

342
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,370
<11-4,Sebastian>我们可以给你一个带风景的小屋,你喜欢沙子吗?
<11-4,Sebastian>Well,we'll get you a hut with a view,,do you like sand?

343
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,440
<11-5,Cameron>我的意思是药物，没有PET扫描
<11-5,Cameron>I meant medically. No PET scans.

344
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,810
<11-6,Sebastian>没有核磁共振，简直荒谬
<11-6,Sebastian>No MRIs-- This is ridiculous.

345
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,420
<11-7,Cameron>查医生……我知道,医院规章
<11-7,Cameron>Dr. Charles-- I know,I know. Hospital regulations.

<12-2,Cameron>Basement. All right.

351
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,510
<12-3,Sebastian>你或许会发现……
<12-3,Sebastian>You might even find that,uh,

352
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,100
<12-3,Sebastian>没有技术的支撑
<12-3,Sebastian>without the technological crutches,

353
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,770
<12-3,Sebastian>你变成了更棒的诊断专家
<12-3,Sebastian>you become a better diagnostician.

354
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,270
<12-3,Sebastian>我的心脏能应付这个，对吧?
<12-3,Sebastian>My heart can handle this,right?

355
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,250
<12-4,Cameron>到目前为止，是嘉年华让你出问题的
<12-4,Cameron>Uh,so far,just carnival rides have set you off.

356
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,110
<12-5,Sebastian>当你见到那些人，他们让你改变
<12-5,Sebastian>When you meet these people,it changes you.

357
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,310
<12-5,Sebastian>我们该在晚餐后谈论这些
<12-5,Sebastian>We should talk about it over dinner.

358
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,490
<12-6,Cameron>你是邀我去非洲还是约会?
<12-6,Cameron>Are you asking me to Africa or on a date?

359
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,450
<12-7,Sebastian>哦，我可以邀你走半个地球
<12-7,Sebastian>Oh,I can ask you halfway around the world,

360
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,070
<12-7,Sebastian>却不能邀你去一条街远的餐厅吗?
<12-7,Sebastian>I can't ask you to a restaurant a block away?

361
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,740
<12-8,Cameron>一个是工作，令一个是……
<12-8,Cameron>Well,one's a job and the other's-- Uh-huh

362
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,940
<12-9,Sebastian>对，医院规章，不能约会病人，对吧?
<12-9,Sebastian>Yeah, Hospital regs. You can't date ,patients,right?

363
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,580
<12-9,Sebastian>我不打算...
<12-9,Sebastian>I wouldn't want to...

364
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,150
<12-9,Sebastian>拿你宝贵的客观性冒险
<12-9,Sebastian>risk your precious objectivity.

365
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,850
<12-9,Sebastian>顺便说，你哪个问题也没回答呢
<12-9,Sebastian>You haven't answered either question, by the way

366
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,330
<12-10,Cameron>你不觉得客观性重要吗?
<12-10,Cameron>You don't think objectivity's important?

367
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,770
<12-11,Sebastian>我觉得象House那样依赖客观的医生
<12-11,Sebastian>I think doctors like House cling to objectivity

368
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,470
<12-11,Sebastian>很象依赖毯子的三岁小孩
<12-11,Sebastian>like a three-year-old to a blanket.

369
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,080
<12-11,Sebastian>别激动，保持冷静
<12-11,Sebastian>Don't get too worked up. Stay calm.

370
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,220
<12-11,Sebastian>保持正确的看法
<12-11,Sebastian>Stay cool and maintain the correct perspective.

371
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,450
<12-11,Sebastian>他们正常的唯一裂痕是
<12-11,Sebastian>The only flaw in their argument

372
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,920
<12-11,Sebastian>当百万人濒死时
<12-11,Sebastian>is that when you have millions of people dying,

373
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,720
<12-11,Sebastian>正确的看法是由
<12-11,Sebastian>the correct perspective is to be yelling

374
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,750
<12-11,Sebastian>你的肺顶部呼喊出来的
<12-11,Sebastian>at the top of your lungs.

375
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,780
<12-12,Cameron>对不起，我的头要了我的命……
<12-12,Cameron>I'm sorry,my head is--is killing me--

376
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,760
<12-12,Cameron>坐在台阶上
<12-12,Cameron>Sit on the step.

377
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,930
<12-13,Sebastian>那你到底跟不跟我出去呢?
<12-13,Sebastian>So you gonna go out with me or not?

378
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
<12-14,Cameron>你的心跳正常
<12-14,Cameron>Your heart rate's normal.

379
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,360
<12-15,Sebastian>当然，只是一阶台阶而已
<12-15,Sebastian>Yeah,of course it is. It's one flight of stairs.

380
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,010
<12-15,Sebastian>我会没事的
<12-15,Sebastian>I'm gonna be fine.

381
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,600
<12-15,Sebastian>我的手真小……
<12-15,Sebastian>My hand's a little--

382
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,300
<13-1,Cameron>你错了
<13-1,Cameron>You were wrong.

383
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,750
<13-2,House>嗨，我有感觉，我尽力了
<13-2,House>Hey. I have feelings. I'm trying my best.

384
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,090
<13-2,House>对你不够吗?
<13-2,House>Isn't that enough for you?

385
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,230
<13-3,Chase>反常的EKG是真的吗?
<13-3,Chase>The abnormal EKG was real?

386
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,820
<13-4,Cameron>不是心窦综合症
<13-4,Cameron>It's not sick sinus syndrome.

387
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,870
<13-5,House>感谢上帝我们在放起搏器之前发现了
<13-5,House>Thank God we found out before we ,put the pacemaker in

388
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,140
<13-5,House>感谢上帝你把他领近了楼梯间
<13-5,House>Thank God you dragged him into a stairwell

389
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,260
<13-5,House>好让他的心跳加速
<13-5,House>to get his heart racing.

390
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,800
<13-6,Cameron>我们走楼梯，楼梯在楼梯间
<13-6,Cameron>We were taking the stairs. They keep them ,in the stairwell.

391
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,940
<13-7,Chase>这家伙是个自私的混蛋，他干嘛不……
<13-7,Chase>The guy's a selfish jerk. Why would he--

392
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,310
<13-8,Cameron>你干嘛说他自私?
<13-8,Cameron>Why would you say he's selfish?

393
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,370
<13-9,House>因为他跟福满谈了
<13-9,House>Because he's been talking to Foreman.

394
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,720
<13-10,Chase>我没有，我只是发表意见
<13-10,Chase>No,I haven't.I'm just giving my opinion

395
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,360
<13-10,Chase>这种利他主义不自然……
<13-10,Chase>This kind of altruism doesn't just naturally--

396
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,000
<13-11,House>完美的简述，但他还是病人
<13-11,House>Excellent briefing. Hey,the guy's still sick.

397
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,830
<13-12,Foreman>我们可以谈一下吗?
<13-12,Foreman>Can we talk about that?

398
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,870
<13-12,Foreman>头疼指向神经系统问题
<13-12,Foreman>Headaches point to a neurological problem

399
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,250
<13-12,Foreman>声学神经瘤
<13-12,Foreman>Acoustic neuroma.

400
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,350
<13-12,Foreman>脑瘤导致头晕眼花
<13-12,Foreman>Brain tumor causes dizziness,

401
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,810
<13-12,Foreman>意识丧失
<13-12,Foreman>loss of consciousness.

402
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,130
<13-12,Foreman>与呼吸和心跳节律不稳混合
<13-12,Foreman>Mess with,uh,breathing patterns,heart rhythms--

403
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,510
<13-13,House>做核磁共振
<13-13,House>Get an MRI.

404
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,500
<13-13,House>喂?
<13-13,House>Hello?

405
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,440
<13-13,House>哦，对不起，我马上下来
<13-13,House>Oh,I'm sorry. I'll be right down.

406
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,430
<13-13,House>没问题
<13-13,House>No problem

407
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,400
<13-13,House>我会补偿性多做一个小时
<13-13,House>I'll do an extra hour to make up

408
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,960
<13-13,House>我出诊时间晚了
<13-13,House>I'm late for my clinic duty.

<13-13,House>这里，去装我几个小时
<13-13,House>Here,go be me for a couple of hours

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,800
<14-1,Foreman>突发腹泻，发烧
<14-1,Foreman>Explosive diarrhea,fever.

411
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,380
<14-1,Foreman>可能是流感
<14-1,Foreman>It's probably the flu.

412
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,610
<14-1,Foreman>哇
<14-1,Foreman>Wow

413

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,380
<14-4,Cecelia>不，是卡希
<14-4,Cecelia>No. Carter,Cecelia.

416
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,030
<14-5,Foreman>他们把你安排错了房间，希
<14-5,Foreman>They put you in the wrong room,Cecelia.

417
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,810
<14-6,Cecelia>卡太太
<14-6,Cecelia>Mrs. Carter.

<14-6,Cecelia>抱歉
<14-6,Cecelia>Sorry.

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,150
<14-7,Foreman>我一会儿就来
<14-7,Foreman>Uh,I'll just be a few more minutes.

420
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,230
<14-7,Foreman>没法按顺序，全都乱套了
<14-7,Foreman>Don't take these in order,everything falls apart.

421
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,220
<14-8,Cecelia>我得癌了
<14-8,Cecelia>I have cancer.

422
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,130
<14-8,Cecelia>我可以感觉到肿块

<14-10,Cecelia>See you in an hour or two.

425
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,450
<14-11,Foreman>躺平
<14-11,Foreman>Lie flat

426
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,700
<14-11,Foreman>举起你左臂到头下面
<14-11,Foreman>Lift your left arm up and under your head.

427
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,400
<14-11,Foreman>这吗? 行
<14-11,Foreman>Right there? Yeah.

428
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,740
<14-12,Cecelia>我今早感觉到的
<14-12,Cecelia>I felt it this morning.

429
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,250
<14-12,Cecelia>我表姐也有
<14-12,Cecelia>Oh,my cousin had the same thing.

430
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,580
<14-12,Cecelia>没事
<14-12,Cecelia>It's nothing.

431
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,260
<14-13,Foreman>我们下个周期再检查
<14-13,Foreman>We should check it again on your next cycle

432
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,080
<14-13,Foreman>但你真没什么可担心的
<14-13,Foreman>but you really don't have anything to worry about

433
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,380
<14-14,Cecelia>他们也是这么告诉当娜的,她六个月就死了
<14-14,Cecelia>That's what they told Donna. ,She was dead in six months.

434
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,490
<14-15,Foreman>听我说，边缘很滑，能移动
<14-15,Foreman>Listen,the edges are smooth,it has mobility.

435
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,220
<14-15,Foreman>是良性的征兆
<14-15,Foreman>It has all the earmarks of a benign--

436
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,590
<14-16,Cecelia>我干嘛要信你?
<14-16,Cecelia>Why should I believe you?

437
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,870
<14-16,Cecelia>因为你想催我走?
<14-16,Cecelia>Because you're trying to rush me out of here?

438
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,920
<14-17,Foreman>活体检查的假阳性……
<14-17,Foreman>The risks of a false positive on ,a biopsy outweigh--

439
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,690
<14-18,Cecelia>要么你安排活体检查,要么我跟你上级说话
<14-18,Cecelia>Either you do the biopsy,,or I talk to your superior.

440
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,410
<14-18,Cecelia>选哪个...
<14-18,Cecelia>Which is it...

441
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,230
<14-19,Foreman>豪斯医生?
<14-19,Foreman>Dr. House?

442
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,370
<14-19,Foreman>我来安排活体检查
<14-19,Foreman>I'll arrange the biopsy.

443
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,660
<14-20,Cecelia>谢谢
<14-20,Cecelia>Thanks.

444
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,810
<15-1,Cameron>他约我出去
<15-1,Cameron>He asked me out

445
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,860
<15-2,Chase>我很震惊
<15-2,Chase>I'm shocked.

446
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,410
<15-2,Chase>我在病人不约你时才震惊
<15-2,Chase>I'm--I'm shocked when patients don't  ask you out

447
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,260
<15-3,Cameron>他还约我去非洲
<15-3,Cameron>He also asked me to come to Africa.

448
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,360
<15-4,Chase>天啊，他动作挺快啊
<15-4,Chase>Boy,he moves fast.

449
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,780
<15-5,Cameron>我看这两个问题有两个对象
<15-5,Cameron>I think the two questions had ,two different objectives.

450
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,140
<15-6,Chase>你喜欢他?
<15-6,Chase>You like him?

451
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,480
<15-7,Cameron>英俊的单身男士，天才医生
<15-7,Cameron>Good-looking single guy,genius doctor.

452
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,870
<15-7,Cameron>关怀全世界
<15-7,Cameron>Cares about the world.

453
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,460
<15-8,Chase>我看你的答案是不
<15-8,Chase>I take it you said no.

454
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,270
<15-9,Cameron>你觉得我那么在意规矩……
<15-9,Cameron>You think I'm that hung up on rules--

455
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,110
<15-10,Chase>他不是豪斯
<15-10,Chase>He's not House.

456
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,120
<15-10,Chase>那什么都没有
<15-10,Chase>There's nothing there.

457
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,200
<15-11,Cameron>对，有
<15-11,Cameron>Yeah,there is.

458
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,420
<16-1,House>我让你植入PPD了吗?
<16-1,House>Did I ask you to plant a PPD?

459
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,330
<16-2,Cameron>是阳性的
<16-2,Cameron>It was positive.

460
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,650
<16-2,Cameron>他得TB了
<16-2,Cameron>He's got TB.

461
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,290
<16-3,House>他当然有TB
<16-3,House>Well,of course he's got TB!

462
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,110
<16-3,House>这家伙在丛林里20年了
<16-3,House>The guy's been in the jungle for 20 years!

463
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,290
<16-3,House>如果他红眼病测试阳性
<16-3,House>If he tested positive for pinkeye,

464
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,680
<16-3,House>你觉得那是他的大问题吗?
<16-3,House>would you think that was his big problem?

465
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,350
<16-4,Cameron>我做了一个试验，是阳性的,那有问题吗?
<16-4,Cameron>I did a test,it was positive. ,Why is that  a problem?

466
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,870
<16-5,House>因为现在他在他的胳膊上,有了一个红色的大靶子
<16-5,House>Because now he's got the ,big red target on his arm,

467
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,380
<16-5,House>那个顽固的混蛋会以为他对了
<16-5,House>the stubborn jerk thinks he's right.

468
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,850
<16-5,House>他就不会让我们做其他试验了
<16-5,House>He won't let us do any more tests.

469
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,330
<16-6,Cameron>也许他不是唯一一个顽固的混蛋
<16-6,Cameron>Maybe he's not the only stubborn jerk!

470
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,260
<16-6,Cameron>我也做了LP ，低糖
<16-6,Cameron>I did an LP too. Low glucose.

471
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,510
<16-6,Cameron>他的瑟丹比率增高了
<16-6,Cameron>And he has an increased sed rate.

472
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,630
<16-6,Cameron>所有结果指向结核
<16-6,Cameron>Everything screams tuberculosis.

473
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,020
<16-7,House>不是所有
<16-7,House>Not everything!

474
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,540
<16-8,Cameron>如果任何症状都由TB导致
<16-8,Cameron>If any of the symptoms are caused by the TB

475
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,840
<16-8,Cameron>那该偏离我们的诊断
<16-8,Cameron>it would throw off our diagnosis.

476
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,900
<16-8,Cameron>你是对的
<16-8,Cameron>You're right.

477
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,770
<16-9,House>我们得治疗TB
<16-9,House>We gotta treat the TB.

478
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,390
<16-10,Cameron>谁知道呢？也许，他就……好起来呢
<16-10,Cameron>Who knows? Maybe he'll just...get better.

479
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,400
<16-11,House>你会喜欢那么，是吧?
<16-11,House>You'd like that,wouldn't you?

480
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,380
<17-1,Wilson>所以，是TB 也不是TB?
<17-1,Wilson>So it's TB but not TB?

481
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,500
<17-2,House>我复杂
<17-2,House>I'm complicated.

482
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,330
<17-3,Wilson>那家伙知道肺结核
<17-3,Wilson>The guy does know tuberculosis.

483
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,390
<17-3,Wilson>-如果他说可以证明,-那家伙甚至不是个真正的医生
<17-3,Wilson>-If he says it can manifest ,-Guy's not even a real doctor.

484
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,190
<17-4,House>他是活人连续剧
<17-4,House>He's a human telethon.

485
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,670
<17-5,Wilson>那是你跟他的问题吗?
<17-5,Wilson>Is that your problem with him?

486
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,410
<17-5,Wilson>你每天都见伪君子，,这个怎么这么特殊?
<17-5,Wilson>You see hypocrites everyday. ,Why is this guy so special?

487
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,200
<17-6,House>你以为我会用伪善的,态度对待伪善吗?
<17-6,House>You think I have a hypocritical ,attitude to hypocrisy?

488
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,310
<17-6,House>问题是，字母表有26个字母
<17-6,House>The problem is,there are 26 ,letters in the alphabet,

489
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,510
<17-6,House>他只用两个
<17-6,House>and he only uses two of them.

490
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,700
<17-6,House>他用一个诊断对待千百个病人
<17-6,House>He treats thousands of patients ,with one diagnosis.

491
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,800
<17-6,House>他知道结果，是骗人
<17-6,House>He knows the answer going in. It's cheating.

492
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,160
<17-7,Wilson>所以是因为他是那些没用专家的一名?
<17-7,Wilson>So it's all because he's one of them ,useless specialists?

493
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,940
<17-8,House>哦，我是不是伤了大肿瘤专家的感情了?
<17-8,House>Oh,did I hurt the big-time oncologist's ,itty-bitty feelings?

494
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,800
<17-8,House>你对有癌的人是个很大的帮助
<17-8,House>You're a big help to patients who ,actually have cancer.

495
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,380
<17-8,House>其他时候很烦人
<17-8,House>Other times,you're just annoying.

496
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,220
<17-9,Cuddy>你完蛋了
<17-9,Cuddy>You've outdone yourself.

497
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,910
<17-9,Cuddy>我也是那么说的
<17-9,Cuddy>I'll say.

498
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,430
<17-10,House>我的萨拉掩护了一块T骨牛排
<17-10,House>My salad's covering a free T-bone steak.

499
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,510
<17-11,Cuddy>卡希，记得吗?
<17-11,Cuddy>Cecelia Carter,remember her?

500
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,240
<17-12,House>上周他们说“神秘炖菜”，他们欠我的
<17-12,House>Last week they said it was "mystery stew," ,they owe me.

501
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,220
<17-13,Cuddy>她在我办公室哭呢
<17-13,Cuddy>She was just in my office crying

502
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,750
<17-13,Cuddy>因为你对她误诊
<17-13,Cuddy>because of the way you treated her.

503
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,420
<17-14,Wilson>那不象你
<17-14,Wilson>That doesn't sound like you.

504
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,480
<17-15,House>所以很可能根本不是
<17-15,House>Then it probably wasn't.

505
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,190
<17-16,Cuddy>我知道你很喜欢吓唬人
<17-16,Cuddy>I get that you like to shock people.

506
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,760
<17-16,Cuddy>因为愚蠢而以吓唬人为满足
<17-16,Cuddy>Stun them out of complacency,out of stupidity.

507
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,610
<17-16,Cuddy>但这个女人以为自己有癌了
<17-16,Cuddy>But this woman thought she had cancer.

508
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,660
<17-16,Cuddy>她胸部有个肿块
<17-16,Cuddy>She had a lump in her breast.

509
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,980
<17-16,Cuddy>你到底达到什么目的?
<17-16,Cuddy>What were you trying to accomplish?

510
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,950
<17-17,House>我来问你
<17-17,House>Let me ask you something.

511
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,930
<17-17,House>如果这是其他的医生,
<17-17,House>If this were another doctor,

512
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,960
<17-17,House>我们说，她抱怨的是……
<17-17,House>if the patient were complaining about,let's say,

513
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,440
<17-17,House>我不知道，福满，你就变成了
<17-17,House>I don't know,Foreman,you'd just dismiss this

514
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,000
<17-17,House>一个妄想的婊子听另一个妄想婊子的胡话
<17-17,House>as the paranoid bitching of ,another paranoid bitch.

515
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,510
<17-17,House>那么病例归档就该放在“妄”下面
<17-17,House>And file it under "P" for--

516
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,840
<17-18,Wilson>妄想?
<17-18,Wilson>Paranoid?

517
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,760
<17-19,House>我不是
<17-19,House>Am not.

518
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,360
<17-21,House>-你对,-好
<17-21,House>-You're right,-Good

519
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,290
<17-22,Cuddy>今天完事前
<17-22,Cuddy>Apologize to her

520
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,730
<17-22,Cuddy>向她道歉
<17-22,Cuddy>before the end of business today.

521
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,990
<17-23,Wilson>你对希干什么了?
<17-23,Wilson>What did you do to Ceci?

522
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,080
<17-24,House>不知道
<17-24,House>I have no idea.

523
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,630
<17-24,House>只有萨拉，早餐吃多了
<17-24,House>Just the salad today. Big breakfast.

524
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,790
<18-1,Sebastian>嘿
<18-1,Sebastian>Hey.

525
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,640
<18-1,Sebastian>Levofloxacin?
<18-1,Sebastian>Levofloxacin?

526
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,480
<18-2,Cameron>你对TB有抗性.
<18-2,Cameron>You have a resistant strain of TB.

527
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,270
<18-3,Sebastian>哇，你就拿着这些来了
<18-3,Sebastian>Wow,you just walk right in with these.

528
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,180
<18-4,Cameron>那是我们当医生干的活
<18-4,Cameron>That's what we doctors do.

529
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,360
<18-4,Cameron>我们写下药名,
<18-4,Cameron>We write down the name of some medicine,

530
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,660
<18-4,Cameron>然后有人给我们
<18-4,Cameron>and someone gives it to us.

531
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,650
<18-5,Sebastian>你知道，世界上有的地方
<18-5,Sebastian>You know,there's parts of the world ,where you get knifed

532
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,330
<18-5,Sebastian>带这个要带上刀子
<18-5,Sebastian>walking around with this.

533
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,700
<18-5,Sebastian>我的意思是，正规的东西就够糟了...
<18-5,Sebastian>I mean,the regular stuff's bad enough,but...

534
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,900
<18-5,Sebastian>治疗抗性?
<18-5,Sebastian>...treatment for the resistant strain?

535
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,760
<18-5,Sebastian>他们花六块钱买这个
<18-5,Sebastian>They get $6.00 a tablet for that.

536
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,390
<18-5,Sebastian>而我得吃两年
<18-5,Sebastian>And I'll take it for two years.

537
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,580
<18-5,Sebastian>链霉素
<18-5,Sebastian>Streptomycin.

538
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,470
<18-5,Sebastian>那是两个单位
<18-5,Sebastian>Now,that's two grand

539
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,240
<18-5,Sebastian>10个单位就能救活一个人
<18-5,Sebastian>Ten grand,cure one person.

540
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,190
<18-5,Sebastian>我有过一个病人，加尼
<18-5,Sebastian>I had a patient in,uh,Jani once.

541
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,340
<18-5,Sebastian>是个有……
<18-5,Sebastian>It was a mother had--

542
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,470
<18-5,Sebastian>三个孩子的母亲
<18-5,Sebastian>had,uh,three little boys.

543
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,370
<18-5,Sebastian>她得了TB
<18-5,Sebastian>She had resistant TB.

544
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,460
<18-5,Sebastian>她买不起这些
<18-5,Sebastian>She couldn't afford these.

545
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,580
<18-5,Sebastian>她连生计都困难
<18-5,Sebastian>She couldn't afford bread.

546
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,700
<18-5,Sebastian>我们给她常规药……
<18-5,Sebastian>We gave her the regular stuff,but,uh--

547
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,670
<18-5,Sebastian>不出所料，她死了
<18-5,Sebastian>No surprise,she died.

548
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,240
<18-6,Cameron>我很难过
<18-6,Cameron>I'm sorry.

549
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,210
<18-7,Sebastian>我不吃这些药
<18-7,Sebastian>I'm not taking these pills.

550
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,990
<18-8,Cameron>因为她吃不起,
<18-8,Cameron>Because she couldn't get them,

551
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,040
<18-8,Cameron>你就不吃吗?
<18-8,Cameron>you're not gonna take them?

552
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,800
<18-8,Cameron>太愚蠢了
<18-8,Cameron>That's insane.

553
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,520
<18-9,Sebastian>为什么? 因为我比她好?
<18-9,Sebastian>Why? 'Cause I'm better than her?

554
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,110
<18-10,Cameron>因为任其死亡不好,
<18-10,Cameron>Because letting her die was wrong,

555
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,530
<18-10,Cameron>任你死亡也是不对的
<18-10,Cameron>but letting you die is just as wrong.

556
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,290
<18-11,Sebastian>也许我不会死
<18-11,Sebastian>Well,maybe I won't die.

557
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,880
<18-11,Sebastian>也许那样就会有人信我的故事了
<18-11,Sebastian>Maybe somebody will pay more attention to my story

558
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,800
<19-1,Cameron>他认为抗生素公司需要
<19-1,Cameron>He figured the Fromsudecal companies ,need something big

559
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,130
<19-1,Cameron>更大的力量推动他们行动
<19-1,Cameron>to force them into action

560
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,650
<19-1,Cameron>这样媒体报道比非洲村民之死更多
<19-1,Cameron>This is gonna get a lot more media play than ,a thousand African villagers dying

561
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,140
<19-2,House>所以他不吃药
<19-2,House>So he won't take the pills.

562
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,240
<19-3,Chase>《新闻周刊》找你
<19-3,Chase>Newsweek's calling you.

563
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,040
<19-4,House>他也不再同意做任何检查了
<19-4,House>And he won't agree to any more tests.

564
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,140
<19-5,Cameron>他有他的诊断
<19-5,Cameron>He has his diagnosis.

565
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,580
<19-6,House>看到你不听我的发生什么了吧?
<19-6,House>See what happens when you don't listen to me?

566
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,420
<19-7,Cameron>也许百万生灵由此得救
<19-7,Cameron>Maybe millions of lives get saved.

567
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,730
<19-8,House>对，那正是我的观点
<19-8,House>Yeah. That's my point.

568
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,970
<19-8,House>心律加快，夜间盗汗
<19-8,House>Increased heart rate. Night sweats.

569
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,010
<19-8,House>意识丧失
<19-8,House>Loss of consciousness.

570
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,380
<19-8,House>还有粗鲁的性行为
<19-8,House>Besides rough sex,

571
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,020
<19-8,House>他们的共同点是什么?
<19-8,House>what do they all have in common?

572
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,730
<19-10,House>T……不是TB
<19-10,House>T--It's not TB!

573
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,200
<19-11,Chase>他的植物神经系统?
<19-11,Chase>His autonomic nervous system?

574
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,690
<19-12,Cameron>我们知道不是脑瘤
<19-12,Cameron>We know that it's not a brain tumor.

575
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,620
<19-13,Chase>还有什么能吞噬他的神经?
<19-13,Chase>So what else could be eating his nerves?

576
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,000
<19-14,Foreman>自律神经系统？导致羞愧感知失灵？
<19-14,Foreman>Fabry's? Autonomic dysregulation syndrome ,Shy-drager Syndrome

577
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,860
<19-14,Foreman>没关系
<19-14,Foreman>It doesn't matter

578
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,500
<19-14,Foreman>他不会让我们检查他
<19-14,Foreman>He won't let us test him.

579
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,930
<19-15,House>按照我的意思，查塞阪博士是个白痴
<19-15,House>In my opinion,Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot.

580
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,770
<19-15,House>对，你可以引证我的话
<19-15,House>Yeah,you can quote me

581
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,900
<19-15,House>C-U-D-D-Y.
<19-15,House>C-U-D-D-Y.

582
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,580
<20-1,House>塞阪拒绝挽救生命的计划
<20-1,House>Sebastian is refusing life-saving treatment.

583
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,900
<20-2,Cuddy>他拒绝TB的治疗
<20-2,Cuddy>He's refusing TB treatment.

584
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,500
<20-2,Cuddy>你不觉得他有TB
<20-2,Cuddy>You don't think he has TB

585
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,240
<20-2,Cuddy>因此，你少担心点吧
<20-2,Cuddy>Ergo,you should care less.

586
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,710
<20-3,House>他不让我检查他
<20-3,House>He won't let me test him.

587
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,200
<20-4,Cuddy>那你想让我干什么?
<20-4,Cuddy>And what do you want me to do about it?

588
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,890
<20-5,House>按倒他
<20-5,House>Hold him down.

589
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,190
<20-6,Cuddy>你跟卡希道歉了吗?
<20-6,Cuddy>Have you apologized to Cecelia Carter yet?

590
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,250
<20-7,House>相信我，她不想听我说话
<20-7,House>Trust me,she doesn't want to hear from me.

591
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,660
<20-7,House>你看，那家伙在自杀
<20-7,House>Look,the guy is killing himself

<20-8,Cuddy>塞阪在三点要召开记者会
<20-8,Cuddy>Sebastian has called a press conference for 3:00.

602
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,620
<20-10,Cuddy>不是我同意他的做法
<20-10,Cuddy>It couldn't possibly be that I think he's right.

603
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,950
<20-10,Cuddy>只是想做他那样做的一部分而已
<20-10,Cuddy>That I'd like to be a small part of ,what he's doing.

604
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,000
<20-11,House>哦，婊子可以喜欢做爱,那并不表示她们就不是婊子
<20-11,House>Oh,whores can like the sex. ,Doesn't mean they're not whores.

605
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,420

614
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,480
<21-4,Sebastian>我认为我知道最终的结果
<21-4,Sebastian>I think I know what I'll have to look forward to.

<21-4,Sebastian>我知道

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,010
<21-13,House>这东西冲不下去
<21-13,House>This thing just will not flush.

639
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,810
<21-14,Sebastian>你真的以为你到这来
<21-14,Sebastian>Do you really think that if you come in here

640
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,290
<21-14,Sebastian>把温度搞热点
<21-14,Sebastian>and make it a little hot,

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,030
<21-14,Sebastian>有味儿点，我就投降
<21-14,Sebastian>make it smell a little,that I'm just gonna fold

642
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,460
<21-14,Sebastian>并放弃所有对我有意义的事情吗？
<21-14,Sebastian>and abandon everything that matters to me?

643
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,550
<21-15,House>那边还有糟糕的卫生设备
<21-15,House>Lousy sanitation over there too.

645
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,240
<21-15,House>你的生命不同
<21-15,House>Your life is not the same

646
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,830
<21-15,House>结果你用假装是他们,而使他们的真正经历大打折扣
<21-15,House>And you're cheapening everything they're ,going through by pretending you are

647
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,610
<21-16,Sebastian>我是一样的，我不特别
<21-16,Sebastian>I am the same. I'm not special.

648
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,110
<21-17,House>你不能要求象第三世界的,病人那样被治疗
<21-17,House>You can't demand to be treated like any ,third world sick person

<21-17,House>然后召开记者会
<21-17,House>and call a press conference!

650
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,730
<21-18,Sebastian>他们特殊地对待我
<21-18,Sebastian>They treat me special.

651
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,650
<21-18,Sebastian>那不代表我就特殊
<21-18,Sebastian>That doesn't mean I am.

652
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,900
<21-18,Sebastian>哪有不占这样便宜的
<21-18,Sebastian>And what kind of selfish jerk

653
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,790
<21-18,Sebastian>自私的白痴呢?
<21-18,Sebastian>wouldn't take advantage of that fact?

654
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,230
<22-1,Sebastian>都是可以预防的
<22-1,Sebastian>It's all preventable.

<22-1,Sebastian>远超过需要的储量
<22-1,Sebastian>There's more than enough to go around.

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,220
<22-1,Sebastian>那么如果我可以得到,
<22-1,Sebastian>So if I can get 'em,

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,000
<22-1,Sebastian>萨尼呢?
<22-1,Sebastian>Why can't Sarni?

662
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,930
<22-1,Sebastian>又有人刚刚死去
<22-1,Sebastian>Another person just died.

663
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,260
<22-1,Sebastian>你们的愤怒在哪里?
<22-1,Sebastian>Where is your outrage?

664
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,050
<22-1,Sebastian>不，我并不打算牺牲自己
<22-1,Sebastian>No,I have no intention of martyring myself

665
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,300
<23-1,Sebastian>我只是把我自己...
<23-1,Sebastian>I'm just putting myself...

666
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,700
<23-2,House>当然，他们快死了
<23-2,House>Sure,they're dying.

667
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,770
<23-2,House>但被很很地敲了一下
<23-2,House>But it's got a great beat.

668
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,860
<23-3,Wilson>在那样的灯光下一定热死了
<23-3,Wilson>Must be hot as hell under those lights.

669

<23-3,Wilson>对
<23-3,Wilson>Yep.

670
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,130
<23-5,Foreman>嘿，干嘛呼我？他没事吗？
<23-5,Foreman>Hey,why the page? He okay?

00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,050
<23-6,House>他昏迷
<23-6,House>He's in a coma.

<23-6,House>我需要你给希……道歉
<23-6,House>I need you to apologize to Ceci...cecily

673
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,870
<23-7,Foreman>卡太太？为什么？
<23-7,Foreman>Mrs. Carter? For what?

674
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,560
<23-8,House>随便因为什么
<23-8,House>For whatever I did.

675
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,780
<23-9,Foreman>你什么也没做啊
<23-9,Foreman>You didn't do anything.

676
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,570
<23-10,House>那一直就是我的立场
<23-10,House>That has been my position all along.

677
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,870
<23-11,Cuddy>他的胸部X光片呈阴性
<23-11,Cuddy>His chest X-Rays are negative

678
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,510
<23-11,Cuddy>所以他此刻不传染
<23-11,Cuddy>So he's not contagious at this point

679
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,270
<23-11,Cuddy>他目前的情况稳定
<23-11,Cuddy>His condition's currently stable.

680
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,150
<23-11,Cuddy>你是否注意到……
<23-11,Cuddy>Do you ever notice

681
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,330
<23-12,House>历史上自我牺牲的女人……
<23-12,House>how all the self-sacrificing women in history--

682

00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,090
<23-12,House>再想不出来了……
<23-12,House>Can't think of any others--

684
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,440
<23-12,House>他们都是孤独而死
<23-12,House>They all die alone

685
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,870
<23-12,House>而男人，却是乱七八糟的，疯狂
<23-12,House>The men,on the other hand,get so much fuzz,,it's crazy.

686
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,330
<23-13,Wilson>这世界不公啊
<23-13,Wilson>It's an unfair world.

687
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,890
<23-14,Foreman>豪斯，她当时害怕而且不讲理
<23-14,Foreman>House,she was scared and unreasonable

688
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,160
<23-15,House>用肺癌侮辱一个女人
<23-15,House>Insulting a woman with breast cancer.

689
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,570
<23-15,House>那样态度不够正面
<23-15,House>That's a move best left to the pros.

690
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,910
<23-15,House>坦白的讲，你不够专业
<23-15,House>Frankly,you don't have the chops.

691
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,440
<23-16,Foreman>我没侮辱她
<23-16,Foreman>I didn't insult her!

692
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,620
<23-16,Foreman>我只是按她的要求,做了个不必要的活体检查
<23-16,Foreman>I did the unnecessary biopsy,like she wanted

693
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,650
<23-16,Foreman>是阴性的，跟我早料到的一样
<23-16,Foreman>It was negative,like I knew it would be

694
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,780
<23-17,House>要是你怎么办？管他们叫专家吗？
<23-17,House>What'd you do? Call 'em perky?

695
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,360
<23-17,House>你早过了那样发神经行医的年头了
<23-17,House>You are years away from mad skills like that.

696
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,280
<23-17,House>我需要你道歉
<23-17,House>I need you to apologize.

697
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,380
<23-18,Foreman>卡迪那样做因为她以为是你
<23-18,Foreman>Cuddy's only doing this because ,she thinks it's you.

698
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,390
<23-19,House>欢迎到地球
<23-19,House>Welcome to the world.

699
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,540
<23-19,House>人跟人不同，也会被区别对待
<23-19,House>Everyone's different,and everyone ,gets treated different.

700
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,200
<23-19,House>你跟那个抗争，会被卷起来死于TB
<23-19,House>You try fighting that,you wind up dying of TB.

701
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,280
<23-20,Wilson>你干嘛呢?
<23-20,Wilson>What are you doing?

702
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,550
<23-21,House>检查病人的自律神经系统
<23-21,House>Testing the patient's autonomic nervous system.

703
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,010
<23-22,Wilson>当然
<23-22,Wilson>Of course.

704
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,760
<23-23,House>他的内部加热和通风系统关了
<23-23,House>His internal heating and ventilation ,should be off.

705
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,340
<23-23,House>他该不会出汗
<23-23,House>He shouldn't be able to sweat

706
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,570
<23-23,House>那就是他用那么可怕的爽身粉的原因
<23-23,House>That's why he's got that awful body powder

707
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,150
<23-23,House>拿走它，打开暖气，把他安置在灯光下
<23-23,House>Take it away,crank up the heat,stick him ,under the lights.

708
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,890
<23-23,House>他无法冷却自己
<23-23,House>He can't cool himself.

709
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,700
<23-23,House>他该变得鲜红
<23-23,House>He should be turning bright red

710
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,550
<23-24,Wilson>图像还可以啊
<23-24,Wilson>Picture's fine.

711
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,080
<23-25,Sebastian>我请求斯塔克拯救这些生灵
<23-25,Sebastian>I'm asking Stoia Tucker to save these lives,

712
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,810
<23-25,Sebastian>数百万生灵，包括我
<23-25,Sebastian>millions of lives,including my own.

713
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:18,770
<23-26,Cuddy>豪斯医生
<23-26,Cuddy>Dr. House.

714
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,780
<23-27,Sebastian>我谢谢你如果你能让我们……
<23-27,Sebastian>I would appreciate it if you left us all--

715
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,030
<23-25,Sebastian>把那个拿开
<23-25,Sebastian>Get that outta my face.

716
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,870
<23-26,Cuddy>你想证明什么，豪斯?
<23-26,Cuddy>What are you trying to prove,House?

717
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,450
<23-27,Sebastian>豪斯医生，如果你能离开我会感谢你的
<23-27,Sebastian>Dr. House, I would appreciate it ,if you left the room

718
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,900
<23-28,House>他象只猪一样出汗
<23-28,House>He's sweating like a pig.

719
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,280
<23-29,Cameron>这有上百度
<23-29,Cameron>It's a hundred degrees in here,House,

720
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,890
<23-29,Cameron>－－是你关的暖气,－－他们能听见我吗?
<23-29,Cameron>because you turned up the thermostat,-- Did they hear me?

721
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,460
<23-30,Sebastian>媒体，他们听呢吗?
<23-30,Sebastian>The media,did they listen?

722
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,290
<23-31,House>他已丧失意识
<23-31,House>He's disoriented.Where's the--

723
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,030
<23-32,Sebastian>他们得听我说
<23-32,Sebastian>They have to hear me.

724
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,260
<23-33,House>他的动脉压力增高了
<23-33,House>His arteries are clamping down.

725
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,130
<23-34,Cuddy>所有人离开房间
<23-34,Cuddy>I want everybody out of her now!

726
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,580
<23-35,House>把压力车推来，他需要做胃部引流
<23-35,House>Get the crash cart. He's having a cardiac arrest.

727
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,500
<23-36,Cuddy>让他们出去
<23-36,Cuddy>Get them out!

728
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,700
<23-36,Cuddy>所有人，出去
<23-36,Cuddy>Everyone--I want everyone out of here now

729
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,980
<23-37,Cameron>清理
<23-37,Cameron>Clear.

730
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,590
<23-37,Cameron>加油啊，塞阪
<23-37,Cameron>Come on,Sebastian.

731
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,250
<23-37,Cameron>清理
<23-37,Cameron>Clear.

732
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,500
<23-38,Cuddy>有心律
<23-38,Cuddy>We have sinus rhythm.

733
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,340
<23-39,House>那不是TB
<23-39,House>That is not TB.

734
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,400
<23-40,Wilson>引人注目的电视节目
<23-40,Wilson>Compelling television.

735
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,730
<24-1,Sebastian>做任何你想做的测试
<24-1,Sebastian>Do whatever tests you want.

736
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,970
<24-2,House>我想拿你得TB了治疗
<24-2,House>I want to treat you for TB

737
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,380
<24-2,House>卡梅伦医生在你脑脊髓液里
<24-2,House>Dr. Cameron found low sugar

738
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,180
<24-2,House>发现了低糖
<24-2,House>in your cerebrospinal fluid.

739
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,050
<24-2,House>是TB的经典发现
<24-2,House>It's a classic finding of TB.

740
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,660
<24-3,Sebastian>现在你觉得TB是问题了？
<24-3,Sebastian>Now you think TB's the problem?

741
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,200
<24-3,Sebastian>不是
<24-3,Sebastian>Nah.

742
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,640
<24-4,House>TB导致热天的心跳骤停,
<24-4,House>TB caused cardiac arrest on a hot day,

743
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,950
<24-4,House>你在非洲工作
<24-4,House>your work in Africa would be

744
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,780
<24-4,House>按说早该比这会儿的问题要多
<24-4,House>even more futile than it already is.

745
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,680
<24-5,Sebastian>你能说重点吗?
<24-5,Sebastian>Can you get to your point,please?

746
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,450
<24-5,Sebastian>我办公室的那块白板
<24-5,Sebastian>That whiteboard in my office.

747
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,400
<24-6,House>现在写满症状
<24-6,House>We're up to about a dozen symptoms now.

748
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,690
<24-6,House>心博停止
<24-6,House>Cardiac arrest.

749
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,350
<24-6,House>明显不是TB
<24-6,House>Clearly not TB.

750
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,870
<24-6,House>脑脊髓液糖明显不是 TB
<24-6,House>CSF sugar clearly is TB.

751
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,870
<24-6,House>其他的可以兼顾
<24-6,House>The rest of them could go either way.

752
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,090
<24-6,House>除非我们知道需要兼顾什么
<24-6,House>Unless we know which ones are which,

753
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,960
<24-6,House>我无法诊断你
<24-6,House>I can't diagnose you.

754
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,450
<24-7,Sebastian>我愿意做任何你需要做的试验
<24-7,Sebastian>I'll take any other tests or treatments ,you might want to prescribe

755
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,740
<24-8,House>也就是说你不特殊，但TB特殊
<24-8,House>So you're not special. But TB is.

756
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,750
<24-9,Sebastian>人们死于TB因为我们放任他们死去
<24-9,Sebastian>People die of TB because we let 'em.

757
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,960
<24-9,Sebastian>是我们的选择
<24-9,Sebastian>It's our choice.

758
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,820
<24-10,House>人们死于疟疾，因为我们放任
<24-10,House>People die of malaria because we let them.

759
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,440
<24-10,House>他们死于痢疾，他们……
<24-10,House>They die of dysentery,they--

760
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,310
<24-11,Sebastian>不，TB是我的病
<24-11,Sebastian>No, TB's my disease.

761
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,580
<24-12,House>你拥有一个病?
<24-12,House>You own a disease?

762
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,930
<24-12,House>很抱歉，我错数了登革热高烧
<24-12,House>Well,I'm sorry,I missed the IPO on Dengue Fever.

763
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,130
<24-13,Sebastian>你看，我知道我自成一派
<24-13,Sebastian>Look,I know I have a way about me.

764
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,150
<24-13,Sebastian>我知道我让很多人不爽
<24-13,Sebastian>I know I piss a lot of people off

765
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,520
<24-13,Sebastian>并使更多人很苦恼
<24-13,Sebastian>And a whole lot more I just annoy.

766
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,470
<24-13,Sebastian>但你是第一个给我遇上的……
<24-13,Sebastian>But you're the first person that I've ever met

767
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,280
<24-13,Sebastian>被我干的事困扰的人
<24-13,Sebastian>who I think is actually annoyed by what I do.

768
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,930
<24-13,Sebastian>你觉得我没有救人命吗？
<24-13,Sebastian>Do you think I'm not saving any lives or--

769
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,420
<24-13,Sebastian>或者那样做不好?
<24-13,Sebastian>Or is that a bad thing?

770
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,020
<24-14,House>现在，我只是要救你的命
<24-14,House>Right now,I'm just trying to save your life.

771
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,930
<24-15,Sebastian>或者是你对抱希望有问题?
<24-15,Sebastian>Or do you just have a problem with hope?

772
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,720
<24-15,Sebastian>你知道，我们工作的差别……
<24-15,Sebastian>You know,the difference between our jobs--

773
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,800
<24-15,Sebastian>不在于数字和风格……
<24-15,Sebastian>It's not numbers,or styles

774
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,020
<24-15,Sebastian>在于我知道我会失败
<24-15,Sebastian>It's that I know I'm gonna fail.

775
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,170
<24-15,Sebastian>就算我救了百万人,还会再有百万人染病
<24-15,Sebastian>Even if I save a million people,,there's gonna be another million

776
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,830
<24-15,Sebastian>你是对付不了那个
<24-15,Sebastian>You couldn't handle that.

777
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,500
<24-15,Sebastian>我觉得你怨恨任何能对付这状况的人
<24-15,Sebastian>I think you resent anyone who can.

778
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,520
<24-16,House>我们是否可以就,你难以置信的讨厌达成一致?
<24-16,House>Can't we just agree that you're ,incredibly annoying?

779
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,930
<24-16,House>吃药吧
<24-16,House>Take the pills.

780
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,030
<24-16,House>要不我任由你死，做解剖,然后召开我自己的记者会
<24-16,House>Or I let you die,do an autopsy,,call my own press conference

781
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,090
<24-16,House>确保让全世界知道你不是死于TB
<24-16,House>And make sure the world knows ,that you didn't die of TB.

782
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,840
<24-16,House>赞助商会很失望的
<24-16,House>Corporate sponsors will be disappointed.

783
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,640
<24-16,House>但他们会发现其他疾病
<24-16,House>But they'll find another disease.

784
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,420
<24-17,Sebastian>你干嘛那样做?
<24-17,Sebastian>Why would you do that?

785
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,150
<24-18,House>因为我是个刻薄鬼
<24-18,House>Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch.

786
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,330
<25-1,House>那么我们仍需解释P-R可变性
<25-1,House>So we still have to explain P-R variability,

787
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,480
<25-1,House>昏厥、头疼
<25-1,House>syncope,headaches--

788
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,250
<25-1,House>还有……低糖
<25-1,House>And...low sugar?

789
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,770
<25-2,Foreman>典型的TB
<25-2,Foreman>That was classic TB.

790
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,050
<25-3,Chase>显然不是
<25-3,Chase>Apparently not.

791
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,340
<25-4,Cameron>-又做过试验了吗? ,-是
<25-4,Cameron>-You rerun the test? ,-Yeah.

792
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,580
<25-6,House>好
<25-6,House>This is good.

793
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,370
<25-7,Foreman>好？简直是诡异
<25-7,Foreman>Good? This is bizarre.

794
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,160
<25-8,House>诡异好啊
<25-8,House>Bizarre is good.

795
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,150
<25-8,House>平庸有千种解释
<25-8,House>Common has hundreds of explanations.

796
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,700
<25-8,House>诡异却几乎没有解释
<25-8,House>Bizarre has hardly any.

797
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,740
<25-9,Cameron>还有什么可以导致脑脊髓液低糖？
<25-9,Cameron>What else could cause low CSF sugar?

798
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,610
<25-10,House>嗯，问题该由我来问
<25-10,House>Uh-uh. I get to ask the questions.

799
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,960
<25-10,House>我觉得你问问题时
<25-10,House>I've found you look a lot smarter

800
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,180
<25-10,House>比傻瓜般不回答看上去聪明多了
<25-10,House>asking questions than dumbly not answering.

801
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,760
<25-11,Chase>血液中胰岛素含量高
<25-11,Chase>High insulin levels in his blood

802
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,020
<25-12,Cameron>该很高
<25-12,Cameron>They'd have to be very high.

803
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,620
<27-21,House>好
<27-21,House>Okay

804
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,570
<25-13,Chase>血液胰岛素含量高
<25-13,Chase>Very high insulin levels in his blood

805
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,570
<25-14,Cameron>他怎么会胰岛素含量高呢?
<25-14,Cameron>How could he get high insulin levels?

806
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,510
<25-14,Cameron>我们查了普通血糖，正常
<25-14,Cameron>We've checked daily blood sugars,all normal.

807
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,300
<25-15,House>看她多聪明，因为她问问题
<25-15,House>See how smart she looks? ,Cause she asked the question.

808
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,240
<25-16,Cameron>不是葡萄糖菌，因为他没有皮疹
<25-16,Cameron>And it's not Glucagonoma because he has no rash.

809
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,670
<25-16,Cameron>不是自行导致的，因为他不是傻瓜
<25-16,Cameron>It's not self-induced because he's not an idiot

810
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,930
<25-16,Cameron>更不是瘤，因为CT和核磁共振都是阴性
<25-16,Cameron>And it's not a tumor because the CT ,and the MRI were both negative

811
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,500
<25-17,House>只剩下瘤了
<25-17,House>Which just leaves tumor.

812
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,390
<25-18,Cameron>你干嘛这样做?干嘛忽视我说的话？
<25-18,Cameron>Why do you do this? Why do you ignore what I say?

813
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,070
<25-18,Cameron>我甚至……小瘤子
<25-18,Cameron>Like I'm not even-- Small tumor.

814
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,440
<25-19,House>很小，很小
<25-19,House>Really,really tiny.

815
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,170
<25-19,House>太小了，看不见
<25-19,House>So small we can't see it.

816
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,730
<25-19,House>胰岛素腺体瘤
<25-19,House>Nesidioblastoma.

817
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,990
<25-20,Chase>由胰岛素细胞组成的蜂窝状瘤
<25-20,Chase>An abnormal growth of the insulin-secreting ,cells in his pamcreas

818
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,810
<25-21,Foreman>间歇分泌胰岛素
<25-21,Foreman>That only intermittently secretes insulin

819
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,240
<25-22,House>从而导致压力
<25-22,House>In response to stress

820
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,950
<25-22,House>就象……我不知道
<25-22,House>Like if... Oh,I don't know.

821

952
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,460
<29-1,Sebastian>并不因为每8秒钟死个孩子
<29-1,Sebastian>It's not about the kids dying every eight seconds.

953
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,480
<29-1,Sebastian>是因为媒体猛击,
<29-1,Sebastian>It's about the media stroking,

<30-5,House>也就是说我得到了,由他挽救的所有生命的信任
<30-5,House>That means I get credit for every life ,he saves from here on out

960
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,110
