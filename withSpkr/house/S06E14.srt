00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,910
<1-1,Lucas>早上好
<1-1,Lucas>Hey.

28
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,790
<1-1,Lucas>慢点  小美人
<1-1,Lucas>Slow down, sister.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,560
<1-2,Cuddy>事实上  我得快点
<1-2,Cuddy>Actually, I need to speed up.

30
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,860
<1-2,Cuddy>瑞秋一大早起来就发烧
<1-2,Cuddy>Rachel woke up early with a fever

31
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,920
<1-2,Cuddy>已经让我担惊受怕了一早上
<1-2,Cuddy>And she's been terrorizing me all morning.

32
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,830
<1-2,Cuddy>我已经迟到了
<1-2,Cuddy>I'm already late.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,710
<1-3,Lucas>对不起  监视工作比我想象的要长
<1-3,Lucas>Sorry, stakeout went longer than I thought.

34
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,310
<1-3,Lucas>你怪我吗
<1-3,Lucas>Have you ever been to a rave?

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,560
<1-4,Cuddy>再见
<1-4,Cuddy>Good-bye.

36
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,930
<1-5,Lucas>你已经迟到了  瑞秋也病了
<1-5,Lucas>You're already late and Rachel's sick.

37
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,250
<1-5,Lucas>即使现在走  也无济于事
<1-5,Lucas>Neither of which can be solved by you leaving

38
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,720
<1-6,Cuddy>享受当下吧 整个医院都等我完成悬而未决的议案呢
<1-6,Cuddy>Right this second. The entire hospital is depending on a proposal I've yet to finish

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,010
<1-6,Cuddy>必须8点30前提出来
<1-6,Cuddy>And need to present at 8:30.

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
<1-7,Lucas>现在才七点半
<1-7,Lucas>It`s 7:30.

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,440
<1-8,Cuddy>已经7点37了
<1-8,Cuddy>It`s 7:37.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,040
<1-9,Lucas>我让你10分钟就到医院
<1-9,Lucas>I'll have you on the road in ten minutes.

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,600
<1-9,Lucas>你不想总因为开会紧张兮兮的吧
<1-9,Lucas>Come on, you don't want to go into your meeting all tight

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,670
<1-9,Lucas>压得你喘不过气来  不是吗
<1-9,Lucas>And stressed out, do you?

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,630
<1-10,Lucas>-你电话响了  -是豪斯  别理他
<1-10,Lucas>- That's yours. - It's house. Ignore it.

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,410
<1-12,Lucas>上面写着"紧急事件"
<1-12,Lucas>It says "Emergency page."

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,600
<1-13,Cuddy>我说别理他
<1-13,Cuddy>I said ignore it.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,680
<1-14,Lucas>亲爱的
<1-14,Lucas>Sweet.

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,470
<1-14,Lucas>对不起
<1-14,Lucas>I'm sorry.

55
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,600
<2-1,Lucas>总想着要时间长点
<2-1,Lucas>It's hard to pace yourself

56
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,380
<2-1,Lucas>反而立马缴械投降了
<2-1,Lucas>When you've been thinking about it for ten hours straight.

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,890
<2-2,Cuddy>太棒了  现在我既迟到了
<2-2,Cuddy>That's great. Now I'm late,

58
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,440
<2-2,Cuddy>又紧张  而且受打击
<2-2,Cuddy>Stressed out, and frustrated.

59
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,040
<2-2,Cuddy>对不起
<2-2,Cuddy>Sorry.

60
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,600
<2-3,Lucas>如果再给我一分钟  我会...
<2-3,Lucas>If you give me a minute, I can...

61
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,810
<2-4,Cuddy>下次吧
<2-4,Cuddy>It'll wait.

62
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,380
<2-4,Cuddy>你行的
<2-4,Cuddy>You can do it.

63
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,080
<2-5,Lucas>行什么
<2-5,Lucas>Do what?

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,500
<3-1,Nurse Regina>我以为你7点30就能来呢
<3-1,Nurse Regina>I thought you were coming in at 7:30.

68
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,800
<3-1,Nurse Regina>瑞秋早上起来发烧了
<3-1,Nurse Regina>Rachel woke up with a fever

69
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,220
<3-2,Cuddy>所以我  就来的晚了
<3-2,Cuddy>And then I...just couldn't get here any sooner.

70
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,040
<3-3,Nurse Regina>药房里有点麻烦
<3-3,Nurse Regina>There's a problem in the pharmacy.

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,580
<3-4,House>你好  老大
<3-4,House>Hey, boss lady!

72
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,250
<3-4,House>你连紧急呼叫都不回么
<3-4,House>You don't answer emergency pages anymore?

73
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,060
<3-5,Cuddy>跟他们说我会尽快到场
<3-5,Cuddy>Tell them all I'll be by as soon as I can

74
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,350
<3-5,Cuddy>跟他说我肯定这次不是狼来了
<3-5,Cuddy>And tell him I assumed it was either about the wolf again

75
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,350
<3-5,Cuddy>也不少昨天那个手续我不批
<3-5,Cuddy>Or the procedure I refused to approve yesterday.

76
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,220
<3-6,House>结果却不是抗药性金黄色葡萄球菌感染
<3-6,House>Turned out it wasn't a resistant staph,

77
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,180
<3-6,House>但我还是说  如果是的话
<3-6,House>But I still say that if it had been,

78
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,560
<3-6,House>应该给他感染疟疾病毒
<3-6,House>Infecting him with malaria...

79
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,530
<3-7,Cuddy>说真的  豪斯  我没时间理这个
<3-7,Cuddy>Seriously, house, I don't have time for this.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,830
<3-9,Cuddy>-你撒谎  -还有20分钟开会
<3-9,Cuddy>- You're lying. - I have a meeting in 20 minutes.

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,960
<3-10,House>说的不是你的会议
<3-10,House>Not talking about your meeting.

82
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,520
<3-10,House>我说的是电话
<3-10,House>I'm talking about the phone call.

83
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,710
<3-11,Cuddy>我没问你说的是什么
<3-11,Cuddy>I didn't ask what you were talking about,

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,510
<3-11,Cuddy>因为我不在乎
<3-11,Cuddy>Because I don't care.

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,200
<3-12,House>我昨晚和你宝贝儿一起监视了
<3-12,House>I was with your boy toy on a stakeout last night.

86
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,240
<3-13,Cuddy>你昨晚和卢卡斯在一起吗
<3-13,Cuddy>You were with lucas?

87
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,260
<3-14,House>他需要有人
<3-14,House>He needed someone who could diagnose

88
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,520
<3-14,House>给他诊断一下软组织损伤
<3-14,House>A soft tissue injury from across the street.

89
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,660
<3-14,House>显然他不认识什么好医生
<3-14,House>Apparently he doesn't know any good doctors.

90
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,170
<3-15,Cuddy>或者他认识的那个 工作之余根本没空
<3-15,Cuddy>Or the ones he does know actually have lives outside of work.

91
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,930
<3-16,House>监视工作不太忙
<3-16,House>Things got a little slow,

92
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,630
<3-16,House>所以我们打了个赌
<3-16,House>So we made some wagers.

93
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,610
<3-16,House>打赌我能不能
<3-16,House>One being whether I could get you to stop

94
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,830
<3-16,House>用紧急呼叫打断你们的好事儿
<3-16,House>The miscegenation with an emergency page.

95
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,560
<3-17,Cuddy>你怎么觉得我们会...
<3-17,Cuddy>What made you think we'd...

96
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,820
<3-18,House>他说你们每早都做
<3-18,House>He said you guys do it every morning.

97
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,930
<3-19,Cuddy>每个人都在撒谎  记得吗
<3-19,Cuddy>Everybody lies. Remember?

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,370
<3-20,House>所以你们其实没有...
<3-20,House>So you weren't actually...

99
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,170
<3-21,Cuddy>再见  豪斯
<3-21,Cuddy>Good-bye, House.

100
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,530
<3-22,House>我得在给钱以前得到个确定答案
<3-22,House>I'm gonna need a definitive answer before any money changes hands.

<3-23,Nurse Regina>抱歉打扰了
<3-23,Nurse Regina>Sorry to interrupt,

<3-24,Cuddy>Figured this would be the one day he comes early.

<3-24,Cuddy>您能帮我校对一下这个吗
<3-24,Cuddy>Can you proofread this for me?

<3-25,Nurse Regina>When are you gonna find your own assistant?

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,860
<8-19,Cuddy>我不关心怎么有意思
<8-19,Cuddy>I don't care how interesting it is.

266
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,610
<8-19,Cuddy>你不许用疟疾感染他
<8-19,Cuddy>You are not infecting him with malaria.

267
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,720
<8-20,Taub>什么时候疟疾能治疗心力衰竭了
<8-20,Taub>Since when is malaria a cure for heart failure?

268
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,680
<8-21,House>不能
<8-21,House>It's not.

269
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,920
<8-21,House>不是充血性心力衰竭
<8-21,House>It's not congestive heart failure.

270
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,700
<8-21,House>应该是
<8-21,House>It's gotta be...

271
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,280
<8-21,House>刚接到胡让尼的电话
<8-21,House>Just got off the phone with Hourani.

272
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,150
<9-1,Cuddy>对不起  戴夫  我现在真没空
<9-1,Cuddy>I'm sorry, Dave. I don't really have time right now--

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,390
<9-1,Cuddy>你以为我有时间听他抱怨20分钟
<9-1,Cuddy>Think I had time to listen to him go for 20 minutes

274
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,040
<9-2,Cuddy>就说手术室里的温度这点事吗
<9-2,Cuddy>About the damn temperature in the O.R.?

275
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,020
<9-2,Cuddy>我处理好了
<9-2,Cuddy>I took care of it.

276
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,860
<8-21,House>不是它
<8-21,House>It's not an "it."

277
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,830
<8-21,House>你该处理的应该是他
<8-21,House>It's a "Him" You need to take care of.

278
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,110
<8-21,House>你要所有员工都奉迎豪斯所有的诡异想法  而我甚至
<8-21,House>You got the entire staff catering to house's every whim, and I can't get approval

279
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,160
<8-21,House>不能雇佣一个外科医生来填补
<8-21,House>To hire a replacement for the surgeon

280
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,640
<8-21,House>他从我的部门偷走那人的空缺
<8-21,House>He stole from my department?

281
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,530
<9-1,Cuddy>他是我的首席医生
<9-1,Cuddy>A doctor I only took on in the first place

282
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,670
<9-2,Cuddy>仅仅是由于你的压力
<9-2,Cuddy>Because of pressure from you.

283
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,010
<9-3,Cuddy>就是说你当初不想要奇斯
<9-3,Cuddy>So you didn't want Chase,

284
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,630
<9-3,Cuddy>但是现在因为没了他而生气
<9-3,Cuddy>But now you're pissed you can't have him?

285
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,170
<9-3,Cuddy>你想召开委员会
<9-3,Cuddy>You want to convene a search committee

286
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,740
<9-4,Cuddy>重新找一位外科主任吗
<9-4,Cuddy>And start looking for a new chief of surgery?

287
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,730
<9-4,Cuddy>不  戴夫
<9-4,Cuddy>No, Dave.

288
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,640
<9-4,Cuddy>那就别总忙着替他收拾残局
<9-4,Cuddy>Then you better stop spending all your time

289
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,820
<9-4,Cuddy>先做好你的工作吧
<9-4,Cuddy>Putting out his fires and start doing your damn job.

290
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,620
<9-5,Cuddy>托马斯医生那里有问题吗
<9-5,Cuddy>There a problem with Dr. Thomas?

291
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,090
<9-5,Cuddy>不  只是一个手术室的小问题
<9-5,Cuddy>No, just refereeing a dispute about the O.R.

292
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,060
<9-5,Cuddy>现在我们还没有和大西洋保险签合同
<9-5,Cuddy>So we don't yet have a contract with Atlanticnet.

293
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
<9-6,Sanford>我们已经多给了你一周时间
<9-6,Sanford>We gave you an extra week

294
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,940
<9-6,Sanford>你确定今天会有答复的
<9-6,Sanford>And you assured us you'd have a deal by today.

295
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,590
<9-7,Cuddy>我们可以成交  但与我们期望绝不相符
<9-7,Cuddy>We could have a deal, just not the deal we deserve.

296
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,510
<9-8,Female Board Member>你想要什么  继续延期吗
<9-8,Female Board Member>So what do you want, approval for an extension?

297
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,020
<9-8,Female Board Member>我们已经讨论这个8个月了
<9-8,Female Board Member>We've been at this for eight months.

298
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,760
<9-9,Cuddy>继续延期不会改变什么
<9-9,Cuddy>An extension isn't gonna change anything.

299
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,300
<9-10,Sanford>你的计划是什么
<9-10,Sanford>So what's your plan?

300
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,790
<9-11,Cuddy>我提出了最终报价
<9-11,Cuddy>I presented a final offer.

301
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,560
<9-11,Cuddy>我说我们愿意按照人数计费
<9-11,Cuddy>I told them that we would agree to a capitated structure

302
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,850
<9-11,Cuddy>只要他们把赔偿提高12%
<9-11,Cuddy>If they increase reimbursements by 12%.

303
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,250
<9-12,Female Board Member>最终报价  什么意思
<9-12,Female Board Member>A final offer? What does that mean?

304
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,430
<9-13,Cuddy>如果下午三点之前他们不接受
<9-13,Cuddy>If they don't accept it by 3:00,

305
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,780
<9-13,Cuddy>我们就终止合作
<9-13,Cuddy>We're gonna terminate.

306
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,220
<9-13,Cuddy>你疯了吗
<9-13,Cuddy>Are you out of your mind?

307
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,990
<9-14,Cuddy>如果我们不跟大西洋保险合作
<9-14,Cuddy>If we don't accept atlanticnet insurance,

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
<9-14,Cuddy>就会丢掉80%的病人
<9-14,Cuddy>We'll lose 80% of our patients.

309
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,680
<9-14,Cuddy>能继续开业三个月就是幸运了
<9-14,Cuddy>We'd be lucky to last three months.

310
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,620
<9-14,Cuddy>我们没要求他们能力之外的
<9-14,Cuddy>We're not asking for anything they can't afford.

311
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,220
<9-15,Sanford>他们的最终报价是提高4%
<9-15,Sanford>Their last offer was a 4% increase

312
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
<9-15,Sanford>你要求的是12%
<9-15,Sanford>And you're demanding 12.

313
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,190
<9-16,Cuddy>有些地方他们赔得更多
<9-16,Cuddy>They're paying even more at some places.

314
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,290
<9-16,Cuddy>有些是入住率还不如我们这里的医院
<9-16,Cuddy>Units that have lower ratings than ours.

315
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,170
<9-17,Sanford>在理论世界中  那说辞还有效
<9-17,Sanford>In a perfect world, that would definitely matter.

316
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,120
<9-18,Cuddy>桑福德  他们只关心利润增长率
<9-18,Cuddy>Sanford, they're all about growth.

317
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,640
<9-18,Cuddy>他们也知道如果市场宣传说自己是最大的
<9-18,Cuddy>And they know they don't get new customers

318
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,440
<9-18,Cuddy>他们就没有新的客户而言了
<9-18,Cuddy>By marketing themselves as the biggest.

319
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,530
<9-18,Cuddy>因此他们一直宣传自己是最好的
<9-18,Cuddy>They do it by claiming they're the best,

320
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,920
<9-18,Cuddy>如果他们的病人不再来我们这里就医他们就不能再这样宣传自己了
<9-18,Cuddy>And they can't do that if their patients can't come to us.

321
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,820
<9-19,Sanford>你跟摩根谈的时候他有什么反应
<9-19,Sanford>What was Morgan's reaction when you told him?

322
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,110
<9-20,Cuddy>他没有同意  但他会的
<9-20,Cuddy>He didn't give in, but he will.

323
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,930
<9-20,Cuddy>我告诉他3点以前给我答复
<9-20,Cuddy>I told him I'd make the announcement at 3:00.

324
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,980
<9-20,Cuddy>他会在3点前给我回电话的
<9-20,Cuddy>He'll call back before then.

325
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,870
<9-20,Cuddy>他们需要我们
<9-20,Cuddy>They need us.

326
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
<9-20,Cuddy>不  是我们需要他们
<9-20,Cuddy>No, we need them.

327
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,740
<9-21,Sanford>我们相互共生
<9-21,Sanford>We need each other.

328
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,570
<9-21,Sanford>谈判是你的责任
<9-21,Sanford>The negotiation is your responsibility,

329
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,920
<9-21,Sanford>所以我们没法阻拦你的想法
<9-21,Sanford>So we can't stop you if this is what you want to do.

330
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,930
<9-21,Sanford>但我们都清楚
<9-21,Sanford>But just so we're clear,

331
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,700
<9-21,Sanford>如果我们不跟大西洋保险合作的话
<9-21,Sanford>If we don't have a contract with atlanticnet,

332
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,850
<9-21,Sanford>你也许不会在雇佣我们了
<9-21,Sanford>You're not gonna have a contract with us.

333
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,420
<10-1,Nurse Regina>猜猜是谁没来门诊值班
<10-1,Nurse Regina>Guess who didn't show up for clinic duty?

334
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,980
<10-2,Cuddy>别告诉我
<10-2,Cuddy>Oh, don't tell me.

335
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,480
<10-2,Cuddy>满身长疮的病人需要肝脏移植
<10-2,Cuddy>The guy with all the boils needs a liver transplant.

336
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,240
<10-3,Nurse Regina>不  是他的医生需要休息了
<10-3,Nurse Regina>No, his doctor needs a nap.

337
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,300
<10-3,Nurse Regina>需要我把他找出来吗
<10-3,Nurse Regina>You want me to try to find him?

338
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,000
<10-4,Cuddy>-你真的需要他吗  -我需要个医生
<10-4,Cuddy>- You really need him? - I need someone.

339
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,450
<11-1,Clinic Patient>我得了癌症
<11-1,Clinic Patient>I have cancer.

340
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,890
<11-2,Cuddy>你为什么觉得自己得了癌症
<11-2,Cuddy>Why do you think you have cancer?

341
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,400
<11-3,Clinic Patient>不是我觉得
<11-3,Clinic Patient>I don't think I have cancer.

342
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,830
<11-1,Clinic Patient>而是知道我的确得了癌症
<11-1,Clinic Patient>I know I have cancer.

343
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,470
<11-3,Clinic Patient>六个月前  我做手术摘掉
<11-3,Clinic Patient>I had surgery to remove a malignant polyp

344
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,900
<11-3,Clinic Patient>结肠中的恶性肿瘤
<11-3,Clinic Patient>In my colon six months ago,

345
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,080
<11-3,Clinic Patient>现在它已经转移到我的肺部和淋巴了
<11-3,Clinic Patient>And now it's spread to my liver and lymph nodes.

346
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,350
<11-4,Cuddy>就是说你已经被肿瘤科专家确诊了
<11-4,Cuddy>So you're under the care of an oncologist?

347
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,770
<11-5,Clinic Patient>是的 但是他们不给我需要的处方
<11-5,Clinic Patient>Yeah, but he won't give me the prescription I need.

348
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,860
<11-6,Cuddy>你还需要多开点止痛药吗
<11-6,Cuddy>Do you need more painkillers?

349
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,630
<11-7,Clinic Patient>不  我需要母乳
<11-7,Clinic Patient>No. I need breast milk.

350
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,760
<11-8,Cuddy>-人的母乳吗  -是的
<11-8,Cuddy>- Human breast milk? - Yes.

351
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,020
<11-9,Clinic Patient>那里有抗癌成分
<11-9,Clinic Patient>It has cancer-fighting qualities.

352
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,510
<11-10,Cuddy>对于新生儿来说母乳喂养可以降低以后的患癌风险
<11-10,Cuddy>Well, in newborns, it's been shown to reduce future risk.

353
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,520
<11-11,Clinic Patient>不  对患了癌症的成人也一样
<11-11,Clinic Patient>No, in adults with cancer too.

354
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,190
<11-11,Clinic Patient>我读过相关著作
<11-11,Clinic Patient>I've read studies.

355
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,450
<11-11,Clinic Patient>你看...
<11-11,Clinic Patient>Look...

356
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,960
<11-12,Clinic Patient>我甚至知道哪里可以买到人乳
<11-12,Clinic Patient>I even know a place where I can buy it.

357
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,570
<11-12,Clinic Patient>我只是需要医生开个处方我就可以去买了然后得到保险公司的赔偿
<11-12,Clinic Patient>I just need a prescription so I can get reimbursed by my insurance company.

358
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,990
<11-13,Cuddy>他们承诺可以赔偿母乳 作为癌症治疗的费用吗
<11-13,Cuddy>They said they'd reimburse the cost of breast milk as a cancer treatment?

359
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,490
<11-14,Clinic Patient>他们会赔偿处方药的费用
<11-14,Clinic Patient>They reimburse prescriptions,

360
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,980
<11-14,Clinic Patient>所以如果你能给我开个处方
<11-14,Clinic Patient>So if you write me a prescription,

361
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,360
<11-14,Clinic Patient>他们就没别的选择必须给我支付了
<11-14,Clinic Patient>Then they have no choice but to pay.

362
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,410
<11-15,Cuddy>事实上  他们有其他选择
<11-15,Cuddy>Well, actually, they have a choice.

363
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,220
<11-16,Clinic Patient>你是干什么的  保险公司的业务员吗
<11-16,Clinic Patient>What are you, some type of shill for the insurance company?

364
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,040
<11-17,Cuddy>不是
<11-17,Cuddy>No.

365
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,130
<11-18,Clinic Patient>我已经付保险费30年了
<11-18,Clinic Patient>Look, I've been paying premiums for 30 years,

366
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,790
<11-18,Clinic Patient>我的有生之年却一天都没病过 直到现在得了癌症
<11-18,Clinic Patient>And I've never been sick a day in my life till this happened.

367
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,920
<11-18,Clinic Patient>现在我没法工作
<11-18,Clinic Patient>Now I can't work.

368
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,840
<11-18,Clinic Patient>我没有经济来源
<11-18,Clinic Patient>I got no money.

369
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,360
<11-18,Clinic Patient>现在你却帮他们欺骗我吗
<11-18,Clinic Patient>And you want to help them screw me over?

370
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
<11-20,Clinic Patient>-我没有欺骗你  -那就给我开处方吧
<11-20,Clinic Patient>- I'm not screwing you over. - Well, then give me the script.

371
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,110
<11-21,Cuddy>那帮不了你的
<11-21,Cuddy>It won't help you.

372
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,320
<11-22,Clinic Patient>-会伤害到我吗  -不会 但是...
<11-22,Clinic Patient>- Will it hurt me? - No, but--

373
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,550
<11-24,Clinic Patient>好吧  就是说伤害不到你我
<11-24,Clinic Patient>Okay, so it won't harm me and it won't harm you,

374
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,250
<11-24,Clinic Patient>顶多伤害到保险公司而已
<11-24,Clinic Patient>But it's this insurance company--

375
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,310
<11-25,Cuddy>这跟保险没有关系

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,500
<12-16,Westbrook>他对普林斯顿普雷斯波罗医院提起诉讼
<12-16,Westbrook>He's filed a suit against pph

405
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,780
<12-16,Westbrook>罗伯特·奇斯医生没经过同意就做了手术
<12-16,Westbrook>And dr. Robert Chase for performing surgery without consent.

406
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,210
<12-17,Cuddy>我明白了
<12-17,Cuddy>Yes, I saw that.

407
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,700
<12-17,Cuddy>我也看见手术同意书了
<12-17,Cuddy>I also saw the consent forms.

408
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,410
<12-17,Cuddy>他们都签字了
<12-17,Cuddy>They were all signed.

409
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,340
<12-18,Westbrook>是的  但他却向我的委托人保证
<12-18,Westbrook>Yes, but my client was assured

410
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,780
<12-18,Westbrook>整个手术过程就仅仅是做几处小小的缝合
<12-18,Westbrook>That the procedure would just be a few minor sutures.

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,660
<12-18,Westbrook>等等
<12-18,Westbrook>Wait.

412
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,660
<12-19,Cuddy>你的委托人意外地用锯子切断了拇指 对吧
<12-19,Cuddy>Your client accidentally cut his thumb off with a table saw, right？

413
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,680
<12-21,Cuddy>是的  奇斯医生把它接上了
<12-21,Cuddy>Yes. And Dr. Chase reattached it?

414
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,830
<12-20,Westbrook>对
<12-20,Westbrook>Yes.

415
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,300
<12-23,Cuddy>你是说他不想拇指接上吗
<12-23,Cuddy>You're saying he didn't want it reattached?

416
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,690
<12-24,Westbrook>对  他的确不想
<12-24,Westbrook>No, he most certainly did not.

417
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,560
<13-1,Chase>他只得到了保险公司60%住院费用赔偿
<13-1,Chase>His insurance only covered 60% of inpatient expenses,

418
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,490
<13-1,Chase>所以他只同意最便宜的治疗方案
<13-1,Chase>So he would only agree to the cheapest option.

419
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,380
<13-2,Cuddy>那你怎么跟他说的
<13-2,Cuddy>So what did you tell him?

420
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,980
<13-3,Chase>我说把露出骨头部分的皮肤缝合
<13-3,Chase>I said I'd sew up the skin over the exposed bone.

421
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,810
<13-3,Chase>然后我让他躺下 在护理人员那拿来他的拇指然后接上了
<13-3,Chase>Then I put him under, got his thumb from the paramedics, and reattached it.

422
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,380
<13-3,Chase>他想干什么  告诉法官
<13-3,Chase>What's he gonna do?

423
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,470
<13-3,Chase>我把他重要的指头接上而伤害到他了吗
<13-3,Chase>Tell the judge that I harmed him by reattaching a vital digit?

424
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,540
<13-4,Cuddy>他和他的保险公司都起诉了 都不想付手术费用
<13-4,Cuddy>Both he and the insurance company are suing to get out of paying the bill.

425
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,130
<13-4,Cuddy>超过8万美金
<13-4,Cuddy>It's over $80,000.

426
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,330
<13-5,Chase>那是他的拇指
<13-5,Chase>It was his thumb.

427
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,650
<13-5,Chase>我不能就为了剩几个小钱让他把它扔到垃圾堆里
<13-5,Chase>I couldn't just let him toss it in the trash to save a few bucks.

428
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,030
<13-5,Chase>生病的药剂师来了
<13-5,Chase>The pharm tech who called in sick is here.

429
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,160
<14-1,Nurse Regina>她在你的办公室里
<14-1,Nurse Regina>She's waiting in your office.

430
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,680
<14-1,Nurse Regina>他看都不看我一眼
<14-1,Nurse Regina>He barely even looks at me anymore.

431
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,270
<14-1,Nurse Regina>我们已经几个月没有做爱了
<14-1,Nurse Regina>We haven't had sex in months.

432
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,360
<15-1,Gail>你不需要靠吃药减肥
<15-1,Gail>You don't need pills to lose weight.

00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,050
<15-3,Gail>你不知道那有多难
<15-3,Gail>You don't understand how hard it is.

435
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,210
<15-3,Gail>自从我生了第二个孩子  不管我怎么做
<15-3,Gail>Ever since our second child, no matter what I do.

436
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,980
<15-3,Gail>我只是想减掉10磅甚至更多
<15-3,Gail>I just wanted to lose ten more pounds

437
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,460
<15-3,Gail>我坚持不下去了

<16-13,Cuddy>你觉得我应该怎样应对大西洋保险呢
<16-13,Cuddy>What do you think I should do about Atlanticnet?

<16-14,Wilson>他是个操纵人心的大师总是能得到他想要的
<16-14,Wilson>He's a master manipulator who always gets what he wants.

<16-15,Cuddy>现在的局势已经够失控了
<16-15,Cuddy>This situation is out of control enough already.

<16-15,Cuddy>我最不希望的就是豪斯也被卷进来
<16-15,Cuddy>House is the last person I want to get involved.

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,790
<16-19,House>还有心脏衰竭都是由肾细胞癌引起的
<16-19,House>and heart failure was called by renal cell carcinoma.

488
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
<16-19,House>我需要你签字批准让我用疟疾病来治疗它
<16-19,House>I need your signature to start treating it with malaria.

489
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,360
<16-19,House>别担心
<16-19,House>Don't worry.

490
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,370
<16-19,House>我同时给他化疗了
<16-19,House>I'm giving him chemo too.

491
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,120
<16-20,Cuddy>是什么让你突然对疟疾痴心绝对呢
<16-20,Cuddy>What is your sudden obsession with malaria?

492
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,530
<16-21,House>只是想履行我那削减开支的部分
<16-21,House>Just trying to play my part cutting costs.

493
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,120
<16-21,House>疟疾病是消除低体温症状
<16-21,House>Malaria is the simplest, cheapest method

494
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,250
<16-21,House>最简单  最便宜的方法了
<16-21,House>of delivering hypothermia.

495
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,700
<16-21,House>是这样
<16-21,House>Right.

496
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,000
<16-22,Cuddy>你需要唯一需要关心的金钱是
<16-22,Cuddy>The only money you care about...

497
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,140
<16-22,Cuddy>你是不是跟谁打赌了说你能用疟疾作为一种诊断工具
<16-22,Cuddy>You bet someone you could use malaria as a diagnostic tool?

498
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,490
<16-23,House>那可真不像是我做的事情啊
<16-23,House>That doesn't sound like me.

499
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,330
<16-24,Cuddy>当我没说
<16-24,Cuddy>Forget it.

500
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,760
<16-25,House>好吧  跟你直说了  让一个病人
<16-25,House>Okay, let me see if I've got this straight.

501
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,930
<16-25,House>处于微小风险的打赌算得上无理取闹吗
<16-25,House>A bet that puts one patient at minor risk is juvenile?

502
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,450
<16-26,Cuddy>而且是不负责任和危险的
<16-26,Cuddy>And irresponsible and dangerous.

503
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,610
<16-27,House>回到大局  在对抗大西洋保险的战争中
<16-27,House>But going all in against atlanticnet--

504
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,990
<16-28,Cuddy>那可不是在打赌
<16-28,Cuddy>Is not a bet.

505
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,260
<16-28,Cuddy>那是一场精心策划的谈判
<16-28,Cuddy>That is a carefully considered negotiating position.

506
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,720
<16-29,House>我把这个放进你的收信箱里了
<16-29,House>I'm gonna put this in your inbox.

507
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,820
<16-29,House>希望你别弄丢了
<16-29,House>I just hope it doesn't get lost

508
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
<16-29,House>相信经历过所有这些以后你会仔细考虑的
<16-29,House>Underneath all the other stuff you're carefully considering.

509
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,220
<17-1,Cuddy>能帮我看一下这些日程表吗
<17-1,Cuddy>Can you take a look at these per diem schedules?

510
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,480
<17-1,Cuddy>如果有时间冲突通知我
<17-1,Cuddy>Let me know if you see any conflicts.

511
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,140
<17-1,Cuddy>明白
<17-1,Cuddy>Got it.

512

<17-2,Nurse Regina>对了  艾瑞克夫斯基的确来过
<17-2,Nurse Regina>Oh, and Ereshefsky actually did come in.

513
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,240
<17-2,Nurse Regina>你抓到她把海绵落在病人身上了吗
<17-2,Nurse Regina>You catch her leaving a sponge in a guy or something?

514
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,020
<17-3,Cuddy>-并不是医学过失  -那是因为什么
<17-3,Cuddy>- Wasn't a medical mistake. - What was it?

515
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,440
<17-5,Cuddy>现在不能告诉你了  因为她来过
<17-5,Cuddy>Can't tell you now. She came in.

516
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,880
<17-6,Cuddy>嘿  斯坦
<17-6,Cuddy>Hey, Stan!

517
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,920
<17-6,Cuddy>黄麻素的订单你核查了没有
<17-6,Cuddy>Have you audited the ephedrine orders yet?

518
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,830
<17-7,Stan>为什么要查  你告诉我她已经承认了
<17-7,Stan>Why? You told me she confessed.

519
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,170
<17-8,Cuddy>-斯坦  -行了  好吧
<17-8,Cuddy>- Stan. - All right, yeah.

520
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,320
<17-9,Stan>-我会处理的  -今天就查
<17-9,Stan>- I'll take care of it. - Today.

521
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,470
<17-11,Nurse Regina>你知道他现在正对你骂骂咧咧呢
<17-11,Nurse Regina>You know he's cussing you out in there now.

522
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,730
<17-12,Cuddy>只要他能核查  我无所谓
<17-12,Cuddy>I don't care as long as he does it.

523
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,060
<17-14,Cuddy>-真是个贱人  -你来这儿干嘛
<17-14,Cuddy>- What a bitch. - What are you doing here?

524
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,830
<17-15,Lucas>听说你忙得顾不上午餐
<17-15,Lucas>Sounded like you were going to be too busy for lunch,

525
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,740
<17-15,Lucas>所以这是我的拿手菜  菠菜烤宽面
<17-15,Lucas>so my specialty, spinach lasagna.

526
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,130
<17-16,Cuddy>你确定不是来找其他的人
<17-16,Cuddy>Sure you didn't come looking for more people

527
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,880
<17-16,Cuddy>把咱们的性生活吹嘘吗
<17-16,Cuddy>You could brag about our sex life too?

528
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,010
<17-17,Lucas>好吧  抱歉
<17-17,Lucas>Okay. Sorry.

529
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,350
<17-17,Lucas>从现在开始  关于咱们的性生活
<17-17,Lucas>From now on, I got nothing but bad things

530
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,710
<17-17,Lucas>我会只捡不好的方面说
<17-17,Lucas>to say about our sex life.

531
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,080
<17-17,Lucas>或者什么都不说
<17-17,Lucas>Or nothing to say.

532
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,990
<17-18,Cuddy>玛丽娜是怎么回事呢
<17-18,Cuddy>And what's going on with Marina?

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
<17-18,Cuddy>-她不回我电话  -她本来要回电来的
<17-18,Cuddy>- She hasn't called me back. - She was gonna call.

534
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,910
<17-19,Lucas>我告诉她我会告诉你一切都好的
<17-19,Lucas>I told her I'd let you know everything was okay.

535
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,330
<17-20,Cuddy>那么说她的烧退了
<17-20,Cuddy>So her fever broke?

536
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,440
<17-21,Lucas>如果烧退了  那么又意味着什么呢
<17-21,Lucas>What exactly does that mean, "When a fever breaks"?

537
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,600
<17-22,Cuddy>卢卡斯  我非常的忙
<17-22,Cuddy>Lucas, I'm very busy.

538
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,230
<17-22,Cuddy>她到底发烧了还是没发烧
<17-22,Cuddy>Does she have a fever or not?

539
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,590
<17-23,Lucas>这是你的午饭
<17-23,Lucas>That was gonna be your lunch?

540
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,530
<17-23,Lucas>而且你也没吃早饭
<17-23,Lucas>And you didn't have breakfast either.

541
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,210
<17-23,Lucas>不  她不发烧了
<17-23,Lucas>No, she doesn't have a fever,

542
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,780
<17-23,Lucas>而且疹子  看起来就像是小尿疹
<17-23,Lucas>And the rash was just, like, a little diaper rash.

543
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,930
<17-24,Cuddy>什么疹子  她起疹子了吗
<17-24,Cuddy>What rash? She has a rash?

544
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,680
<17-25,Lucas>小疹子
<17-25,Lucas>Little one.

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,160
<17-25,Lucas>丽莎  别担心  我正跟你说呢
<17-25,Lucas>Lisa, don't worry. I'm telling you.

546
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,400
<17-26,Lucas>哦  天啊
<17-26,Lucas>Oh, god.

547
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,590
<17-26,Lucas>我一定是错拿了玛丽娜的手机
<17-26,Lucas>I must have grabbed Marina's cell by mistake.

548
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,230
<17-26,Lucas>而且为了睡个好觉
<17-26,Lucas>And I turned the ringer off on the home phone

549
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,530
<17-26,Lucas>我把家里的电话调静音了
<17-26,Lucas>so I could sleep.

550
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,540
<17-27,Cuddy>你想对我怎么着
<17-27,Cuddy>What are you doing to me?

551
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,130
<17-28,Lucas>我猜你的谈判还没结束呢
<17-28,Lucas>I take it your deal's not done.

552
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:13,940
<17-29,Cuddy>暂时还没有
<17-29,Cuddy>Not yet.

553
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,140
<17-30,Lucas>不如让我去查一查那个负责谈判的家伙的老底怎么样
<17-30,Lucas>How about I take a quick look into the guy who's in charge of the negotiations?

554
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,600
<17-30,Lucas>或者直接查CEO的就更好了
<17-30,Lucas>Or better yet, the CEO.

555
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,370
<17-30,Lucas>如果查到他们的污点  你可以当成把柄
<17-30,Lucas>If I get some dirt, you can use it as leverage.

556
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,980
<17-31,Cuddy>时间不够了
<17-31,Cuddy>There's no time.

557
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,530
<17-31,Cuddy>你是怎么找到那些家伙的呢
<17-31,Cuddy>How do you even find these guys?

560
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,400
<18-2,Tannenbaum>我当时还以为他脸上
<18-2,Tannenbaum>I thought he was gonna have a damn coronary

561
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,700
<18-2,Tannenbaum>长出来一个冠状瘤呢
<18-2,Tannenbaum>right there in the tee box.

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,390
<19-3,Nurse Regina>他说是非常紧急的事
<19-3,Nurse Regina>He said it's urgent.

597
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,890
<20-2,Cuddy>我不明白  这怎么可能
<20-2,Cuddy>I don't understand how it's even possible.

598
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,090
<20-3,Stan>我检查了两次
<20-3,Stan>I've checked it twice.

599
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,490
<20-4,Cuddy>-多少  -10箱
<20-4,Cuddy>- How much?  - Ten cases.

600
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,730
<20-5,Stan>-10箱  -三年前就开始了
<20-5,Stan>- Ten cases? - Going back three years.

601
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,170
<20-6,Cuddy>你到底在干嘛  斯坦
<20-6,Cuddy>What the hell have you been doing, Stan?

602
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,700
<20-6,Cuddy>你应该是来管理这儿呢
<20-6,Cuddy>You're supposed to be managing this place.

603
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,410
<20-7,Stan>我签署的文件都是对的
<20-7,Stan>All the paperwork I signed was correct.

604
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,070
<20-7,Stan>她肯定是之后改了订单
<20-7,Stan>She must have altered the orders afterwards.

605
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,340
<20-8,Cuddy>订单来了后你没再交叉核对过吗
<20-8,Cuddy>Didn't you ever cross-check it with the bills that came in?

606
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,600
<20-9,Stan>我交给别人做了
<20-9,Stan>I delegated it.

607
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,330
<20-10,Cuddy>给谁
<20-10,Cuddy>To whom?

608
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,060
<20-11,Stan>盖尔
<20-11,Stan>To Gail.

609
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
<20-11,Stan>她看上去很可靠
<20-11,Stan>Look, she seemed perfectly trustworthy.

610
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,940
<20-11,Stan>我怎么会知道
<20-11,Stan>How was I supposed to know?

611
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,690
<20-12,Cuddy>-做好你的工作你就知道了  -抱歉
<20-12,Cuddy>- By doing your job. - I'm sorry.

612
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,000
<20-13,Stan>你通知毒品管制所了吗
<20-13,Stan>Have you notified the DEA?

613
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,610
<20-15,Stan>-毒品管理局  -天啊斯坦  拜托
<20-15,Stan>- The DEA? - Jeez, Stan. Hello!

614
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,500
<20-16,Cuddy>才不会有人偷5万英镑的药
<20-16,Cuddy>You don't steal $50,000 worth of pills

615
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,890
<20-16,Cuddy>用来减肥呢
<20-16,Cuddy>because you want to lose weight.

616
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,380
<20-16,Cuddy>她在为制造毒品提供原料
<20-16,Cuddy>She's supplying a meth lab.

617
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,810
<20-16,Cuddy>赶紧把她叫回来
<20-16,Cuddy>Just get her back in here.

618
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,100
<20-17,Stan>好的
<20-17,Stan>All right.

619
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,850
<20-17,Stan>马上
<20-17,Stan>Now.

620
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,440
<21-1,Eli>如果你想找工作  相信我
<21-1,Eli>Oh, you ever want a job, trust me.

621
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,740
<21-1,Eli>他会给你双倍的工资
<21-1,Eli>He'll double whatever you're making here.

622
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,300
<21-2,Cuddy>看来他喜欢我的提议
<21-2,Cuddy>Take it he liked my proposal.

623
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,050
<21-3,Eli>喜欢到要我厚着脸皮又过来一趟
<21-3,Eli>Enough to tell me to get my ass back over here today.

624
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,840
<21-3,Eli>给你
<21-3,Eli>Here.

625
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,350
<21-3,Eli>他愿意增加到8%
<21-3,Eli>He's willing to go to 8%.

626
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,540
<21-5,Eli>-8  -我们之前可是4
<21-5,Eli>- Eight? - We were at four.

627
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,810
<21-5,Eli>董事会肯定会觉得你已经很了不起了
<21-5,Eli>Your board's gonna think you walk on water.

628
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,780
<21-6,Cuddy>我就要12  否则免谈
<21-6,Cuddy>I want 12.

629
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,930
<21-7,Eli>你不可能拿到12的
<21-7,Eli>You're not gonna get 12.

630
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,060
<21-7,Eli>那是痴人说梦
<21-7,Eli>There's just no way.

631
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,190
<21-8,Cuddy>8%才勉强负担了我们的成本膨胀
<21-8,Cuddy>8% barely covers our cost inflation.

632
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,650
<21-9,Eli>但按人数计算可以让你降低成本膨胀
<21-9,Eli>But capitated structure should allow you to hold down inflation.

633
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,670
<21-10,Cuddy>而且把你们的风险都转给了我们
<21-10,Cuddy>And shifts all your risk onto us,

634
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,410
<21-10,Cuddy>所以12是我们应得的
<21-10,Cuddy>which is why we deserve 12.

635
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,970
<24-1,Cuddy>丽莎  得了吧
<24-1,Cuddy>Lisa, come on.

636
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,760
<21-10,Cuddy>给我修草坪的人比我孩子的老师还赚得多
<21-10,Cuddy>The guy who mows my lawn makes more than my kid's teacher.

637
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,310
<21-11,Eli>那两个午饭时间被你打扰的人
<21-11,Eli>Hell, the two guys whose lunch you interrupted

638
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,010
<21-11,Eli>他们可能被开除  解雇费估计
<21-11,Eli>could get fired, and their severance would be more

639
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,290
<21-11,Eli>比他们多数员工一生赚的钱还要多
<21-11,Eli>than most of their employees make in a lifetime.

640
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,800
<21-11,Eli>早就不是一分耕耘一分收获的年代了
<21-11,Eli>It doesn't have anything to do with what you deserve.

641
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,350
<21-11,Eli>就这样了
<21-11,Eli>This is it.

642
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,210
<21-11,Eli>要么照单全收  要么一文不取
<21-11,Eli>Take it or leave it.

643
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,930
<22-1,Cuddy>你在干嘛呢
<22-1,Cuddy>What are you doing?

644
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,720
<22-2,House>你知道什么优秀的移植外科医生吗
<22-2,House>Know any good transplant surgeons?

645
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,170
<22-2,House>原来他除了肾脏  还有其他的器官衰竭
<22-2,House>Turns out his kidneys aren't the only thing failing.

646
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,000
<22-2,House>我知道你在想什么
<22-2,House>And I know what you're thinking.

647
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,500
<22-2,House>疟疾不会那么快就毁了他的肝
<22-2,House>But malaria wouldn't destroy his liver that fast,

648
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,850
<22-2,House>更何况我们根本没用疟疾
<22-2,House>especially since we never infected him.

649
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,000
<22-3,Cuddy>你不是说
<22-3,Cuddy>I thought you said--

650
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,600
<22-4,House>显然  福曼觉得他翅膀够硬了
<22-4,House>Apparently Foreman now thinks that he has

651
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,100
<22-4,House>以食品及药物管理局不批准为由
<22-4,House>the authority to overrule my orders

652
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,970
<22-4,House>违抗我的命令
<22-4,House>Just because the FDA wouldn't approve.

653
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,680
<22-4,House>不用担心  我会搞定他
<22-4,House>Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

654
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,220
<22-4,House>如果你能和胡让尼谈谈
<22-4,House>If you could just talk to Hourani...

655
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,310
<22-5,Cuddy>你会怎么做
<22-5,Cuddy>What would you do?

656
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,710
<22-6,House>如果你在我做爱的时候呼我
<22-6,House>If you paged me during sex?

657
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,050
<22-7,Cuddy>和大西洋保险公司的合同
<22-7,Cuddy>About the contract with Atlanticnet.

658
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,120
<22-7,Cuddy>我让他们提高到8%了
<22-7,Cuddy>I got them to come up to 8%,

659
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,060
<22-7,Cuddy>但我们至少得拿到12%
<22-7,Cuddy>but we should get at least 12.

660
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,760
<22-8,House>全是数字游戏 做做算术题就知道了
<22-8,House>It's all numbers. Do the math and nothing else.

661
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,680
<22-9,Cuddy>这不是我的面子问题
<22-9,Cuddy>It's not about my pride.

662
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,080
<22-9,Cuddy>而是原则问题
<22-9,Cuddy>It's about the principle.

663
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,940
<22-9,Cuddy>他们就是欺负我们规模小
<22-9,Cuddy>They're trying to screw us over because we're small.

664
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,000
<22-10,House>他们不就是干这个的吗
<22-10,House>That's what they're supposed to do.

665
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,850
<22-11,Cuddy>他们该强迫其他医院向我们学习
<22-11,Cuddy>They should be pressuring other hospitals to be more like us,

666
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,580
<22-11,Cuddy>而不是倒着来
<22-11,Cuddy>not trying to make us more like them.

667
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,510
<22-11,Cuddy>太愚蠢了
<22-11,Cuddy>It's stupid.

668
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,050
<22-12,House>拿你的工作冒险去指出他们的愚蠢不是也很蠢吗
<22-12,House>Putting your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?

669
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,890
<22-13,Cuddy>你也会这么做
<22-13,Cuddy>You would.

670
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,140
<22-14,House>有可能
<22-14,House>Probably.

671
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,410
<22-14,House>但我也会为了赢50块
<22-14,House>But then I also wanted to try to cure cancer

672
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,200
<22-14,House>用感染疟疾去治疗癌症
<22-14,House>by infecting a guy with malaria to win a $50 bet.

673
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,730
<22-14,House>你真想向我学习吗
<22-14,House>You really want to be like me?

674
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,560
<23-1,Cuddy>大家都知道  过去八个月以来
<23-1,Cuddy>As you know, for the past eight months,

675
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,450
<23-1,Cuddy>我们都在和大西洋保险公司
<23-1,Cuddy>We've been trying to renegotiate our contract

676
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,760
<23-1,Cuddy>为合同进行谈判
<23-1,Cuddy>with Atlanticnet Insurance.

677
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,160
<23-1,Cuddy>过程很艰难重重
<23-1,Cuddy>It's been a difficult process,

678
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,260
<23-1,Cuddy>但在下午五点 正式通知出来之前
<23-1,Cuddy>but I wanted to let you all know before we made the formal announcement

679
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,490
<23-1,Cuddy>我想先告诉大家
<23-1,Cuddy>that as of 5:00 P.M. Today,

680
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,430
<23-1,Cuddy>我们即将终止与大西洋保险公司的合同
<23-1,Cuddy>our contract with atlanticnet will be terminated.

681
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,890
<23-1,Cuddy>我们已向客户接待处的呼叫中心
<23-1,Cuddy>We've doubled the number of customer service representatives

682
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,360
<23-1,Cuddy>调配了双倍人手
<23-1,Cuddy>in our call center.

683
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,150
<23-1,Cuddy>我们将向现有的病人再提供30天的看护
<23-1,Cuddy>Current patients will still be allowed to remain in our care for 30 days,

684
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,700
<23-1,Cuddy>但从明天开始 我们将不再接受
<23-1,Cuddy>But starting tomorrow, we will no longer be accepting patients

685
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:42,780
<23-1,Cuddy>享受大西洋保险公司服务的病人
<23-1,Cuddy>with atlanticnet health insurance.

686
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,650
<23-1,Cuddy>拜托  玛丽娜
<23-1,Cuddy>Come on, Marina.

687
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,070
<24-1,Cuddy>快接电话
<24-1,Cuddy>Pick up the phone.

688
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,910
<24-2,Cuddy>忙着呢
<24-2,Cuddy>I'm busy.

689
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,080
<24-3,Foreman>-我们找到匹配的肝脏了  -行
<24-3,Foreman>- We found a liver match. - All right.

690
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,500
<24-4,Cuddy>让他做术前准备吧
<24-4,Cuddy>Get him prepped.

691
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,920
<24-4,Cuddy>我会搞定胡让尼的
<24-4,Cuddy>I'll straighten things out with Hourani.

692
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,990
<24-5,Foreman>胡让尼不是问题
<24-5,Foreman>Hourani's not the problem.

693
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,350
<24-5,Foreman>豪斯才是
<24-5,Foreman>House is.

694
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,270
<24-5,Foreman>他想让奇斯做手术
<24-5,Foreman>Now he wants Chase to do the surgery.

695
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,040
<24-6,Cuddy>向胡让尼表明他不需要他吗
<24-6,Cuddy>To prove to Hourani he doesn't need him?

696
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,870
<24-7,Foreman>向托马斯证明奇斯才是 外科最厉害的医生
<24-7,Foreman>To prove to Thomas that Chase was his department's best surgeon.

697
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,390
<24-8,Cuddy>奇斯怎么想
<24-8,Cuddy>And what does Chase want to do?

698
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,500
<24-9,Foreman>他想做这个手术
<24-9,Foreman>Chase wants to do the surgery.

699
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,690
<24-10,Cuddy>你不希望他做  是因为
<24-10,Cuddy>And you don't want him to do it because?

700
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,300
<24-11,Foreman>-我不管谁做  -那问题是
<24-11,Foreman>- I don't care who does it. - So what's the problem?

701
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,900
<24-13,Foreman>为了让病人进手术室
<24-13,Foreman>In order to get our patient into the OR,

702
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,500
<24-13,Foreman>我们得把他放到手术名单上
<24-13,Foreman>we have to get him on the surgery schedule.

703
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,510
<24-13,Foreman>而做这件事情  需要一个
<24-13,Foreman>In order to do that, we need someone to put him there

704
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,580
<24-13,Foreman>豪斯和托马斯都管不了的人
<24-13,Foreman>who neither House nor Thomas can overrule.

705
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,800
<24-14,Cuddy>什么
<24-14,Cuddy>What?

706
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,870
<24-15,House>你难道希望我重新回归维柯丁的怀抱吗
<24-15,House>Would you rather I go back on vicodin?

707
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,410
<24-16,Cuddy>她又不在给你的腿按摩
<24-16,Cuddy>She's not massaging your leg.

708
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,940
<24-17,House>她终究  会的
<24-17,House>She will...eventually.

709
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,210
<24-18,Cuddy>为什么只有我一个人担心这家医院的死活
<24-18,Cuddy>Why am I the only person here who cares what happens to this hospital?

710
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,680
<24-18,Cuddy>勤快点  管好你的部门
<24-18,Cuddy>Get off your ass and get your department under control.

711
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,480
<24-18,Cuddy>至少这几天帮帮忙
<24-18,Cuddy>At least for the next few days.

712
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,640
<24-19,House>让大西洋保险这种大公司
<24-19,House>Gonna take longer than a few days for a company

713
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,060
<24-19,House>向你的公关活动低头
<24-19,House>the size of Atlanticnet to start feeling

714
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,940
<24-19,House>可不是几天的事
<24-19,House>the squeeze of your P.R. Campaign.

715
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,410
<24-19,House>如果他们会低头的话
<24-19,House>If they ever do.

716
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,440
<24-20,Cuddy>你怎么知道的
<24-20,Cuddy>And you know this how?

717
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,850
<24-20,Cuddy>从你一直在研究他们还有他们其他的合同
<24-20,Cuddy>From all the time you've spent researching them and their other contracts?

718
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,390
<24-20,Cuddy>他们处理媒体关系的方式吗
<24-20,Cuddy>The way they handle their press relations?

719
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,840
<24-21,House>我知道他们有个纳斯卡车队
<24-21,House>I know they have a NASCAR team.

720
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,730
<24-21,House>不管你在希伯来学校  或是跟
<24-21,House>Despite what you may have learned at Hebrew school

721
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,050
<24-21,House>吉米·克里夫(牙买加雷鬼歌手) 学了些什么
<24-21,House>or from Jimmy Cliff,

722
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,810
<24-21,House>他们越强大
<24-21,House>Sometimes the bigger they are,

723
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,720
<24-21,House>反击就越厉害
<24-21,House>the harder they kick your ass.

724
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,390
<24-21,House>我不是贪心
<24-21,House>I'm not trying to be greedy.

725
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,510
<25-1,Westbrook>但他也不希望被医疗费用逼得破产
<25-1,Westbrook>But he's also not interested in being forced into a medical bankruptcy.

726
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,400
<25-2,Cuddy>阿塞维多先生  很抱歉你有经济问题
<25-2,Cuddy>Mr. Acevedo, I am sorry you're having financial difficulties.

727
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,650
<25-2,Cuddy>但多亏我们  你保住了大拇指
<25-2,Cuddy>But because of us, you still have a thumb.

728
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,520
<25-2,Cuddy>我以为一个木匠应该需要大拇指吧
<25-2,Cuddy>I assume that's something a carpenter might need.

729
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,560
<25-3,Westbrook>我也以为你见我们
<25-3,Westbrook>And I assume you didn't ask for this meeting

730
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,020
<25-3,Westbrook>不是为了教育我的客户吧
<25-3,Westbrook>so you could lecture my client.

731
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,600
<25-4,Cuddy>你有保险
<25-4,Cuddy>You have insurance.

732
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,530
<25-4,Cuddy>但凭这个诉讼
<25-4,Cuddy>But by filing this suit,

733
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,300
<25-4,Cuddy>他们可能拒绝赔付
<25-4,Cuddy>you've caused us to get paid nothing by them either.

734
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,180
<25-5,Westbrook>-这跟我们无关  -实际上有关系
<25-5,Westbrook>- That's not our problem. - Actually it is,

735
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,940
<25-6,Cuddy>因为他要对我们尚未赔付的费用负责
<25-6,Cuddy>Since he's responsible for any expense we're not reimbursed.

736
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,700
<25-6,Cuddy>但是如果你撤诉
<25-6,Cuddy>But if you drop this suit

737
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,890
<25-6,Cuddy>并且指明蔡斯医生在为你
<25-6,Cuddy>And make it clear that Dr. Chase was acting

738
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,150
<25-6,Cuddy>接断指时是为你着想的
<25-6,Cuddy>In your best interest when he reattached your thumb,

739
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,770
<25-6,Cuddy>我们会重新提交索赔请求
<25-6,Cuddy>Then we'll be able to resubmit the claim.

740
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,510
<25-7,Westbrook>你们也会支付免赔额
<25-7,Westbrook>And you'll cover his deductible,

741
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,270
<25-7,Westbrook>律师费  还有五万元的精神补偿
<25-7,Westbrook>Attorney's fees, and 50 grand for pain and suffering?

742
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,070
<25-8,Cuddy>其实  我想说的是我们会替他付免赔额的一半
<25-8,Cuddy>Actually, I was thinking more like we'd cover half his deductible,

743
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,950
<25-8,Cuddy>你只要付16000元
<25-8,Cuddy>Which means you'd only owe $16,000.

744
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,100
<25-9,Westbrook>你是让他付钱给你
<25-9,Westbrook>You mean you want him to pay you?

745
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,780
<25-9,Westbrook>对
<25-9,Westbrook>Yes.

746
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,850
<25-10,Cuddy>你知道这手术要花费多少吗
<25-10,Cuddy>Do you have any idea how much it costs?

747
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,520
<25-10,Cuddy>培训一名显微外科医生要多少年
<25-10,Cuddy>How many years it takes to train someone in microsurgery?

748
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,230
<25-10,Cuddy>我们让你的生活重新步入正轨
<25-10,Cuddy>We gave you back your life.

749
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,480
<25-10,Cuddy>你仍然能工作
<25-10,Cuddy>You can still work.

750
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,670
<25-10,Cuddy>可以自己系扣子  拿叉子
<25-10,Cuddy>You can button your own shirt, hold a fork.

751
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,060
<25-11,Westbrook>马丁  我们走
<25-11,Westbrook>Martin, let's go.

00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,580
<25-11,Westbrook>我知道自己应该付钱
<25-11,Westbrook>I know I should pay.

754
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,420
<25-11,Westbrook>但我不能
<25-11,Westbrook>But I just can't.

755
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,240
<25-12,Cuddy>我还是不能正常工作
<25-12,Cuddy>I still cannot work.

756
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,410
<25-12,Cuddy>我已经待业在家
<25-12,Cuddy>I'm already underwater on my house.

757
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,420
<25-12,Cuddy>还有两个孩子要养
<25-12,Cuddy>And I have two kids with braces.

758
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,050
<25-12,Cuddy>你觉得自己少个手指会一切正常
<25-12,Cuddy>You think you'd be in better shape without a thumb?

759
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,110
<32-1,Cuddy>目前
<32-1,Cuddy>Right now...

760
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,030
<32-2,Eli>经济角度看来  是的
<32-2,Eli>Financially? Yeah.

761
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,500
<32-3,Cuddy>我的确是

00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,660
<25-11,Westbrook>好吧  我们奉陪
<25-11,Westbrook>Well, so would we.

763
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,430
<25-12,Cuddy>你进来时  我们没有这种想法
<25-12,Cuddy>But when you came in, we didn't think about that,

764
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,890
<25-13,Cuddy>只是一心为你好
<25-13,Cuddy>We just took care of you.

<25-13,Cuddy>没错  你的医生一心治病救人
<25-13,Cuddy>Yeah, right, all you doctors care about is healing.

767
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,330
<25-14,Westbrook>所以停车场里全是
<25-14,Westbrook>That's why there's all those BMWs and Porsches

768
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:10,820
<25-14,Westbrook>-宝马和保时捷  -该死
<25-14,Westbrook>- In the parking lot. - Damn it.

<25-17,Cuddy>我们靠这份营生赚钱
<25-17,Cuddy>We earn this money.

776
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,670
<25-17,Cuddy>即使手术费要你卖掉房子来还
<25-17,Cuddy>And if we have to take your house to get it,

779
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,530
<26-2,Nurse>好像有人在打架
<26-2,Nurse>I think they're fighting.

780
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,520
<26-3,Cuddy>让开  都让开

<26-4,Cuddy>What the hell is going on?

782
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,070
<26-5,House>我让他们畅所欲言
<26-5,House>I told them to use their words.

783
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,620
<27-1,Nurse Regina>那个药剂师回来了
<27-1,Nurse Regina>That pharm tech is back.

<27-4,Gail>What're you gonna do about it?

789
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,980

<27-5,Cuddy>Well, for one... notify the DEA.

790
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,600
<27-5,Cuddy>很好
<27-5,Cuddy>Good.

791
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,210
<27-6,Gail>他们肯定对豪斯医生如何强迫我为他偷药
<27-6,Gail>I'm sure they'll be very interested to hear How doctor house forced me to help him steal the meds

792
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,880
<27-6,Gail>同时与他有染的医院行政人员
<27-6,Gail>And the administrator who he's having sex with

<27-7,Cuddy>You really think you can lie your way out of this?

795
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,290
<27-8,Gail>没错

<28-1,Nurse Regina>董事局主席想跟你谈谈
<28-1,Nurse Regina>The hospital board's chairman wants to speak to you.

798
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,950
<28-2,Cuddy>- 告诉他我很忙  - 我说了  但是他
<28-2,Cuddy>-Tell him I'm busy. -I did, but he--

00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,070
<28-4,Cuddy>告诉他我不干了
<28-4,Cuddy>Tell him I quit.

800
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,940
<29-1,Cuddy>你打赌输给卢卡斯了
<29-1,Cuddy>You owe lucas the money.

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,660
<29-1,Cuddy>打电话时我们在做爱
<29-1,Cuddy>We were having sex when you called.

<29-2,House>母乳男最终找到愿意
<29-2,House>The breast milk guy finally found a doctor

803
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,810
<29-2,House>替他开药的医生了
<29-2,House>To give him what he wanted.

804
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,350
<29-2,House>如果这样能管用  比按照疟疾治疗好
<29-2,House>If it works, it's way better than malaria.

805
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,000
<29-2,House>值得一试
<29-2,House>It was worth a shot.

806
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,730
<29-2,House>我
<29-2,House>I...

807
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,170
<29-3,Cuddy>以为他们只是在虚张声势
<29-3,Cuddy>I thought they were the ones bluffing.

808
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,170
<29-3,Cuddy>没理由他们任我们终止合同
<29-3,Cuddy>No way they'd let us terminate.

809
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,130
<29-4,House>董事会不会开了你

811
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,260
<29-5,Cuddy>为什么
<29-5,Cuddy>Why not?

812
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,830
<29-6,House>因为你是个笨蛋
<29-6,House>Because you're an idiot.

813
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,220
<29-6,House>而这个地方需要你
<29-6,House>This place needs you.

814
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,040
<29-6,House>这些对你很重要
<29-6,House>And that matters to you.

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,230
<29-7,Cuddy>你怎么看那个药剂师
<29-7,Cuddy>What do you think of that pharm tech?

<29-7,Cuddy>盖尔
<29-7,Cuddy>Gail.

817
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,890
<29-8,House>是个反社会分子
<29-8,House>She's a sociopath.

818
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,160
<29-9,Cuddy>你知道她偷药
<29-9,Cuddy>You knew she was stealing meds?

819
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,830
<29-9,Cuddy>不知道
<29-9,Cuddy>No.

820
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,150
<29-10,House>不过她打开信的样子真怪
<29-10,House>But have you seen the way she opens the mail?

821
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,930
<29-11,Cuddy>怎么你从没告诉过我
<29-11,Cuddy>Why didn't you ever tell me?

822
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,820
<29-12,House>也许这消息有一天能派上用场
<29-12,House>Figured it might come in handy one day.

823
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,120
<30-1,Cuddy>盖尔  我一直欣赏你
<30-1,Cuddy>Gail, I like you.

824
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,040
<30-1,Cuddy>一直如此
<30-1,Cuddy>I always have.

825
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,650
<30-1,Cuddy>我也知道你不会在不属于你的优势下得偿所愿
<30-1,Cuddy>And I know you must've gotten sucked up into a situation you weren't able to control.

826
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,940
<30-2,Gail>真的  那你和豪斯就可以胡作非为
<30-2,Gail>Really, is that what happened with you and house?

827
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,420
<30-3,Cuddy>我不会因为你威胁来诋毁
<30-3,Cuddy>I'm not gonna back down

828
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,560
<30-3,Cuddy>就做出让步
<30-3,Cuddy>Just because you threaten to smear me.

829
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,010
<30-3,Cuddy>如果你愿意说出事实
<30-3,Cuddy>Now, if you agree to tell the truth,

830
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,810
<30-3,Cuddy>我仍然会帮助你
<30-3,Cuddy>There are things I can do to help.

831
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,970
<30-3,Cuddy>想想你的丈夫  你的孩子们
<30-3,Cuddy>Think about your husband, your kids.

832
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,040
<30-3,Cuddy>我相信你内心还是个好人
<30-3,Cuddy>I know you're a good person deep down inside.

833
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,540
<30-3,Cuddy>七年间你做的的一切是不可能瞒过去的
<30-3,Cuddy>You can't completely hide everything about yourself in seven years.

834
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,120
<30-3,Cuddy>你可真够傻的
<30-3,Cuddy>You're an idiot.

835
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,650
<30-4,Gail>上班六个月后我就开始偷了
<30-4,Gail>I started stealing from here six months after you hired me.

836
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,330
<30-4,Gail>到现在你也不怎么了解
<30-4,Gail>You still don't even know the half of it,

837
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,460
<30-4,Gail>而且你永远也不会清楚的
<30-4,Gail>And you never will.

838
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,490
<30-4,Gail>要不是我生了病 这一切还是神不知鬼不觉
<30-4,Gail>You wouldn't have even found out about this if I hadn't gotten sick.

839
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
<30-4,Gail>你也没自我感觉那么强硬
<30-4,Gail>And you aren't as tough as you think you are.

840
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,730
<30-4,Gail>你没有勇气炒了我
<30-4,Gail>There's no way you'd let this job get taken away.

841
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,430
<30-4,Gail>因为如果你这么做了
<30-4,Gail>And if I go down...

842
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,260
<30-4,Gail>我会拖你一起下水
<30-4,Gail>You're going down.

843
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,860
<30-4,Gail>斯坦过来时  请把这个交给他
<30-4,Gail>Can you tell stan to give this to

844
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,530
<31-1,Cuddy>让他上报毒品管理局
<31-1,Cuddy>The dea agent when he comes by.

845
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,130
<31-2,Nurse Regina>一朵花
<31-2,Nurse Regina>A flower?

846
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,440
<31-3,Cuddy>没错  卢卡斯送我的
<31-3,Cuddy>Yeah, Lucas gave it to me.

847
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,030
<30-2,Gail>也许有一天能派上用场
<30-2,Gail>I thought he might come in handy one day.

848
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,650
<30-3,Cuddy>上班六个月后
<30-3,Cuddy>I started stealing from here

849
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,920
<30-4,Gail>我就开始偷了
<30-4,Gail>Six months after you hired me.

850

<31-4,Nurse Regina>太棒了
<31-4,Nurse Regina>Nice.

851
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,580
<31-5,Cuddy>至少有件事能扬眉吐气一次
<31-5,Cuddy>Least I came out on top once today.

852
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,540
<31-6,Nurse Regina>你去哪
<31-6,Nurse Regina>Where you going?

853
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,740
<31-7,Cuddy>把辞呈交给董事会
<31-7,Cuddy>To hand the board my resignation.

854
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,520
<31-7,Cuddy>希望无论谁来代替我 都仍能得到那8%
<31-7,Cuddy>Hopefully whoever they hire to replace me can still get the 8%.

855
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,690
<31-7,Cuddy>玛丽娜
