1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,390
<1-1,Babyshoes>你嗑药了, 当差的?
<1-1,Babyshoes>You high,popo?

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,610
<1-2,House>有幽默感的警察,你查他的警车
<1-2,House>cop with a sense of humor.You can check the cop car.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,320
<1-2,House>还有他的私人用车, 工作地点, 家里
<1-2,House>Also check his personal car,work,home.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,770
<1-3,Cameron>Foreman, 出去!
<1-3,Cameron>Foreman,get out!

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,150
<1-4,Foreman>只有我觉得好笑么?
<1-4,Foreman>Am I the only one who finds this funny?

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,340
<1-5,Cameron>你偷了我的论文
<1-5,Cameron>You stole my article.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,340
<1-5,Cameron>我没偷
<1-5,Cameron>I wouldn't do that.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,250
<1-5,Cameron>我们不是朋友 是同事
<1-5,Cameron>We're not friends,we're colleagues.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,960
<2-1,Cameron>狗娘养的!
<2-1,Cameron>Ow! Son of a bitch!

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,220
<2-2,Foreman>现在你我都感染了
<2-2,Foreman>Now we're both exposed.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,460
<2-4,Foreman>我会死的
<2-4,Foreman>I'm gonna die.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,700
<2-4,Foreman>你死, 我死, 这些都不会发生
<2-4,Foreman>You die,I die.It's not gonna happen.

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,490
<2-5,House>死亡时间, 12:26 P.M.
<2-5,House>Time of death,12:26 P.M.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,210
<3-1,House>我要一把骨锯
<3-1,House>I need a bone saw.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,650
<3-4,Cuddy>- 对不起, 爱莫能助,- 你说可以的
<3-4,Cuddy>I'm sorry. I wish I could. --You said you

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,800
<3-5,House>我只需要取很小一块他的大脑,如此而已
<3-5,House>I just want a little tiny slice of this guy's brain,that's all I need.

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,900
<3-5,House>找出即将杀死Foreman的东西
<3-5,House>Just enough to tell me what's killing foreman.

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,390
<3-6,Cuddy>一小片Joe的大脑也会造成公众恐慌
<3-6,Cuddy>A thin slice of joe's brain could also cause a public health crisis.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,740
<3-7,House>没有必要每次都小题大做
<3-7,House>It's not a good idea to scream "fire"every time somebody lights a match.

20
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,170
<3-8,Cuddy>别轻描淡写的, House
<3-8,Cuddy>Don't downplay this,house.

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,950
<3-8,Cuddy>你把他们隔离肯定有原因
<3-8,Cuddy>You put both of them in isolation for a reason.

22
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,260
<3-8,Cuddy>Joe的死亡使生物安全等级上升为3
<3-8,Cuddy>Joe's death elevates this situation to a biosafety level three.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,520
<3-9,House>噢, 3级
<3-9,House>Ooh,level three.

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,240
<3-9,House>应该找jack bauer,(24 男主角)
<3-9,House>You should call jack bauer.

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
<3-10,Cuddy>我找了疾病控制中心(CDC)
<3-10,Cuddy>I called the cdc.

26
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,020
<3-11,House>告诉他们我们会万分当心
<3-11,House>Well,tell them i'll be really,really careful.

27
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,920
<3-12,Cuddy>没有配套设备,不可能做到"万分当心"
<3-12,Cuddy>We don't have the proper equipment for you to be really,really careful.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,840
<3-12,Cuddy>你想把Foreman怎么样都无所谓,但解剖必须由CDC进行
<3-12,Cuddy>You can do whatever you want to foreman,but the cdc will do this autopsy.

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,770
<3-13,House>随便, 问题是,3天之内能拿到结果都算快的了
<3-13,House>Whatever.The point is,we'll be lucky to get results in three days.

30
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,370
<3-14,Cuddy>我告诉他们这个是紧急事件
<3-14,Cuddy>I told them how urgent this is.

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,260
<3-15,House>他们怎么说?
<3-15,House>And they told you?

32
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,090
<3-16,Cuddy>3天后能拿到结果
<3-16,Cuddy>We'll have the results in three days.

33
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,350
<3-17,House>可惜
<3-17,House>Aw,that's a shame.

34
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,150
<3-17,House>Foreman看不到结果了,他将在36小时内死去
<3-17,House>Because foreman will never get to know what it was.He'll be dead in 36 hours.

35
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,120
<3-17,House>也许是中毒, 根本没传染性
<3-17,House>Maybe this is a toxin.Maybe it's not contagious at all,

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,440
<3-17,House>Foreman却要死在这个"也许"上
<3-17,House>and you're killing foreman because of a maybe.

37
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,950
<3-18,Cuddy>给你36小时, 你去查出来
<3-18,Cuddy>Well,you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is.

38
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,350
<3-18,Cuddy>Foreman过来, 快点
<3-18,Cuddy>Foreman.Come here,fast.

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,600
<4-1,House>怎么了?
<4-1,House>What's going on?

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
<4-2,Foreman>他们什么时候来验尸?
<4-2,Foreman>When are they doing the autopsy?

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,690
<4-2,Foreman>你自己来, 马上
<4-2,Foreman>You're doing it.Now.

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,430
<4-3,House>知道以前是怎么用冰锥做脑叶手术吗?
<4-3,House>You ever study how they used to do ice pick lobotomies?

43
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,980
<4-4,Foreman>在医学院读到过, 为什么要我--
<4-4,Foreman>I read about it in med school.Why would I--

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,790
<4-5,House>把冰锥顶在他的眼袋, 泪管的正上方
<4-5,House>shove an ice pick into the eye socket.Just above the tear duct.

45
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,990
<4-5,House>用榔头敲几下, 取出样本
<4-5,House>Bang it a couple of times with a hammer,get a sample.

46
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,950
<4-6,Foreman>怎么回事?
<4-6,Foreman>What's going on,man?

47
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,010
<4-7,Cuddy>Foreman, 不要做
<4-7,Cuddy>Foreman,you can't do it.

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,690
<4-7,Cuddy>那样你会违反--
<4-7,Cuddy>You'll be in violation of--

49
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,160
<4-8,House>- 没命了还用坐牢么,- 你
<4-8,House>can't do the time if you're not alive.--You.

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,530
<4-9,Cuddy>我要你换上防护服
<4-9,Cuddy>I need you to suit up.

51
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,430
<4-9,Cuddy>从Foreman医生那里拿回工具
<4-9,Cuddy>Get that equipment away from dr. Foreman.

52
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,780
<4-10,House>慢慢来, 伙计
<4-10,House>take your time,guys.

53
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,780
<4-10,House>你干吗不说些小心之类的?,那样不会错
<4-10,House>Why don't you just tell him to go slow?Won't be your fault.

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,170
<4-10,House>Foreman.
<4-10,House>Foreman.

55
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,990
<4-11,Cuddy>我们还不知道这是什么类型的感染
<4-11,Cuddy>We don't even know what kind of contagion we're dealing with.

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,110
<4-12,House>所以我们要凿开那人的脑袋
<4-12,House>Which is why we need to chop into the guy's head.

57
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,050
<4-14,House>- 这样很危险,- 对你来说没什么, foreman
<4-14,House>It's dangerous.--Not to you,foreman.

58
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,650
<4-15,Cuddy>还有其它方法来诊断
<4-15,Cuddy>There are other ways to diagnose you.

59
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,900
<4-16,House>是吗? 你知道?
<4-16,House>Yeah?You have the answer?

60
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,330
<4-16,House>Foreman, 动手
<4-16,House>Foreman,do it now.

61
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,290
<4-17,Cuddy>我警告你, 不要--
<4-17,Cuddy>I am warning you,do not--

62
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,550
<4-18,House>你在做什么?
<4-18,House>What are you doing?

63
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,630
<4-19,Foreman>我感觉不好
<4-19,Foreman>That didn't feel right.

64
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
<4-20,Cuddy>他失明了
<4-20,Cuddy>He's blind.

65
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,020
<4-21,House>他以为自己能看见,跟那警察一样
<4-21,House>He thinks he can see.Same as the cop.

66
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,660
<4-22,Foreman>给我个袋子盛样本
<4-22,Foreman>I need something to bag the sample.

67
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,210
<4-23,House>算了吧, 你刚刚取了床垫的样本
<4-23,House>Forget it.You just biopsied a mattress.

68
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,200
<4-24,Foreman>不不, 我没事
<4-24,Foreman>No,no,no.I'm fine.

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,100
<4-24,Foreman>House, 样品拿去, 去检查
<4-24,Foreman>House,there's the sample.Get it,test it.

70
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,010
<4-24,Foreman>快点去检查样品!
<4-24,Foreman>You gotta test that sample!

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,570
<4-25,House>36小时的估计过于乐观了
<4-25,House>Apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours.

72
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,410
<4-25,House>接下来将是无法遏止, 无法忍受的疼痛
<4-25,House>Intractable,unbearable pain is up next.

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,010
<4-25,House>关于验尸的事, 要不要再考虑下?
<4-25,House>Sure you don't want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?

74
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,520
<5-1,Chase>眼睛是好的
<5-1,Chase>physically,his eyes are fine.

75
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,940
<5-1,Chase>问题在于和大脑隔离了
<5-1,Chase>Problem's isolated to his brain.

76
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,590
<5-1,Chase>枕叶的损伤从主要视皮层--
<5-1,Chase>Damage to the occipital lobe extends from the primary visual cortex--

77
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,530
<5-2,Cameron>要不要检查细菌性脑膜炎?
<5-2,Cameron>should we test him for bacterial meningitis?

78
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,440
<5-3,House>如果是脑膜炎, 他早就倒下了
<5-3,House>If it was meningitis,we'd all be sick.

79
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,100
<5-4,Cameron>- 从脑脊液可以看出,- 毫无意义
<5-4,Cameron>His csf could show signs--that would be pointless.

80
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,190
<5-5,House>已经做过脑组织活检, 是阴性
<5-5,House>We already did a brain biopsy.It was negative.

81
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,990
<5-6,Chase>有毒霉菌?
<5-6,Chase>Toxic mold?

82
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,170
<5-7,Cameron>如果是霉菌, 我肯定病了
<5-7,Cameron>If it was toxic mold,I'd be sick.

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,040
<5-8,House>我们怎么知道你没病?
<5-8,House>How do we know you're not sick?

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,490
<5-9,Cameron>我样子很快活么?
<5-9,Cameron>Do I seem happy to you?

85
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,980
<5-10,House>从没
<5-10,House>Never.

86
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,520
<5-11,Chase>有点好笑
<5-11,Chase>It was funny.

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,350
<5-12,House>暂时认定不从血液传播
<5-12,House>Well,let's assume it's not blood-borne.

88
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,890
<5-12,House>如果你开始讲笑话,我们再重新估计
<5-12,House>If you start cracking jokes,we can re-assess.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,900
<5-12,House>同时, 远离你的亲友和宠物
<5-12,House>In the meantime,stay away from people and animals that you care about.

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,870
<5-12,House>Guillian-barr病?
<5-12,House>Guillian-barr?

91
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,240
<5-14,Chase>他们都没有出现麻痹症状
<5-14,Chase>Neither of them had any sort of paralysis.

92
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,900
<5-15,Cameron>也许麻痹未来得及出现,Joe就已经死亡
<5-15,Cameron>Joe could have died before the paralysis had a chance to present.

93
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,220
<5-16,Chase>会不会是虫媒病毒?
<5-16,Chase>What about arbovirus?

94
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,940
<5-17,House>开始治疗
<5-17,House>Start treatment.

95
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,140
<5-18,Cameron>按虫媒病毒?
<5-18,Cameron>For arbovirus?

96
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,440
<5-18,Cameron>你觉得这个大都市的警察
<5-18,Cameron>You think our jersey beat cop

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,010
<5-18,Cameron>曾在蛮荒的非洲跟虫子在一起?
<5-18,Cameron>has been spending a lot of time exploring deep,dark africa?

98
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,230
<5-19,House>任何治疗方向
<5-19,House>Treatment for everything.

99
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,090
<5-19,House>有谱的没谱的,只要能想到就治
<5-19,House>Likely or unlikely.If you can think of it,treat for it.

100
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,360
<5-20,Chase>这么多药物同时使用,会产生毒性
<5-20,Chase>Mixing that many meds will create all sorts of toxic interactions.

101
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,600
<5-21,Cameron>那样会令肝肾不堪重负,肯定有更好的方法
<5-21,Cameron>We'll box his liver,trash his kidneys.There's got to be a better way.

102
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,160
<5-21,Cameron>当然有更好的方法!
<5-21,Cameron>Of course there's a better way!

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,980
<5-22,House>都在Cuddy不让我们动的那具尸体上
<5-22,House>It's that body sitting in the room with him that cuddy  won't let us touch.

104
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,470
<5-22,House>细菌, 病毒, 毒素, 真菌, 寄生虫,必然是其中一种
<5-22,House>Bacterials,virals,toxins,fungals,parasites.It's got to be one of them.

105
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,380
<5-23,Cameron>你去哪里?
<5-23,Cameron>Where are you going?

106
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
<5-24,House>看能不能再找个大脑来检查
<5-24,House>To see if I can find another brain to biopsy.

107
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,710
<6-1,Chase>我们要把Joe锁在楼下,直到CDC到达
<6-1,Chase>we're going to lock joe up downstairs until the cdc gets here.

108
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,760
<6-1,Chase>Foreman, 你看不见
<6-1,Chase>Foreman,you can't see.

109
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,230
<6-2,Foreman>对
<6-2,Foreman>Right.

110
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,230
<6-3,Chase>House想给你一些药,在密封口里
<6-3,Chase>House wants to start you on some meds.They're in the airlock.

111
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,340
<6-4,Foreman>治什么的?
<6-4,Foreman>For what?

112
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,620
<6-5,Chase>最大的嫌疑是有毒的霉菌
<6-5,Chase>Leading candidate is toxic mold.

113
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,940
<6-6,Foreman>cameron病了吗?
<6-6,Foreman>Is cameron sick?

114
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,290
<6-7,Cameron>我没事, 多谢关心
<6-7,Cameron>I'm fine.Thanks for asking.

115
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,210
<6-8,Foreman>你们这网撒的可有点大,不止是霉菌吧?
<6-8,Foreman>You're casting your net a little wider than toxic mold,aren't you?

116
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,810
<6-9,Cameron>Guillian-barr病也在台上放着
<6-9,Cameron>Guillian-barr?is also on the table.

117
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,750
<6-10,Foreman>还有椭圆形的...上面有个"L"或是"7"
<6-10,Foreman>This is an oval shape...has either an l or a 7.

118
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,740
<6-10,Foreman>我猜是个"L", 左氧氟沙星,因为不能排除细菌
<6-10,Foreman>I'm guessing an L.Levofloxacin,because you can't rule out bacteria.

119
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,350
<6-10,Foreman>8-0-0, 是阿昔洛韦的剂量,对付病毒
<6-10,Foreman>Eight,zero,zero.That's the dosage for the acylovir in case it's viral.

120
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,390
<6-10,Foreman>方的...不, 好像是菱形的
<6-10,Foreman>Square...no,more like a rhombus.

121
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,140
<6-10,Foreman>治真菌的氟康唑
<6-10,Foreman>That's fluconazole for fungus.

122
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,640
<6-10,Foreman>另外还有8种药, 你们
<6-10,Foreman>There's about eight others here.You--

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
<6-10,Foreman>你们把能想到的病都治了
<6-10,Foreman>you're treating me for everything.

124
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,580
<6-10,Foreman>你们不知道我得的什么
<6-10,Foreman>You have no idea what I've got.

125
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,240
<6-11,Chase>House认为这是最好的措施
<6-11,Chase>House thinks this is the best course of action.

126
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,510
<6-12,Foreman>House乱了方寸了
<6-12,Foreman>House is desperate.

127
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,920
<6-12,Foreman>他从来不乱
<6-12,Foreman>House is never desperate.

128
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,490
<6-13,Cameron>其中的一些药会起作用
<6-13,Cameron>Something we give you will work.

129
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,000
<6-14,Foreman>是啊, 以后所有的病人都这么治
<6-14,Foreman>Yeah,we should start treating all patients this way.

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,020
<6-14,Foreman>他们生病了, 就把所有的药吃了
<6-14,Foreman>When they get sick,they just take everything.

131
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,530
<6-15,Chase>聊胜于无
<6-15,Chase>It's better than doing nothing.

132
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,020
<7-1,Foreman>喂?
<7-1,Foreman>Hello?

133
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,040
<7-2,House>我在警察家
<7-2,House>I'm at the cop's place.

134
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,800
<7-2,House>追溯你的脚步
<7-2,House>I need to retrace your steps.

135
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,420
<7-3,Foreman>你觉得"百病皆治"还不保险?
<7-3,Foreman>You don't think the "treat him for everything" approach is enough?

136
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,170
<7-4,House>你从哪里开始查的?
<7-4,House>Where did you start your search?

137
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,140
<7-5,Foreman>厨房
<7-5,Foreman>The kitchen.

138
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,690
<7-6,House>告诉我你做的每件事, 接触的每样东西
<7-6,House>You will tell me everything you did,everything you touched.

139
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,050
<7-6,House>即使上厕所,我也要知道时间和理由
<7-6,House>If you went to the john,I want to know when and why.

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,670
<7-7,Foreman>从水槽的霉斑开始取样
<7-7,Foreman>I started with samples from the mold in his sink.

141
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,070
<7-8,House>然后?
<7-8,House>What next?

142
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,930
<7-9,Foreman>就那样, 然后离开了
<7-9,Foreman>That's it.Then I left.

143
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,570
<7-9,Foreman>现在干什么?
<7-9,Foreman>What do we do now?

144
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,700
<7-10,House>等待steve mcqueen乐翻天
<7-10,House>Wait for steve mcqueen to get giddy.

145
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,090
<7-11,Foreman>好计划
<7-11,Foreman>Excellent plan.

146
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,120
<7-11,Foreman>嘿, 爸爸
<7-11,Foreman>Hey,dad.

147
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,890
<7-11,Foreman>是Eric, 我不太好
<7-11,Foreman>It's eric.I'm not doing too good.

148
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,440
<7-11,Foreman>foreman怎么样了?
<7-11,Foreman>How's foreman?

149
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,470
<8-1,Wilson>你在玩网上摄像头?
<8-1,Wilson>You're accessing a webcam?

150
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,170
<8-2,House>Cuddy的浴室偷拍
<8-2,House>Cuddy's shower.

151
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,860

152
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,840
<8-3,Wilson>是你的厨房?
<8-3,Wilson>is that your kitchen?

153
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,690
<8-4,House>当然, 我不能带到这儿来
<8-4,House>Well,obviously I couldn't bring him here.

154
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,410
<8-4,House>他已经接触到foreman碰过的东西
<8-4,House>He's been exposed to whatever foreman's got.

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,970
<8-5,Wilson>你让steve受感染?
<8-5,Wilson>You infected steve?

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,650
<8-5,Wilson>干吗不从宠物店买一只?
<8-5,Wilson>Why didn't you just get a rat from the pet store?

157
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,170
<8-6,House>因为...我需要病史清晰的老鼠
<8-6,House>Because...I needed one with a clean medical history.

158
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
<8-6,House>谁知道那些老鼠有没有用抗生素?
<8-6,House>Who knows what kind of antibiotics they give those rats?

159
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,260
<8-7,Wilson>这就是你的计划?,坐这里看着你的老鼠?
<8-7,Wilson>So this is your plan?Just sit here and watch your rat all day?

160
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,970
<8-8,House>应该很快的
<8-8,House>Well,it shouldn't take long.

161
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,540
<8-8,House>一切准备好, 我还清洗了笼子...
<8-8,House>Got the ac blasting,I soaped the floor of his cage...

162
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,450
<8-8,House>一旦发病, 就动手解剖
<8-8,House>as soon as he gets sick,I do an autopsy.

163
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,670
<8-9,Wilson>一旦死亡
<8-9,Wilson>As soon as he's dead.

164

<8-10,House>一旦发病, 它的头部会遭某个...
<8-10,House>Right after he gets sick,there's a good chance he'll get hit in the head with A...

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,750

<8-10,House>cane-shaped object.

166
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,790
<8-11,Wilson>通常你只拿病人当小白鼠
<8-11,Wilson>Normally you just use your patients as lab rats.

167
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,380
<8-11,Wilson>这是个不错的改观
<8-11,Wilson>It's a nice change.

168
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,560
<8-12,House>最先的症状是欣快
<8-12,House>First symptom is euphoria.

169
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,420
<8-13,Wilson>你怎么知道老鼠是不是欣快?
<8-13,Wilson>How do you know if a rat's euphoric?

170
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,570
<8-14,House>他平时不会这样爬水瓶的吧?
<8-14,House>He doesn't usually climb on his water bottle like that,does he?

171
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,290
<9-1,Mother>只有坐在车座上才出现症状
<9-1,Mother>the seizures only seem to happen when she's in her car seat.

172
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,590
<9-1,Mother>她颤动, 呻吟
<9-1,Mother>She starts to rock and grunt.

173
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,690
<9-2,House>对外界有反应么?
<9-2,House>She responsive?

174
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,820
<9-3,Mother>没有, 好像沉浸在她的世界
<9-3,Mother>No,no,it's like she's in a zone.

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,200
<9-3,Mother>还有她的腹肌张力异常

<9-5,Mother>我在"癫痫网"上看过几篇文章
<9-5,Mother>I looked up a few articles on epilepsy.

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,410
<9-5,Mother>有几个很不错的青年足球联盟
<9-5,Mother>You know,there's actually some really great youth soccer leagues,

180
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,960
<9-5,Mother>能照顾到她的特殊需求...
<9-5,Mother>that would cater specifically to her special needs,and...

181
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,980
<9-5,Mother>我想这就是为什么她不能适应学前班
<9-5,Mother>I think it might explain why she's been having a hard time in preschool.

182
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,160
<9-6,House>先让我确认你的诊断,然后再说退学的事
<9-6,House>Let's confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back.

183
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,500
<9-6,House>变幻的光线和高频的声音,会诱发癫痫
<9-6,House>Strobing lights and high-pitched sounds can provoke a seizure.

184
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,160

<9-8,House>彼此彼此, 失败者
<9-8,House>Takes one to know one,loser.

186
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,100
<9-8,House>不是, 我说自己是失败者,这段剪掉
<9-8,House>Wait,that means I'm a loser.Scratch that.

187
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,680
<9-8,House>这些发作过程, 过后会不会出汗?

<9-10,House>And does she seem upset by them,or just tired?

<9-11,Mother>不, 她只是觉得好玩
<9-11,Mother>No,she kind of thinks it's funny.

<9-12,House>颤动, 呻吟, 出汗, 肌肉强直,再加上担心的父母
<9-12,House>You mix rocking,grunting,sweating,and dystonia with concerned parents,

<9-12,House>你在"癫痫网"上得到一个业余的诊断
<9-12,House>and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy.

193
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,640
<9-12,House>实际上, 你女儿只是在"逗小妹妹玩"
<9-12,House>In actuality,all your little girl is doing is saying "yoo hoo"to the "hoo hoo."

194
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,850

199
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,150
<9-16,House>这叫满足失调, 其实也不太准确
<9-16,House>It's called gratification disorder.Sort of a misnomer.

200
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,960
<9-16,House>不能满足自己, 那才叫失调
<9-16,House>If one was unable to gratify oneself,that would be a disorder.

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,830
<9-17,Mother>你是说她在自慰?
<9-17,Mother>Are you saying she's masturbating?

202
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,540
<9-18,House>说的隐晦点好吗, 有小朋友
<9-18,House>I was trying to be discreet.There's a child in the room.

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,100
<9-20,House>"癫痫网"才叫可怕
<9-20,House>Epilepsy is horrifying.

205
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,900
<9-20,House>告诉你女儿注意隐私就没事了,给你
<9-20,House>Teach your girl about privacy and she'll be fine.Here you go.

206
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,350
<9-21,Girl>谢谢
<9-21,Girl>Thank you.

207
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,680
<10-1,Cuddy>你想在一个下午,把这个月的病人病历都弄妥?
<10-1,Cuddy>One afternoon,and you're on pace to set the record for most patients seen in a month.

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,930
<10-2,House>我坐堂门诊你不高兴?
<10-2,House>You're upset that i'm doing clinic hours?

<10-2,House>简直是婚礼上下雨的表情
<10-2,House>Wow,that is so like rain on your wedding day.

<10-3,Cuddy>刚才的3小时, 我一直在和CDC交涉,而你--
<10-3,Cuddy>For the past three hours,I have been on the phone with the cdc,while you are--

211
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,320
<10-4,House>交涉的怎样了?
<10-4,House>yeah,how's that going, by the way?

212
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,670
<10-5,Cuddy>他们答应加速处理--
<10-5,Cuddy>They promised to expedite--

213
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,590
<10-6,House>他们连尸体都没拿到, 做解剖未免难了点
<10-6,House>tough to do an autopsy when they haven't even picked up the body.

214
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,180
<10-7,Cuddy>你都不和病人在同一楼层,还奢谈什么治病
<10-7,Cuddy>It's tough to treat your patient when you're not even on the same floor.

215
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,520
<10-7,Cuddy>去吧, 门诊有人值班
<10-7,Cuddy>Go.Clinic is covered.

216
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,390
<10-8,House>看着药品滴注的过程
<10-8,House>I go watch the meds drip into his iv.

217
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,000
<10-8,House>你觉得这样有助于治疗吗?
<10-8,House>You think that'll make the treatment work faster?

218
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,750
<10-9,Cuddy>去办公室, 玩你的球
<10-9,Cuddy>Go to your office.Play with your ball.

219
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,010
<10-9,Cuddy>在白板上写字, 羞辱你的团队
<10-9,Cuddy>Write on your whiteboard.Insult your team.

220
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,860
<10-9,Cuddy>拿出你平常惯用的招数,只要解决问题
<10-9,Cuddy>Do whatever it is that you do to figure things out.

221
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,740
<10-10,House>感到内疚了?
<10-10,House>Feeling guilty?

222
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,450
<10-10,House>现在改变主意还不晚, 去打给CDC
<10-10,House>It's not too late to change your mind.Go call the cdc.

223
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,450
<10-10,House>告诉他们你开玩笑的
<10-10,House>Tell 'em you were just joshing.

224
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,700
<10-11,Cuddy>躲着Foreman直到他死掉
<10-11,Cuddy>Keep avoiding foreman's case until he dies.

225
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,840
<10-11,Cuddy>这样我就内疚了
<10-11,Cuddy>Then I'll drown in guilt.

226
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,680
<11-1,Cameron>好些了么?
<11-1,Cameron>Feeling any better?

227
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,830
<11-2,Foreman>你怎么样?
<11-2,Foreman>How are you doing?

228
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,400
<11-3,Cameron>我不是病人
<11-3,Cameron>I'm not the patient.

229
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,680
<11-4,Foreman>你的血沉升高了?
<11-4,Foreman>Is your sed rate elevated?

230
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,160
<11-4,Foreman>没有
<11-4,Foreman>No.

231
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,820
<11-5,Cameron>看来我是走运的
<11-5,Cameron>So far,it looks like i lucked out.

232
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,560
<11-5,Cameron>Cameron.
<11-5,Cameron>Cameron.

233
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,900
<11-6,Foreman>你把止血带丢在床上了
<11-6,Foreman>Looks like you left a tourniquet on the bed.

234
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,410
<11-7,Cameron>你能看见了?
<11-7,Cameron>You can see again?

235
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,570
<11-8,Foreman>治疗起作用了
<11-8,Foreman>The treatment's working.

236
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,930
<12-1,House>问题是, 哪种治疗?
<12-1,House>The question is,which treatment?

237
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,820
<12-2,Cameron>每次减少一种药, 先去掉哪个?
<12-2,Cameron>We'll start weaning him off one at a time.Which one do we start with?

238
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,330
<12-3,House>哪怕你按字母顺序也好,只要保持他的视力
<12-3,House>I don't care if you do it alphabetically.Just stay on top of his vision.

239
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,030
<12-3,House>一旦视力有消失的迹象,就说明去掉的药是有效的
<12-3,House>First sign of regression means we've taken him off the wrong one.

240
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,110
<12-3,House>最新的血检结果
<12-3,House>The latest blood work.

241
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,360
<12-4,Chase>Foreman的淀粉酶和脂肪酶,是正常值的三倍
<12-4,Chase>Foreman's amylase and lipase levels are three times normal.

242
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,490
<12-5,Cameron>胰腺被破坏了
<12-5,Cameron>Pancreas is failing.

243
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,010
<12-6,Chase>药物的副作用
<12-6,Chase>A toxic side effect of his meds.

244
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,170
<13-1,House>哲学问题
<13-1,House>philosophical question.

245
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,130
<13-1,House>你打算怎样死法?
<13-1,House>How do you want to die?

246
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,750
<13-2,Foreman>老死
<13-2,Foreman>Old age.

247
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,380
<13-3,House>你必须在从现在起4小时和14小时之间选
<13-3,House>Your choice is currently between 4 hours from now and 14 hours from now.

248
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,430
<13-3,House>估计你会选后者
<13-3,House>So I'm assuming that means you want the latter.

249
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,510
<13-3,House>鸡尾酒疗法有效
<13-3,House>The cocktail's working.

250
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,920
<13-4,Foreman>视力几乎全部恢复
<13-4,Foreman>My vision's almost completely restored.

251
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,820
<13-5,House>药物治疗了你的脑袋
<13-5,House>The meds are curing what's in your head,

252
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,580
<13-5,House>却摧毁了你的胰腺
<13-5,House>but they're trashing your pancreas.

253
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,430
<13-5,House>所以你会呕吐, 站直的力气都没有
<13-5,House>That's why you're puking and you can't stand up without screaming.

254
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,750
<13-6,Foreman>降低剂量
<13-6,Foreman>So lower the dosages.

255
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,930
<13-6,Foreman>对胰腺损伤小点, 仍能对抗感染
<13-6,Foreman>Less stress on my pancreas, still battle the infection.

256
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,730
<13-7,Chase>小剂量也有毒性
<13-7,Chase>Lower dosages will still be toxic.

257
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
<13-7,Chase>我不在乎!
<13-7,Chase>I don't care!

258
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,730
<13-8,Foreman>我能忍受胰腺炎的疼痛
<13-8,Foreman>I can handle the pain of the pancreatitis.

259
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,880
<13-9,House>但你不能忍受没胰腺的生活
<13-9,House>I don't think you can handle life without a pancreas.

260
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,180
<13-9,House>继续给你用药
<13-9,House>We keep you on these meds,

261
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,050
<13-9,House>你可以在生命的最后4小时,保留视觉
<13-9,House>you'll spend the last four hours of your life being able to see.

262
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
<13-9,House>取消用药, 你又变瞎子
<13-9,House>Take you off,you'll go blind again.

263
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,570
<13-9,House>但能争取时间,让我们弄清什么在侵蚀你的大脑
<13-9,House>But it'll give us time to figure out what's eating your brain.

264
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,340
<13-9,House>好吧
<13-9,House>Fine.

265
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,370
<13-10,Foreman>我们怎么做
<13-10,Foreman>What do we do next?

266
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,060
<13-11,Offstage male>eric?
<13-11,Offstage male>eric?

267
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,890
<13-12,Foreman>爸爸?
<13-12,Foreman>Dad?

268
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,200
<13-13,House>你们等会儿再叙旧
<13-13,House>Yeah,you two can get caught up later.

<14-1,Cuddy>Uh...what is this?

272
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,760
<14-2,House>他不是什么, 是人
<14-2,House>He isn't a what,he's a who.

273
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,760
<14-2,House>还是个有投票权的
<14-2,House>They even have the right to vote now.

274
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,550
<14-2,House>Rodney foreman,cuddy. Cuddy,rodney foreman.
<14-2,House>Rodney foreman - cuddy,Cuddy - rodney foreman

275
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,350
<14-3,Rodney>很高兴见到您, 女士
<14-3,Rodney>Nice to meet you,ma'am.

276
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,630
<14-4,House>是Foreman的爸爸
<14-4,House>This is foreman's dad.

277
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,190
<14-5,Cuddy>我知道了
<14-5,Cuddy>Yeah,I got that.

278
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,320
<14-6,House>Cuddy医生是我们的主任
<14-6,House>And dr. Cuddy,here,is the dean of medicine.

279
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,120
<14-6,House>知道我跟你说的那个解剖吗
<14-6,House>Remember that cool autopsy i was telling you about,

280
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,300
<14-6,House>能救你儿子一命的?
<14-6,House>the one that would save your son's life?

281
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,970
<14-6,House>她有权批准解剖
<14-6,House>She's the one can give us the green light to do it.

282
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,460
<14-7,Rodney>我能理解您为何不那样做
<14-7,Rodney>I understand you don't want them to do it.

283
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,530
<14-7,Rodney>House医生看来还没理解
<14-7,Rodney>Dr. House didn't seem to know why.

284
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,980
<14-8,Cuddy>Foreman先生, 我一直尽力让CDC尽快--
<14-8,Cuddy>Mr. Foreman,I am doing everything I can to get the cdc--

285
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,060
<14-9,House>还是不够快
<14-9,House>won't be soon enough.

286
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,420
<14-10,Cuddy>关于我遵守公众健康安全守则的--
<14-10,Cuddy>And my decision to follow public health safety protocols

287
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,420
<14-11,House>别怪规矩不好
<14-11,House>oh,don't blame the rules.

288
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,140
<14-11,House>别把这都归罪于什么政策和守则
<14-11,House>Don't want to hang this on policy and protocol.

289
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,370
<14-12,Cuddy>我非常清楚, 您的儿子可能丧生,正如我清楚
<14-12,Cuddy>I'm well aware that it may cost your son his life,just as I am well aware

290
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,570
<14-12,Cuddy>我的决定能影响无数的家庭和朋友
<14-12,Cuddy>that my decision has a devastating effect on family and friends

291
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,120
<14-12,Cuddy>没在我眼前抗议的那些
<14-12,Cuddy>without having them paraded in front of me.

292
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,500
<14-12,Cuddy>你的儿子得了一种,未知的, 传染性的, 致命的感染
<14-12,Cuddy>Your son has an unknown,contagious,deadly infection.

293
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,090
<14-12,Cuddy>如果我们不能限制在这里,将有很多人处于危险
<14-12,Cuddy>If we don't contain it here,even more people could be at risk.

294
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,550
<14-12,Cuddy>我对那些人也负有责任
<14-12,Cuddy>And I am capable of empathizing with those people too

295
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,360
<14-12,Cuddy>即使他们没在我面前示威
<14-12,Cuddy>without having them paraded in front of me.

296
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,530
<14-13,Rodney>我理解
<14-13,Rodney>I understand.

297
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,480
<15-1,Rodney>你的手怎么了?
<15-1,Rodney>What's wrong with your hand?

298
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,410
<15-2,Foreman>这叫肌肉痉挛
<15-2,Foreman>It's--it's called a muscle contraction.

299
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,000
<15-3,Rodney>我以为毛病在你头上
<15-3,Rodney>I thought this thing was in your brain.

300
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,310
<15-4,Foreman>是的, 这表明病源侵入了运动皮层
<15-4,Foreman>It is.It just means the infection's moved to the primary motor cortex,

301
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,420
<15-4,Foreman>那里控制肌肉
<15-4,Foreman>which controls the muscles.

302
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,760
<15-4,Foreman>是不是还很欣慰让我读医学?
<15-4,Foreman>Aren't you glad you sent me to med school?

303
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,220
<15-5,Rodney>疼吗?
<15-5,Rodney>Does it hurt?

304
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,710
<15-6,Foreman>不
<15-6,Foreman>No.

305
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,040
<15-7,Rodney>会疼吗?
<15-7,Rodney>Is it gonna?

306
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,270
<15-8,Foreman>另一个人
<15-8,Foreman>The--the other guy...

307
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,970
<15-8,Foreman>看上去不是很痛苦--
<15-8,Foreman>he didn't seem to suffer too much,he--

308
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,730
<15-8,Foreman>他睡着了
<15-8,Foreman>just went in his sleep.

309
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,070
<16-1,Wilson>Steve还是很正常?,没有痉挛的迹象
<16-1,Wilson>Steve still acting normal?,No sign of contractures.

310
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,460
<16-2,House>他们把警察的尸体封在密封袋子里
<16-2,House>They got the cop's body in a locked,airtight bag.

311
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,780
<16-3,Wilson>门口还有警卫
<16-3,Wilson>And a guard on the door.

312
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,050
<16-3,Wilson>这些联邦官员还真是紧张
<16-3,Wilson>These feds are seriously paranoid.

313
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,980
<16-4,House>他几小时没尿尿了, 时间该到了
<16-4,House>He hasn't gotten up to pee in hours.He's due.

314
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,410
<16-5,Wilson>你没朝他的多纳圈上洒泻药?
<16-5,Wilson>You haven't sprinkled senokot granules on his doughnut?

315
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,130
<16-5,Wilson>他的肠子会像红海分开一样翻腾
<16-5,Wilson>His bowels would open up like the red sea.

316
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,750
<16-6,House>他不会吃多纳圈的
<16-6,House>He wouldn't eat the doughnut.

317
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,430
<16-7,Wilson>你不是真的在这里待了几小时吧?
<16-7,Wilson>Have you seriously been dn here for hours?

318
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,480
<16-7,Wilson>没
<16-7,Wilson>No.

319
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,900
<16-8,House>我去尿了几次
<16-8,House>I had to pee a couple times.

320
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,250
<16-9,Wilson>不要再责怪cuddy了
<16-9,Wilson>You've got to stop blaming cuddy for this.

321
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,430
<16-10,House>这是她的错, 责怪是应该的
<16-10,House>Given that it is her fault,that seems appropriate.

322
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,740
<16-11,Wilson>她有错
<16-11,Wilson>That part is her fault.

323
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,090
<16-11,Wilson>某人在地下室浪费时间
<16-11,Wilson>The part where somebody wasted his time in the basement,

324
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,020
<16-11,Wilson>密谋放倒一个政府人员,那也是错
<16-11,Wilson>plotting the overthrow of a government agency,that one's on you.

325
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,160
<16-12,House>我唯一可做的就是思考,在哪里无所谓
<16-12,House>The only think I can do is think.I can pretty much do that anywhere.

326
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,740
<16-12,House>只要没人烦我
<16-12,House>As long as no one's bugging me.

327
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,090
<17-1,Rodney>给你兄弟打电话了吗?
<17-1,Rodney>did you call your brother?

328
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,560
<17-1,Rodney>没有
<17-1,Rodney>No.

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,370
<17-2,Foreman>你呢?
<17-2,Foreman>Did you?

330
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,890
<17-3,Rodney>没
<17-3,Rodney>No.

331
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,390
<17-4,Foreman>没什么大事
<17-4,Foreman>It's not a big deal.

332
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,510
<17-4,Foreman>我倒是想见妈妈
<17-4,Foreman>I sure would have liked to see mom,though.

333
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,790
<17-5,Rodney>你知道她无法旅行
<17-5,Rodney>You know she can't travel anymore.

334
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,430
<17-6,Foreman>你告诉她
<17-6,Foreman>You tell her?

335
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,960
<17-6,Foreman>做什么?
<17-6,Foreman>Why?

336
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,870
<17-7,Rodney>让她难过一阵
<17-7,Rodney>Just upset her for a while.

337
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,400
<17-7,Rodney>然后转眼就不记得了
<17-7,Rodney>Then she wouldn't remember for a while.

338
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,130
<17-8,Foreman>她不该知道吗?
<17-8,Foreman>Think she should know?

339
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,120
<17-9,Rodney>她已经记不起自己
<17-9,Rodney>She's lost a lot of who she was.

340
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,390
<17-9,Rodney>无法接受这样的事
<17-9,Rodney>She can't deal with something like this.

341
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,460
<17-10,Foreman>你能接受?
<17-10,Foreman>And you can?

342
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,880
<17-11,Rodney>我知道你会去一个美好的地方
<17-11,Rodney>I still know you're going to a better place.

343
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,350
<17-12,Foreman>你说的轻松
<17-12,Foreman>It's easy for you,isn't it?

344
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,750
<17-12,Foreman>只要你相信我会去好地方,死也没那么糟了
<17-12,Foreman>As long as you believe i'm going to a better place,dying ain't so bad.

345
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,560
<17-13,Rodney>我想让你不要怕
<17-13,Rodney>I don't want you to be afraid.

346
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,310
<17-14,Foreman>如果不怕死, 还能怕什么?
<17-14,Foreman>If I'm not afraid of dying,what the hell should I be afraid of,dad?

347
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,700
<17-15,Rodney>我以为你相信了
<17-15,Rodney>I thought you believed.

348
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,700
<17-16,Foreman>曾经
<17-16,Foreman>I did.

349
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,470
<17-16,Foreman>现在我不太确定了
<17-16,Foreman>I'm not so sure anymore.

350
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,630
<17-17,Rodney>我会为你祈祷, 儿子
<17-17,Rodney>I'm going to pray for you,son.

351
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,250
<17-17,Rodney>希望你和我一起
<17-17,Rodney>I suggest you do the same.

352
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,570
<18-1,Chase>视野开始衰退
<18-1,Chase>field of vision is regressing.

353
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,670
<18-1,Chase>疼痛达到8级
<18-1,Chase>And he's reached an eight on the pain scale.

354
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,440
<19-1,Cameron>病情发展和joe的一样
<19-1,Cameron>The disease pattern is following the exact course as joe'S.

355
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,500
<19-2,Chase>在foreman身上更快
<19-2,Chase>Only it's moving much faster in foreman.

356
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,560
<19-3,House>好 这是不一致
<19-3,House>Good!It's an anomaly.

357
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,540
<19-3,House>不一致告诉我们很多,为何foreman更快, 有何区别?
<19-3,House>Anomals tell us things.Why is this moving faster in foreman?What's different?

358
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,360
<19-4,Cameron>可能是同一种病的不同表型?
<19-4,Cameron>Could be a different strain of the same disease?

359
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,180
<19-5,House>没错-我们寻找未知疾病是浪费时间
<19-5,House>Right--we were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease.

360
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,890
<19-5,House>应该找同一疾病的不同表型
<19-5,House>We should have been looking for a different strain of an unknown disease.

361
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,950
<19-6,Chase>joe是警察
<19-6,Chase>joe's a cop.

362
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,320
<19-6,Chase>他要健身, 他也许...
<19-6,Chase>He's into physical fitness,he could have had...

363
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,230
<19-6,Chase>免疫系统更强, 代谢更强
<19-6,Chase>a more powerful immune system,stronger metabolism.

364
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,690
<19-7,Cameron>Foreman是黑人
<19-7,Cameron>Foreman's black.

365
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,950
<19-7,Cameron>什么?
<19-7,Cameron>What?

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,960
<19-8,House>你掌握这个信息多久了?
<19-8,House>How long have you been sitting on this information?

367
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,420
<19-9,Cameron>狼疮, 痛风, 青光眼, 骨关节炎,高血压, 糖尿病
<19-9,Cameron>Lupus,gout,glaucoma,osteoarthritis,hypertension,diabetes,

368
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,110
<19-9,Cameron>说错了纠正我,这些病在黑人身上反应更大
<19-9,Cameron>stop me any time,they all affect black people more than whites.

369
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,290
<19-10,House>每种都查
<19-10,House>Check everything.

370
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,260
<19-10,House>细菌, 真菌, 毒素, 寄生虫
<19-10,House>Bacterials,fungals,toxins,parasites.

371
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,510
<19-10,House>任何一种有种族差异的病
<19-10,House>Look for anything with a documented racial disparity.

372
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,580
<19-10,House>等等
<19-10,House>Wait.

373
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,690
<19-11,Cameron>老鼠出现症状?
<19-11,Cameron>The rat's showing symptoms?

374
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,060
<19-11,Cameron>没
<19-11,Cameron>No.

375
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,150
<19-12,House>他完全健康
<19-12,House>He's completely healthy.

376
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,820
<19-12,House>也许这就是Foreman和警察的区别
<19-12,House>Maybe that's the difference between foreman and the cop.

377
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,220
<20-1,Cuddy>感觉怎么样?
<20-1,Cuddy>How are you feeling?

378
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,060
<20-2,Foreman>你来干什么?
<20-2,Foreman>Why are you here?

379
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,430
<20-3,Cuddy>你是朋友, 我应该来
<20-3,Cuddy>Because you're a friend. And I should be here.

380
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,520
<20-4,Foreman>对不起, House试图用我爸来操纵你
<20-4,Foreman>I'm sorry house used my dad to try and manipulate you.

381
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,400
<20-4,Foreman>你很坚定, 不会改变主意
<20-4,Foreman>You've got integrity,you aren't going to change your mind

382
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,790
<20-4,Foreman>面对我父亲也不会
<20-4,Foreman>just because you're confronted by my father.

383
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,010
<20-5,Cuddy>谢谢
<20-5,Cuddy>Thank you.

384
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,520
<20-6,Foreman>正如我不会原谅你
<20-6,Foreman>Just like I'm not going to forgive you

385
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,370
<20-6,Foreman>哪怕你来慰问我
<20-6,Foreman>just because you come by here and ask how I'm feeling.

386
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,240
<20-7,Cuddy>你知道我别无选择
<20-7,Cuddy>You know I've had no choice.

387
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,030
<20-8,Foreman>你有的选择!
<20-8,Foreman>Of course you had a choice!

388
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,780
<20-9,Cuddy>规则写的很清楚
<20-9,Cuddy>Regulations are clear.

389
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,620
<20-10,Foreman>不遵守规则受到的惩罚-
<20-10,Foreman>And the punishment for violating those regulations!

390
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,700
<20-10,Foreman>是死亡?
<20-10,Foreman>Is it death?

391
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,440
<20-10,Foreman>说实话, 我可以接受你被罚款, 被停职--
<20-10,Foreman>Because frankly,I'm okay if you get a fine,a suspension--

392
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,860
<20-10,Foreman>靠, 哪怕去坐几年牢,只要能救我的命!
<20-10,Foreman>hell,you can spend a couple of years in jail if it saves my life!

393
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,000
<20-11,House>你死的太快
<20-11,House>You're dying too fast.

394
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,110
<20-12,Foreman>完全同意
<20-12,Foreman>Couldn't agree more.

395
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,300
<20-13,House>嗨, cuddy
<20-13,House>Hey,cuddy.

396
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,150
<20-13,House>探病愉快否?
<20-13,House>Having a nice visit?

397
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,350
<20-14,Cuddy>这是什么?
<20-14,Cuddy>What's that?

398
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,820
<20-15,House>军团--肺炎军团菌
<20-15,House>Legionel--legionella pneumophila.

399
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,020
<20-16,Cuddy>带着这么一瓶病菌干什么?
<20-16,Cuddy>And why are you carrying a vial of it around with you?

400
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,950
<20-17,House>Foreman感染之前完全健康
<20-17,House>Foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection.

401
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,840
<20-17,House>警察不是, 他有军团菌病
<20-17,House>Our cop wasn'T.He had legionnaire's disease.

402
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,040
<20-17,House>我们治好他的军团菌病之前,警察的大脑一直是好的
<20-17,House>Our cop didn't turn into brain food until we cured the legionella.

403
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,770
<20-17,House>军团菌延缓了疾病过程
<20-17,House>Legionella slowed down the disease.

404
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,420
<20-18,Foreman>为什么会这样?
<20-18,Foreman>Why would that happen?

405
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,170
<20-19,House>不知道 只知道确实如此
<20-19,House>No idea.I just know that it did.

406
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,950
<20-20,Cuddy>你想让foreman感染?
<20-20,Cuddy>So you want to infect foreman?

407
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,440
<20-21,House>你要和CDC打小报告?
<20-21,House>Gonna tattle to the cdc?

408
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,920
<20-22,Foreman>药物不能治好我, 疾病可以?
<20-22,Foreman>Meds can't help me,but a disease can?

409
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,680
<20-22,Foreman>算了, 给我止疼,让我昏过去
<20-22,Foreman>Forget it!Just take the pain away and put me under.

410
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,040
<20-23,House>让你昏过去, 就不能监测疼痛
<20-23,House>If I put you under,I can't monitor your pain.

411
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,580
<20-23,House>不监测疼痛就不知道军团菌是否有效
<20-23,House>If I can't monitor your pain,I won't know if the legionella's working.

412
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,800
<20-24,Foreman>我不会授权你--
<20-24,Foreman>I'm not consenting to you giving me--

413
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,160
<20-24,Foreman>是什么?
<20-24,Foreman>what was that?

414
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,270
<20-25,House>可惜没有一团魔烟升起
<20-25,House>I wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something.

415
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,000
<20-25,House>那样有戏剧性
<20-25,House>Would've been much more dramatic.

416
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,810
<20-25,House>穿着拖鞋
<20-25,House>Keep your slippers on.

417
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,500
<20-25,House>小心扎了脚
<20-25,House>Wouldn't want you to cut your foot.

418
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,080
<21-1,Cameron>感觉好些了?
<21-1,Cameron>do you feel any better?

419
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,740
<21-2,Foreman>喘不过气, 头晕
<21-2,Foreman>I can't breathe.I'm dizzy.

420
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,610
<21-2,Foreman>我满耳朵都是肺部的杂音
<21-2,Foreman>And I can barely hear anything over the sounds of my lungs crackling.

421
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,410
<21-3,Cameron>就是军团菌病
<21-3,Cameron>That's the legionella.

422
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,030
<21-4,Foreman>你是从症状推断出?
<21-4,Foreman>You figure that out from the symptoms,

423
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,620
<21-4,Foreman>还是从地上的小瓶子?
<21-4,Foreman>or from the vial of stuff tossed in my room?

424
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,490
<21-5,Cameron>我只是想专业点,没必要冷嘲热讽
<21-5,Cameron>I'm trying to be professional here.There's no reason to be nasty.

425
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,210
<21-7,Cameron>- 我很痛苦,- house也是
<21-7,Cameron>I'm in pain.--So is house.

426
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,280
<21-8,Foreman>他开心的很
<21-8,Foreman>And he's a delight.

427
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,490
<21-9,Cameron>他不想杀死自己的同事
<21-9,Cameron>He doesn't try to kill his colleagues.

428
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,910
<21-9,Cameron>可以拿掉温度计了
<21-9,Cameron>You can remove the thermometer now.

429
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,170
<21-9,Cameron>降了整整一度
<21-9,Cameron>It's down almost a whole degree.

430
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,430
<21-9,Cameron>疼痛怎么样?
<21-9,Cameron>How's the pain?

431
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,680
<21-10,Foreman>好得很
<21-10,Foreman>Great.

432
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,340
<21-10,Foreman>好的那种
<21-10,Foreman>This is the good kind.

433
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,700
<21-11,Cameron>跟一小时前相比呢?
<21-11,Cameron>How bad is it compared to an hour ago?

434
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,630
<21-12,Foreman>没有恶化
<21-12,Foreman>No worse.

435
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,580
<22-1,Wilson>军团菌有用?
<22-1,Wilson>the legionella helping?

436
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,700
<22-2,House>是
<22-2,House>Yeah.

437
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,200
<22-3,Wilson>- 不错,- 还不够
<22-3,Wilson>Good.--Not great.

438
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,460
<22-4,House>没有治好什么, 只是延缓
<22-4,House>Didn't fix anything, it just slowed it down.

439
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,130
<22-4,House>只需给steve多点时间发病
<22-4,House>The point was to give steve a little more time to get sick.

440
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,660
<22-5,Wilson>如果他就是不病, 你怎么办?
<22-5,Wilson>What are you going to do if he never gets sick?

441
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,490
<22-6,House>聪明
<22-6,House>Brilliant.

442
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,790
<23-1,House>Cameron,什么病感染人, 但不感染鼠?
<23-1,House>Cameron,what type of illnesses affect humans,but not rats?

443
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,330
<23-2,Cameron>为什么问这个?
<23-2,Cameron>Why are you asking me that?

444
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,000
<23-3,House>我确信你12岁之前肯定想做兽医
<23-3,House>Because I'm sure that you spent the first 12 years of your life dreaming of ing a vet.

445
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,410
<23-3,House>老鼠没有病, Cameron也没有
<23-3,House>The rat is not getting sick.Cameron is not getting sick.

446
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,270
<23-4,Cameron>对不起
<23-4,Cameron>Sorry.

447
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,730
<23-5,House>没关系, 不是你的错
<23-5,House>It's okay,it's not your fault.

448
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,460
<23-5,House>按照推断,你没病是因为不通过血液传播
<23-5,House>Presumably,you're still healthy because whatever it is,is not bloodborne.

449
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,100
<23-5,House>Steve就说不过去,他做了所有foreman做过的
<23-5,House>Steve has no excuse.He did everything that foreman did.

450
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,390
<23-6,Chase>有些细菌不感染鼠类
<23-6,Chase>Some bacterial infections don't infect rats.

451
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,480
<23-7,Cameron>Foreman测过每一种感染大脑的细菌,全是阴性
<23-7,Cameron>Foreman tested negative for every bacterial infection that would affect his brain.

452
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,890
<23-8,House>哪种病菌他可能有, 但又查不出?
<23-8,House>And what infections could he be positive for,but test negative for?

453
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,200
<23-8,House>我们检测的其实是抗体
<23-8,House>When we test for infections,we look for antibodies.

454
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,360
<23-8,House>万一病人受了感染, 却没产生抗体?
<23-8,House>But what if the patient is infected,but has no antibodies?

455
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,490
<23-8,House>如果身体不对抗感染?
<23-8,House>What if the body is not fighting the infection?

456
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,560
<23-9,Cameron>为什么会--
<23-9,Cameron>Why would--

457
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,270
<23-10,House>我先问的
<23-10,House>I asked first.

458
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,400
<23-10,House>先解答是什么. 然后说为什么
<23-10,House>Let's start with the what.We'll deal with the why later.

459
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,530
<23-11,Chase>如果身体不能识别感染,检测就是阴性
<23-11,Chase>If the body doesn't recognize the infection,our tests come back negative,

460
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,730
<23-11,Chase>于是疾病不受阻挡地肆虐
<23-11,Chase>and the disease rampages through the body unstopped.

461
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,240
<23-12,House>正如警察和Foreman那样
<23-12,House>Exactly like the cop and exactly like foreman.

462
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,400
<23-12,House>如果病人又接受第二种感染?
<23-12,House>And what if the patient was then exposed to a second infection?

463
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,780
<23-12,House>比如军团菌?
<23-12,House>Like legionella?

464
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,420
<23-12,House>身体会认出它, 增加白细胞数量
<23-12,House>The body would recognize that infection,increase the white count,

465
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,930
<23-12,House>派出部队, 抵御入侵
<23-12,House>send in the troops to start fighting,

466
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,610
<23-12,House>结果最初的感染遇到了打击
<23-12,House>and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire.

467
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,700
<23-12,House>问题变成
<23-12,House>So the question becomes,

468
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,750
<23-12,House>什么东西感染人但不感染老鼠?
<23-12,House>what type of bacterial infection  affects humans but not rats,

469
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,930
<23-12,House>而且不易被身体识别?
<23-12,House>and the human body would be unlikely to recognize?

470
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,680
<24-1,House>答案是李氏杆菌
<24-1,House>The answer is listeria.

471
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,510
<24-1,House>准备上氨苄加庆大
<24-1,House>I'm starting you on ampengent.

472
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,160
<24-2,Foreman>你的理论依据是, 测试阴性而且-
<24-2,Foreman>So you're basing this theory on the test being negative

473
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,670
<24-2,Foreman>你的老鼠健康?
<24-2,Foreman>and your rat being healthy?

474
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,730
<24-3,House>还有军团菌对你有效
<24-3,House>And the fact that legionnaire's is helping you.

475
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,090
<24-4,Foreman>但你给我的药会中止这一切
<24-4,Foreman>But the medicine you want to give me will put an end to that.

476
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,270
<24-5,House>是
<24-5,House>Yeah.

477
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,650
<24-6,Foreman>如果不是李氏杆菌,却治好军团病
<24-6,Foreman>And if it's not listeria,all the gent will do is cure the legionnaire's disease

478
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,430
<24-6,Foreman>另一种病起死回生,会要我的命
<24-6,Foreman>and put whatever is killing me back into overdrive.

479
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,520
<24-7,House>问问题之前不要假定我错
<24-7,House>Stop asking me questions based on the premise that I'm wrong.

480
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,310
<24-7,House>抗生素在密封口里
<24-7,House>The antibiotics are in the airlock.

481
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,200
<24-8,Foreman>第一次活检没有结果
<24-8,Foreman>I think the first biopsy didn't give us the answer

482
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,930
<24-8,Foreman>因为你挖的不够深
<24-8,Foreman>because you didn't go deep enough.

483
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,300
<24-8,Foreman>我要做脑白质检查
<24-8,Foreman>I want you to do a white matter brain biopsy.

484
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,270
<24-9,House>是啊, 也不能怪你
<24-9,House>Absolutely.Don't blame you.

485
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,710
<24-9,House>对于一个有高级推理能力的人,世界太复杂了
<24-9,House>The world is such a complicated place if you've got higher reasoning skills.

486
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,750
<24-9,House>我也羡慕小动物和弱智儿童
<24-9,House>I'm often jealous of small animals and retarded children.

487
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,840
<24-9,House>用抗生素
<24-9,House>Take the antibiotics.

488
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,440
<24-10,Foreman>如果做得对, 损伤可以很小
<24-10,Foreman>There can be minimal damage if it's done right.

489
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,120
<24-10,Foreman>如果手术组在我告诉他们的地方钻孔
<24-10,Foreman>If the surgeons drill where I tell them to drill.

490
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,270
<24-11,House>稍有偏差 你下半辈子,会成为一个流着口水的白痴
<24-11,House>One slip--you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth.

491
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,070
<24-12,Foreman>我宁可残废也不想死
<24-12,Foreman>I'd rather be disabled than dead.

492
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,500
<24-13,House>当然,  我瘸的很性感
<24-13,House>Sure,I make it look oh so sexy.

493
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,590
<24-13,House>实际上没你想的那么风光
<24-13,House>It's actually not as glamorous as you might think.

494
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,600
<24-14,Foreman>活检会告诉我们哪里出问题
<24-14,Foreman>The biopsy will tell us for sure what's wrong.

495
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,660
<24-15,House>抗生素也可能
<24-15,House>The antibiotics could do the same thing.

496
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,030
<24-16,Foreman>可能, 不是能
<24-16,Foreman>Could,not will.

497
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,320
<24-17,House>我们试试再说
<24-17,House>We try it,we see.

498
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,500
<24-18,Foreman>抗生素会带给我疼痛
<24-18,Foreman>The antibiotics will bring back the pain.

499
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,640
<24-19,House>疼痛促使我们做出坏决定
<24-19,House>Pain makes us make bad decisions.

500
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,030
<24-19,House>惧怕疼痛...可以成为一个动机
<24-19,House>Fear of pain...is almost as big a motivator.

501
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,120
<24-19,House>我么还有时间
<24-19,House>Look,we still have time.

502
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,910
<24-19,House>如果需要做活检 我会的
<24-19,House>I will do that biopsy if I have to.

503
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,510
<24-19,House>不到万不得已
<24-19,House>But not a moment before.

504
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,040
<25-1,House>给foreman静注抗生素,他爸在哪里?
<25-1,House>Start foreman on I.V. Antibiotics.Where's his dad?

505
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,120
<25-2,Cameron>你儿子要死的时候你会在哪?
<25-2,Cameron>Where are you supposed to be when your son is dying?

506
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,990
<25-3,House>他没陪在身边
<25-3,House>He's not with him.

507
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,170
<25-4,Cameron>他在教堂
<25-4,Cameron>He's in the chapel.

508
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,090
<26-1,House>我为你儿子设定了一个新疗法
<26-1,House>I started your son on a new course of treatment.

509
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,520
<26-1,House>如果有效, 他会好起来
<26-1,House>If it works,he'll get better.

510
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,590
<26-1,House>如果无效, 不会好
<26-1,House>If it doesn't,he won'T.

511
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,340
<26-1,House>非但不会好
<26-1,House>While he's not getting better,

512
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,960
<26-1,House>还要经历巨大的疼痛
<26-1,House>he's going to experience so much pain

513
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,040
<26-1,House>我们只能用化学方法诱导昏迷
<26-1,House>that we'll have to put him in a chemically-induced coma

514
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,090
<26-1,House>直到我们想出办法
<26-1,House>while we figure out what to do next.

515
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,750
<26-2,Rodney>我儿子说你是个控制欲的混蛋
<26-2,Rodney>My son says you're a manipulative bastard.

516
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,310
<26-3,House>那是我的小名
<26-3,House>It's a pet name.

517
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,660
<26-3,House>我叫他dr. Bling.
<26-3,House>I call him dr. Bling.

518
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,830
<26-4,Rodney>我想你来是有原因的,你想要什么?
<26-4,Rodney>I assume you're here for a reason.What do you want from me?

519
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,010
<26-5,House>当你儿子陷入昏迷
<26-5,House>When your son is in a coma,

520
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,000
<26-5,House>只能由你为他做出医学上的决定
<26-5,House>you're the one who's going to have to make the medical decisions for him.

521
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
<26-6,Rodney>随便, 你说了算
<26-6,Rodney>Oh,whatever you decide is fine.

522
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,370
<26-7,House>你不管我做什么?
<26-7,House>You don't care what I do?

523
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,620
<26-8,Rodney>我不是医生, 我能知道什么?
<26-8,Rodney>I'm not a doctor.What do I know?

524
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,540
<26-8,Rodney>我只知道eric说过
<26-8,Rodney>Except what eric tells me.

525
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,610
<26-8,Rodney>他说你是他共事过的最好的医生
<26-8,Rodney>He says you're the best doctor he's ever worked with.

526
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,640
<27-1,Foreman>帮我一个忙
<27-1,Foreman>I need your help.

527
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,920
<27-2,Cameron>对你的疼痛我无能为力
<27-2,Cameron>There's nothing I can give you for the pain.

528
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,550
<27-3,Foreman>我想昏过去
<27-3,Foreman>I want to be put out.

529
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,650
<27-4,Cameron>5分钟后会有护士来
<27-4,Cameron>I can have a nurse in here in five minutes.

530
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,200
<27-1,Foreman>不, 帮我一个忙
<27-1,Foreman>No.Want some help.

531
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,140
<27-5,Foreman>我也许醒不过来
<27-5,Foreman>I might not come back.

532
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,810
<27-5,Foreman>我没立遗嘱
<27-5,Foreman>I've never done a will.

533
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,520
<27-6,Cameron>我给你找律师
<27-6,Cameron>I'll call a lawyer for you.

534
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,530
<27-7,Foreman>我要你做我的患者代理人
<27-7,Foreman>I want you to be my medical proxy.

535
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,390
<27-7,Foreman>令我对你不忿的那些方面--
<27-7,Foreman>All the things that piss me off about you in house's office--

536
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,660
<27-7,Foreman>你的感情化, 过于关爱, 过于谨慎--
<27-7,Foreman>you're too emotional,too caring,too cautious--

537
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,470
<27-7,Foreman>在这里都是好事
<27-7,Foreman>they're all good things on this floor.

538
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,270
<27-8,Cameron>- 你爸爸在--,- 不
<27-8,Cameron>- Your dad is,-no.

539
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,950
<27-10,Cameron>- 他关心你,- 你也是
<27-10,Cameron>- He cares about you.-,-So do you.

540
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,830
<27-11,Foreman>我不能
<27-11,Foreman>I can't do this.

541
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,350
<27-13,Foreman>我们期待家属为他们的家人做出决定
<27-13,Foreman>We expect family members to make decisions about their loved ones

542
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,990
<27-13,Foreman>仅凭10分钟的介绍
<27-13,Foreman>after a ten-minute briefing

543
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,240
<27-13,Foreman>却忽视我们从医数年的经验
<27-13,Foreman>that we're agonizing over even with years of medical experience.

544
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,910
<27-14,Cameron>这是我文章里的
<27-14,Cameron>That's from my article.

545
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,240
<27-15,Foreman>对不起, allison
<27-15,Foreman>I'm sorry,allison.

546
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,660
<27-15,Foreman>我不该偷你的论文,不该让你感染
<27-15,Foreman>I shouldn't have stolen your article.I shouldn't have exposed you.

547
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,930
<27-15,Foreman>你是朋友
<27-15,Foreman>You were a friend.

548
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,070
<27-15,Foreman>我想知道我们没事了
<27-15,Foreman>I need to know that we're okay.

549
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,180
<27-15,Foreman>不
<27-15,Foreman>No.

550
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,910
<27-16,Cameron>我会做你的代理人,但我们还没完
<27-16,Cameron>I'll be your proxy,but we're not okay.

551
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,770
<27-16,Cameron>你怕你要死了,所以你想把一切做对
<27-16,Cameron>You're scared you're dying.And that's the only reason you want to set things right.

552
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,650
<27-16,Cameron>我们会先治好你
<27-16,Cameron>We're going to get you better first,

553
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:09,650
<27-16,Cameron>然后, 如果你想道歉, 我就在这里
<27-16,Cameron>and then, if you still want to apologize,I'll be around.

554
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,850
<27-16,Cameron>我去叫律师
<27-16,Cameron>I'll call that lawyer.

555
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,150
<27-17,House>有进展么?
<27-17,House>Any improvement?

556
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,910
<27-18,Cameron>目前来看
<27-18,Cameron>Well,as far as we can tell,

557
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,140
<27-18,Cameron>抗生素只是治疗了军团菌
<27-18,Cameron>the only thing the antibiotics are treating is the legionella.

558
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,530
<27-18,Cameron>我们要另想主意了
<27-18,Cameron>I think we need to consider alternate theories.

559
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,680
<27-19,House>例如?
<27-19,House>Like what?

560
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,320
<27-20,Cameron>我们做个活检--
<27-20,Cameron>We do the biopsy.We--

561
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,620
<27-21,House>再试一段抗生素
<27-21,House>give the antibiotics more time.

562
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,510
<27-22,Cameron>没时间了,疼痛几乎无法忍受
<27-22,Cameron>There is no more time.The pain is almost unbearable already.

563
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,280
<27-23,House>几乎无法忍受, 又不是几乎要死
<27-23,House>So he's almost in unbearable pain.He's not almost dead.

564
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,530
<27-23,House>这说明我们还有时间
<27-23,House>Which means we have more time.

565
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,550
<27-23,House>Foreman先生?
<27-23,House>Mr. Foreman?

566
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,480
<28-1,Chase>我们要让你儿子昏迷
<28-1,Chase>We need to put your son in a coma.

567
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,300
<28-1,Chase>你要在场
<28-1,Chase>You should be there.

568
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,040
<28-2,Rodney>这是医院的程序?
<28-2,Rodney>It's a medical procedure,right?

569
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,040
<28-2,Rodney>是
<28-2,Rodney>Yeah.

570
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,150
<28-3,Chase>如果我们让他昏迷, 又不能解决
<28-3,Chase>But once we put him out,if--if we don't solve this,

571
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,040
<28-3,Chase>他不会醒来
<28-3,Chase>he won't wake up.

572
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,370
<28-4,Rodney>我该说什么?
<28-4,Rodney>What should I say?

573
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,170
<28-4,Rodney>跟他说些宽心的话?
<28-4,Rodney>Should I talk to him like it's going to be...okay?

574
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,850
<28-4,Rodney>还是跟他道别?
<28-4,Rodney>Or should I be saying good-bye?

575
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,730
<28-4,Rodney>我想知道大家都是怎么说--
<28-4,Rodney>I need to know what people say when--

576
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,250
<28-5,Chase>只需说你爱他
<28-5,Chase>just tell him you love him.

<29-4,Foreman>你不知道
<29-4,Foreman>You don't know that.

581

<29-5,Rodney>我知道
<29-5,Rodney>I know.

582
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,350
<29-6,Foreman>你不知道

583
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,680
<29-7,Rodney>我不想失去你
<29-7,Rodney>I don't want to miss you.

586
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,940

587
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,870
<29-8,Foreman>- 可以开始了么?,- 当然
<29-8,Foreman>Can we do this now?--Yeah,of course.

588
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,200
<29-9,Cameron>我接受你的道歉
<29-9,Cameron>I accept your apology.

589
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,440
<30-1,Wilson>你怎么不在foreman身边?
<30-1,Wilson>Why weren't you with foreman?

590
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,710
<30-2,House>我在地下室徘徊, 你嘲笑我
<30-2,House>I hang out in the basement,you rag on me.

591
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,500
<30-2,House>我呆在办公室, 你嘲笑我
<30-2,House>I stay in my office,you rag on me.

592
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,520
<30-2,House>你就是不能消停
<30-2,House>Honkey just can't buy a break.

593
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,760
<30-3,Wilson>做活检
<30-3,Wilson>Do the biopsy.

594
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,880
<30-4,House>根据警察的病情发展,我认为他还有4个小时--
<30-4,House>Based on the cop's progression,I figure he's got about another four hours--

595
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,150
<30-5,Wilson>你认为?
<30-5,Wilson>you figure?

596
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,160
<30-5,Wilson>你是在玩俄罗斯轮盘赌,枪却顶在他头上
<30-5,Wilson>You're playing russian roulette,but the gun's pointed at him.

597
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,940
<30-6,House>不, 切开他的脑袋才是危险的
<30-6,House>No,cutting open his head is what's dangerous.

598
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,510
<30-7,Wilson>哦, 危险,人们会怎么想?
<30-7,Wilson>Oh,it's dangerous.Well,what would people think?

599
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,410
<30-7,Wilson>你不看病人是因为, 一旦你认识他们
<30-7,Wilson>The reason you don't see patients is because if you know them,

600
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,930
<30-7,Wilson>- 你就恶言恶语,- 我认识你
<30-7,Wilson>you'll give a crap about them. --I know you.

601
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,410
<30-9,Wilson>如果你恶言恶语, 就不会胡来
<30-9,Wilson>If you give a crap, you stop making outrageous calls.

602
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,190
<30-9,Wilson>如果是别的病人
<30-9,Wilson>If this was any other patient,

603
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,740
<30-9,Wilson>你才不在乎什么风险,早就切开他们的脑袋
<30-9,Wilson>you'd have damned the risk and cut their head open a long time ago.

604
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,110
<30-10,Cameron>他昏迷了, 但是脑电波显示还在疼痛
<30-10,Cameron>He's out. The eeg shows he's still in pain.

605
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,230
<30-10,Cameron>抗生素试够了, 我们做大脑活检
<30-10,Cameron>The antibiotics have had more than enough time.We're doing the brain biopsy.

606
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,200
<30-11,House>除非在接下来的3小时内,我们想不出更好的主意
<30-11,House>Not unless you people can't come up with something clever in the next three hours.

607
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,950
<30-12,Cameron>现在就做
<30-12,Cameron>Now.We're doing it now.

608
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,270
<30-13,House>- 谁让你当上老板了?,- Foreman
<30-13,House>Who died and made you boss?--Foreman.

609
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,230
<31-1,Cuddy>合法的
<31-1,Cuddy>It's legal.

610
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,970
<31-2,House>他神志不清
<31-2,House>he's out of his mind.

611
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,910
<31-2,House>昨天他还嘲笑别人头上的洞
<31-2,House>Yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guy's head.

612
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,540
<31-3,Cuddy>让律师来寻找破绽,与此同时, Cameron说了算
<31-3,Cuddy>Then hire a lawyer and challenge it.In the meantime,cameron's in charge.

613
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,420
<31-4,Rodney>他为什么要签这个?
<31-4,Rodney>Why would he sign that?

614
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,420
<31-5,Cameron>并不针对谁, Foreman先生
<31-5,Cameron>It's nothing personal,mr. Foreman.

615
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,990
<31-6,Rodney>我儿子不信任我, 怎么会不针对谁?
<31-6,Rodney>My son doesn't trust me.How exactly is that not personal?

616
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,130
<31-7,Cameron>我很遗憾
<31-7,Cameron>I'm sorry.

617
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,540
<31-7,Cameron>你遗憾?
<31-7,Cameron>You're sorry?

618
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,480
<31-8,House>你说的是他的儿子
<31-8,House>You're talking about this man's son.

619
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,760
<31-8,House>- 你否决他的参与,- 闭嘴吧, house.
<31-8,House>You're denying him the right to be a part of--oh,shut up,house.

620
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,840
<31-9,Cuddy>你想做活检就做
<31-9,Cuddy>If you want to do the biopsy,do the biopsy.

621
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,550
<31-9,Cuddy>如果house要阻挠就告诉我,我来摆平他
<31-9,Cuddy>If house tries to interfere,let me know and I will take care of it.

622
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,810
<31-10,Cameron>是啊, 你真威风
<31-10,Cameron>Yeah.You're a hero.

623
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,670
<31-10,Cameron>如果不是你, 我们现在应该,在切死尸的头, 而不是foreman
<31-10,Cameron>If it wasn't for you,we'd be cutting into a dead guy's head instead of foreman'S.

624
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,250
<31-10,Cameron>对不起
<31-10,Cameron>Sorry.

625
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,160
<32-1,House>谢谢

626
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,230
<32-2,Cameron>- 够生猛!,- 粗鲁而且无必要
<32-2,Cameron>That was great!--It was rude and unnecessary.

<32-3,House>是啊
<32-3,House>Yeah.

628
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,330
<32-4,Cameron>走开
<32-4,Cameron>Go away.

629
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,720
<32-5,House>给我点时间
<32-5,House>Give me time.

630
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,820
<32-6,Cameron>- 没时间了,- 1小时
<32-6,Cameron>We're out of time.--An hour.

631
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,640
<32-8,Cameron>懂不懂什么叫没时间?
<32-8,Cameron>What does "out of time" mean?

632
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,490
<32-9,House>他的氧饱和度是94
<32-9,House>His o2 stats are 94 right now.

633
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,520
<32-9,House>肺是90, 发生致命心律失常,的危险不会增加
<32-9,House>His lungs are about 90.The danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.

634
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,500
<32-10,Cameron>那又如何? 等待全无意义
<32-10,Cameron>So what?There's no point in waiting.

635
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,930
<32-11,House>你是对的, 我们应该切尸体的头
<32-11,House>You were right.We should be cutting into a corpse's head.

636
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,710
<32-12,Cameron>是应该, 可尸体在CDC手里
<32-12,Cameron>Yeah,we should be,except the cdc's got the cop's body--

637
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,570
<32-13,House>应该有其它尸体
<32-13,House>there's got to be other bodies.

638
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,790
<32-14,Cameron>你觉得这病还杀死其他人?
<32-14,Cameron>You think this thing has killed other people?

639
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,390
<32-14,Cameron>不
<32-14,Cameron>No.

640
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,100
<32-15,House>他的公寓是个垃圾堆
<32-15,House>That apartment was a dump.

641
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,780
<32-15,House>steve mcqueen没得病,不代表其它小动物没得
<32-15,House>Just because steve mcqueen didn't get sick doesn't mean some other vermin didn'T.

642
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,480
<32-15,House>给我一小时, 我回去找个死去的动物
<32-15,House>You give me an hour.I go back there,I find a dead animal,

<32-15,House>我切开"它"的头,保住Foreman的
<32-15,House>I cut its head open instead of foreman'S.

644

<32-16,Cameron>Foreman在吸纯氧
<32-16,Cameron>Foreman's already on 100% oxygen.

645
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,600
<32-16,Cameron>氧饱和过90, 我就不能再等
<32-16,Cameron>Once his o2 seds hit 90,I can't wait any longer.

646
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,400
<32-16,Cameron>你的防护服呢?
<32-16,Cameron>Where's your suit?

647
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,020
<32-17,House>你我总有一人能找出答案
<32-17,House>Either you'll find the answer,or I'll find the answer.

648
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,850
<32-17,House>无所谓
<32-17,House>Doesn't matter.

649

<34-2,House>太好了
<34-2,House>Great.

654
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,770
<34-3,Cameron>多快能抓到?
<34-3,Cameron>How fast can you get it in here?

655
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,110
<34-4,House>大约30秒后
<34-4,House>I'll know in about 30 seconds.

<34-5,Cameron>你最好抓到 它, 手术组已经到位
<34-5,Cameron>You better have the bird.The surgical team's in place.

657
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,530
<34-6,House>我的错
<34-6,House>I screwed up.

658
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,230
<34-7,Cameron>你抓不到一只瞎鸟?
<34-7,Cameron>How can you not capture a blind bird?

659
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,310
<34-8,House>不是这个意思
<34-8,House>That's not what I meant.

660
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,520
<34-8,House>我上次来的时候犯错了
<34-8,House>I screwed up the first time through this place.

661
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,970
<34-9,Cameron>Foreman把去过的地点告诉你
<34-9,Cameron>Foreman told you everywhere he went.

662
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,530
<34-10,House>不在地点, 在于时间
<34-10,House>It's not where,it's when.

663

<34-10,House>他是午后来的
<34-10,House>He came here early afternoon.

<34-10,House>我和steve来晚了两小时,你来早了6小时
<34-10,House>Me and steve came through two hours too late.You were six hours early.

665
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,530
<34-10,House>是水, 灌溉系统泵入--
<34-10,House>It's the water.The irrigation system only pumps--

<34-11,Cameron>house, 我查过水, 水没问题
<34-11,Cameron>house,I tested the water.The water's clean.

<34-11,Cameron>House.
<34-11,Cameron>House.

668
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,950
<34-12,House>没找对水
<34-12,House>We tested the wrong water.

669
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,880
<34-12,House>他偷有线电视, 偷肥料, 还偷水
<34-12,House>He stole cable,he stole fertilizer,and he stole water.

670

<34-12,House>漂满了阿米巴虫
<34-12,House>It's riddled with naegleria.

671

<34-13,Cameron>我知道

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,730
<34-14,House>你已经做了活检
<34-14,House>You already did the biopsy.

673
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,200
<34-15,Cameron>我以为没得选择
<34-15,Cameron>I thought I had no choice.

674

<35-2,Cameron>He has primary amebic meningoencephalitis.

676
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:09,370
<35-2,Cameron>一种寄生虫,通过鼻腔迁移到大脑
<35-2,Cameron>It's a parasite that goes through the nose and migrates into the brain,

677
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,310
<35-2,Cameron>以脑细胞为食
<35-2,Cameron>where it feeds on brain cells.

678
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,900
<35-2,Cameron>军团菌攻击这种寄生虫,所以延缓了疾病
