1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,710
<51-11,House>他根本没病
<51-11,House>He is not sick.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,440
<1-1,Cuddy>莱利医生呕吐不止  很明显没法讲课
<1-1,Cuddy>Dr. Riley is throwing up. He obviously can't lecture.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,550
<1-2,House>你亲眼看见他吐了  还是他说的
<1-2,House>You witnessed the spew? Or you just have his word for it?

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,230
<1-2,House>我感觉自己得了淋病
<1-2,House>I think I'm coming down with a little bit of the clap.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,600
<1-2,House>可能得回家休息几天
<1-2,House>I may have to go home for a few days.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,570
<1-3,Cuddy>莱利医生从没对我撒过谎
<1-3,Cuddy>Dr. Riley doesn't have a history of lying to me.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,220
<1-4,House>你说过这是他今年第五次不上课了
<1-4,House>You said this is the fifth time he's missed a class this year.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,010
<1-4,House>要么他是病入膏肓  要么就是撒谎
<1-4,House>Either he's dying or he's lying.

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,780
<1-5,Cuddy>我免你两个小时的门诊
<1-5,Cuddy>I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,460
<1-6,House>好  我让卡梅隆去
<1-6,House>Fine. I'll have Cameron do it.

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,960
<1-6,House>她最喜欢传道授业解惑
<1-6,House>She loves inspiring the inspired.

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,730
<1-8,House>-得你去  -为啥老是我
<1-8,House>- You'll do it. - Why is it always me?

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,440
<1-9,Cuddy>因为你人缘差
<1-9,Cuddy>Because the world hates you.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,570
<1-9,Cuddy>或者因为这是节诊断课
<1-9,Cuddy>Or because it's a class on diagnostics.

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,070
<1-9,Cuddy>看哪个答案更满足你的自恋心理
<1-9,Cuddy>Pick whichever reason feeds your narcissism better.

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,150
<1-10,House>老子不干
<1-10,House>I'm not doing it.

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,400
<1-10,House>你该拦住我  重新谈判的
<1-10,House>You're supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,960
<1-11,Cuddy>而你该继续往前走
<1-11,Cuddy>And you were supposed to keep on walking.

19
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,740
<1-11,Cuddy>抱歉  咱俩都没按规矩来  再来
<1-11,Cuddy>Sorry. Guess we both screwed up. Go on. Do it again.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,880
<1-12,House>我去上课  免我四小时的门诊
<1-12,House>I'll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,600
<1-13,Cuddy>两小时  我知道你宁愿花几小时
<1-13,Cuddy>Two. I know you'd rather spend a couple of hours

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,990
<1-13,Cuddy>听自己说话  也不愿在这儿问诊
<1-13,Cuddy>listening to yourself than listening to patients.

23
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,230
<1-13,Cuddy>20分钟后开课
<1-13,Cuddy>Class starts in 20 minutes.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,750
<1-14,Brenda>豪斯医生  有病人找你
<1-14,Brenda>Dr. House, there's a patient.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,240
<1-15,House>我得要走了  有事儿找卡迪
<1-15,House>I'm outta here. Take it up with Cuddy.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,200
<1-15,House>格雷戈
<1-15,House>Greg.

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,100
<1-17,House>史黛西
<1-17,House>Hi, Stacy.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,420
<1-18,Stacy>你好吗
<1-18,Stacy>How ya doin'?

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,710
<1-19,House>你问我好吗
<1-19,House>How am I doing?

30
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,040
<1-19,House>过去这五年就好像...
<1-19,House>The last five years have been like--

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,410
<1-19,House>你有没看过《美女也疯狂》[成人影片]
<1-19,House>You ever see those Girls Gone Wild videos?

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,400
<1-20,Stacy>你就那样活着  还是你就靠看那片活着
<1-20,Stacy>Your life's been like that? Or your life's been spent watching them?

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,150
<1-20,Stacy>我很想你
<1-20,Stacy>I have missed you.

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,520
<1-21,House>所以你才来的吗
<1-21,House>Is that why you're here?

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,610
<1-22,Stacy>我是来找你帮忙的
<1-22,Stacy>I need your help.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,480
<1-23,House>-这是谁的病历  -我丈夫的
<1-23,House>- Who am I looking at? - My husband.

37
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,790
<1-25,House>病人感觉腹痛  并伴有间歇性晕眩
<1-25,House>Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells.

38
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,810
<1-25,House>没有肿瘤  也不是血管炎
<1-25,House>No sign of tumors, no vasculitis.

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,800
<1-25,House>可能是消化不良
<1-25,House>Could be indigestion.

40
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,740
<1-25,House>或是肾结石  小小一颗就会很痛苦
<1-25,House>Or maybe a kidney stone. Little one can pack a lot of wallop.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,600
<1-26,Stacy>你以为我不会结婚  是吗
<1-26,Stacy>Did you think I wasn't going to get married?

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,360
<1-27,House>至少不是跟身体这么差的
<1-27,House>Not to someone so poorly endowed.

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,340
<1-27,House>这家伙胰脏太烂了
<1-27,House>This guy's pancreas is pathetic.

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,700
<1-28,Stacy>不是肾结石  也不是消化不良
<1-28,Stacy>There is no kidney stone, no indigestion.

45
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,110
<1-28,Stacy>换了三家医院五个医生都查不出病因
<1-28,Stacy>Three hospitals, five doctors-- Not one of them found anything.

46
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,880
<1-29,House>也许本来就没什么病
<1-29,House>Maybe there's nothing to be found.

47
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,090
<1-30,Stacy>是啊  就好比你会突然信任医生
<1-30,Stacy>Right. You suddenly trust doctors,

48
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,220
<1-30,Stacy>喜欢宠物和雨中散步
<1-30,Stacy>love puppies and long walks in the rain.

49
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,840
<1-31,House>我的腿没法散步
<1-31,House>Walks are out.

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,940
<1-32,Stacy>相处久了  对方有不对劲自然知道
<1-32,Stacy>I was around you long enough to know when something's not right.

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,780
<1-32,Stacy>马克性情大变  行为古怪没有连贯性
<1-32,Stacy>Mark's had personality changes. He's acting strange, disconnected.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,890
<1-33,House>有意思
<1-33,House>Interesting.

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,360
<1-33,House>就是说不是神经问题
<1-33,House>Means there's either a neurological component,

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,650
<1-33,House>就是有了外遇
<1-33,House>or he's having an affair.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,850
<1-34,Stacy>没有外遇  什么都没有  他就是病了
<1-34,Stacy>No affair. No nothing. He's sick.

56
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,180
<1-34,Stacy>我知道你不太忙  你躲工作跟躲瘟疫似的
<1-34,Stacy>I know you're not too busy. You avoid work like the plague.

57
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,590
<1-34,Stacy>除非真有瘟疫
<1-34,Stacy>Unless it actually is the plague.

58
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,570
<1-34,Stacy>-我请你帮忙  -我是不太忙
<1-34,Stacy>- I'm asking you a favor. - I'm not too busy.

59
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,210
<1-35,House>但不确定想不想救他
<1-35,House>But I'm not sure I want him to live.

60
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,370
<1-35,House>很高兴再见到你
<1-35,House>It's good seeing you again.

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,500
<2-1,House>有三个人来看门诊
<2-1,House>Three guys walk into a clinic.

62
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,270
<2-1,House>都说腿疼  会是什么病
<2-1,House>Their legs hurt. What's wrong with them?

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,710
<2-1,House>你知道我不待见你的  是吧
<2-1,House>I'm not gonna like you, am I?

64
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,250
<2-2,Keen>腿疼最可能的原因就是肌肉劳损
<2-2,Keen>The most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain.

65
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,790
<2-2,Keen>热敷并放松疼痛部位
<2-2,Keen>Apply heat and rest affected areas.

66
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,510
<2-2,Keen>统计学上说  你说得对  很好
<2-2,Keen>Statistically, you're right. Very good.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,650
<2-3,House>以我的经验
<2-3,House>My experience,

68
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,820
<2-3,House>半数以上腿疼都是骨骼肌系统问题
<2-3,House>over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal,

69
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,990
<2-3,House>一般是由于过度锻炼引起的
<2-3,House>generally from excessive exercise,

70
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,390
<2-3,House>12%是因怀孕导致静脉曲张而引起的
<2-3,House>Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy,

71
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,100
<2-3,House>其余大部分都是交通事故
<2-3,House>and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents.

72
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,760
<2-3,House>三个人  就有六条退
<2-3,House>I said three people. That's six legs.

73
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,750
<2-3,House>所以其中三条是运动过度  两条是交通意外
<2-3,House>So you've got three hurt jogging, two in collisions,

74
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,250
<2-3,House>还有一条是因为怀孕
<2-3,House>and one of the legs is pregnant.

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,460
<2-4,Caring>疼痛发生时  他们都在干什么
<2-4,Caring>What were they doing when pain presented?

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,310
<2-4,Caring>-我不知道  -你没问病史吗
<2-4,Caring>- I have no idea. - You didn't ask? You didn't take a history?

77
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,130
<2-4,Caring>当然  但所知的仅限于病人自述
<2-4,Caring>Of course. But all that told us is what they said happened.

78
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,730
<2-4,Caring>病人甲  农夫  说他当时正在修栅栏
<2-4,Caring>Person "A", farmer, says he was fixing a fence.

79
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,430
<2-4,Caring>突然脚踝疼痛  肌肉失去控制
<2-4,Caring>Tightness in the ankle, loss of muscle control.

80
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,990
<2-4,Caring>病人乙   排球运动员
<2-4,Caring>Person "B", volleyball practice.

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,860
<2-4,Caring>教练认为是肌肉拉伤
<2-4,Caring>Coach figured it was a pulled muscle.

82
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,360
<2-4,Caring>病人丙  卡门·伊莱克特拉正在打高尔夫
<2-4,Caring>And "C", we've got Carmen Electra golfing.

83
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,220
<3-1,Keen>-好球  -你治过《海滩护卫队》里的妞吗
<3-1,Keen>- Yes! - Whoa. You treated the Baywatch chick?

84
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,500
<3-1,Keen>应该说是《海滩护卫队》的演员  没
<3-1,Keen>The Baywatch thespian. And no.

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,530
<3-2,House>我得假设每个病人的身份
<3-2,House>I gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients,

86
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,830
<3-2,House>我厌倦了总拿中年男子举例
<3-2,House>and I got tired of using the middle-aged man.

87
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,240
<3-2,House>卡门看来是个不错的选择
<3-2,House>Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative.

88
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,550
<3-2,House>而且  她高尔夫也打得不错
<3-2,House>Also, she's apparently quite the golfer.

89
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,810
<3-2,House>在接下来两小时内  三人中的一个...
<3-2,House>In less than two hours, one of these three...

90
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,260
<3-2,House>将被扔出医院
<3-2,House>will be tossed out of the hospital

91
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,580
<3-2,House>因为他是装病来骗麻醉剂的
<3-2,House>because they were faking it to score narcotics,

92
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,750
<3-2,House>一人将生命垂危
<3-2,House>and one will be very close to death.

93
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,790
<3-2,House>猜得出是谁吗
<3-2,House>Any guesses on which is which?

94
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,460
<3-2,House>好吧  先从农夫讲起
<3-2,House>Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,340
<4-1,House>你徒步走到栅栏的吗  有多远
<4-1,House>Did you hike to the fence, and how far?

96
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,090
<4-2,Farmer>是的  离我的农庄差不多半英里
<4-2,Farmer>Yes. It's about a half a mile from my farmhouse.

97
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,940
<4-3,House>哪儿疼
<4-3,House>Where is the pain localized?

98
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,290
<4-4,Farmer>从脚踝开始  往上都疼
<4-4,Farmer>It started just above my ankle, and it's radiating up.

99
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,860
<4-5,House>那么  我们该先做什么
<4-5,House>So, what should we do first?

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,980
<4-6,Keen>问家族病史
<4-6,Keen>Family history?

101
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,840
<4-7,House>腿疼的病史  这可不多
<4-7,House>Indicative of leg pain? That's a very short list.

102
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,780
<4-7,House>家族中有无骨癌
<4-7,House>Any history of bone cancer,

103
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,400
<4-7,House>成骨不全或多发性骨髓瘤病史
<4-7,House>osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma?

104
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,220
<4-8,Caring>可能是血液问题
<4-8,Caring>Could be a blood issue.

105
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,890
<4-8,Caring>应做全血球计数和血浆D二聚体检测
<4-8,Caring>We should run a C.B.C. and a D-Dimer.

106
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,450
<4-9,Rebellious>再做个核磁共振
<4-9,Rebellious>And get an M.R.I.

107
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,160
<4-10,Caring>核磁共振还是PET扫描
<4-10,Caring>M.R.I. or a PET scan?

108
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,700
<4-11,Rebellious>要是血管的问题  最好...
<4-11,Rebellious>If the problem's vascular, he's better off--

109
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,910
<4-12,House>抱歉  谢谢参与
<4-12,House>Sorry. Thanks for playin'.

110
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,350
<4-12,House>病人已死  你们害死的
<4-12,House>Patient's dead. You killed him.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,630
<4-13,Keen>根本没时间做检测  我们也无能为力
<4-13,Keen>We had no time to run any tests. There was nothing we could do.

112
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,400
<4-14,House>至少有时间看看病人的腿
<4-14,House>You had time to look at the leg.

113
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,560
<5-1,Caring>不是说先从农夫讲起吗
<5-1,Caring>I thought we were starting with the farmer's case first.

114
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,410
<5-2,House>没错  不过要看腿的话...
<5-2,House>We are. But if we're gonna look at a leg--

115
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,430
<5-2,House>你得脱了裤子
<5-2,House>I need you to take off your pants.

116
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,930
<5-2,House>有创伤
<5-2,House>Puncture.

117
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,600
<7-1,Caring>-蛇咬的  -我也会这么猜
<7-1,Caring>- Snakebite. - That would be my guess.

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,300
<7-2,House>农夫不知道自己被蛇咬吗
<7-2,House>Farmer didn't know he'd been bitten by a snake?

119
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,090
<7-3,Rebellious>他是这么说的
<7-3,Rebellious>That's what he said.

120
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,880
<7-4,House>突感刺痛  高茎草地  什么都没看见
<7-4,House>Sudden shooting pain, tall grass. Never saw a thing.

121
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,110
<7-5,Keen>-是哪种蛇  -你想让我
<7-5,Keen>- What kind of snake? - You want me to tell you

122
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,420
<7-6,House>单凭腿上的创口就说出是哪种蛇吗
<7-6,House>what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?

123
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,930
<7-7,Keen>不知道是哪种蛇的话
<7-7,Keen>How are we to know what kind of antivenom to use

124
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,620
<7-7,Keen>怎么能确定用哪种抗蛇毒血清
<7-7,Keen>if we don't know what kind of snake it is?

125
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,630
<7-8,House>会有人去找答案的
<7-8,House>Oh, there are people to find those things out.

126
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,390
<8-1,Chase>难道不该等动物保护协会之类的吗
<8-1,Chase>Shouldn't we wait for the Humane Society or something?

127
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,460
<8-2,Foreman>那人可能仅剩几小时可活了
<8-2,Foreman>Guy might only have a couple of hours.

128
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,370
<8-3,House>等动物保护协会派人来的同时
<8-3,House>And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up,

129
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,000
<8-3,House>不如先去看看排球运动员的情况
<8-3,House>what say we check in on the volleyball player.

130
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,170
<8-3,House>你有肌腱炎
<8-3,House>You have tendinitis.

131
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,980
<8-3,House>这人多大年纪
<8-3,House>How old is this person?

132
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,550
<8-3,House>我是说
<8-3,House>I mean,

133
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,250
<10-1,Caring>不会真有40岁中年男人混在女排队里的吧
<10-1,Caring>it's not really a 40-year-old man on a girls' volleyball team, right?

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,050
<10-2,House>看的是腿  腿就是腿
<10-2,House>It's a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.

135
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,380
<10-3,Caring>我只是担心...
<10-3,Caring>Well, I was just worried that--

136
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,530
<10-4,House>她要是再年轻点  你是否会加倍担心
<10-4,House>Would you worry about her more if she was younger?

137
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,640
<10-5,Keen>当然我们该关心所有病人
<10-5,Keen>Obviously, we should care about all our patients,

138
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,970
<10-5,Keen>不管多大年纪...
<10-5,Keen>no matter what age--

139
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,270
<10-6,House>对  我看到你盯着卡门那小样了
<10-6,House>Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen.

140
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,940
<10-6,House>她是我的  离她远点
<10-6,House>She's mine. Stay away.

141
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,550
<10-6,House>-你会给你妈妈动手术吗  -当然不
<10-6,House>- Would you operate on your mother? - Of course not.

142
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,820
<10-7,Caring>我肯定会太紧张  不能客观处理
<10-7,Caring>I'd be too nervous. Couldn't be objective.

143
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,560
<10-8,House>那为什么都急于视患者如家人般对待
<10-8,House>Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they're family?

144
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,370
<10-8,House>实际的病人16岁
<10-8,House>The actual patient is 16.

145
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,170
<10-8,House>医生关心过多  就会这样
<10-8,House>Here's what happens when doctors care too much.

146
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,480
<11-1,Cameron>告诉我你所有的情况
<11-1,Cameron>I need to know everything about you.

147
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,520
<11-1,Cameron>我追溯了其家族三代
<11-1,Cameron>I went back three generations.

148
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,830
<11-1,Cameron>无癌症  帕金森或其他病变史
<11-1,Cameron>No history of cancer, Parkinson's or any other degenerative condition.

149
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,160
<12-1,Cameron>但她们学校有个男孩
<12-1,Cameron>But there's this boy at school,

150
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,890
<12-1,Cameron>是校排球队的
<12-1,Cameron>and he's on the boys' volleyball team.

151
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,120
<12-1,Cameron>在派对上俩人好上了  从此再没联系过她
<12-1,Cameron>They made out at a party, and now he won't call her back.

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,970
<12-1,Cameron>她一个同学说
<12-1,Cameron>And this friend of hers at school said

153
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,970
<12-1,Cameron>那男孩从没喜欢过她
<12-1,Cameron>this boy didn't like her and never did.

154
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,300
<12-2,House>让你去检查她的膝盖  你就问回来这些
<12-2,House>You got all this from an examination of the knee?

155
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,460
<12-3,Cameron>我觉得她很抑郁
<12-3,Cameron>I think she's depressed.

156
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,330
<12-4,House>她没有肌腱炎吗
<12-4,House>She doesn't have tendinitis?

157
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,570
<12-6,House>-有肌腱炎  -那她是因此而抑郁吗
<12-6,House>- She has tendinitis. - She's depressed about having tendinitis?

158
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,050
<12-7,Cameron>她抑郁的原因跟患肌腱炎的原因一样
<12-7,Cameron>She's depressed for the same reason that she has tendinitis.

159
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,710
<12-8,House>-不是那男孩?  -不  那男孩是个混蛋
<12-8,House>- Not the boy?  - No, the boy's a jerk.

160
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,150
<12-9,Cameron>她自己清楚但仍很抑郁
<12-9,Cameron>She knows that, and yet she's depressed.

161
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,310
<12-9,Cameron>我发现个小瘤
<12-9,Cameron>I found a nodule.

162
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,860
<12-10,House>是甲状腺问题  引发情绪抑郁
<12-10,House>Ahh. Problems with the thyroid gland-- causes depressed mental state...

163
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,680
<12-10,House>也可以导致肌腱发炎
<12-10,House>can cause inflammation of the tendons.

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,610
<12-11,Cameron>我会去做测试
<12-11,Cameron>I'll run the tests.

165
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,710
<13-1,Caring>这么说  正是因为她的极度关注
<13-1,Caring>So because she took such an extreme interest,

166
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,270
<13-1,Caring>才能发现那人甲状腺有问题
<13-1,Caring>she found out that the person had a thyroid condition.

167
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,750
<13-2,House>不对  因为关注  她发现个极小的瘤
<13-2,House>No. Because she took such an interest, she discovered a tiny nodule...

168
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,490
<13-2,House>本来无关紧要  却让我们别无选择
<13-2,House>which in reality signified nothing but gave us no choice...

169
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,270
<13-2,House>让肌腱炎病人去做又贵又痛的检测
<13-2,House>but to put a person with tendinitis through an expensive and painful test.

170
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,450
<13-2,House>真正处理得当的医生  会这样看病
<13-2,House>Here's how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.

171
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,660
<15-1,Carmen>现在我能穿上裤子了吧
<15-1,Carmen>Can I put my pants back on now?

172
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,680
<15-2,House>最好不要
<15-2,House>I'd rather you didn't.

173
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,500
<15-3,Caring>这是哪位卡门·伊莱克特拉
<15-3,Caring>Which Carmen Electra is this?

174
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,950
<15-4,House>开始那位  打高尔夫的
<15-4,House>The first one. The golfer.

175
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,480
<15-5,Keen>那她为什么没穿裤子
<15-5,Keen>Then why isn't she wearing pants?

176
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,840
<15-6,House>你膝盖肌腱的反射能力下降
<15-6,House>You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon.

177
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,310
<15-7,Rebellious>-谁能来说下  -椎间盘突出
<15-7,Rebellious>- Anyone? - Slipped disc.

178
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,280
<15-8,House>有可能  有多痛
<15-8,House>Could be. How bad does it hurt?

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,090
<15-9,Carmen>-真的很痛很痛  -真的
<15-9,Carmen>- It hurts really, really bad. - Yeah?

180
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,480
<15-11,Caring>看起来不像真的  她是装病的那位吗
<15-11,Caring>It doesn't seem real. Is she the one faking?

181
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,570
<15-12,House>看在上帝份上
<15-12,House>Oh, for God's sake.

182
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,090
<15-12,House>请她来是为了满足我的幻想
<15-12,House>She's here to play into my fantasy,

183
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,340
<15-12,House>又不是因为演技
<15-12,House>not 'cause she's Meryl Streep.

185
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,200
<15-12,House>好吧
<15-12,House>Fine.

186
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,990
<15-13,Late 30s Man>我到底得了什么病
<15-13,Late 30s Man>What the hell is wrong with me!

187
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,940
<15-13,Late 30s Man>快帮帮我
<15-13,Late 30s Man>Do something!

188
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,390
<15-14,Caring>这么疼不像是椎间盘突出
<15-14,Caring>Too much pain to be a slipped disc.

189
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,270
<15-14,Caring>内容物疝出  压迫到了神经根
<15-14,Caring>Could be herniated and impinging the nerve root.

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,570
<15-15,Keen>或者是腹股沟区牵涉痛
<15-15,Keen>Or it could be referred pain from his groin.

191
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,900
<15-16,House>先生  还有其他部位疼痛吗
<15-16,House>Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else?

192
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,010
<15-17,Keen>他蜷着身子  肯定不是后背疼
<15-17,Keen>He's curling. It's not the back.

193
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,330
<15-18,House>-先生  你哪里疼  -救救我
<15-18,House>- Sir, where are you getting pain?  - Help me!

194
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,120
<15-20,House>不先帮他止疼  什么都问不出来
<15-20,House>He's not gonna tell us anything if we don't get him out of pain.

195
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,860
<15-21,Rebellious>给他注射50毫克杜冷丁
<15-21,Rebellious>Give him 50 milligrams of Demerol.

196
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,520
<15-22,Caring>没有他的病历  会过敏的
<15-22,Caring>We have no history. He could be allergic.

197
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,980
<15-23,House>我该怎么办
<15-23,House>What do I do?

198
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,070
<15-24,Rebellious>他不停叫疼  无法诊断
<15-24,Rebellious>We can't diagnose him while he screams.

199
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,060
<15-25,Caring>总比止痛药过敏致死的好  那就...
<15-25,Caring>Better than killing him with painkillers. That--

200
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,490
<15-26,House>显然他没过敏
<15-26,House>Apparently he's not allergic.

201
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,280
<15-27,Late 30s Man>谢谢  我感觉好多了
<15-27,Late 30s Man>Thank you. I feel a lot better now.

202
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,750
<16-1,Caring>我们搞砸了
<16-1,Caring>We screwed up.

203
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,180
<16-2,House>不  你们做了主治医师该做的
<16-2,House>No. You did exactly what his attending did.

204
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,720
<16-3,Rebellious>-那就是得当的诊断方式吗  -对
<16-3,Rebellious>- And that was the proper way to handle the case? - Yeah.

205
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,320
<16-5,Rebellious>那人显然把这当毒品用
<16-5,Rebellious>The guy used him as a dealer.

206
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,260
<16-6,House>你们以后会见识更多装病骗麻醉剂的
<16-6,House>You're gonna see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice.

207
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,310
<16-6,House>原因只有一个  这么做见效
<16-6,House>There's a reason-- It works.

208
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,070
<16-6,House>现在  回到农场
<16-6,House>Meanwhile, back on the farm--

209
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,110
<17-1,Chase>没错  是粗鳞响尾蛇
<17-1,Chase>Yeah. Timber rattlesnake.

210
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,020
<18-1,Cameron>准备四瓶CroFab抗蛇毒血清
<18-1,Cameron>Four vials of the CroFab antivenom.

211
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,250
<18-2,Farmer>-你好  感觉如何  -还不错
<18-2,Farmer>- Hey, how ya doin'? - All right.

212
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,780
<18-3,Cameron>谢谢  注射以后很快就会好的
<18-3,Cameron>Thank you. This will start making you feel better really fast.

213
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,430
<18-3,Cameron>他有过敏反应  呼吸器
<18-3,Cameron>He's having an allergic reaction. Bag.

214
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,190
<18-3,Cameron>心脏起搏器
<18-3,Cameron>Paddles and epi.

215
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,600
<18-5,Cameron>-他的心脏没问题  -很快就会有
<18-5,Cameron>- His heart's fine. - It's not gonna stay that way.

216
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,610
<18-5,Cameron>心脏起搏器
<18-5,Cameron>Paddles!

217
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,640
<19-1,House>不如休息五分钟
<19-1,House>What say we take five,

218
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,480
<19-1,House>喝点咖啡  方便方便
<19-1,House>get some coffee, go pee.

219
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,270
<20-1,Wilson>你以为她不会结婚吗
<20-1,Wilson>You didn't think she was gonna get married?

220
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,740
<20-2,House>她也这么问我
<20-2,House>She asked me the same question.

221
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,860
<20-3,Wilson>怎么  不准备给他治吗
<20-3,Wilson>And... what? You're not gonna treat him?

222
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,070
<20-4,House>很可能他什么病都没有
<20-4,House>There's probably nothing wrong with him.

223
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,930
<20-5,Wilson>当然  那也说得通
<20-5,Wilson>Oh, sure, that makes sense.

224
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,010
<20-5,Wilson>她只是利用丈夫生病这样的老桥段
<20-5,Wilson>She's just using the old sick husband routine...

225
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,450
<20-5,Wilson>当做重新接近你的借口
<20-5,Wilson>as an excuse to get back in touch with you.

226
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,950
<20-5,Wilson>你觉得这对她来说容易吗
<20-5,Wilson>You think this is easy for her?

227
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,900
<20-5,Wilson>她再次靠近你的唯一原因
<20-5,Wilson>The only reason she'd be anywhere near you is

228
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,020
<20-5,Wilson>只能是别无选择了
<20-5,Wilson>if she was desperate.

229
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,400
<20-6,House>难道因为她恨我  我就该帮她吗
<20-6,House>So I should help her because she hates me?

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,770
<20-7,Wilson>她并不恨你  她深爱你
<20-7,Wilson>She doesn't hate you. She loves you.

231
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,080
<20-7,Wilson>她只是无法留在你的身边
<20-7,Wilson>She just... can't stand to be around you.

232
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,820
<20-8,Keen>豪斯医生
<20-8,Keen>Uh, Dr. House?

233
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,420
<20-8,Keen>已经休息了将近六分钟了
<20-8,Keen>It's been almost six minutes.

234
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,520
<20-9,Keen>找到了
<20-9,Keen>Found him.

235
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
<20-9,Keen>那排球运动员
<20-9,Keen>The volleyball player...

236
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,940
<20-10,House>诊断为肌腱炎  注射抗炎药后见效
<20-10,House>was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you'd expect in a case of tendinitis.

237
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,310
<20-11,Rebellious>等下  被蛇咬的那位呢
<20-11,Rebellious>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy?

238
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,530
<20-11,Rebellious>我对排球运动员那例不是很感兴趣
<20-11,Rebellious>I don't really care about the volleyball player.

239
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,900
<20-12,House>要是我说排球运动员突然重度中风呢
<20-12,House>What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?

240
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,760
<20-13,Rebellious>-真的吗  -没有
<20-13,Rebellious>- Really? - No.

241
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,820
<20-14,House>但这样你就会感兴趣了  是吗
<20-14,House>But that would make you interested, right?

242
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,980
<20-14,House>要是她的甲状腺水平再次降低呢
<20-14,House>What if her T-4 came back low?

243
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,450
<20-14,House>这本不是好事  但真的话反而能引起医生兴趣
<20-14,House>It's not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.

244
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,310
<20-15,Rebellious>你说过甲状腺活检只是徒劳
<20-15,Rebellious>You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.

245
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,110
<20-16,House>不  我没这么说  我只是她说让一名
<20-16,House>No, I didn't. I said she put a person

246
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,850
<20-16,House>患肌腱炎的病人去做又贵又痛苦的检查
<20-16,House>with tendinitis through an expensive and painful test.

247
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
<20-16,House>很显然  病人既有肌腱炎又有甲状腺问题
<20-16,House>Apparently, the patient had tendinitis and a thyroid condition.

248
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,170
<21-1,Cameron>给你用甲状腺素
<21-1,Cameron>We're gonna start you on thyroxine.

249
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,580
<21-1,Cameron>能让你病情好转  平复情绪
<21-1,Cameron>It'll make you feel better and level your moods.

250
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,470
<21-2,Volleyball Player>谢谢
<21-2,Volleyball Player>Thank you.

251
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,300
<21-4,House>-就这样吗  -你之前是对的
<21-4,House>- So that's it? - You were right the first time.

252
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,870
<21-4,House>被蛇咬的病例更有趣  其实是恶心
<21-4,House>Snakebite guy's way more interesting. Gross, actually.

253
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,010
<21-4,House>用肾上腺素后见效
<21-4,House>The patient responded to epinephrine,

254
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,190
<21-4,House>不再过敏
<21-4,House>and the allergic reaction was arrested.

255
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,890
<22-1,Foreman>不幸的是  病情仍持续恶化
<22-1,Foreman>Unfortunately, the patient continues to deteriorate.

256
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,180
<22-2,Chase>也许不是我们抓的那种蛇咬的
<22-2,Chase>Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type we caught.

257
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,650
<22-3,Foreman>毒液测试报告传真过来了
<22-3,Foreman>He faxed us the venom test.

258
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,170
<22-3,Foreman>确认是粗鳞响尾蛇
<22-3,Foreman>Confirmed. It's a timber rattlesnake.

259
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,340
<22-4,House>不对  不是的  注意到毒液量那栏吗
<22-4,House>No, it's not. Notice the volume?

260
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,050
<22-5,Foreman>我大致浏览了性别和颜色
<22-5,Foreman>I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring.

261
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,900
<22-5,Foreman>就直接跳过去看蛇的种类了
<22-5,Foreman>Jumped right to the name of the snake.

262
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,330
<22-6,House>两百毫克毒液  病人是不足四小时前被咬的
<22-6,House>Two hundred milligrams. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago.

263
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,560
<22-6,House>蛇不可能在短时间内重新生成这么多毒液
<22-6,House>There's no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.

264
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,560
<22-7,Keen>我们还得知道蛇生成毒液的速度吗
<22-7,Keen>We're supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?

265
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,030
<22-8,House>不必  除非你的病人被蛇咬了
<22-8,House>No. Unless you've got a patient bit by one.

266
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,340
<22-8,House>这类知识就有用了
<22-8,House>Then it might be helpful.

267
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,210
<22-8,House>那我们现在该怎么办
<22-8,House>So what do we do now?

268
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,020
<22-9,Caring>他肯定是被其它蛇给咬了  回去再找吧
<22-9,Caring>He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.

269
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,890
<22-10,House>或者上网  就能查到
<22-10,House>Or you go online, and you find

270
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,030
<22-10,House>新泽西只有三种常见毒蛇
<22-10,House>there's only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey:

271
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,660
<22-10,House>铜头蛇  粗鳞响尾蛇和珊瑚蛇
<22-10,House>the copperhead, timber rattler and the coral.

272
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,930
<22-10,House>而我们给病人注释的抗蛇毒血清
<22-10,House>Copperhead and timber rattler

273
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,720
<23-1,House>对铜头蛇和粗鳞响尾蛇都有效
<23-1,House>both respond to the antivenoms we gave the guy.

274
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,370
<22-11,Caring>那应该给他注射另一种抗蛇毒血清吗
<22-11,Caring>So we give him the antivenom for the other one?

275
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,270
<22-12,House>你这是在问我
<22-12,House>Is that a question?

276
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,670
<22-13,Keen>绝对不能盲目再给他用抗蛇毒血清了
<22-13,Keen>We can't just blindly give him another antivenom,

277
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,260
<22-13,Keen>尤其是在第一种差点害死他后
<22-13,Keen>especially after the first one almost killed him.

278
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,890
<22-13,Keen>你说新泽西就三种常见毒蛇
<22-13,Keen>You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey.

279
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,170
<22-13,Keen>-那万一是不常见的呢  -很好
<22-13,Keen>- Well, what if this is an uncommon one? - Very good.

280
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,420
<22-15,Keen>-还是得找到到底是哪种  -没必要了
<22-15,Keen>- We gotta find the right snake. - No need.

281
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,090
<22-16,House>很可能等我们回来
<22-16,House>Odds are by the time you get back,

282
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,780
<22-16,House>验尸报告自然会告诉我们是那种蛇
<22-16,House>the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.

283
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,030
<22-17,Keen>但你说...
<22-17,Keen>But you said--

284
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,530
<22-18,Caring>所以还是得给他再用其他血清
<22-18,Caring>So we do give him the antivenom for the other one?

285
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,100
<22-18,Caring>再说一次  你是在问我吗
<22-18,Caring>Again, was that a question?

286
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,040
<22-19,House>是我在问你们啊
<22-19,House>I asked what you would do.

287
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,890
<22-19,House>你把问题扔回给我  好像有失公允
<22-19,House>It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do.

288
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,020
<22-19,House>谁选择给他用另一种抗蛇毒血清
<22-19,House>Who gives the guy the other antivenom?

289
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,260
<22-19,House>谁选择继续去找蛇
<22-19,House>And who goes looking for the snake?

290
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,690
<22-20,Rebellious>我觉得这两个选择  一个杀人  一个救人
<22-20,Rebellious>I assume that one choice kills him, the other one saves him.

291
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,770
<22-21,House>在腿部中毒变黑的情况下
<22-21,House>That's usually the way it works

292
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,330
<22-21,House>通常只有这两种方法
<22-21,House>at the leg-turning-black stage.

293
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,370
<22-22,Caring>所以我们可能杀了他  也可能救了他
<22-22,Caring>So half of us killed him, and half of us saved his life.

294
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,450
<22-24,Keen>-对  -但不该以此谴责我们...
<22-24,Keen>- Yeah. - We can't be blamed for--

295
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,660
<22-25,House>我知道这跟你们所学是相违背的
<22-25,House>I'm sure this goes against everything you've been taught,

296
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,400
<22-25,House>但对错之分确实存在
<22-25,House>but right and wrong do exist.

297
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,140
<22-25,House>仅仅因为你自己不知道哪个是对
<22-25,House>Just because you don't know what the right answer is--

298
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,220
<22-25,House>或者根本没办法知道哪个是对
<22-25,House>maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is--

299
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,110
<22-25,House>这样并不会让你的答案变对
<22-25,House>doesn't make your answer right or even okay.

300
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,760
<22-25,House>其实事情远没那么复杂
<22-25,House>It's much simpler than that.

301
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,510
<22-25,House>不过是个低级错误
<22-25,House>It's just plain wrong.

302
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,590
<23-1,House>我们给他用了抗蛇毒血清
<23-1,House>We gave the guy the antivenom.

303
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,960
<23-2,Farmer>万一我再过敏呢
<23-2,Farmer>What if I'm allergic again?

304
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,790
<23-3,Foreman>所以这么多医生站在这
<23-3,Foreman>That's why these people are here.

305
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,800
<23-3,Foreman>一旦你有过敏反应
<23-3,Foreman>If you have a reaction,

306
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,440
<23-3,Foreman>我们会及时采取必要措施
<23-3,Foreman>we're ready to do whatever's necessary...

307
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,510
<23-3,Foreman>确保你气道保持通畅  心脏继续跳动
<23-3,Foreman>to ensure your airways stay open and your heart keeps beating.

308
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,310
<23-4,Farmer>我妻子正在赶来  就不能等等再治吗
<23-4,Farmer>My wife's on her way in. Can't this wait?

309
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,540
<23-5,Foreman>抱歉  等不了
<23-5,Foreman>I'm sorry. It can't.

310
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,800
<23-7,Caring>-我腿又疼了  -他又回来了吗
<23-7,Caring>- It hurts again. - He came back?

311
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,670
<23-8,House>通常来说  吸毒的人都很蠢
<23-8,House>On average, drug addicts are stupid.

312
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,750
<23-9,Rebellious>-要是我就报警  -很好
<23-9,Rebellious>- I'd call the cops. - Good for you.

313
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,990
<23-10,House>大部分医生都不会用职业生涯赌这一把
<23-10,House>A lot of doctors wouldn't risk their careers on a hunch.

314
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,300
<23-11,Rebellious>这不算赌  我明知道他是来骗毒品的
<23-11,Rebellious>It's not a hunch. I mean, I know he wants drugs.

315
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,700
<23-12,House>但吸毒的人也有可能生病
<23-12,House>Well, even drug addicts get sick.

316
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,210
<23-12,House>事实上  出于某种原因
<23-12,House>Actually, for some reason,

317
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,470
<23-12,House>他们比不吸毒的更常生病
<23-12,House>they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts.

318
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,830
<23-12,House>幸运的是  你不用赌这一把
<23-12,House>Luckily, you don't have to play your hunch.

319
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,140
<23-12,House>有种更快的解决之道  事实上有好几种
<23-12,House>There's a faster way. Actually, there are several.

320
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,160
<23-12,House>我更倾向于给他验尿
<23-12,House>My preference is urine testing.

321
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,840
<23-13,Rebellious>但你已经知道他会有毒品反应了
<23-13,Rebellious>But you already know he has drugs in his system.

322
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,080
<23-14,House>我不是想检测的这个
<23-14,House>That's not what I'm testing for.

323
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,740
<24-1,House>我们会将这根硬橡胶管通过尿道插入你的膀胱
<24-1,House>We're gonna put this hard rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder.

324
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,620
<24-1,House>可能会有点不舒服
<24-1,House>It may be a little uncomfortable.

325
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,080
<24-2,Late 30s Man>难道不该给我来点什么麻醉剂吗
<24-2,Late 30s Man>Shouldn't I be getting some sort of anesthetic?

326
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,430
<24-3,House>不麻醉  今天我们很怕有过敏反应
<24-3,House>We're concerned about allergic reactions today.

327
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,140
<24-4,House>如果这人能忍受塑胶管插在鸡鸡里
<24-4,House>If the guy can handle a rod in his penis

328
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,520
<24-4,House>半小时之久  那他肯定是真病了
<24-4,House>for half an hour, he's really sick.

329
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,050
<24-5,Rebellious>或者他毒瘾真的有够重
<24-5,Rebellious>Or he's really jonesing.

330
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,390
<24-6,House>还是有很多简单办法能搞到毒品的
<24-6,House>There's easier ways to get ahold of drugs.

331
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,600
<24-6,House>比如说  去其他医院
<24-6,House>Other hospitals, for example.

332
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,130
<24-6,House>对排球运动员的治疗并不见效
<24-6,House>The volleyball player is not responding to treatment.

333
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,280
<24-6,House>至少我们不认为有效
<24-6,House>At least we think it's not working...

334
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,990
<24-6,House>事实上  她的病情恶化了
<24-6,House>on account of the fact that she's getting worse.

335
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,020
<24-6,House>-还能听到我说话吗  -听不到
<24-6,House>- Can you still hear me? - No.

336
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,370

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,930
<26-11,House>最有可能的是腺瘤
<26-11,House>The adenoma is most likely.

355

<26-11,House>检查其甲状旁腺素  体内磷含量...
<26-11,House>Check her P.T.H., phosphorus

<26-14,House>对了  你们并不知道他
<26-14,House>Oh, right. You guys don't know about him.

362
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,250
<26-14,House>他是在排球运动员入院三个月后
<26-14,House>He doesn't get bitten until three months after

363
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,410
<26-14,House>被蛇咬伤来就诊的
<26-14,House>we treat the volleyball player.

364
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,780
<26-14,House>幸运的是  已经确认时机并未完全延误
<26-14,House>Luckily, it's been well established that time is not a fixed construct.

365
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,270
<26-14,House>病情没有改善  给他双倍剂量
<26-14,House>His condition is not improving. Double the dosage.

367
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,300
<26-15,Foreman>-已经加了  -还有种血清
<26-15,Foreman>- Already did. - There's another antivenom.

<26-16,House>- It's not as effective, but-- - Already tried it.

<26-18,House>第一种用的就是  但他过敏

370
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,410
<26-19,Cameron>同时用高剂量的类固醇
<26-19,Cameron>Gave it to him with high-dose steroids.

371
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,920
<26-20,House>-都没有效果  -这些能说明什么
<26-20,House>- Nothing's working. - What does it all mean?

<27-2,House>-不是那种蛇吗  -已经试遍了所有的血清
<27-2,House>- Wrong snake? - We tried every other antivenom we had.

373
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
<27-3,Caring>是病情延误太久吗
<27-3,Caring>We're too late?

374
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,240
<27-4,House>对  他就快死了  他妻子赶到了
<27-4,House>Yep. He's dying. His wife's here.

375
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,040
<27-4,House>她总算找到保姆看孩子了  谁去告诉他们噩耗
<27-4,House>Finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let 'em know?

376
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,020
<27-5,Caring>-其实我在开玩笑  -他不会死吗
<27-5,Caring>- Actually, I'm kidding. - He's not dying?

377
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,400
<27-6,House>不  他是快死了  但并没有妻儿
<27-6,House>Oh, yeah, he's dying. But there's no wife and kid.

378
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,230
<27-6,House>这太好了
<27-6,House>Which is great.

379
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,200
<27-6,House>让宣布病人死亡这事更省心了
<27-6,House>Makes the breaking-the-news thing way easier.

380
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,010
<27-6,House>对了  还有个消息
<27-6,House>Oh, yeah. One more piece of news.

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,930
<28-1,House>吸毒的那家伙开始尿血了
<28-1,House>The drug addict is peeing blood.

382
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,250
<28-1,House>他们是怎么教你们向家属宣布噩耗的
<28-1,House>How do they teach you how to tell someone that they're dying?

383
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,510
<28-1,House>就像教建筑师怎么跟人解释
<28-1,House>It's kind of like teaching architects how to explain

384
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,540
<28-1,House>他们造的房子为何倒塌一样
<28-1,House>why their building fell down.

385
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,120
<29-1,House>练习时会分角色扮演吗
<29-1,House>Do you role-play and stuff?

386
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,960
<29-2,Keen>对  一人去通知死亡
<29-2,Keen>Yeah. One of us gives the bad news,

387
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,510
<29-2,Keen>另一人则扮演家属
<29-2,Keen>and one of us gets the bad news.

388
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,970
<29-3,House>那怎么做才能在这门课上拿个优秀呢
<29-3,House>What do you have to do to get an "A" in You're Dying 101?

389
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,400
<29-3,House>他们会依照你们的亲切度和支持度打分吗
<29-3,House>They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness?

390
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,970
<29-3,House>有没有个衡量同情的标准
<29-3,House>Is there a scale for measuring compassion?

391
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,740
<29-3,House>我有个朋友
<29-3,House>This buddy of mine--

392
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,380
<29-3,House>每次有人感谢他  我都恨不得给他十块钱
<29-3,House>I gotta give him 10 bucks every time someone says thank you.

393
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,470
<29-3,House>想象下  他实在太好人了
<29-3,House>Imagine that. This guy's so good,

394
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,050
<29-3,House>即使宣布死亡  人们还是会不住感谢他
<29-3,House>people thank him for telling 'em that they're dying.

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,100
<29-3,House>还差棕色
<29-3,House>Needs brown.

396
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,260
<29-3,House>我可没收到那么多感谢
<29-3,House>I don't get thanked that often.

397
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,610
<29-3,House>你快死了
<29-3,House>You're dying.

398
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,170
<29-3,House>就剩几个小时了
<29-3,House>In a few hours.

399
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,440
<30-1,House>除了帮你止痛  我们已无能为力了
<30-1,House>There's nothing we can do except deal with the pain.

400
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,270
<30-2,Farmer>我得回家
<30-2,Farmer>Well, I need to go home.

401
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,410
<30-3,House>你不能回家
<30-3,House>You're not going home.

402
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,610
<30-4,Farmer>但我的狗呢  我的狗以后怎么办
<30-4,Farmer>But my dog. What will happen to my dog?

403
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,530
<30-4,Farmer>颈部没有病变  没有腺瘤
<30-4,Farmer>Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

404
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,520
<32-1,Rebellious>等下  那家伙快死了  却只关心他的狗吗
<32-1,Rebellious>Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying, and all he cares about is his dog?

405
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,030
<32-2,House>在你们角色扮演中  有没人遇到过狗狗这回事
<32-2,House>Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions?

406
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,250
<32-2,House>人类的真理就是  人人皆会说谎
<32-2,House>It's a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies.

407
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,720
<32-2,House>唯一的不同是  说什么谎
<32-2,House>The only variable is about what.

408
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,390
<32-2,House>告诉某人他快死了  最大的好处就是
<32-2,House>The great thing about telling someone they're dying...

409
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,730
<32-2,House>让他更易聚焦于自己最在乎的事
<32-2,House>is that it tends to focus their priorities.

410
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,200
<32-2,House>你就能找出他们最关心的问题
<32-2,House>You find out what matters to them.

411
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,260
<32-2,House>他们愿意为之付诸一切的事
<32-2,House>What they're willing to die for.

412
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,970
<32-2,House>他们不惜为之说谎的事
<32-2,House>What they're willing to lie for.

413
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,260
<32-3,House>你肯定会有邻居照顾...
<32-3,House>You must have a neighbor who--

414
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,590
<32-4,Farmer>邻居们都不喜欢它
<32-4,Farmer>Neighbors don't like him.

415
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,450
<32-5,House>那动物保护协会的会接管  让它安家
<32-5,House>So the Humane Society will take him in and find him a home.

416
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:04,610
<32-6,Farmer>他们才不会  对了  也许我姨妈...
<32-6,Farmer>No, they won't. Yeah, but maybe my aunt--

417
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,670
<32-7,House>那不是蛇咬的  是吗
<32-7,House>It wasn't a snakebite, was it?

418
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,120
<32-8,Farmer>我说过我不记得被咬过
<32-8,Farmer>I said I don't remember bein' bit.

419
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,710
<32-9,House>你当然记得  只是不是蛇咬的
<32-9,House>Sure you do. Just not by a snake.

420
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,080
<32-9,House>估计前阵子你家恶犬就咬过邻居
<32-9,House>I assume that Cujo bit one of your neighbors a while back.

422
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,950
<32-9,House>一旦你说是它咬的你  我肯定会上报
<32-9,House>You tell me that he bit you, and I gotta report it.

423
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,520
<32-9,House>你家恶犬已经有不良记录了  肯定会被处死
<32-9,House>Cujo's got a record. He gets the chair.

424
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,900
<32-9,House>好消息是你应该死不了了
<32-9,House>The good news is you might just live.

425
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,100
<32-9,House>坏消息是你的狗非死不可
<32-9,House>The bad news is your dog's gonna die.

426
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,970
<33-1,Chase>他就为了救这玩意不惜玩命
<33-1,Chase>Guy risked his life to save this thing?

427
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,830
<33-2,Foreman>我来制住它  你去它嘴巴里采样
<33-2,Foreman>I'll hold him. You swab the mouth.

428
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,770
<33-3,Chase>我觉得我制住它比较好  你去采样
<33-3,Chase>I think I've got a better grip here. You go for the mouth.

429
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,500
<33-5,Chase>好吧  猜拳决定
<33-5,Chase>All right. I'm odds.

<33-7,Chase>I don't care if he's scratching your nads off, you don't let go.

433
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,270
<33-8,Foreman>快动手
<33-8,Foreman>Just do it!

434
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,930
<33-9,Chase>不如就让那人死了算了
<33-9,Chase>I say we let the guy die.

<33-25,House>None that his history would indicate.

451
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,670
<33-26,Caring>可能是因私自注射杜冷丁引起的
<33-26,Caring>Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.

452
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,660
<33-28,Caring>-治疗方式  -热敷及放松...
<33-28,Caring>- Treatment? - Heat and rest--

453
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,760
<33-29,House>-还有其他可能原因吗  -感染
<33-29,House>- Other possible causes? - Infection.

454
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,760
<33-31,House>开始给他用抗生素  还有呢
<33-31,House>Start him on antibiotics. What else?

455
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,300
<33-31,House>-快  快点想  -我  我不知道
<33-31,House>- Come on! Come on! - I-I don't know.

456
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,700
<33-33,House>真没用  不过至少还有自知之明
<33-33,House>You're useless. But at least you know it.

457
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,660
<33-33,House>血检结果显示肌酸激酶超高
<33-33,House>Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase.

458
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,870
<33-33,House>-这说明什么  -外伤的诊断是正确的
<33-33,House>- What does that tell you? - The trauma diagnosis was right.

459
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,840
<33-34,Rebellious>放松休息几天就会没事的
<33-34,Rebellious>He takes it easy for a few days, he'll be fine.

460
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,510
<33-35,House>你确定?
<33-35,House>You sure?

461
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,720
<33-36,Rebellious>肌酸激酶超高就排除了感染的可能
<33-36,Rebellious>The elevated C.K. rules out infection--

462
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,020
<33-37,House>知道什么比没用更糟吗
<33-37,House>You know what's worse than useless?

463
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,180
<33-37,House>没用  迟钝
<33-37,House>Useless and oblivious.

464
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,690
<33-37,House>他们遗漏了什么可能
<33-37,House>What are they missing?

465
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,840
<33-38,Keen>你脸板成那样  让我们很难思考
<33-38,Keen>It's kind of hard to think when you're in our face like--

466
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,710
<33-38,Keen>是吗
<33-38,Keen>Yeah?

467
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,510
<33-39,House>你觉得面对垂危病人会更容易吗
<33-39,House>You think it's gonna be easier when you got a real patient really dying?

468
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,540
<33-39,House>你们到底遗漏了什么
<33-39,House>What are you missing?

469
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,810
<33-40,Cameron>肌肉坏死
<33-40,Cameron>Muscle death.

470
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,710
<33-41,House>跟你无关
<33-41,House>Not your case.

471
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,920
<33-42,Cameron>大家一起讨论肯定不是坏事
<33-42,Cameron>Nothing wrong with a consult.

472
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,790
<33-43,Caring>肌肉坏死会释放肌红蛋白  对肾脏有毒
<33-43,Caring>Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It's toxic to the kidneys.

473
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,990
<33-44,House>聪明
<33-44,House>Brilliant.

474
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,240
<33-44,House>给他腿部做核磁共振  看到底什么情况
<33-44,House>M.R.I. his leg. See what's killing it.

475
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,160
<34-1,Rebellious>为何要给那女孩做核磁共振
<34-1,Rebellious>Why is the girl getting the M.R.I.?

476
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,870
<34-2,House>因为她颈部扫描未发现任何甲状腺瘤
<34-2,House>Because the neck scan revealed nothing,

477
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,880
<34-2,House>而她的医生  比她自己想象得强迫症更加严重
<34-2,House>and her doctor's way more obsessive than she thinks she is.

478
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,580
<34-3,Rebellious>但你说那人需要做核磁共振
<34-3,Rebellious>But you said the guy needed the M.R.I.

479
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,050
<34-4,House>那是因为卡梅隆告诉你们他是肌肉坏死
<34-4,House>Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death.

480
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,200
<34-4,House>你们可没人这么说  他的医生也没人发现
<34-4,House>Not one of you said it. Not one of this guy's doctors said it.

481
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,370
<34-4,House>他们就让他卧床休息
<34-4,House>They gave him bed rest

482
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,030
<34-4,House>跟你们一样给他用抗生素
<34-4,House>and antibiotics, just like you guys would have.

483
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,350
<34-5,Caring>-那他病情好转了吗  -没有
<34-5,Caring>- Did he get better? - No.

484
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,620
<34-7,Caring>-多久才...  -三天
<34-7,Caring>- How long-- - Three days.

485
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,750
<34-8,House>这就是医学的自然规律  你们可能会搞砸
<34-8,House>It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up.

486
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,120
<34-8,House>也可能会害死病人
<34-8,House>you're gonna kill someone.

487
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,050
<34-8,House>没法面对这一事实的话   趁早转行
<34-8,House>If you can't handle that reality, pick another profession.

488
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,740
<34-8,House>或者读完医学院就去教书
<34-8,House>Or finish medical school and teach.

489
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,370
<34-9,Caring>他们用了整整三天才想到可能是肌肉坏死?
<34-9,Caring>Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?

490
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,780
<34-10,House>不  是病人三天后
<34-10,House>No, three days before the patient

491
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,930
<34-10,House>自己想到可能是肌肉坏死
<34-10,House>suggested it might have been muscle death.

492
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,460
<35-1,Cameron>核磁共振结果显示是骨肉瘤
<35-1,Cameron>The M.R.I. revealed an osteosarcoma.

493
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,110
<35-1,Cameron>你大腿骨上有个癌变的肿块
<35-1,Cameron>A cancerous tumor on your femur.

494
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,600
<35-1,Cameron>需要手术摘除
<35-1,Cameron>It needs to be removed surgically.

495
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,420
<35-1,Cameron>再经化疗  她生存几率很高
<35-1,Cameron>With chemo, she has an excellent chance of survival.

496
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,510
<35-1,Cameron>但我必须提醒你
<35-1,Cameron>But I have to warn you--

497
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,760
<35-1,Cameron>医生将根据你肿瘤的大小和顽固程度
<35-1,Cameron>depending on how large the tumor is and how ingrained it is,

498
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,790
<35-1,Cameron>决定是否需要截肢
<35-1,Cameron>the surgeon may need to amputate your leg.

499
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,280
<35-1,Cameron>我很抱歉
<35-1,Cameron>I'm sorry.

500
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,040
<35-1,Cameron>没事的
<35-1,Cameron>It's okay.

501
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,930
<36-1,Foreman>狗的口腔很脏
<36-1,Foreman>Dogs' mouths are pretty filthy,

502
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,300
<36-1,Foreman>它们有天生抗体  可消灭大部分细菌
<36-1,Foreman>but they have natural antibodies to fight off most of the stuff.

503
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,480
<36-1,Foreman>但我们没有  所以被狗咬很危险
<36-1,Foreman>We don't. That's why dog bites can be so nasty.

504
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,540
<36-1,Foreman>检测结果显示你家狗唾液中含有链球菌
<36-1,Foreman>Lab tests of your dog's saliva revealed a type of strep bacteria.

505
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,430
<36-1,Foreman>这种病通常被称为坏死性筋膜炎[噬肉病]
<36-1,Foreman>It's commonly known as the flesh-eating disease.

506
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,320
<37-4,Late 30s Man>必须马上手术  切除坏死组织
<37-4,Late 30s Man>We need to operate immediately to remove the damaged tissue.

507
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,170
<37-5,Cuddy>可能得截肢
<37-5,Cuddy>We may need to remove the leg.

508
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,950
<37-1,Cuddy>-核磁共振显示有问题  -开什么玩笑
<37-1,Cuddy>- The M.R.I. revealed a problem. - No kidding.

509
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,220
<37-3,Cuddy>抱歉你的医生没尽早查出问题
<37-3,Cuddy>I'm sorry none of your doctors found it earlier.

510
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,660
<37-3,Cuddy>我个人自此将全程监督你的治疗情况
<37-3,Cuddy>I am personally gonna oversee your treatment from now on.

511
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,470
<37-4,Late 30s Man>你们会让我动一堆手术  是吧
<37-4,Late 30s Man>You're gonna cut me open, aren't you?

512
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,950
<37-5,Cuddy>可能需要截肢
<37-5,Cuddy>We may need to remove the leg.

513
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,720
<38-1,House>他的核磁共振结果显示
<38-1,House>His M.R.I. showed that the leg pain

514
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,010
<38-1,House>腿疼并非私自注射而导致
<38-1,House>wasn't caused by the self-injection.

515
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,930
<38-1,House>也不是感染引发的
<38-1,House>It wasn't caused by an infection.

516
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,500
<38-1,House>动脉瘤内血栓形成
<38-1,House>It was an aneurysm that clotted...

517
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,100
<38-1,House>导致的梗死
<38-1,House>leading to an infarction.

518
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
<38-2,Foreman>天哪  你猜对了  正是豪斯自己
<38-2,Foreman>My God, you were right. It's House.

519
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,190
<39-1,Cuddy>一定得动手术
<39-1,Cuddy>We have to do the surgery.

520
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,720
<39-1,Cuddy>坏死组织必须手术切除  如果太多的话...
<39-1,Cuddy>The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there's too much--

521
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,950
<39-2,House>我不管你们发现了什么
<39-2,House>I don't care what you find.

522
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,960
<39-3,Cuddy>为了救你  这些都是必要措施
<39-3,Cuddy>It may become necessary in order to save your life.

523
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,790
<39-4,House>我喜欢自己的腿
<39-4,House>I like my leg.

524
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,810
<39-4,House>自我记事起  他们就跟着我
<39-4,House>I've had it for as long as I can remember.

525
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,580
<39-5,Stacy>格雷戈  我跟你一样喜欢你的腿
<39-5,Stacy>Greg, I love your leg as much as you do.

526
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,830
<39-6,House>绝对不能截肢
<39-6,House>They're not cutting it off.

527
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,750
<40-1,House>病人作出正确的选择
<40-1,House>The patient made the right choice.

528
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,060
<40-1,House>告诉医生  截肢也可以
<40-1,House>Tell a surgeon that it's okay to cut a leg off,

529
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,050
<40-1,House>他将抛光自己腿上的钢架度过漫漫长夜
<40-1,House>and he's gonna spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.

530
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,100
<40-2,Rebellious>对  医生对保全病人四肢根本毫不在乎
<40-2,Rebellious>Right. Surgeons could care less about saving limbs.

531
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,190
<40-3,House>医生当然关心病人权益
<40-3,House>Of course they care about their patients.

532
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,240
<40-3,House>只是关心他们自己更多而已
<40-3,House>They just care about themselves more,

533
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,660
<40-3,House>这种立场也不是不能理解
<40-3,House>which is not an unreasonable position.

534
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,280
<40-3,House>保留越多的组织
<40-3,House>Trying to maximize the tissue you save...

535
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,020
<40-3,House>风险越大
<40-3,House>also maximizes the chances of something going wrong,

536
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,960
<40-3,House>这意味着你得格外小心
<40-3,House>which means you've gotta be extra careful,

537
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,630
<40-3,House>这真是太讨厌了
<40-3,House>which is such a pain in the ass.

538
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,470
<40-3,House>医学界已经有了非凡进步  装了义肢的孩子们
<40-3,House>Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs...

539
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,240
<41-1,Cuddy>百米冲刺可以跑进12秒内
<41-1,Cuddy>are running the hundred-meter dash in 12 seconds.

540
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,460
<41-2,House>是啊  只是看着不太美观而已
<41-2,House>Yeah, they're just not as pretty.

541
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,400
<41-2,House>做个旁路  让血液恢复流通就好
<41-2,House>Do a bypass. Restore the circulation.

542
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,880
<41-4,House>-截肢更安全  -对你还是对我
<41-4,House>- Amputation is safer. - For you or me?

543
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,350
<41-5,Cuddy>-血流的阻塞...-已经阻塞了四天
<41-5,Cuddy>- The blockage of blood flow--  - Four-day blockage.

544
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,790
<41-7,Cuddy>对  导致肌肉细胞坏死
<41-7,Cuddy>Yes. It caused muscle cell death.

545
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,590
<41-7,Cuddy>细胞坏死会释放细胞因子和钾
<41-7,Cuddy>When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium.

546
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,000
<41-8,House>一旦血液恢复流通  而不把坏死组织切除的话
<41-8,House>And if you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off,

547
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,110
<41-8,House>这些都会重新流回我的身体系统中
<41-8,House>then all that crap gets washed back into my system.

548
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,410
<41-8,House>细胞因子可能导致器官衰竭
<41-8,House>The cytokines could cause organ failure.

549
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,010
<41-8,House>而钾可能导致心脏骤停
<41-8,House>The potassium could cause cardiac arrest.

550
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,950
<41-8,House>但另一方面  我可能能保住我的腿
<41-8,House>On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.

551
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,950
<41-10,House>-光是术后的疼痛就...-我可以忍受
<41-10,House>- The postoperative pain alone will -  - I'll get through it.

552
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,530
<41-10,House>风险我都明白  你也清楚
<41-10,House>I understand the risks. You're in the clear.

553
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,790
<41-10,House>安排旁路手术吧
<41-10,House>Go schedule an O.R.

554
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,960
<41-11,Stacy>老天  你个白痴
<41-11,Stacy>God, you're an idiot.

555
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,060
<41-12,House>我觉得我更像个混球
<41-12,House>I think I'm more of a jerk.

556
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,730
<41-13,Stacy>我不想跟你耍嘴皮子  也不会装可爱
<41-13,Stacy>I'm not being glib, and I'm not being cute.

557
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,790
<41-13,Stacy>只是不想你害死自己
<41-13,Stacy>I don't want you to kill yourself.

558
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,880
<41-14,House>我不会死的
<41-14,House>I'm not gonna die.

559
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,220
<41-15,Stacy>这下我还真放心了
<41-15,Stacy>Oh, I feel completely reassured.

561
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,500
<41-12,House>再吸干净点
<41-12,House>More suction.

562
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,270
<41-12,House>现在插入
<41-12,House>Inserting now.

563
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,370
<42-1,House>让他们加大吗啡用量
<42-1,House>They gotta up the morphine.

564
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,250
<42-2,Stacy>医生说不行
<42-2,Stacy>Doctors say they can't.

565
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,160
<42-3,House>医生还曾推荐卧床休息和使用抗生素呢
<42-3,House>Doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.

566
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,280
<42-4,Stacy>他们之前是错了
<42-4,Stacy>They screwed up.

567
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,410
<42-4,Stacy>但不意味着这次也错了
<42-4,Stacy>It doesn't mean they're wrong this time.

568
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,630
<42-5,House>当然也不意味着这次就对了
<42-5,House>Sure doesn't mean they're right.

569
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,000
<42-6,Stacy>-吗啡会害死你的  -我能熬过去的
<42-6,Stacy>- Morphine will kill you. - I can handle it.

570
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,110
<42-8,Stacy>你疼痛难忍  不能正确思考
<42-8,Stacy>You're in pain. You're not thinking right.

571
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,770
<42-9,House>所以我才需要那该死的吗啡
<42-9,House>That's why I need the damn morphine!

572
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,500
<42-10,Stacy>我去跟他们说
<42-10,Stacy>I'll talk to them.

573
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,490
<43-1,Stacy>上帝啊  他还得这样疼多久
<43-1,Stacy>Oh, my God. How much longer is the pain gonna last?

574
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,020
<43-2,Cuddy>得看肌肉细胞坏死的数量
<43-2,Cuddy>It depends on how much muscle cell death there was.

575
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,280
<43-2,Cuddy>他可能是对的
<43-2,Cuddy>He could be right.

576
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,230
<43-2,Cuddy>他可能可以不用截肢就挺过去
<43-2,Cuddy>He could come out of this with almost full use of his leg.

577
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,520
<43-3,Stacy>或者呢
<43-3,Stacy>Or?

578
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,380
<43-4,Cuddy>或者可能余生都这么痛苦
<43-4,Cuddy>He could be in pain for the rest of his life.

579
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,070
<43-4,Cuddy>还有第三种选择  动手术
<43-4,Cuddy>There's a third option... surgically.

580
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,150
<43-4,Cuddy>是目前情况和截肢间折中的办法
<43-4,Cuddy>A middle ground between what we did and amputation.

581
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,070
<43-5,Stacy>他不喜欢折中
<43-5,Stacy>He's not big on middle ground.

582
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,750
<43-5,Stacy>是啊
<43-5,Stacy>Yeah.

583
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,360
<44-1,House>护士  护士
<44-1,House>Nurse? Nurse!

584
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,010
<44-1,House>再帮我挂葡萄糖酸钙
<44-1,House>I need more calcium gluconate.

585
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,280
<44-2,Nurse>你已经挂了五袋了
<44-2,Nurse>You just had five m.l.'s.

586
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,010
<44-3,House>报告显示心电图QRS波变宽
<44-3,House>The Q.R.S. is getting wider.

587
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,990
<44-3,House>钾含量一直在增加
<44-3,House>My potassium is rising.

588
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,280
<44-4,Nurse>-我这就去找医生  -你最好快点
<44-4,Nurse>- I'll talk to your doctor. - Well, you better make it fast,

589
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,380
<44-5,House>因为我的心脏快骤停了
<44-5,House>'cause I'm about to go into cardiac arrest.

590
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,600
<44-5,House>快帮我挂  不然心动过速会更严重
<44-5,House>You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.

591
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,960
<44-6,Nurse>-我会有麻烦的  -听着  这又不是麻醉剂
<44-6,Nurse>- I could get in trouble-- - Listen, it's not a narcotic!

592
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,430
<44-7,House>我不是在跟你讨价还价  你还有20秒
<44-7,House>I'm not looking for a buzz. You got about 20 seconds.

593
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,650
<44-7,House>我错了
<44-7,House>I was wrong.

594
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,210
<44-9,Nurse>-什么情况  -心动过速
<44-9,Nurse>- What do you got? - Wide complex tachycardia.

595
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,530
<44-11,Nurse>-是你的诊断  -他自己做的诊断
<44-11,Nurse>- You diagnosed-- - He did.

596
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,920
<44-12,Cuddy>-准备心脏除颤器  -心脏除颤器
<44-12,Cuddy>- Defibrillator. - Paddles.

597
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,600
<44-12,Cuddy>-充电  -让开
<44-12,Cuddy>- Charge. - Clear.

598
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,430
<45-1,House>病人心脏停跳超过一分钟
<45-1,House>The patient was technically dead for over a minute.

599
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,560
<45-1,House>他活过来了
<45-1,House>He's back.

600
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,330
<45-1,House>你认为他经历了死亡吗
<45-1,House>Do you think he was dead?

601
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,730
<45-1,House>你认为濒死体验是真实的吗
<45-1,House>Do you think those experiences were real?

602
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,010
<47-1,Wilson>何谓"真实"  体验是真实发生的
<47-1,Wilson>Define "real". They were real experiences.

603
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,130
<47-2,House>他们说的是...
<47-2,House>What they meant--

604
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,730
<47-2,House>我个人选择相信  人们常说的
<47-2,House>Personally, I choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see,

605
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,820
<47-2,House>这位病人见也到的  那道白光
<47-2,House>the visions this patient saw,

606
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,900
<47-2,House>只是大脑停止时
<47-2,House>they're all just chemical reactions

607
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,660
<47-2,House>所发生的化学反应
<47-2,House>that take place while the brain shuts down.

608
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,890
<47-3,Foreman>你选择相信这个
<47-3,Foreman>You choose to believe that?

609
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,040
<47-4,House>科学研究从不会有尽头
<47-4,House>There's no conclusive science.

610
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,020
<47-4,House>我的选择对我的生命没有影响
<47-4,House>My choice has no practical relevance to my life.

611
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,860
<47-4,House>我只是选择更令人欣慰的结果
<47-4,House>I choose the outcome I find more comforting.

612
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,190
<47-5,Cameron>而你觉得这个说法更令人欣慰
<47-5,Cameron>You find it more comforting to believe that this is it?

613
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,060
<47-6,House>我觉得相信人世不是一场单纯的试验
<47-6,House>I find it more comforting to believe that this...

614
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,320
<47-6,House>更令我欣慰
<47-6,House>isn't simply a test.

615
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,280
<48-1,Stacy>现在有多痛
<48-1,Stacy>How bad is the pain right now?

616
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,350
<48-2,House>非常痛
<48-2,House>It's bad.

617
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,700
<48-3,Stacy>根本就没好转
<48-3,Stacy>It's not getting any better.

618
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,780
<48-3,Stacy>如果你对的话  疼痛会减少
<48-3,Stacy>If you were right, the pain would be subsiding.

619
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,910
<48-4,House>-你也会慢慢好转  -只是时间长点
<48-4,House>- You'd be getting better. - It's just taking longer.

620
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,600
<48-4,House>不  不是的
<48-4,House>No, it's not.

621
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,730
<48-5,Stacy>本该让他们帮你截肢的
<48-5,Stacy>We've gotta let 'em cut the leg off.

622
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,120
<48-6,House>这是我的腿  是我的人生
<48-6,House>It's my leg. It's my life.

623
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,720
<48-7,Stacy>如果需要你截肢救我一命  你会吗
<48-7,Stacy>Would you give up your leg to save my life?

624
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,720
<48-8,House>当然
<48-8,House>Of course I would.

625
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,930
<48-9,Stacy>那你怎么会认为你的命不如我的值钱
<48-9,Stacy>Why do you think your life is worth less than mine?

626
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,240
<48-9,Stacy>如果是其他病人  你会怎么跟他们说
<48-9,Stacy>If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?

627
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,090
<48-10,House>-我会说让他们自己选择  -不可能
<48-10,House>- I would say it's their choice. - Not a chance.

628
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,580
<48-11,Stacy>你会恐吓他们
<48-11,Stacy>You'd browbeat them

629
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,900
<48-11,Stacy>直到他们作出你认为对的选择
<48-11,Stacy>until they made the choice you knew was right.

630
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,490
<48-11,Stacy>你会冲他们嚷嚷  这只是条该死的腿
<48-11,Stacy>You'd shove it in their face that it's just a damn leg.

631
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,430
<48-11,Stacy>你觉得自己不该活下去吗
<48-11,Stacy>You don't think you deserve to live?

632
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,280
<48-11,Stacy>觉得自己不该得到幸福吗
<48-11,Stacy>You don't think you deserve to be happy?

633
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,990
<48-11,Stacy>让他们截肢就好了
<48-11,Stacy>Now let them cut off your leg.

634
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,790
<48-12,House>我做不到  做不到
<48-12,House>I can't. I can't.

635
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,430
<48-12,House>抱歉
<48-12,House>I'm sorry.

636
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,340
<48-13,Stacy>光是疼就能把你疼死
<48-13,Stacy>The pain alone is gonna kill you.

637
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,310
<48-14,House>我知道  我知道
<48-14,House>I know. I know.

638
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,030
<48-14,House>帮我去跟医生说下
<48-14,House>I need you to talk to the doctor.

639
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,270
<49-1,Cuddy>他改主意了吗
<49-1,Cuddy>He change his mind?

640
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,000
<49-1,Cuddy>没有
<49-1,Cuddy>No.

641
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,230
<49-2,Stacy>他要求对他进行化学昏迷
<49-2,Stacy>He's asked to be put in a chemically induced coma...

642
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,270
<49-2,Stacy>让他能在疼痛最严重的时候  一路睡过去
<49-2,Stacy>so that he can sleep through the worst part of the pain.

643
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,040
<49-3,Cuddy>我们可以这么做
<49-3,Cuddy>We can do that.

644
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,210
<49-4,Stacy>他昏迷之后会怎么做
<49-4,Stacy>What happens after he's in the coma?

645
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,160
<49-5,Cuddy>当然会严密监视他的情况
<49-5,Cuddy>We'll obviously monitor his condition closely,

646
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,200
<49-5,Cuddy>如果在接下来48小时内
<49-5,Cuddy>and if he can get through the next 48 hours

647
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,400
<49-5,Cuddy>心脏没有其他状况
<49-5,Cuddy>without another cardiac incident--

648
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,620
<49-6,Stacy>我是他的健康医疗代理
<49-6,Stacy>I meant, I'm his health care proxy.

649
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,350
<49-6,Stacy>他不能做决定期间  我可以代理
<49-6,Stacy>I get to make medical decisions for him if he's not able to.

650
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
<49-7,Cuddy>你该跟他谈谈他想怎么做
<49-7,Cuddy>You should talk to him about what he wants to do.

651
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,510
<49-8,Stacy>我知道他想怎么做
<49-8,Stacy>I know what he wants.

652
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,160
<49-8,Stacy>但在他昏迷期间  我就能做主  对吗
<49-8,Stacy>But if he's out, it's my call, right?

653
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,340
<50-1,Cuddy>你会在一分钟内昏迷
<50-1,Cuddy>You'll be out in less than a minute.

654
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,870
<50-3,Stacy>谢谢
<50-3,Stacy>Thank you.

655
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,430
<50-4,House>等我醒来后再见
<50-4,House>I'll see you when I wake up.

656
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,880
<50-4,House>我们去打高尔夫
<50-4,House>We'll go golfing.

657
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,210
<50-5,Stacy>我爱你
<50-5,Stacy>I love you.

658
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,990
<50-5,Stacy>我也爱你
<50-5,Stacy>I love you too.

659
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,760
<50-5,Stacy>对不起
<50-5,Stacy>I'm sorry.

660
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,370
<50-6,House>你没什么好道歉的
<50-6,House>You've got nothing to be sorry about.

661
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,790
<50-7,Stacy>你之前说过的折衷选择
<50-7,Stacy>The middle ground you were talking about--

662
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,320
<50-8,Cuddy>进行手术  切除坏死肌肉
<50-8,Cuddy>We go in, take out the dead muscle.

663
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,020
<50-8,Cuddy>还是会有一些伤害的风险  但...
<50-8,Cuddy>There's still some risk of reperfusion injury, but--

664
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,760
<50-9,Stacy>给我需要签名的表格
<50-9,Stacy>Give me the forms you need signed.

665
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,950
<50-10,Cuddy>你这是在救他的命
<50-10,Cuddy>You're saving his life.

666
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,280
<50-11,Stacy>他不会那么想的
<50-11,Stacy>He won't see it that way.

667
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,820
<51-1,House>由于切除肌肉的范围太大
<51-1,House>Because of the extent of the muscle removed,

668
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,580
<51-1,House>病人腿部功能严重受损
<51-1,House>the utility of the patient's leg was severely compromised.

669
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,950
<51-1,House>由于确诊时间延误太久
<51-1,House>Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis,

670
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,280
<51-1,House>病人持续遭受慢性剧痛
<51-1,House>the patient continues to experience chronic pain.

671
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,920
<51-2,Caring>-她没权利那样做  -她有代理权
<51-2,Caring>- She had no right to do that. - She had the proxy.

672
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,460
<51-4,Caring>她明知他不想动手术
<51-4,Caring>She knew he didn't want the surgery.

673
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,620
<51-5,Rebellious>她是为了救他的命
<51-5,Rebellious>She saved his life.

674
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,450
<51-6,Keen>这点没人知道  也许他会好转
<51-6,Keen>We don't know that. Maybe he would've been fine.

675
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,390
<51-7,Caring>没关系  这是病人的选择
