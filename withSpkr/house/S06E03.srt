1
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,320
<1-1,Vince>我想其他人都死了
<1-1,Vince>I guess everybody else is dead...

2
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,760
<1-1,Vince>意味着敌人数量远超过我们
<1-1,Vince>Which means we're totally outnumbered.

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,690
<1-1,Vince>我们得用强大的火力弥补
<1-1,Vince>We got to make up for that in pure firepower.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
<1-2,Lee>你是想袭击补给区  对吧
<1-2,Lee>You want to raid the feeding area, don't you?

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,230
<1-3,Vince>那里面有两箱手榴弹
<1-3,Vince>Two boxes of grenades in there.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,540
<1-3,Vince>这是突围的唯一机会
<1-3,Vince>It's our only chance at getting out.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,460
<1-4,Roy>文森  那是个死亡陷阱
<1-4,Roy>Uh, Vince, that place is a death trap.

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,110
<1-5,Vince>幸亏  我有大型冲击波枪
<1-5,Vince>Lucky for you, I've got the mega-blaster.

9
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,220
<1-5,Vince>李  你抄右  雷  你从正前方进攻
<1-5,Vince>Lee, you go right. Roy, straight down the middle.

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,410
<1-5,Vince>我来掩护你们
<1-5,Vince>I'll cover you both.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,260
<1-6,Vince>一  二  三
<1-6,Vince>1, 2, 3!

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,900
<1-7,Lee>掩护到哪去了
<1-7,Lee>Where's that cover fire?

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,000
<1-7,Lee>用大型冲击波枪啊  老兄
<1-7,Lee>Mega-blaster, dude. Mega-blaster!

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,680
<1-8,Roy>搞什么鬼
<1-8,Roy>Aah! What the hell?

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,290
<1-9,Lee>到手了  文森  你哪儿去了
<1-9,Lee>Got it! Vince, where are you?

16
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,370
<1-10,Roy>我甩不掉它们
<1-10,Roy>Ah, I can't get them off of me!

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,930
<1-11,Lee>文森你这个窝囊废  跑哪儿了
<1-11,Lee>Vince, you d-bag, where are you?

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,910
<1-11,Lee>该死
<1-11,Lee>Damn it. Damn it.

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,100
<2-1,Roy>有没搞错  文森
<2-1,Roy>Damn it, Vince.

20
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,600
<2-2,Roy>你觉得这血腥场面好玩吗
<2-2,Roy>That blood look funny to you?

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,160
<2-3,Lee>还在改进中  那个编码有点乱
<2-3,Lee>Still working on it. The code's a little janky.

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,890
<2-4,Lee>老板  你就忍心这么看着我们
<2-4,Lee>Hey, boss, you just like watching us

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,140
<2-4,Lee>被打得屁滚尿流吗
<2-4,Lee>Get our asses shredded?

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,780
<2-5,Roy>不是想说你不够积极
<2-5,Roy>Yeah, not that you're not hilarious,

25
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,450
<2-5,Roy>但我们三个月内就要上市啊
<2-5,Roy>But we hit the shelves in three months.

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,400
<2-6,Roy>文森
<2-6,Roy>Vince?

27
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,330
<2-7,Lee>文森  你怎么了
<2-7,Lee>Vince, what's wrong?

28
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,880
<2-8,Vince>我的手被火烧一样疼
<2-8,Vince>My hands. They're on fire.

29
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,260
<3-1,Thirteen>神经传导速度测试正常  排除腕管综合症
<3-1,Thirteen>Your NCV test was normal. Rules out carpal tunnel.

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,080
<3-1,Thirteen>没有明显外伤  您的血液循环正常
<3-1,Thirteen>No evidence of trauma. Your blood work looks normal.

31
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,470
<3-2,Vince>-那我得什么病  -我也不知道
<3-2,Vince>- Then what is it? - I don't know.

32
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,910
<3-3,Thirteen>我会将你转去神经专科
<3-3,Thirteen>I'll arrange to have you transferred to a neurologist.

33
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,850
<3-3,Thirteen>神经专科吗
<3-3,Thirteen>A neurologist?

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,860
<3-4,Vince>你们这不是有个名声在外的诊断专家吗
<3-4,Vince>Don't you have some famous diagnostics guy?

35
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,750
<3-4,Vince>他干嘛去了
<3-4,Vince>What's he doing?

36
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,780
<4-1,House>我辞职
<4-1,House>I quit.

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,410
<4-2,Foreman>你不能辞职
<4-2,Foreman>You can't quit.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,380
<4-3,House>我猜你把我和葛伦霍弄混了[断背山男主角]
<4-3,House>I think you're confusing me with Jake Gyllenhaal.

39
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,720
<4-4,Cuddy>-豪斯  你还好吗 -很好  而且我想保持这样
<4-4,Cuddy>-House, are you okay?-Yeah, and I want to stay that way.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,650
<4-5,House>我的心理医生说
<4-5,House>Talked it over with my therapist.

41
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,710
<4-5,House>我需要改变我的生活环境  习惯
<4-5,House>I need to change my environment, my habits.

42
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,700
<4-6,Foreman>可他准你把行医执照拿回来了
<4-6,Foreman>But he cleared you to get your license back.

43
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,900
<4-7,House>所以对我找份新的研究性工作很有帮助
<4-7,House>Which will help immensely with my new job in research.

44
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,710
<4-7,House>我发出了几份简历
<4-7,House>I've sent out some resumes.

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,040
<4-7,House>做研究就不用看病人  更小的压力
<4-7,House>Research means no patients, less pressure.

46
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,220
<4-8,Cuddy>你才刚出来
<4-8,Cuddy>Well, you just got out.

47
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,720
<4-8,Cuddy>你花时间想透彻了吗
<4-8,Cuddy>Have you had enough time to think this through?

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,950
<4-8,Cuddy>对不起
<4-8,Cuddy>I'm sorry.

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,870
<4-9,House>我知道这会影响到你们俩
<4-9,House>I know this will affect both of you...

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,820
<4-9,House>还有十三
<4-9,House>And Thirteen...

51
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,790
<4-9,House>还有大鼻子情圣
<4-9,House>And the one with the nose.

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,480
<4-9,House>我只是不能冒险回来这里
<4-9,House>I just can't risk coming back here.

53
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,260
<4-10,Cuddy>好吧
<4-10,Cuddy>Okay.

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
<4-11,Cuddy>真是出乎意料
<4-11,Cuddy>That was surprising.

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,680
<4-12,Foreman>我想领导这个部门
<4-12,Foreman>I want to run the department.

56
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,780
<4-13,Cuddy>你能在豪斯彻底走人之后
<4-13,Cuddy>You consider waiting until House clears the lobby

57
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,500
<4-13,Cuddy>再对他的位置虎视眈眈行吗
<4-13,Cuddy>Before you start angling for his job?

58
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,560
<4-14,Foreman>他不是过世或耍脾气  而且要有人来领导
<4-14,Foreman>He's not dead or sentimental and somebody needs to do it.

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,790
<4-15,Cuddy>并非必须的
<4-15,Cuddy>Not necessarily.

60
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,670
<4-15,Cuddy>诊断科并不存在
<4-15,Cuddy>Departments of diagnostic medicine don't exist.

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,550
<4-15,Cuddy>我们设这个部门是因为有豪斯
<4-15,Cuddy>The only reason we have one is because of House.

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,730
<4-16,Foreman>你重新给我们分配了职务
<4-16,Foreman>You reassigned us,

63
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,820
<4-16,Foreman>给了我们三个月工资
<4-16,Foreman>Kept us on payroll for three months.

64
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,190
<4-16,Foreman>你也同样可以给我一次机会
<4-16,Foreman>You might as well give me a chance.

65
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,260
<4-17,Cuddy>你是个好医生
<4-17,Cuddy>You're a great doctor.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,860
<4-17,Cuddy>我希望你留在神经专科
<4-17,Cuddy>I want you to stay on in neuro.

67
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,690
<4-17,Cuddy>豪斯是个天才
<4-17,Cuddy>But House was a genius.

68
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,090
<4-18,Foreman>豪斯也是个任性的  官司缠身的瘾君子
<4-18,Foreman>House was an egotistical, pill-popping lawsuit magnet...

69
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,640
<4-18,Foreman>同时也是个天才
<4-18,Foreman>And a genius.

70
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,290
<4-18,Foreman>我跟他共事比任何人都久
<4-18,Foreman>And I worked with him longer than anybody else.

71
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,460
<4-18,Foreman>我能胜任的
<4-18,Foreman>I can do this.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,180
<4-19,Cuddy>你只有一次机会
<4-19,Cuddy>You get one shot.

73
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
<5-1,Taub>豪斯要做什么
<5-1,Taub>What's House gonna do?

74
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,210
<5-2,Foreman>不知道  可他走了
<5-2,Foreman>No idea, but he's gone.

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,240
<5-2,Foreman>还是将注意力放在解决医学难题上吧
<5-2,Foreman>So how about we focus on the medicine?

76
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,640
<5-3,Thirteen>-干嘛  -你成我上司了
<5-3,Thirteen>- What? - You're the boss.

77
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,730
<5-3,Thirteen>挺性感的
<5-3,Thirteen>It's kind of sexy.

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,420
<5-4,Taub>我以为他只是换了条裤子
<5-4,Taub>Here I thought it was just the pants.

79
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,720
<5-4,Taub>糖尿病性神经病变
<5-4,Taub>Uh, diabetic neuropathy?

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,420
<5-5,Foreman>糖化血色素正常
<5-5,Foreman>Hba1c looks fine.

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,570
<5-5,Foreman>可能是甲状腺机能减退
<5-5,Foreman>Could be hypothyroidism.

82
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,870
<5-6,Thirteen>没有疲劳或增重的症状
<5-6,Thirteen>No fatigue or weight gain.

83
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,200
<5-6,Thirteen>那是复合性局部疼痛综合症吗
<5-6,Thirteen>What about complex regional pain syndrome?

84
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,160
<5-7,Taub>想法不错
<5-7,Taub>That's a good idea.

85
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,830
<5-8,Foreman>做相关测试  瞧瞧我们
<5-8,Foreman>Let's run with it. Look at that.

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,320
<5-8,Foreman>没有豪斯  工作照旧
<5-8,Foreman>No House, the job still gets done.

87
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,560
<5-9,Thirteen>还是少了什么
<5-9,Thirteen>And yet something's missing.

88
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,800
<5-10,Taub>我矮  他黑
<5-10,Taub>I'm short. He's black.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,900
<5-10,Taub>你断背  有点
<5-10,Taub>You're gay-ish.

90
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,590
<5-12,Foreman>-所言极是 -按复合性局部疼痛综合症治疗
<5-12,Foreman>-That's it.-Treat for CRPs.

91
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,210
<5-12,Foreman>用脊椎刺激疗法
<5-12,Foreman>Prep the patient for spinal stimulation.

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
<6-1,Vince>我不相信
<6-1,Vince>I don't buy it.

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,390
<6-2,Taub>复合性局部疼痛综合症不太好理解
<6-2,Taub>CRPs isn't that well understood,

94
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,710
<6-3,Vince>我认为是汞中毒
<6-3,Vince>But I think it's mercury poisoning.

95
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,980
<6-3,Vince>我吃了很多寿司
<6-3,Vince>I eat a ton of sushi.

96
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,440
<6-4,Thirteen>你这个医学菜鸟是刚刚才从网上学来的吧
<6-4,Thirteen>And you're currently getting mixed reviews in speed-the-plow on broadway.

97
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,060
<6-4,Thirteen>搜索一下
<6-4,Thirteen>Google it.

98
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,520
<6-4,Thirteen>食用鱼类难以
<6-4,Thirteen>It's pretty hard to consume enough fish

99
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,080
<6-4,Thirteen>导致汞中毒
<6-4,Thirteen>to give yourself mercury poisoning,

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,040
<6-4,Thirteen>而且汞中毒并不会单单表现为疼痛
<6-4,Thirteen>And it doesn't usually present solely with pain.

101
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,910
<6-5,Vince>是可以的
<6-5,Vince>But it can.

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,150
<6-5,Vince>看这大西洋医学杂志
<6-5,Vince>Check out the Atlantic Medical Journal.

103
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,730
<6-5,Vince>这个人因灼烧感疼痛入院
<6-5,Vince>This guy came in with burning pain

104
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,140
<6-5,Vince>病因是由汞中毒导致的
<6-5,Vince>Caused by, uh, "erythromelalgia"

105
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,490
<6-5,Vince>红斑性肌痛症
<6-5,Vince>caused by mercury poisoning.

106
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,120
<6-6,Thirteen>有网络后谁还会要医生呢
<6-6,Thirteen>Who needs actual doctors when you got the internet?

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,930
<6-7,Vince>恕我冒犯  可是医生也会犯错
<6-7,Vince>No offense, but doctors make mistakes.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,820
<6-7,Vince>医疗失误率今年高达百分之三十
<6-7,Vince>Medical errors are up 30% this year.

109
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,810
<6-8,Taub>你再对比一下病人自己的误诊率
<6-8,Taub>You should check the rate of patient error.

110
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,430
<6-9,Vince>网络信息包罗万象
<6-9,Vince>There's a ton of information out there.

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,000
<6-9,Vince>我何不为自己自学一下
<6-9,Vince>Why wouldn't I educate myself, be my own advocate?

112
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,940
<6-9,Vince>我也有查过复合性局部疼痛综合症
<6-9,Vince>CRPs came up in my search too.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,770
<6-9,Vince>可我从没出现肤色异常
<6-9,Vince>But I've never had any skin discoloration,

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,470
<6-9,Vince>而且我的疼痛是偶发而不是持续性的
<6-9,Vince>And my pain is sporadic and not constant.

115
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,060
<6-9,Vince>肯定值得做个恶心的血检
<6-9,Vince>It's got to be worth one lousy blood test.

116
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,810
<7-1,Cameron>你知道豪斯看人家摸他的球会有什么反应
<7-1,Cameron>You know how House feels about people touching his ball.

117
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,850
<7-2,Foreman>不知道  奇斯不肯告诉我
<7-2,Foreman>No. Chase refuses to tell me.

118
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,640
<7-3,Cameron>对  我老公是断背  说不过你
<7-3,Cameron>Right. My husband's gay. Witty.

119
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,010
<7-3,Cameron>我听说你要接替豪斯
<7-3,Cameron>I hear you're taking over for House.

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,830
<7-3,Cameron>你会大有作为  恭喜你
<7-3,Cameron>You're gonna be great. Congratulations.

121
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,640
<7-4,Foreman>还未确定永久性
<7-4,Foreman>Not permanent.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,650
<7-5,Camreon>现在不是而已  陶博和十三同意吗
<7-5,Camreon>Yet. Taub and Thirteen cool with it?

123
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,960
<7-5,Camreon>陶博比你年长
<7-5,Camreon>He's older than you.

124
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,020
<7-5,Camreon>十三跟你玉帛相见
<7-5,Camreon>She's seen you naked.

125
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,360
<7-6,Foreman>说得我们不像是已经两年没有一起工作的样子
<7-6,Foreman>Not like we haven't been working together for two years now.

126
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,250
<7-7,Cameron>一起工作  与为你工作是不同的
<7-7,Cameron>Working with is different than working for.

127
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,540
<7-7,Cameron>你见过豪斯了
<7-7,Cameron>You saw House.

128
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,020
<7-7,Cameron>他怎样
<7-7,Cameron>How was he?

129
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,540
<7-8,Foreman>他
<7-8,Foreman>He was...

130
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,330
<7-8,Foreman>挺好
<7-8,Foreman>Good.

131
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,270
<7-8,Foreman>诚实  有责任感
<7-8,Foreman>He was honest, took responsibility.

132
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,660
<7-8,Foreman>还有些诡异
<7-8,Foreman>It was kind of weird.

133
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
<7-9,Cameron>十三在这边吗
<7-9,Cameron>Uh, is Thirteen around?

134
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,950
<7-9,Cameron>急诊室移交文件要她签字
<7-9,Cameron>I need her to sign off on her E.R. transfer.

135
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,900
<7-10,Foreman>她和陶博在给病人做骨髓刺激
<7-10,Foreman>She and Taub are doing a spinal stimulation.

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,450
<7-11,Cameron>他们没有
<7-11,Cameron>No, they're not.

137
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,150
<7-11,Cameron>我才刚去过导管室
<7-11,Cameron>I just dropped a patient in the cath suite,

138
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,940
<7-11,Cameron>你的手下不在那里
<7-11,Cameron>And your guys were not in there.

139
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,040
<8-1,Foreman>知道吗  骨髓刺激疗法
<8-1,Foreman>You know, usually spinal stimulation

140
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,610
<8-1,Foreman>跟病人在导管室里做的
<8-1,Foreman>Is done with the patient in the room.

141
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,570
<8-2,Thirteen>他叫我们测试他血液中的汞含量
<8-2,Thirteen>He asked us to test his blood for mercury.

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,740
<8-2,Thirteen>虽然不太可能  也并非毫无可能
<8-2,Thirteen>It's unlikely, but not impossible.

143
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,760
<8-3,Foreman>-也不是我们的结论  -一个测试并不碍事
<8-3,Foreman>- It's also not what we agreed on. - Testing doesn't hurt.

144
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,850
<8-4,Thirteen>只需要二十分钟  我觉得没关系
<8-4,Thirteen>It only takes 20 minutes. I figured it didn't matter.

145
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,860
<8-5,Foreman>我是觉得
<8-5,Foreman>I'm thinking

146
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,410
<8-5,Foreman>有没有关系是由我来决定
<8-5,Foreman>I should decide when it matters.

147
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,530
<8-6,Taub>在你发完官威之后
<8-6,Taub>When you're done marking your territory...

148
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,690
<8-6,Taub>测试结果
<8-6,Taub>Test results.

149
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,140
<8-6,Taub>惊喜  惊喜啊
<8-6,Taub>Surprise, surprise.

150
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,980
<8-6,Taub>马·韦伯错了[医学喜剧主角]
<8-6,Taub>Marcus Webly was wrong.

151
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,970
<8-7,Foreman>我来处理
<8-7,Foreman>I'll handle this.

152
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,850
<8-7,Foreman>你以为自己不会百感交集吗
<8-7,Foreman>You expected not to have mixed feelings?

153
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,270
<9-1,House>我知道决定是正确的
<9-1,House>I know it's the right call.

154
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,820
<9-1,House>只是不知道怎么打发时间
<9-1,House>Just don't know what to do with my time.

155
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,290
<9-1,House>我的腿痛日益加剧
<9-1,House>And my leg

156
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,250
<9-1,House>疼痛加剧得很厉害
<9-1,House>pain's flared up

157
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,270
<9-1,House>从我离开梅菲尔德后
<9-1,House>since I left Mayfield.

158
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,390
<9-1,House>布洛芬毫无作用
<9-1,House>Ibuprofen's barely putting a dent in it.

159
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,610
<9-1,House>-你要养成一个爱好  -是的
<9-1,House>- You need a hobby. - Right.

160
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,150
<9-2,House>全世界的医生都是让病人收集可爱小陶俑 来治疗慢性疼痛\
<9-2,House>Doctors the world over treat chronic pain with collections of Hummel figurines.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,950
<9-2,House>我并不是说你要建立很烂的爱好
<9-2,House>No, I didn't say you need a lame hobby.

162
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,810
<9-2,House>你需要能让你集中精力的
<9-2,House>You need something to keep you engaged,

163
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,970
<9-3,House>能让你与人交往的爱好
<9-3,House>Connected to other people.

164
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,520
<9-3,House>你已经让我找了个室友
<9-3,House>You already made me get a roommate.

165
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,240
<9-3,House>威尔森只有一间卧室
<9-3,House>Wilson's got one bedroom.

166
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,000
<9-3,House>再进一步咱俩就只能脱裤子了
<9-3,House>I don't think we can get any more connected without unzipping.

167
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,820
<9-3,House>好吧
<9-3,House>Okay.

168
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,250
<9-3,House>那威尔森有什么爱好呢
<9-3,House>So what does Wilson like to do?

169
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,270
<10-1,Foreman>文森  我是福曼医生  诊断部门的主管
<10-1,Foreman>Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman, head of diagnostics.

170
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,650
<10-2,Vince>你就是代替那个天才的人
<10-2,Vince>So you must be the genius' replacement.

171
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,440
<10-3,Foreman>我倾向于觉得自己是天才2.0版
<10-3,Foreman>I prefer to think of myself as genius. 2.0.

172
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,600
<10-3,Foreman>你的验血结果排除了汞中毒
<10-3,Foreman>Your blood tests ruled out mercury poisoning.

173
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,050
<10-4,Vince>-我的汞指数是多少  -2.8
<10-4,Vince>- What was my mercury level? - 2.8.

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,050
<10-5,Foreman>-就是意味着每1/10公升就 -我知道意味什么
<10-5,Foreman>-That means for every deciliter of... -I know what it means.

175
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,320
<10-6,Vince>我也知道高出正常标准
<10-6,Vince>I also know it's above normal.

176
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,160
<10-6,Vince>我想要汞螯合治疗
<10-6,Vince>I want mercury chelation.

177
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,630
<10-7,Foreman>你的汞指数还不至于导致你现在的症状
<10-7,Foreman>Your level isn't elevated enough to produce your symptoms.

178
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,050
<10-8,Vince>除非我们降低它的水平我会不会改善
<10-8,Vince>You can't know that until we de-elevate it

179
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,350
<10-8,Vince>你才能判断
<10-8,Vince>And see if my pain improves.

180
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,500
<10-8,Vince>这是我的主管判断
<10-8,Vince>It's a judgment call.

181
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,920
<10-9,Foreman>根据你10年的医疗培训吗
<10-9,Foreman>Based on ten years of medical training?

182
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,940
<10-9,Foreman>我认为是复合性局部疼痛综合症
<10-9,Foreman>I think you have CRPs.

183
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,290
<10-9,Foreman>我想尝试刺激脊髓
<10-9,Foreman>I want to try spinal stimulation.

184
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,220
<10-10,Vince>所以简单说来凭你美其名曰的直觉
<10-10,Vince>So, basically, you want to shove a needle in my spine

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,610
<10-10,Vince>我坚持做螯合治疗
<10-10,Vince>I'll stick with the chelation.

186
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,890
<10-11,Foreman>如果你不想好转那就这样吧
<10-11,Foreman>If you don't want to get better, I think we're done.

187
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,870
<10-12,Vince>就这样吧是什么意思
<10-12,Vince>What do you mean "done"?

188
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,310
<10-13,Foreman>既然你对我的治疗建议不感兴趣
<10-13,Foreman>You're not interested in my medical opinion.

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,890
<10-13,Foreman>那我要去看下一位病人了
<10-13,Foreman>I'll move on to my next patient.

190
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,780
<10-13,Foreman>你可以找另外一个医生
<10-13,Foreman>You'll move on to a doctor willing to run

191
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,870
<10-13,Foreman>给你做那些根本没必要的测试
<10-13,Foreman>All the unnecessary tests and procedures you want.

192
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,500
<10-13,Foreman>或者就待在这儿治疗
<10-13,Foreman>Or you can stick around and be cured.

193
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,590
<10-13,Foreman>对我来说没什么不同
<10-13,Foreman>Makes no difference to me.

194
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,960
<11-1,Thirteen>我很高兴你改变主意了
<11-1,Thirteen>I'm glad you changed your mind.

195
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,330
<11-2,Vince>我怎么不知道
<11-2,Vince>Don't know about that

196
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,560
<11-2,Vince>福曼医生强迫我的
<11-2,Vince>Doctor. Foreman basically strong-armed me,

197
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,850
<11-2,Vince>令我印象深刻
<11-2,Vince>Which is impressive.

198
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,960
<11-3,Taub>100赫兹刺激
<11-3,Taub>Stimulating at 100 Hertz.

199
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,570
<11-3,Taub>我猜你肯定发现
<11-3,Taub>Guess you found him

200
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,380
<11-3,Taub>他比我们两个更善于说服人
<11-3,Taub>A little more persuasive than two of us...

201
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,380
<11-3,Taub>尤其是裤子
<11-3,Taub>Probably the pants.

202
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,480
<11-4,Vince>他让我想起我自己
<11-4,Vince>He reminds me of me.

203
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,540
<11-5,Thirteen>-会痛吗  -正确操作是不会痛的
<11-5,Thirteen>- Is it supposed to hurt? - Not if we're in correctly.

204
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,420
<11-5,Thirteen>手痛还是背痛
<11-5,Thirteen>Is it your hands? Your back?

205
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,830
<11-6,Vince>不是  是胸口
<11-6,Vince>No, my chest.

206
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,100
<11-6,Vince>喘不过气了
<11-6,Vince>Can't breathe.

207
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,630
<11-7,Taub>心率140  还在上升
<11-7,Taub>Heart rate's 140, climbing.

208
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,200
<11-8,Thirteen>不要动
<11-8,Thirteen>You need to hold still.

209
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,770
<11-9,Vince>你们做了什么
<11-9,Vince>What did you do?

210
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,480
<11-10,Taub>深呼吸
<11-10,Taub>Deep breaths.

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,450
<11-11,Thirteen>他肺里开始积水了
<11-11,Thirteen>His lungs are filling with fluid.

212
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,960
<12-1,Taub>检查过文森肺部的液体
<12-1,Taub>Analysis of the fluid from Vince's lungs

213
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,880
<12-1,Taub>结果显示实际上是心脏的问题
<12-1,Taub>Shows the lung problem is really a heart problem.

214
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,660
<12-1,Taub>他左心室在变厚
<12-1,Taub>He's got a thickened left ventricle.

215
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,790
<12-2,Thirteen>做脊髓刺激时心脏加速
<12-2,Thirteen>When his heart sped up during the procedure,

216
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,010
<12-2,Thirteen>压力就到达肺部
<12-2,Thirteen>It jacked up the pressure in his lungs,

217
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,360
<12-2,Thirteen>导致肺水肿
<12-2,Thirteen>Causing pulmonary edema.

218
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,710
<12-3,Foreman>还好我让他做了脊髓刺激
<12-3,Foreman>Good thing I talked the patient into spinal stimulation.

219
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,750
<12-4,Thirteen>让我们发现了新症状
<12-4,Thirteen>It did lead us to discovering a new symptom

220
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,630
<12-4,Thirteen>也证明了汞中毒是不成立的
<12-4,Thirteen>And proved he was wrong about mercury poisoning.

221
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,500
<12-5,Foreman>很幸运发现这个
<12-5,Foreman>We lucked into that discovery,

222
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,800
<12-5,Foreman>同时对复合性局部疼痛综合症的判断错了
<12-5,Foreman>And we were wrong about CRPs.

223
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,890
<12-5,Foreman>心室增厚外加神经病
<12-5,Foreman>Ventricular thickening plus neuropathy

224
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,970
<12-6,Taub>-和莱姆病一样了  -还有关节痛
<12-6,Taub>- Could equal Lyme disease. - Not without joint pain.

225
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,670
<12-7,Foreman>他的新游戏是什么时候完成的呢
<12-7,Foreman>When is his new game coming out?

226
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,990
<12-8,Thirteen>几个月了
<12-8,Thirteen>Couple months.

227
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,410
<12-9,Foreman>他肯定不停的工作
<12-9,Foreman>He's probably working nonstop.

228
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,300
<12-9,Foreman>可能用了比咖啡还有提神的东西
<12-9,Foreman>Might be using more than coffee to power through.

229
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,180
<12-10,Taub>可卡因可以解释这个症状
<12-10,Taub>Cocaine use explains the symptoms.

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,540
<12-11,Thirteen>那我们就去他的办公室检查
<12-11,Thirteen>So we search his office for drugs.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,670
<12-11,Thirteen>不要
<12-11,Thirteen>No.

232
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,790
<12-12,Foreman>我们去问他
<12-12,Foreman>We're gonna ask him.

233
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,290
<13-1,Cooking Teacher>烹饪在很多方便都和音乐很相似
<13-1,Cooking Teacher>In a lot of ways, cooking is like music.

234
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,630
<13-1,Cooking Teacher>不同的音符组成交响乐
<13-1,Cooking Teacher>Different elements combine to make a symphony.

235
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,680
<13-2,House>不同之处是贝多芬第五交响乐
<13-2,House>Difference is that Beethoven's 5th

236
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,970
<13-2,House>不会在第二天被拉出来
<13-2,House>Isn't gonna be poop tomorrow.

237
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,890
<13-3,Wilson>我同意让你跟着我的唯一条件
<13-3,Wilson>What was my one condition for allowing you

238
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,850
<13-4,House>-是什么  -不要像混蛋一样
<13-4,House>- To tag along? - Try not to be a jerk.

239
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,220
<13-4,House>我在努力  但失败了
<13-4,House>I'm trying. I'm just failing.

240
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,260
<13-5,Wilson>好好做你的肉丸  保持心态开放
<13-5,Wilson>Roll your meatballs and keep an open mind.

241
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,970
<13-6,Wilson>要你现在试着不开肉丸的玩笑有多难呢
<13-6,Wilson>How hard are you trying not to make a ball joke right now?

242
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,980
<13-7,House>冒烟了
<13-7,House>You're smoking.

243
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,550
<13-7,House>你的肉丸
<13-7,House>The balls.

244
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,230
<13-7,House>不  不
<13-7,House>No, no.

245
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,840
<13-8,Wilson>变色太快了
<13-8,Wilson>They're browning way too fast.

246
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,560
<13-9,House>你要小心的就是蓝色
<13-9,House>Blue is the color you got to watch out for.

247
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,470
<13-9,House>够了
<13-9,House>Enough.

248
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,990
<13-10,Wilson>天哪  里面还是生的
<13-10,Wilson>My god, they're... They're still raw inside.

249
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,090
<13-10,Wilson>等里面煮熟
<13-10,Wilson>By the time they're cooked through,

250
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,070
<13-10,Wilson>外面就已经焦了
<13-10,Wilson>The outside will be burned.

251
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,880
<13-11,House>有一种药粉可以防止那样
<13-11,House>I think there's a medicated powder for that.

252
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,620
<13-11,House>醋也可以
<13-11,House>Although vinegar could work.

253
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,010
<13-11,House>我化学教授说过  理论上说
<13-11,House>My o-chem prof talked about how, theoretically,

254
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,740
<13-11,House>一个慢性酸中毒病人的糖化血红蛋白
<13-11,House>You shouldn't trust the results of a hemoglobin A1C test

255
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,490
<13-11,House>测试结果不是完全准确的
<13-11,House>On a chronically acidotic patient.

256
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,250
<13-11,House>血液中的酸会减慢
<13-11,House>The acid in the blood slows the reaction

257
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,210
<13-11,House>血色素蛋白和血糖的反应
<13-11,House>Between the hemoglobin protein and blood sugar.

258
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,420
<13-11,House>煮肉也是一样的
<13-11,House>Browning meat is the same chemical process,

259
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,160
<13-11,House>也就是说可以用酸来放慢煮熟速度
<13-11,House>Which means, it should also be slowed by acid.

260
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,960
<13-12,Wilson>听起来像那么回事
<13-12,Wilson>That actually makes sense.

261
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,990
<13-12,Wilson>你也许能挽救我的丸子
<13-12,Wilson>You might've... saved my balls.

262
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,430
<13-13,House>这就对了
<13-13,House>That's the spirit.

263
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,730
<14-1,Foreman>很明显测试没有像我们预想的
<14-1,Foreman>Obviously, the procedure didn't go as planned.

264
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,110
<14-1,Foreman>心脏问题是不可预测的
<14-1,Foreman>The heart problem was unforeseeable,

265
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
<14-1,Foreman>但我觉得我还是有责任
<14-1,Foreman>But I still feel responsible.

266
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,380
<14-1,Foreman>-对不起  -没关系
<14-1,Foreman>- I'm sorry. - Okay.

267
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,370
<14-2,Vince>你们做多久了
<14-2,Vince>How long you guys been doing it?

268
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,630
<14-3,Thirteen>我认为
<14-3,Thirteen>I think it's best

269
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,050
<14-3,Thirteen>我们最好专业点
<14-3,Thirteen>If we kept things professional.

270
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,600
<14-4,Vince>很难
<14-4,Vince>Tough to do

271
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,880
<14-4,Vince>我现在看到你穿着豹纹比基尼
<14-4,Vince>Now that I've seen you rock a leopard-print bikini.

272
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,300
<14-4,Vince>顺便祝贺你们
<14-4,Vince>Congrats, by the way. Up top.

273
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,100
<14-5,Foreman>你黑了我的个人主页
<14-5,Foreman>You hacked my profile page?

274
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,930
<14-6,Vince>你的治疗差点让我心脏病发作
<14-6,Vince>Your treatment nearly gave me a heart attack.

275
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,460
<14-6,Vince>所以我要查一下你到底有没有资格
<14-6,Vince>Figured I'd check if you had the credentials

276
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,800
<14-6,Vince>给我做一个接一个的检查
<14-6,Vince>One search led to another.

277
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,040
<14-6,Vince>是她吗  我可以做屏保
<14-6,Vince>Is there a shot of just her? I'm thinking screen saver.

278
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,920
<14-7,Thirteen>我们需要知道你有没有用可卡因
<14-7,Thirteen>We need to know if you've been using cocaine.

279
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,080
<14-8,Vince>没有  兄弟  你封闭了所有人
<14-8,Vince>Nope. Dude, you just block everybody,

280
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,580
<14-8,Vince>还是你真的有三个朋友吗
<14-8,Vince>Or do you really only have three friends?

281
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,970
<14-9,Foreman>你要对我们坦白
<14-9,Foreman>We need you to be straight with us.

282
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,500
<14-9,Foreman>你必须说实话
<14-9,Foreman>We need to be able to trust you.

283
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,650
<14-10,Vince>我12年前戒掉了
<14-10,Vince>I cleaned up my act 12 years ago...

284
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,330
<14-10,Vince>那是在我室友滥用之后
<14-10,Vince>After my college roommate O.D.D.

285
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,000
<14-10,Vince>好吧
<14-10,Vince>Okay.

286
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,110
<15-1,Foreman>检查他的办公室
<15-1,Foreman>Search his office.

287
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,370
<15-2,Thirteen>你觉得他没说实话
<15-2,Thirteen>You think he was lying?

288
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,900
<15-3,Foreman>不  但我还不确定
<15-3,Foreman>No. But I'm not sure.

289
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,160
<15-4,Thirteen>刚才应该问他
<15-4,Thirteen>It was worth asking.

290
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,820
<15-4,Thirteen>如果他说是  我们就省得跑一趟了
<15-4,Thirteen>If he'd have said yes, it would've saved us a trip.

291
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,790
<15-5,Foreman>但他没有
<15-5,Foreman>But he didn't.

292
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,210
<15-6,Thirteen>你应该忘掉他
<15-6,Thirteen>You have to forget about him.

293
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,430
<15-7,Foreman>-病人吗  -豪斯
<15-7,Foreman>- The patient? - House.

294
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,240
<15-8,Thirteen>一开始你想和他一样  但行不通
<15-8,Thirteen>First, you try acting like him. That doesn't work.

295
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
<15-8,Thirteen>所以你就走相反路线
<15-8,Thirteen>So then you try the opposite.

296
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,640
<15-8,Thirteen>现在你生气是因为不得不用回他的招数
<15-8,Thirteen>Now you're mad because you have to use his move.

297
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,010
<15-9,Foreman>我觉得自己像汤姆·布雷迪的替补
<15-9,Foreman>I feel like Tom Brady's backup.

298
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,750
<15-10,Thirteen>汤姆·布雷迪的替补可以挣1千万吗
<15-10,Thirteen>Tom Brady's backup now makes $10 million.

299
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,100
<15-10,Thirteen>别再比较了
<15-10,Thirteen>Stop comparing.

300
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,240
<15-10,Thirteen>做你自己就很好
<15-10,Thirteen>You can do this by being you.

301
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,910
<15-11,Foreman>我们还是要检查他的办公室
<15-11,Foreman>We should still check out his office,

302
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,010
<15-11,Foreman>跟他同事了解一下
<15-11,Foreman>Talk to his coworkers.

303
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,460
<15-12,Thirteen>我和陶一起去
<15-12,Thirteen>I'll get Taub.

304
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,750
<15-13,Foreman>还有
<15-13,Foreman>And...

305
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,740
<15-13,Foreman>谢谢你
<15-13,Foreman>Thanks.

306
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,980
<15-13,Foreman>对了  晚上7:00一起吃饭
<15-13,Foreman>Oh, and dinner tonight at 7:00.

307
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,910
<15-14,Thirteen>可以改到8:00吗
<15-14,Thirteen>Can we make it 8:00?

308
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,600
<15-15,Foreman>已经定了7:00的位子了
<15-15,Foreman>Already made a reservation for 7:00.

309
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,800
<16-2,House>我正在做土豆团子
<16-2,House>I'm making gnocchi.

310
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,510
<16-3,Cuddy>我不想打扰你
<16-3,Cuddy>Oh, I didn't mean to intrude.

311
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,800
<16-4,House>-只是  -塞西尔在上我的烹饪课
<16-4,House>- I just... - Cecile's in my cooking class.

312
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,120
<16-4,House>她不会说英语
<16-4,House>She doesn't speak English.

313
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,630
<16-6,House>如果你要烤土豆
<16-6,House>If you bake the potatoes

314
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,790
<16-7,House>水分就比煮土豆少
<16-7,House>Instead of boiling them, it's less moisture,

315
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,740
<16-7,House>少点麸粉  团子颜色就浅
<16-7,House>Fewer gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.

316
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,980
<16-8,Cuddy>-你看起来不错  -感觉好多了
<16-8,Cuddy>- You seem good. - Feeling better.

317
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,360
<16-11,House>豪斯  我想和你谈一下
<16-11,House>House, I need to talk to you

318
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,370
<16-12,Cuddy>关于你离开医院的事情
<16-12,Cuddy>About your leaving the hospital.

319
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,620
<16-13,House>我是喜欢低声下气
<16-13,House>I do love a good groveling,

320
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,550
<16-13,House>-但这是我最终决定  -好的
<16-13,House>- But my decision is final. - That's fine

321
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,260
<16-14,Cuddy>只要你不是因为我离开
<16-14,Cuddy>As long as I'm not the reason for it.

322
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,950
<16-14,Cuddy>我知道听起来很自恋  但是
<16-14,Cuddy>I know that sounds completely narcissistic, but...

323
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,860
<16-14,Cuddy>是的
<16-14,Cuddy>Yeah.

324
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,860
<16-15,House>但不是这样的
<16-15,House>But it's not.

325
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,870
<16-15,House>我们调情接吻
<16-15,House>We flirted. We kissed.

326
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,180
<16-15,House>我爱抚你
<16-15,House>I fondled.

327
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,330
<16-15,House>我幻觉  我们共度了一个夜晚
<16-15,House>I hallucinated a night with you

328
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,960
<16-15,House>还在医院的阳台上喊出来
<16-15,House>And yelled it from a hospital balcony.

329
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,130
<16-15,House>你不是自恋的人
<16-15,House>You're not a narcissist.

330
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,060
<16-16,Cuddy>那我是什么
<16-16,Cuddy>So what am I?

331
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,580
<16-17,House>不是我离开的原因
<16-17,House>Not the reason I'm leaving.

332
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,150
<16-17,House>豪斯
<16-17,House>House...

333
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,550
<16-18,Cuddy>我会想你的
<16-18,Cuddy>I'm gonna miss you.

334
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,300
<16-19,Cecile>女士  要么吻她要么离开
<16-19,Cecile>Lady, either kiss him or leave.

335
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,650
<16-19,Cecile>我们还要工作
<16-19,Cecile>We got work to do.

336
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,660
<16-20,House>你就不能不说话吗
<16-20,House>You just couldn't keep your trap shut.

337
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,380
<16-21,Cecile>做你的团子吧
<16-21,Cecile>Make the damn gnocchi.

338
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,180
<16-22,Cuddy>再见
<16-22,Cuddy>Bye.

339
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,840
<17-1,Taub>我猜你肯定不急着回办公室
<17-1,Taub>I guess you're not in a hurry to get back to the office.

340
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,340
<17-2,Thirteen>你着急吗
<17-2,Thirteen>And you are?

341
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,410
<17-3,Taub>我不用避开我男朋友
<17-3,Taub>I'm not trying to avoid my boyfriend.

342
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,770
<17-3,Taub>我是蜥蜴  不是白痴
<17-3,Taub>I'm a lizard, not an idiot.

343
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,420
<17-3,Taub>你从一上了车就心情不好
<17-3,Taub>You've been in a crappy mood since we got in the car.

344
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,010
<17-4,Thirteen>难道你喜欢被一个24小时前
<17-4,Thirteen>And you're completely okay with being ordered around

345
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,860
<17-4,Thirteen>还是和你同级的人随意差遣吗
<17-4,Thirteen>By someone who 24 hours ago was basically your equal?

346
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,730
<17-5,Taub>我跟你不同  我不想被区别对待
<17-5,Taub>Unlike you, I didn't expect anything different.

347
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,420
<17-6,Thirteen>在工作上  我会慢慢适应
<17-6,Thirteen>The work part, I can get used to.

348
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,800
<17-6,Thirteen>他没邀请我去吃晚餐
<17-6,Thirteen>He didn't ask me to go to dinner.

349
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,100
<17-6,Thirteen>他只是通知我
<17-6,Thirteen>He told me we were going.

350
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,480
<17-6,Thirteen>他以前从不这样
<17-6,Thirteen>He's never done that before.

351
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,280
<17-7,Taub>为了打平手
<17-7,Taub>So even the score

352
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,420
<17-7,Taub>晚上回家
<17-7,Taub>Go home tonight,

353
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,500
<17-7,Taub>穿上高跟鞋  把他当小马骑
<17-7,Taub>Put on some heels, and break him like a pony.

354
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,510
<17-7,Taub>你会感觉好些的
<17-7,Taub>You'll feel much better.

355
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,140
<17-7,Taub>怎么了
<17-7,Taub>What?

356
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,180
<17-8,Taub>就是那个
<17-8,Taub>Wow, that's one

357
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,370
<17-8,Taub>巨型鸟
<17-8,Taub>Big-ass bird.

358
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,360
<17-9,Thirteen>这太逼真了
<17-9,Thirteen>It's kind of amazing.

359
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,560
<17-9,Thirteen>这些翅膀的扇动跟真的一样
<17-9,Thirteen>The way the wings move, it's so real.

360
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,590
<17-10,Taub>滚开啊
<17-10,Taub>Get them off me!

361
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,920
<17-11,Thirteen>我知道病人怎么了
<17-11,Thirteen>I know what's wrong with the patient.

362
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,570
<17-11,Thirteen>我去告诉福曼
<17-11,Thirteen>I'm going to call Foreman.

363
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,950
<17-12,Taub>救救我
<17-12,Taub>Little help.

364
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,850
<18-1,Taub>你的拍档说是那些该死的鸟提升游戏的真实度
<18-1,Taub>Your partner said you studied birds to improve the game animation.

365
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,660
<18-1,Taub>你碰过他们吗
<18-1,Taub>Did you touch them?

366
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,900
<18-2,Vince>不接触怎么解剖
<18-2,Vince>Can't dissect without touching.

367
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,410
<18-2,Vince>这是了解他们生理结构的最好方法
<18-2,Vince>It's the best way to understand the anatomy.

368
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,060
<18-3,Thirteen>也是传染鹦鹉病的最好途径
<18-3,Thirteen>It's also a good way to contract an infection called psittacosis.

369
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,730
<18-3,Thirteen>我们和福曼医生谈过了
<18-3,Thirteen>We spoke to Dr. Foreman.

370
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,170
<18-3,Thirteen>我们想开始使用抗生素
<18-3,Thirteen>He wants to start you on antibiotics.

371
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,450
<18-4,Vince>是那感染引发的
<18-4,Vince>Does that infection cause problems in the...

372
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,280
<18-4,Vince>勃起问题吗
<18-4,Vince>Joystick area?

373
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,170
<18-4,Vince>我有点走火入魔了
<18-4,Vince>I'm kind of stuck in play mode.

374
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,140
<18-5,Taub>我懂了  她的确美艳动人
<18-5,Taub>Yes, we get it. She's very, very pretty.

375
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,970
<18-6,Vince>不是因为她
<18-6,Vince>It's not her.

376
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,840
<18-6,Vince>是三小时前当她和她男朋友在这的时候
<18-6,Vince>I mean, it was when she was here with her boyfriend three hours ago.

377
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,690
<18-7,Thirteen>你已经勃起了三个小时了吗
<18-7,Thirteen>You've had an erection for three hours?

378
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,900
<18-8,Vince>开始  只是有些尴尬
<18-8,Vince>At first, it was just embarrassing,

379
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,340
<18-8,Vince>但是现在开始疼了
<18-8,Vince>But now it's really starting to hurt.

380
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,620
<18-8,Vince>抗生素会缓解症状吗
<18-8,Vince>Will the antibiotics help?

381
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,540
<18-9,Thirteen>我想不会  这不是鹦鹉热
<18-9,Thirteen>I'm afraid not. This isn't psittacosis.

382
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,930
<19-1,Taub>即使是在服用药物之后  他仍持续勃起
<19-1,Taub>His erection persisted even with medication.

383
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,420
<19-1,Taub>我们需要植入分流器来疏导血液
<19-1,Taub>We had to put in a surgical shunt just to drain the blood.

384
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,360
<19-2,Foreman>你爽约了
<19-2,Foreman>You missed dinner.

385
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,900
<19-2,Foreman>而且植入分流器不需要动用你们俩
<19-2,Foreman>And a shunt doesn't require both of you.

386
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,030
<19-3,Thirteen>我对工作一腔热诚
<19-3,Thirteen>I'm dedicated.

387
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,830
<19-3,Thirteen>心脏  手  还有他的小弟弟
<19-3,Thirteen>Heart, hands, hose.

388
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,880
<19-4,Taub>可能是格林巴利综合症
<19-4,Taub>Could be guillain-barre.

389
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
<19-5,Foreman>神经传导正常
<19-5,Foreman>Not with normal nerve conduction.

390
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,060
<19-5,Foreman>血小板增多症
<19-5,Foreman>Thrombocytosis.

391
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,540
<19-6,Thirteen>血小板数量没那么高
<19-6,Thirteen>His platelet count isn't that high.

392
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,240
<19-6,Thirteen>脑瘤更合理些
<19-6,Thirteen>Brain tumor makes more sense.

393
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,870
<19-7,Taub>不好意思  我只是突然想到
<19-7,Taub>I'm sorry. I just realized...

394
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,710
<19-7,Taub>关节痛和交合之痛
<19-7,Taub>Joint pain and joint pain.

395
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,290
<19-7,Taub>我不是有意想笑你们两个闹别扭的
<19-7,Taub>Honest, I wasn't laughing because of the obvious tension between the two of you.

396
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,050
<19-7,Taub>勃起是循环系统问题造成的
<19-7,Taub>Erection points to a circulatory problem.

397
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,730
<19-7,Taub>我同意福曼
<19-7,Taub>I'm with Foreman.

398
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,400
<19-8,Thirteen>脑瘤可能会导致
<19-8,Thirteen>It is possible for a brain tumor to cause

399
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,940
<19-9,Foreman>按血小板增多症治疗
<19-9,Foreman>We're going with thrombocytosis.

400
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,780
<19-9,Foreman>好吧
<19-9,Foreman>Okay.

401
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,970
<20-1,Foreman>你就因为我没邀你去吃晚餐生气
<20-1,Foreman>You're mad I didn't ask you to dinner?

402
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,120
<20-1,Foreman>我们已经在一起多久啦
<20-1,Foreman>How long have we been dating?

403
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,650
<20-2,Thirteen>就像是你在命令我
<20-2,Thirteen>It felt like an order.

404
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,360
<20-2,Thirteen>-你说话的调调  -我的调调
<20-2,Thirteen>- Your tone of voice was - My tone?

405
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,190
<20-3,Foreman>我现在压力很大
<20-3,Foreman>I'm under a little pressure right now.

406
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,250
<20-3,Foreman>让我喘口气好吗
<20-3,Foreman>How about giving me a break?

407
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,850
<20-4,Thirteen>听着  这对你我都很难
<20-4,Thirteen>Look, this is tough for both of us,

408
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,010
<20-4,Thirteen>只是我不像你  能当上部门头头
<20-4,Thirteen>Except I haven't just gotten a promotion.

409
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,300
<20-5,Foreman>这么说  你嫉妒了
<20-5,Foreman>So now you're jealous.

410
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,250
<20-6,Thirteen>不是  我只是让你别冲着手下发牢骚
<20-6,Thirteen>No. I'm just saying don't complain the burden of command to your employee

411
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,040
<20-7,Foreman>我是跟我女朋友发牢骚而已
<20-7,Foreman>I was complaining to my girlfriend.

412
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,380
<20-7,Foreman>他们是谁
<20-7,Foreman>Who are those guys?

413
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,880
<20-8,Thirteen>不知道
<20-8,Thirteen>I have no idea.

414
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,940
<20-9,Vince>要一较高下了
<20-9,Vince>Meet the competition.

415
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,350
<20-9,Vince>斯蒂芬·鲍尔森  圣马克医院的神经科医生
<20-9,Vince>Steve Paulson. Neurology, St. Mark's.

416
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,390
<20-9,Vince>幸会
<20-9,Vince>Nice to meet you.

417
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,740
<20-10,Foreman>-你请了别的医生  -还有很多别的医生
<20-10,Foreman>- You called another doctor? - Lots of other doctors.

418
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,480
<20-11,Vince>我把我的症状发在了网上
<20-11,Vince>Posted my symptoms on the internet.

419
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,840
<20-11,Vince>你们连败两局
<20-11,Vince>You guys are 0 for 2.

420
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,100
<20-11,Vince>我得找些外援
<20-11,Vince>I thought I'd look for some backup.

421
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,450
<20-11,Vince>用木瓜毒素清洁可以消除你的所有症状
<20-11,Vince>I can cure all your symptoms with my papaya toxin cleanse.

422
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,580
<20-12,Vince>每个月395美元
<20-12,Vince>Month's supply, $395.

423
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,570
<20-12,Vince>虽然这家伙没脑  但那不意味全都是
<20-12,Vince>Okay, that guy's an idiot. That doesn't mean they all are.

424
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,970
<20-13,Foreman>你们在这所医院没有行医特权
<20-13,Foreman>Neither one of you have privileges at this hospital.

425
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,960
<20-13,Foreman>请离开
<20-13,Foreman>Please leave...

426
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,420
<20-13,Foreman>现在就走
<20-13,Foreman>Now.

427
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,970
<20-14,Foreman>福曼医生  我想请问一下
<20-14,Foreman>Uh, DR. Foreman, sorry for the intrusion,

428
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,930
<20-14,Foreman>你还没给他做过头部核磁共振扫描
<20-14,Foreman>But, um, I noticed you haven't done a head MRI yet.

429
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,960
<20-14,Foreman>因为他不需要
<20-14,Foreman>Cause he doesn't need one.

430
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,320
<19-8,Thirteen>我认为他有脑瘤
<19-8,Thirteen>I'm pretty sure he's got a brain tumor.

431
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,620
<20-15,Foreman>我们考虑过这一可能性
<20-15,Foreman>We considered that

432
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,830
<20-15,Foreman>并认为血小板增多症是最可能的
<20-15,Foreman>And concluded thrombocytosis is more likely.

433
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
<20-15,Foreman>我准备给他服用羟基脲
<20-15,Foreman>I'm starting him on hydroxyurea.

434
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,530
<20-15,Foreman>他的血小板数量根本就没超标
<20-15,Foreman>His platelets don't seem anywhere near high enough.

435
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,430
<20-16,Foreman>如果你拍个片子  我肯定你会
<20-16,Foreman>If you took an image, I'm sure you'll

436
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,150
<20-16,Foreman>没有颅内压上升的迹象
<20-16,Foreman>There are no signs of increased ICP.

437
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,190
<20-16,Foreman>我不是在延缓治疗
<20-16,Foreman>I'm not delaying treatment.

438
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,100
<20-17,Vince>看来要打破僵局了
<20-17,Vince>Looks like we need a tiebreaker.

439
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,650
<20-17,Vince>哈德利医生  你怎么想呢
<20-17,Vince>Dr. Hadley, what do you think?

440
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,970
<20-18,Thirteen>我认为两个理论都有可取之处
<20-18,Thirteen>I think both theories have merit.

441
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,800
<20-19,Vince>所以要么是脑瘤
<20-19,Vince>So brain tumor,

442
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,060
<20-19,Vince>要么就是为了支持你那男友上司
<20-19,Vince>Otherwise you'd back your boss/boyfriend.

443
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,640
<20-19,Vince>我要做核磁共振扫描
<20-19,Vince>I want an MRI.

444
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,040
<20-20,Foreman>好  我来安排
<20-20,Foreman>Fine. I'll set it up.

445
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,310
<21-1,House>太好了  你起来了  正要一个人来试味
<21-1,House>Great. You're up. I need a taster.

448
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,530
<21-2,Wilson>还很早啊
<21-2,Wilson>It's a little early.

449
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,120
<21-2,Wilson>你一夜没睡吗
<21-2,Wilson>Did you even go to bed last night?

450
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,370
<21-3,House>床是给女孩用的
<21-3,House>Bed is for sissies,

451
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,760
<21-3,House>除非你在做爱
<21-3,House>Unless you're having sex, in which case...

452
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,480
<21-3,House>也不对  床始终都是给女孩用的
<21-3,House>No, bed is still for sissies.

453
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,070
<21-4,Wilson>这是不是有点走火入魔啊
<21-4,Wilson>Doesn't this seem a little bit obsessive?

454
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,340
<21-5,House>我在宰牛的时候你不该来
<21-5,House>Should've been here when I was butchering the ox.

455
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,010
<21-5,House>你还想怎样  我是个瘾君子
<21-5,House>What do you expect? I'm an addict.

456
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,140
<21-5,House>十一点我就会把所有东西都打开
<21-5,House>I turn everything up to eleven.

457
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,790
<21-6,Wilson>那是  我以为你要保持冷静
<21-6,Wilson>Yeah. I thought you were trying to tone that down.

458
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,180
<21-7,House>在半夜十一点除了玩点
<21-7,House>No. I was trying to find something

459
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,700
<21-7,House>震耳欲聋的东西还能能干嘛
<21-7,House>I could set at eleven without blowing out my eardrums.

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,290
<21-7,House>我腿疼难眠
<21-7,House>I couldn't sleep because of my leg.

463
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,830
<21-7,House>要么来做炖菜
<21-7,House>It was either make ragout

464
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,480
<21-7,House>要么去街上招妓
<21-7,House>Or go out on the street looking to score.

465
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,350
<21-8,Wilson>真是天作之合
<21-8,Wilson>Good choice.

466
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,600
<21-8,Wilson>好好吃
<21-8,Wilson>So, so good.

467
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,890
<22-1,Thirteen>他问我  我如实回答
<22-1,Thirteen>He asked me a question. I answered.

468
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,330
<22-2,Foreman>你要我自己做决定
<22-2,Foreman>You told me to make my own decisions.

469
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,890
<22-2,Foreman>我照做  你却在背后放冷箭
<22-2,Foreman>I do, and you stab me in the back.

470
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,310
<22-3,Thirteen>我已经把我隐瞒了自己的真实想法
<22-3,Thirteen>I didn't even say what I really thought.

471
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,530
<22-3,Thirteen>我被置身事外  我不喜欢这样
<22-3,Thirteen>I hedged, and I don't like that I hedged.

472
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,230
<22-4,Foreman>-如果我有合理的想法  -私下讨论
<22-4,Foreman>- If I have a legitimate opinion - You express it in private.

473
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,080
<22-4,Foreman>在公众场合  团队的意见就是你的意见
<22-4,Foreman>In public, the team opinion is your opinion.

474
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,330
<22-5,Thirteen>可现在团队的意见  变成是你的个人意见
<22-5,Thirteen>Except the team opinion is your opinion.

475
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,130
<22-6,Foreman>那是就我的职责
<22-6,Foreman>That's my job.

476
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,790
<22-7,Thirteen>那我的呢
<22-7,Thirteen>And what's mine,

477
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,750
<22-7,Thirteen>就是要我被质问的时候撒谎吗
<22-7,Thirteen>To lie when I'm asked a direct question?

478
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,030
<22-8,Foreman>你会为了豪斯这么做
<22-8,Foreman>You would've done it for House.

479
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,240
<22-8,Foreman>也许你只是不想让我成功
<22-8,Foreman>Maybe you just don't want me to succeed.

480
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,090
<22-8,Foreman>也许你只是为了晚餐的事再教训我一次
<22-8,Foreman>Maybe you just want to kick me again for not asking you to dinner.

481
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,830
<22-9,Thirteen>至少当豪斯变成不可理喻的混蛋时
<22-9,Thirteen>At least when House was being an unbelievable jerk,

482
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,520
<22-9,Thirteen>我可以跟我的男友抱怨
<22-9,Thirteen>I could talk to my boyfriend about it.

483
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,680
<22-10,Foreman>也许我就是个混蛋
<22-10,Foreman>I may be a jerk,

484
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,950
<22-10,Foreman>但是你错了
<22-10,Foreman>But you're wrong.

485
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,180
<22-10,Foreman>核磁共振检查正常
<22-10,Foreman>MRI is clean.

486
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,710
<22-10,Foreman>治疗他的血小板增多症
<22-10,Foreman>Treat him for thrombocytosis

487
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,320
<23-1,House>你来早了
<23-1,House>You're early

488
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,210
<23-2,Thirteen>你在等什么
<23-2,Thirteen>For what?

489
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,440
<23-3,House>我知道你会来这向我抱怨福曼
<23-3,House>I knew you'd show up here complaining about Foreman.

490
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,750
<23-3,House>原以为你能多撑一个星期
<23-3,House>Thought you'd hold out for another week at least.

491
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,680
<23-4,Thirteen>我只是想问你是否遇过
<23-4,Thirteen>I showed up to ask if you've seen

492
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,950
<23-4,Thirteen>低血小板数的血小板增多症
<23-4,Thirteen>Thrombocytosis with a platelet count under

493
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,370
<23-5,House>我是疯了  可我不傻
<23-5,House>I went crazy, not stupid.

494
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,730
<23-5,House>我离开
<23-5,House>I leave,

495
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,050
<23-5,House>福曼终于如愿以偿
<23-5,House>Foreman embraces his inner mugabe.

496
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,880
<23-6,Thirteen>那是什么
<23-6,Thirteen>What's that?

497
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,420
<23-7,House>毛鸡蛋  未孵化的鸡蛋
<23-7,House>Embryonali, unhatched chicken egg.

498
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,000
<23-7,House>我准备吸出一些蛋黄
<23-7,House>I'm gonna suck out some of the yolk

499
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,810
<23-7,House>把它换成炖菜料
<23-7,House>And replace it with ragout.

500
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,290
<23-7,House>你顺便告诉其他的麻风病人
<23-7,House>By the way, you can tell the other lepers

501
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,130
<23-7,House>我知道他们不来了
<23-7,House>That their absence has been noted.

502
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,270
<23-8,Thirteen>卡梅隆没来过吗
<23-8,Thirteen>Cameron didn't come by?

503
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,060
<23-9,House>爸爸的红颜知都已经发育完全了
<23-9,House>Daddy's little co-dependent is all grown up.

504
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,600
<23-9,House>给跟男友闹别扭的辣妹有机可乘
<23-9,House>Making room for daddy's hot bisexual with boyfriend problems.

505
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,000
<23-10,Thirteen>我们之间没有问题
<23-10,Thirteen>It's not a problem. It's, um...

506
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,630
<23-10,Thirteen>好吧  我们是有问题
<23-10,Thirteen>Okay. It's a problem.

507
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,090
<23-10,Thirteen>我知道
<23-10,Thirteen>I mean, I get it.

508
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,450
<23-10,Thirteen>这个病人像个噩梦
<23-10,Thirteen>The patient's a nightmare.

509
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,100
<23-10,Thirteen>他将他的病例发到网上了  你了解福曼
<23-10,Thirteen>He posted his case online. You know Foreman.

510
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,590
<23-10,Thirteen>你了解整个状况
<23-10,Thirteen>You know the situation.

511
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,560
<23-10,Thirteen>我怎么叫他保持冷静
<23-10,Thirteen>How can I get him to tone it down?

512
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,560
<23-11,House>首先  别再唯唯是诺
<23-11,House>Stop being a coward for one thing.

513
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,980
<23-12,Thirteen>他是个很害怕失败的人
<23-12,Thirteen>He's the one who's afraid of failure.

514
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,870
<23-13,House>要做我没做过的工作
<23-13,House>At a job that no one before me has ever done.

515
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,120
<23-13,House>他的恐惧是正常
<23-13,House>His fears are justified.

516
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,480
<23-13,House>可你却一心只怕他会完全控制你
<23-13,House>You're just afraid of giving him control over you,

517
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,630
<23-13,House>虽然在家里这样没什么不好
<23-13,House>Which might work at home.

518
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,720
<23-13,House>你的抗拒阻碍了他的工作
<23-13,House>It makes it almost impossible for him to do his job.

519
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,140
<23-13,House>把饼干递给我
<23-13,House>Pass me those crackers.

520
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,630
<23-14,Thirteen>你的意思是这都怪我吗
<23-14,Thirteen>You're saying this is all my fault?

521
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,380
<23-15,House>我的意思是
<23-15,House>I'm saying

522
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,870
<23-15,House>懂得适时让步  自己会快乐些
<23-15,House>That you would be happier if you learned when it's okay to give in.

523
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,990
<23-15,House>你是什么
<23-15,House>What?

524
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,040
<23-16,Thirteen>你说我只有作出让步
<23-16,Thirteen>You just suggested that I give in

525
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,420
<23-16,Thirteen>才能变得快乐
<23-16,Thirteen>So that I can be happy.

526
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,530
<23-16,Thirteen>他们在那里对你施了什么法
<23-16,Thirteen>What did they do to you in there?

527
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,150
<23-17,House>尝尝这个
<23-17,House>Taste this.

528
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,330
<23-17,House>很好吃
<23-17,House>Mmm. Good.

529
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,890
<23-18,Thirteen>是我吃过的最美味的东西
<23-18,Thirteen>This might be the best thing I've ever eaten.

530
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,240
<23-18,Thirteen>比你现在能想到的还要好
<23-18,Thirteen>And, yes, I'm including what you're thinking of now.

531
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,720
<23-18,Thirteen>你厨艺太棒了
<23-18,Thirteen>You are an amazing cook!

532
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,580
<23-19,House>我知道
<23-19,House>I know.

533
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,140
<23-19,House>可惜我的腿还是痛
<23-19,House>And yet, my leg hurts.

534
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,170
<24-1,Chase>炒了她
<24-1,Chase>Fire her.

535
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,520
<24-2,Foreman>我没想炒她
<24-2,Foreman>I'm not gonna fire her.

536
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,710
<24-3,Chase>那就别那么多心
<24-3,Chase>Then stop being such a wuss.

537
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,840
<24-4,Foreman>我哪里多心了
<24-4,Foreman>I'm not being a wuss.

538
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,670
<24-5,Chaes>质疑你的工作也是她的职责
<24-5,Chaes>Challenging you is part of her job.

539
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,610
<24-5,Chaes>只不过质疑的人是她  你就感情用事
<24-5,Chaes>But when she does it, you take it personally.

540
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,170
<24-6,Foreman>你是说我错了吗
<24-6,Foreman>So you're saying this is my fault?

541
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,620
<24-7,Chase>我只是想大事化小
<24-7,Chase>I was trying to bury it a little, but, yeah.

542
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,550
<24-7,Chase>你要么就除掉质疑你的人 要么别再小题大作
<24-7,Chase>You got to eliminate either the challenge or the reaction.

543
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,230
<24-8,Foreman>我倒是觉得该按原计划进行
<24-8,Foreman>Or we could stick with my original plan.

544
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,680
<24-8,Foreman>我们喝个烂醉  然后聊起女人的是非
<24-8,Foreman>We get drunk and talk about how girls are lame.

545
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,590
<24-9,Chase>好啊
<24-9,Chase>Yeah.

546
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,730
<24-9,Chase>问题自己就会迎刃而解
<24-9,Chase>This problem will go away on its own.

547
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,450
<25-1,Wilson>早上八点了
<25-1,Wilson>It's 8:00 in the morning.

548
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,200
<25-2,House>咖啡味冰激凌
<25-2,House>Coffee ice cream.

549
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,300
<25-3,Wilson>不做煎蛋饼  也不做栗子泥馅吗
<25-3,Wilson>No frittata? No bombolini?

550
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,730
<25-4,House>仔细思考过你说我走火入魔话
<25-4,House>Started thinking about what you said, about me obsessing.

551
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,010
<25-4,House>现在走火入魔般关注走火入魔
<25-4,House>Started obsessing about obsessing.

552
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,110
<25-4,House>所以决定要休假一天
<25-4,House>Decided to take a day off.

553
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,750
<25-5,Wilson>你不是很喜欢烹饪吗
<25-5,Wilson>You were enjoying cooking.

554
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,220
<25-6,House>有哪个正常男人
<25-6,House>How like a man

555
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,530
<25-6,House>会喜欢整天舞锅弄盆
<25-6,House>To think that I enjoy slaving over a hot stove all day

556
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,220
<25-6,House>而看着你成天跟漂亮小秘鬼混
<25-6,House>While you're off banging secretaries.

557
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,500
<25-7,Wilson>是你说它能让你忘记疼痛的
<25-7,Wilson>You said it was keeping your mind off the pain.

558
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,600
<25-8,House>我发现电视上的减肥胖子更好玩
<25-8,House>That was before I discovered the biggest loser marathon on cable.

559
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,830
<25-8,House>我假装他们能看见我吃得津津有味
<25-8,House>I like to pretend they can see me eating.

560
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,210
<25-9,Wilson>你的腿怎么样了
<25-9,Wilson>And your leg?

561
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,710
<25-10,House>没什么大碍
<25-10,House>It's fine.

562
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,840
<26-1,House>我腿疼难耐
<26-1,House>My leg's killing me.

563
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,670
<26-1,House>烹饪刚开始还管用
<26-1,House>Cooking helped for a while.

564
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,100
<26-1,House>但我很快就厌倦了
<26-1,House>I guess I got bored.

565
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,780
<26-1,House>我的腿又开始疼痛难忍
<26-1,House>My leg started hurting again.

566
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,850
<26-1,House>我开始担心  更加重了病情
<26-1,House>Then I got worried, and that made the pain worse.

567
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,490
<26-2,Nolan>你在担心什么
<26-2,Nolan>What are you worried about?

568
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,490
<26-3,House>我担心终究无计可施
<26-3,House>That nothing's gonna help.

569
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,260
<26-3,House>我要在灰暗世界里了解此生
<26-3,House>That I end up in the very dark place.

570
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,250
<26-3,House>我没事
<26-3,House>I'm fine.

571
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,230
<26-3,House>只是不开心
<26-3,House>Just not happy.

572
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,930
<26-3,House>我不是因为你快乐才让你出院
<26-3,House>I didn't let you out because you were happy.

573
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,420
<26-3,House>我让你出院  是因为我相信
<26-3,House>I let you out, because I believe

574
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,370
<26-3,House>你有处理事情的能力
<26-3,House>You had the skills to cope with that.

575
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,160
<26-4,House>你尝试过一次  既然没起作用
<26-4,House>You tried one thing. It didn't work.

576
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,330
<26-4,House>试点别的
<26-4,House>So move on.

577
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,330
<26-4,House>写作或是下棋
<26-4,House>Write. Play chess.

578
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,430
<26-4,House>如果都没用怎么办
<26-4,House>What if nothing works?

579
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,800
<26-4,House>如果任何事情
<26-4,House>What if nothing gives me more

580
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,270
<26-4,House>我都坚持不了几天就开始另找新欢
<26-4,House>Than a few days before my brain starts looking for the next fix,

581
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,810
<26-4,House>而且腿又会像是被人在用钉子猛戳
<26-4,House>Before my leg feels like someone's shoving nails into it?

582
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,520
<26-4,House>那我该怎么办
<26-4,House>What do I do then?

583
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,570
<26-4,House>如果真的找不到能抓住你的事物
<26-4,House>If nothing in the world can hold your interest,

584
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,540
<26-4,House>我们再来解决也为时不晚
<26-4,House>Uh, we'll deal with that when we get to it.

585
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,730
<26-4,House>但你要信任我  要有耐心
<26-4,House>But you have to trust me, and you have to be patient.

586
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,790
<27-1,Foreman>我给你买了甜甜圈
<27-1,Foreman>I brought you a doughnut.

587
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,880
<27-1,Foreman>花店关门了
<27-1,Foreman>The florist was closed.

588
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,940
<27-2,Thirteen>我去拿个花瓶把它养起来
<27-2,Thirteen>I'll get a vase and put it in water.

589
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,730
<27-3,Foreman>我很抱歉
<27-3,Foreman>You know I'm sorry, right?

590
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,680
<27-4,Thirteen>我也有错
<27-4,Thirteen>I'm sorry too.

591
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,940
<27-4,Thirteen>你觉得
<27-4,Thirteen>Do you think, um,

592
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,370
<27-4,Thirteen>我们能重新来过么
<27-4,Thirteen>We could start over?

593
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,130
<27-5,Foreman>这是个好主意
<27-5,Foreman>That's a fantastic idea.

594
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,850
<27-6,Thirteen>我们会迟到的
<27-6,Thirteen>We're gonna be late.

595
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,170
<27-7,Foreman>你老板不会介意的
<27-7,Foreman>Your boss won't mind.

596
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,890
<27-8,Foreman>没搞错吧
<27-8,Foreman>No way.

597
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,460
<28-1,Taub>他的淋巴结突然涨大
<28-1,Taub>His lymph nodes blew up.

<28-1,Taub>已经按血小板增多症来治疗
<28-1,Taub>He's been treated for thrombocytosis,

599
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,240
<28-1,Taub>但是没什么起色
<28-1,Taub>But there's been no change.

600
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,870
<28-3,Vince>-我诊断有误  -你真是个天才
<28-3,Vince>- I was wrong. - God, you are a genius.

601
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,610
<28-3,Vince>我要把这个加进我的症状表里
<28-3,Vince>I'm adding this to my list of symptoms.

602
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,780
<28-4,Foreman>上次也不管用
<28-4,Foreman>That didn't work last time.

603
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,110
<28-5,Vince>因为我给的钱不够
<28-5,Vince>Because I didn't think big enough.

604
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,750
<28-5,Vince>这次我要悬赏两万五千元奖金
<28-5,Vince>Now I am offering 25000 dollars reward.

<29-1,Thirteen>类固醇已经缓解了面部肿大问题
<29-1,Thirteen>Steroids reduced his facial swelling.

606
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,590
<29-2,Taub>淋巴结肿大排除了血小板增多的可能性
<29-2,Taub>Swollen lymph nodes rule out thrombocytosis.

607
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,650
<29-2,Taub>怎么大家都知道我的邮箱地址
<29-2,Taub>How did so many people get my personal email?

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,450
<29-3,Foreman>网络是个神奇的领域
<29-3,Foreman>The internet is a magical place.

<29-3,Foreman>淋巴肿大表明可能是多动脉炎
<29-3,Foreman>Lymph enlargement makes me think polyarteritis

610
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,750
<29-4,Thirteen>你刚刚说什么
<29-4,Thirteen>You were saying?

611
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,340
<29-5,Foreman>没必要揪着着症状不放  而忽视了病根
<29-5,Foreman>No point in treating the symptom and not the disease.

612
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,820
<29-5,Foreman>你那吸引人的广告有不少答复嘛
<29-5,Foreman>Your stunt generated quite a few responses.

<30-1,Foreman>来看看吧
<30-1,Foreman>Let's take a look.

<30-5,Foreman>You are possessed by the biblical demon "Legion."

<30-7,Foreman>要不然就真的命中
<30-7,Foreman>Otherwise it did fit.

<30-9,Foreman>You want us to spend the next few days shooting down every theory in the world,

624
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,750
<30-9,Foreman>还是让我们好好工作
<30-9,Foreman>Or can we do our jobs

625
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,070
<30-9,Foreman>想出一个解决方案呢
<30-9,Foreman>And come up with one that works?

626
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,270
<30-10,Vince>我要你们给我做淀粉样变性病测试
<30-10,Vince>I want you to test me for amyloidosis.

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,170
<30-11,Foreman>这就是你的专业意见吗
<30-11,Foreman>That's your professional opinion?

628
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,500
<30-12,Vince>这是头脑风暴的结果
<30-12,Vince>It's the wisdom of crowds.

629
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,560
<30-12,Vince>研究表明集体判断
<30-12,Vince>Studies show the collective decision of a group

630
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,730
<30-12,Vince>会比任何个人的判断更加精确
<30-12,Vince>Can be more accurate than any individual's decision.

<30-13,Foreman>如果你得了淀粉样变性病

<30-14,Vince>那好
<30-14,Vince>Fine.

636

<30-15,Foreman>我们来做笔交易
<30-15,Foreman>I'll make you a deal.

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,730
<30-15,Foreman>并取消悬赏
<30-15,Foreman>And retract the reward.

641
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,960
<30-15,Foreman>任选其一  否则你连测试都别想做
<30-15,Foreman>It's either that, or I don't test you at all.

<30-16,Vince>成交
<30-16,Vince>Deal.

<31-4,Wilson>她抽不开身
<31-4,Wilson>She was busy.

648
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,930
<31-5,House>你只是想打探军情吧
<31-5,House>And you are checking up on me.

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,100
<31-6,Wilson>你什么都可以跟我讲
<31-6,Wilson>You know, you can talk to me.

<31-7,House>你已经没袜子借我穿了
<31-7,House>You were running out of socks for me to borrow.

652
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,990
<31-7,House>不过你的内裤倒是剩了不少
<31-7,House>You got plenty of underwear, though.

653
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,380
<31-7,House>我很好

<31-9,House>持续性证明了什么呢
<31-9,House>And consistency proves what?

<31-9,House>真的  我很好  我放去你的房间咯
<31-9,House>Really. I'm good. I'll put these in your room.

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,150
<32-1,Taub>与淀粉样变性症一致
<32-1,Taub>Consistent with amyloidosis.

<32-2,Foreman>网上说的是对的
<32-2,Foreman>The internet was right.

<32-2,Foreman>给他用氟美松[抗炎药]
<32-2,Foreman>Start him on dexamethasone.

663
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,840
<32-3,Taub>已经用过了
<32-3,Taub>Already done.

664
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,170
<32-3,Taub>现在说这个可能不太合适
<32-3,Taub>This may not be the best time for this.

665
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,370
<32-3,Taub>我要辞职
<32-3,Taub>But I quit.

666
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,670
<32-3,Taub>一个朋友邀请我加入他的外科诊所
<32-3,Taub>I got an offer to join a friend's surgical practice.

667
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,200
<32-4,Foreman>一般来说你不会受聘
<32-4,Foreman>Um, you don't generally get an offer

668
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,440
<32-4,Foreman>除非你特意去应征
<32-4,Foreman>Unless you're looking for one.

669
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,880
<32-5,Taub>当我发现豪斯一去不复返的时候  我就到处求职了
<32-5,Taub>I put out some feelers when I found out House wasn't coming back.

670
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,700
<32-6,Foreman>我努力游说上头保留这个部门
<32-6,Foreman>I lobbied to keep the department open

671
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,110
<32-6,Foreman>才能保住你的工作
<32-6,Foreman>So you could keep your job.

672
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,230
<32-7,Taub>是吧  你真是太无私了
<32-7,Taub>Yes. That was incredibly altruistic of you.

673
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,980
<32-7,Taub>不是针对你
<32-7,Taub>It's nothing personal.

674
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,060
<32-7,Taub>你干得很出色
<32-7,Taub>Actually, I think you're doing pretty well.

675
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,650
<32-7,Taub>可是我是为与豪斯共事而来
<32-7,Taub>But I came here to work with House.

676
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,700
<33-1,Thirteen>他是个混蛋
<33-1,Thirteen>He's a jerk.

677
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,500
<33-1,Thirteen>我们没他也能行
<33-1,Thirteen>We'll be fine without him.

678
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,850
<33-1,Thirteen>你知道我们每天都能收到多少份简历吗
<33-1,Thirteen>Do you know how many resumes we get every day without even asking?

679
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,910
<33-2,Foreman>卡迪让我们关门大吉之后人会少点
<33-2,Foreman>Might be a few less after Cuddy shuts us down.

680
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,160
<33-3,Thirteen>这个病例是在你的掌管下顺利解决的
<33-3,Thirteen>The case got solved under your watch.

681
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,380
<33-3,Thirteen>至于如何解决的有那么重要吗
<33-3,Thirteen>Does it really matter how it happened?

682
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,590
<33-3,Thirteen>很重要
<33-3,Thirteen>It matters.

683
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,360
<33-4,Foreman>如果我没准备好坐这个位置怎么办
<33-4,Foreman>What if I'm just not ready for this job?

684
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,370
<33-5,Thirteen>你很沮丧
<33-5,Thirteen>Okay, you're sad.

685
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,310
<33-5,Thirteen>我可以给你讲我和室友在劳伦斯学院的事
<33-5,Thirteen>I could tell you the story about me and my roommate at Sarah Lawrence.

686
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,330
<33-6,Foreman>好的
<33-6,Foreman>Okay.

687
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,320
<33-7,Thirteen>她叫琳熙
<33-7,Thirteen>Her name was Lindsey,

688
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,860
<33-7,Thirteen>她是来自爱荷华州的拉拉队长
<33-7,Thirteen>And she was a cheerleader from Iowa.

689
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,500
<34-1,Wilson>我今早敲碎了我的厕所
<34-1,Wilson>I broke my toilet this morning.

690
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,720
<34-2,Cuddy>我去抄家伙
<34-2,Cuddy>I'll get my tools.

691
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,600
<34-3,Wilson>我堵住了入水阀
<34-3,Wilson>I blocked the intake valve

692
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,450
<34-3,Wilson>收集到豪斯的尿液
<34-3,Wilson>So I could collect some of house's urine.

693
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,310
<34-3,Wilson>卡迪  他几乎不瘸了
<34-3,Wilson>Cuddy, he was barely limping.

694
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,820
<34-4,Cuddy>检测结果是什么
<34-4,Cuddy>What did the lab say?

695
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,510
<34-5,Wilson>尿液里不含维柯丁
<34-5,Wilson>The urine was clean for vicodin.

696
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,590
<34-5,Wilson>即便如此
<34-5,Wilson>It did, however,

697
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,840
<34-5,Wilson>却含有一些奇怪的上皮细胞
<34-5,Wilson>Contain strange epithelial cells.

698
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,210
<34-5,Wilson>进一步的分析显示
<34-5,Wilson>Further analysis showed

699
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,300
<34-5,Wilson>这些细胞来自于拉布拉多寻物犬
<34-5,Wilson>They were from a labrador retriever.

700
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,440
<34-6,Cuddy>该死
<34-6,Cuddy>Damn.

701
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,190
<34-6,Cuddy>他还在服药
<34-6,Cuddy>He's using.

702
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,150
<35-1,Vince>不  不要
<35-1,Vince>No. No.

703
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,480
<35-2,Foreman>文森  文森
<35-2,Foreman>Vince. vince.

704
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,750
<35-2,Foreman>文森  放松
<35-2,Foreman>Vince, relax.

705
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,780
<35-2,Foreman>我是福曼医生
<35-2,Foreman>It's Dr. Foreman.

706
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:27,950
<35-3,Vince>杀死它
<35-3,Vince>Kill it!

707
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,370
<35-3,Vince>杀死它  不  不
<35-3,Vince>Kill it! No! No!

708
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,130
<35-3,Vince>我没有冲击枪
<35-3,Vince>I don't have my blaster!

709
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,990
<35-4,Foreman>幻觉导致体温上升
<35-4,Foreman>He's hallucinating 'cause he's burning up.

710
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,820
<35-4,Foreman>淀粉样变性不会这样
<35-4,Foreman>Amyloidosis wouldn't do this

711
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,540
<35-4,Foreman>退烧药没用
<35-4,Foreman>The antipyretics didn't work.

712
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,390
<36-1,Thirteen>希望冷水浴能帮他降下体温
<36-1,Thirteen>Hopefully the cold tub will get his temp down.

713
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,830
<36-1,Thirteen>也许我们应该听听其他人的意见
<36-1,Thirteen>Maybe we should see if anyone's sent in other ideas.

714
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,250
<36-1,Thirteen>也许奖金吸引到...
<36-1,Thirteen>Maybe the reward money attract...

715
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,590
<36-2,Foreman>我不会再让任何人将我们耍的团团转
<36-2,Foreman>No. I'm not letting anyone else jerk us around.

716
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,840
<36-2,Foreman>网络的淀粉样变性诊断是错误的
<36-2,Foreman>The masses were wrong about amyloidosis.

717
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,140
<36-2,Foreman>他们不知道发烧这一症状
<36-2,Foreman>They don't know about the fever.

718
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,620
<36-2,Foreman>我认为是轻链沉淀病
<36-2,Foreman>I'm going with light-chain deposition disorder.

719
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,740
<36-2,Foreman>你觉得呢
<36-2,Foreman>You okay with that?

720
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,730
<36-3,Thirteen>是的
<36-3,Thirteen>Yes.

721
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,650
<36-4,Foreman>我们认为你得是轻链沉淀病
<36-4,Foreman>We think you have a disease called lcdd.

722
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,110
<36-4,Foreman>这种病导致你的器官里积累了大量蛋白质
<36-4,Foreman>It causes protein to build up in your organs.

723
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,020
<36-5,Vince>你认为
<36-5,Vince>You think?

724
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,930
<36-6,Foreman>我们还不能绝对的确诊
<36-6,Foreman>We can't definitely confirm the diagnosis.

725
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,280
<36-6,Foreman>而你唯一痊愈的机会
<36-6,Foreman>And our only chance of beating this

726
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,490
<36-6,Foreman>就是开始进行高剂量化疗
<36-6,Foreman>Would be to start you on high-dose chemotherapy.

727
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,470
<36-6,Foreman>但是我必须提醒你
<36-6,Foreman>But I do have to warn you

728
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,900
<36-6,Foreman>以你的身体状况可能会致命
<36-6,Foreman>That in your condition, It might kill you.

729
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,680
<36-6,Foreman>你还需要更多信息吗
<36-6,Foreman>Do you want me to get you some more information?

730
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,070
<36-7,Vince>你是我的医生
<36-7,Vince>You're my doctor.

731
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,910
<36-7,Vince>我相信你
<36-7,Vince>I trust you.

732
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,570
<36-8,Foreman>你并不是相信我
<36-8,Foreman>No, you don't.

733
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,350
<36-8,Foreman>你只是害怕
<36-8,Foreman>You're scared,

734
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,060
<36-8,Foreman>害怕自己做决定
<36-8,Foreman>And you don't want to make this decision.

735
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,760
<36-8,Foreman>我的职业生涯都押在这桩病例上
<36-8,Foreman>My career is riding on this case...

736
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,670
<36-8,Foreman>但也远不及你的性命重要
<36-8,Foreman>Nowhere near as important as your life.

737
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,150
<36-8,Foreman>现在最好就是当做轻链沉积治疗
<36-8,Foreman>But I think the best shot for both of us is to treat for lcdd.

738
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,310
<36-9,Vince>好的
<36-9,Vince>Okay.

739
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,960
<36-10,Foreman>那好  先把你从这个盆里弄出来
<36-10,Foreman>All right, let's get you out of this tub

740
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,200
<36-10,Foreman>再开始化疗
<36-10,Foreman>And into chemo.

741
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,500
<37-1,Wilson>我们知道你又服维柯丁
<37-1,Wilson>We know you're back on vicodin.

742
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,020
<37-2,House>错  你们唯一知道的是我是天才
<37-2,House>No. The only thing you know is that I'm a genius

743
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,870
<37-2,House>能让一只狗在你的厕所撒尿
<37-2,House>Who got a dog to pee in your toilet.

744
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,540
<37-2,House>你们不知道我是如何做到的 更有趣的是
<37-2,House>You don't know how I did it or, More interestingly,

745
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,300
<37-2,House>我是在哪撒的尿
<37-2,House>Where I peed.

746
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,490
<37-3,Cuddy>豪斯  你花了三个月的时间
<37-3,Cuddy>House, you've spent the last three months

747
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,080
<37-4,House>您呢  布鲁图[罗马政治家 意大利语]
<37-4,House>Et tu, Butte?

748
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,350
<37-4,House>你来这干嘛
<37-4,House>You got no reason to be here.

749
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,730
<37-4,House>我要整的是他
<37-4,House>He's the one I was jerking around.

750
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,730
<37-5,Wilson>你的腿为什么不疼了
<37-5,Wilson>Why is your leg better?

751
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,440
<37-6,House>哎哟  好痛啊
<37-6,House>Ow. It hurts.

752
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,780
<37-6,House>你们可以走了
<37-6,House>Please go away now.

753
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,680
<37-6,House>如果你们真的以为我还在用的话
<37-6,House>If you really think I'm using,

754
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,940
<37-6,House>为什么不在敲破你家水管前先问问我
<37-6,House>How about asking me before taking a wrench to your plumbing?

755
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,090
<37-7,Cuddy>豪斯  你是个瘾君子
<37-7,Cuddy>House, you're an addict.

756
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,180
<37-7,Cuddy>你的话很难让人信服
<37-7,Cuddy>You can't be surprised if we can't take you at your word.

757
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,120
<37-8,House>那好  我给你些证据
<37-8,House>Fine. Let's get you some proof.

758
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,290
<37-8,House>女士们  闭上眼睛
<37-8,House>Hide your eyes, ladies.

759
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,540
<37-9,Cuddy>豪斯
<37-9,Cuddy>House.

760
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,600
<37-10,House>你也一样
<37-10,House>You too.

761
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,090
<37-11,Wilson>那个杯子是我的教子亲手给我做的
<37-11,Wilson>My godson made me that mug.

762
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,880
<37-12,House>如果测试结果仍是寻猎犬的话
<37-12,House>If the lab says that this is retriever too,

763
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,240
<37-12,House>尽快通知我
<37-12,House>Please let me know right away.

764
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,260
<37-12,House>这能解释我为何总想用你家地毯蹭屁屁
<37-12,House>It'd explain my overwhelming desire to wipe my butt on your carpet.

765
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,770
<37-13,Cuddy>谢谢你把我拽进这趟混水
<37-13,Cuddy>Thank you for dragging me into this.

766
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,320
<38-1,Foreman>停下化疗  他得的是法布雷病
<38-1,Foreman>Stop the chemo. He's got fabry's disease.

767
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,840
<38-1,Foreman>他在冷水槽里呆了一小时
<38-1,Foreman>He was in the tub for an hour.

768
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,300
<38-1,Foreman>他的手指应该被冻僵  但是没有
<38-1,Foreman>His fingers should have pruned, but they didn't.

769
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,840
<38-2,Thirteen>已经停止化疗  证实是法布雷病
<38-2,Thirteen>Already stopped chemo and confirmed fabry's.

770
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,900
<38-3,Vince>很高心你们俩意见一致了
<38-3,Vince>I'm glad you both agree,

771
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,810
<38-3,Vince>但是能否给我解释一下
<38-3,Vince>But could somebody loop me in here?

772
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,000
<38-4,Thirteen>我们原以为你肾脏的沉积物是蛋白质
<38-4,Thirteen>We assumed the deposits in your kidneys were proteins,

773
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,300
<38-4,Thirteen>但实际上时脂肪
<38-4,Thirteen>But they were fats.

774
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,860
<38-4,Thirteen>法布雷病会造成脂肪沉积在器官内部  扰乱神经
<38-4,Thirteen>Fabry's makes them build up in your organs, choke your nerves,

775
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,720
<38-4,Thirteen>防止你的手指在冰水中冻僵
<38-4,Thirteen>Keep your fingers from pruning in water.

776
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,110
<38-4,Thirteen>这是一种慢性病但是可以治愈
<38-4,Thirteen>It's chronic but manageable.

777
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,080
<38-5,Foreman>你怎么想到的
<38-5,Foreman>How'd you figure it out?

778
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,030
<38-6,Thirteen>碘腮腺炎
<38-6,Thirteen>Iodine mumps.

779
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,590
<38-6,Thirteen>做了头部扫描后  他的淋巴结肿胀
<38-6,Thirteen>His lymph nodes swelled up after the head C.T.

780
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,570
<38-6,Thirteen>我们以为这是一种新的症状 其实不是
<38-6,Thirteen>We thought it was a new symptom, But it wasn't.

781
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,470
<38-6,Thirteen>是相对的应激反应
<38-6,Thirteen>It was a reaction to the contrast.

782
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,780
<38-6,Thirteen>碘腮腺炎造成了淋巴结肿胀
<38-6,Thirteen>Iodine mumps takes lymph nodes off the table.

783
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,930
<38-6,Thirteen>倘若除去这一症状
<38-6,Thirteen>Remove that symptom...

784
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,280
<38-7,Foreman>你就突然灵光闪现吗
<38-7,Foreman>And that just came to you?

785
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,670
<38-8,Thirteen>我看过在线回复
<38-8,Thirteen>I looked through the online responses again.

786
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,760
<38-8,Thirteen>今早有个人贴出了这个理论
<38-8,Thirteen>Someone posted it this morning.

787
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,770
<39-1,Thirteen>听说卡迪正式任命了
<39-1,Thirteen>Heard cuddy made it official.

788
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,080
<39-1,Thirteen>终于当上部门主管了  恭喜
<39-1,Thirteen>Department's yours. Congrats.

789
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,880
<39-1,Thirteen>对不起
<39-1,Thirteen>I'm sorry.

790
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,570
<39-1,Thirteen>我背着你下结论
<39-1,Thirteen>I went behind your back.

791
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,970
<39-1,Thirteen>从一分到十分  你有多生气
<39-1,Thirteen>On a scale of 1 to 10,how mad are you?

792
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,730
<39-1,Thirteen>七分
<39-1,Thirteen>Seven

793
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,190
<39-2,Foreman>而且我太蠢了
<39-2,Foreman>And that's stupid.

794
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,800
<39-2,Foreman>你是对的
<39-2,Foreman>You did the right thing.

795
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,290
<39-2,Foreman>是我的错逼得你不得不背着我
<39-2,Foreman>It's my fault you thought you had to go behind my back.

796
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,460
<39-3,Thirteen>我应该站出来面对你
<39-3,Thirteen>I should've stood up to you.

797
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,170
<39-4,Foreman>但是你没有  因为你不想和我争吵
<39-4,Foreman>But you didn't 'cause you didn't want to fight again.

798
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,500
<39-5,Thirteen>这是我们的第一个病例 我们慢慢就会适应的
<39-5,Thirteen>It's our first case. It'll take time to adjust.

799
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,230
<39-6,Foreman>如果等到我们都适应了
<39-6,Foreman>What if by the time we get adjusted,

800
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,690
<39-6,Foreman>我们却已经不爱彼此了呢
<39-6,Foreman>We don't like each other anymore?

801
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,880
<39-7,Thirteen>那不可能
<39-7,Thirteen>That's not gonna happen.

802
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,160
<39-8,Foreman>你确定吗
<39-8,Foreman>You sure?

803
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,670
<39-8,Foreman>自从我登上这一职位
<39-8,Foreman>Cause ever since I took this job,

804
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,130
<39-8,Foreman>我们就让彼此苦不堪言
<39-8,Foreman>We've been making each other miserable.

805
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,920
<39-8,Foreman>我想这样行不通
<39-8,Foreman>I really don't think this is gonna work.

806
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,010
<39-9,Thirteen>你要和我分手吗
<39-9,Thirteen>You're breaking up with me?

807
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,970
<39-9,Thirteen>不
<39-9,Thirteen>No.

808
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,530
<39-10,Foreman>那个晚上 我以为我完蛋了  只有你在我身边
<39-10,Foreman>The other night. When I thought I was done, you were there.

809
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,630
<39-10,Foreman>我需要你
<39-10,Foreman>I need you.

810
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,100
<39-10,Foreman>我不想失去你
<39-10,Foreman>I don't want to lose you.

811
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,660
<39-11,Thirteen>那你为什么
<39-11,Thirteen>Why are you...?

812
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,330
<39-11,Thirteen>你要解雇我
<39-11,Thirteen>You're firing me.

813
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,190
<39-11,Thirteen>很抱歉
<39-11,Thirteen>I'm sorry.

814
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,390
<40-1,House>我逃了
<40-1,House>I slipped.

815
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,420
<40-1,House>你服用了维柯丁吗
<40-1,House>You took vicodin?

816
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,600
<40-2,House>两万五千元
<40-2,House>$25,000.

817
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,750
<40-2,House>我解决了我老队员们的病例
<40-2,House>I solved my old team's case.

818
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,700
<40-2,House>我正准备吃维可丁
<40-2,House>I was about to take the pills.

819
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,360
<40-2,House>我上网
<40-2,House>I went online.

820
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,050
<40-2,House>发现有人贴出了医术问题
<40-2,House>I found people posting medical problems,

821
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,980
<40-2,House>那时
<40-2,House>And...

822
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,620
<40-2,House>我的腿不痛了
<40-2,House>My leg stopped hurting.

823
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,660
<40-3,House>我理应改变我的生活
<40-3,House>I'm supposed to be changing my life.

824
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,840
<40-3,House>这不是改变
<40-3,House>This is not a change.

825
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,100
<40-3,House>也许我错了
<40-3,House>Well, maybe I was wrong.

826
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,580
<40-4,House>这是那在我脑里盖沙子城堡的人所说的话吗
<40-4,House>Says the guy making sand castles in my brain.

827
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,190
<40-4,House>我们要你远离维柯丁
<40-4,House>We need to keep you from using.

828
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,130
<40-4,House>远离旧工作  远离医疗谜题
<40-4,House>Taking your job away, the medical puzzles,

829
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,740
<40-5,House>却几乎反而把你推向了旧生活
<40-5,House>Nearly drove you back to it.

830
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,980
<40-5,House>也许这些诊断药物 是保持你清醒的关键
<40-5,House>Maybe diagnostic medicine is the key to keeping you clean.

831
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,440
<40-5,House>那你是说让我继续上网解决病例
<40-5,House>So you're okay with me going online, solving cases?

832
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,740
<40-5,House>你不能成天关在家中
<40-5,House>No. You can't sit all day in a room by yourself.

833
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,950
<40-6,House>孤独会造成压抑
<40-6,House>Isolation fosters depression.

834
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,240
<40-6,House>那家医院是我旧生活的一部分
<40-6,House>The hospital is part of my old life.

835
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,680
<40-6,House>如果我回去的话  我可能变回
<40-6,House>If I go back, I might become...

836
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,150
<40-6,House>过去的我  一个瘾君子
<40-6,House>Who I was before, pills and all.

837
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,800
<40-5,House>有这种可能
<40-5,House>That's a possibility.

838
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,550
<40-4,House>但是也许
<40-4,House>But could be...

839
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,230
<40-4,House>相对于重新开始吃药更糟的事却是
<40-4,House>The only thing worse for you than going back to diagnostic medicine

840
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,290
<40-3,House>不让你回去
<40-3,House>Is not going back.

841
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,190
<40-7,House>答案自有分晓
<40-7,House>Guess we're gonna find out.
