121
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
<4-12,Kutner>对心脏来说是好事
<4-12,Kutner>For your heart, yeah.

122
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,370
<4-12,Kutner>但也意味着我们仍不知道问题出在哪
<4-12,Kutner>But it also means weabcstill don't know what's wrong.

123
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,530
<5-1,Taub>收支平衡 住处洁净
<5-1,Taub>Checkbook balanced,place spotless.

124
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,620
<5-1,Taub>家具都是自己打的
<5-1,Taub>Looks like she builds her own furniture.

125
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,690
<5-1,Taub>16岁就这样了 30岁会变成什么样?
<5-1,Taub>If you're this grown upabcat 16,what happens at 30?

126
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,470
<5-2,Thirteen>会童心未泯 越活越回去
<5-2,Thirteen>You turn back into a kid.

127
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,550
<5-2,Thirteen>像Kutner一样
<5-2,Thirteen>Like kutner.

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
<5-3,Taub>Kutner也没那么糟
<5-3,Taub>Kutner's not that bad.

129
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,810
<5-4,Thirteen>他要求万物得要和谐美好
<5-4,Thirteen>He needs everything to be nice.

130
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,210
<5-4,Thirteen>要看到所有人善良一面
<5-4,Thirteen>He wants to see the best in everyone.

131
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,090
<5-4,Thirteen>厨房也没问题
<5-4,Thirteen>Kitchen's clear.

132
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,190
<5-5,Taub>是啊 待人友好很危险啊
<5-5,Taub>Yeah, friendly isa dangerous thing.

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,150
<5-6,Thirteen>过度信任你听说过没有?
<5-6,Thirteen>There is such a thing as too trusting.

134
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,270
<5-7,Taub>引伸出信任不足也是个问题
<5-7,Taub>Corollary is there is such aabcthing as not trusting enough.

135
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,990
<5-7,Taub>太多 会受伤
<5-7,Taub>Too much, you get hurt.

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040
<5-7,Taub>太少 活不下去
<5-7,Taub>Not enough, you don't live.

137
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,630
<5-8,Thirteen>那么人生目标就是适当受点伤?
<5-8,Thirteen>So the object in life is toabcget hurt just the right amount?

138
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,410
<5-8,Thirteen>原谅我无法从你那接受与人交往的建议
<5-8,Thirteen>Excuse me if I don't goout of my wayabcto take relationship advice from you.

139
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,330
<5-8,Thirteen>而信任...
<5-8,Thirteen>And trust...

140
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,490
<5-8,Thirteen>得自己争取
<5-8,Thirteen>should be earned.

141
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,940
<6-1,Kutner>水烟枪代表不了什么abc跟吸毒无关
<6-1,Kutner>Bong means nothing.abcDrugs are irrelevant.

142
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,180
<6-2,Thirteen>如果她确实吸了就有关了
<6-2,Thirteen>Relevant if she's taking them.

143
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,690
<6-3,Kutner>即使真吸了 还是无关
<6-3,Kutner>Even if she is:Irrelevant.

144
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,210
<6-3,Kutner>超声波显示心脏无损伤
<6-3,Kutner>Echo showed no heart damage.

145
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,510
<6-4,House>是那个被我毁了发明新药之梦的
<6-4,House>Would that be the echo thatabcforeman chose not to run with you

146
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,000
<6-4,House>Foreman没跟你一起做超声波吗
<6-4,House>after I dashed hisnewabcdrug discovery dreams?

147
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,230
<6-5,Foreman>你因为Kutner搞砸了超声波abc而生我的气?
<6-5,Foreman>You mad at me because youabcthink kutner screwed up the echo?

148
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,270
<6-6,Kutner>我可没有搞砸超声波
<6-6,Kutner>I didn't screw up the echo.

149
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,170
<6-6,Kutner>我知道
<6-6,Kutner>I know.

150
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,980
<6-7,House>心脏结构无损坏
<6-7,House>No structural heart damage.

151
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,460
<6-8,Taub>那如果不是心脏问题...
<6-8,Taub>So if it's not the heart...

152
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,530
<6-9,House>是心脏问题
<6-9,House>it's the heart.

153
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,010
<6-10,Taub>那你刚才又说不是?
<6-10,Taub>Didn't you just say it's not?

154
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,510
<6-11,House>不是所有心脏问题都是结构受损的
<6-11,House>Not all heart damage hasabcto be structural.

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,980
<6-11,House>毒品会导致间歇性心动过速
<6-11,House>Drugs could haveabccaused intermittent tachycardia.

156
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,140
<6-12,Thirteen>心跳不规则能导致肺水肿
<6-12,Thirteen>Irregular heart beat would accountabcfor the pulmonary edema.

157
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,070
<6-13,Kutner>水肿是急性的
<6-13,Kutner>The edema was acute.

158
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,320
<6-13,Kutner>血管炎更说得通
<6-13,Kutner>Vasculitis makes more sense.

159
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,560
<6-14,Taub>验血无血管炎迹象
<6-14,Taub>There's no sign in her blood work.

160
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,180
<6-14,Taub>要患了血管炎abc她会虚弱得无法在工厂上班
<6-14,Taub>And if she had vasculitis, she'dabcbe too weak to work in a factory.

161
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,360
<6-15,Kutner>她连家具都能自己打
<6-15,Kutner>She builds her own furniture.

162
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,940
<6-15,Kutner>会因为身体些许不适而翘班?
<6-15,Kutner>You think she skips work becauseabcshe's feeling a little weak?

163
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,570
<6-15,Kutner>她需要类固醇
<6-15,Kutner>She needs steroids.

164
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,230
<6-16,House>类固醇会引起心跳不规则abc这样她的心条就更更更不规则了
<6-16,House>Steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat,abcmaking her current one irregular-er-er.

165
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,740
<6-16,House>Foreman给她用β-受体阻滞药
<6-16,House>Foreman. Start her on beta-blockers.

166
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,720
<6-16,House>其他人干点别的啥 就是不准帮忙
<6-16,House>The rest of you, do anything thatabcisn't starting her on beta-blockers.

167
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,270
<6-17,Foreman>给她用药 需要我就呼我
<6-17,Foreman>Start her on the treatment.abcPage me if you need me.

168
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,880
<7-1,Kutner>心跳不规则会使血液回流abc到心脏之后 流入肺部
<7-1,Kutner>Irregular heartbeat causes blood to backabcup behind the heart and into the lungs.

169
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,950
<7-1,Kutner>β-受体阻滞药能阻止此事发生
<7-1,Kutner>The beta-blockers keepabcthis from happening.

170
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,660
<7-2,Sophia>上次测试不是说我心脏没事吗
<7-2,Sophia>I thought the testabcshowed my heart was fine.

171
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,510
<7-3,Kutner>心律不齐很狡猾 是间歇性的
<7-3,Kutner>It's tricky. Anabcarrhythmia can come and go.

172
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,180
<7-4,Sophia>这么说你既不相信我也不相信测试结果
<7-4,Sophia>So you don't believe me or the test.

173
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,540
<7-4,Sophia>你们这些人比我还愤世嫉俗
<7-4,Sophia>You guys are more cynical than I am.

174
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,340
<7-5,Kutner>我们在你家里找到了水烟枪
<7-5,Kutner>We found the bong in your apartment.

175
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,940
<7-6,Sophia>你们还进了我房子?
<7-6,Sophia>You went into my apartment?

176
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,690
<7-7,Kutner>长期吸毒会损伤--
<7-7,Kutner>Extended drugabcuse can damage--

177
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,830
<7-8,Sophia>烟枪是我前男友的abc正因为这样才把他甩了
<7-8,Sophia>the bong belongs to myabcex. It's why he's ex.

178
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,500
<7-9,Kutner>不代表你没用过
<7-9,Kutner>That doesn't mean you didn't use it.

179
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,740
<7-9,Kutner>不
<7-9,Kutner>No.

180
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,120
<7-10,Sophia>你没有理由相信我
<7-10,Sophia>You have no reason to trust me.

181
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,390
<7-10,Sophia>你必须得按规定给我治疗
<7-10,Sophia>You have to do your treatment.

182
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,740
<7-11,Kutner>还有一个可能是你患了血管炎
<7-11,Kutner>The other possibilityabcis you have vasculitis.

183
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,370
<7-11,Kutner>可用类固醇治疗
<7-11,Kutner>The treatment for that is steroids.

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,310
<7-11,Kutner>但要是你有在吸毒 心脏受损abc类固醇会使你丧命的
<7-11,Kutner>If you've been using drugs,if they've damaged yourabcheart and I start you on steroids, they could kill you.

185
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,230
<7-12,Sophia>我没有吸毒
<7-12,Sophia>I haven't used drugs.

186
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,800
<7-13,Kutner>我去拿类固醇
<7-13,Kutner>I'll get the steroids.

187
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,820
<8-1,Cuddy>你为什么会在这?
<8-1,Cuddy>Why are you here?

188

<8-4,Foreman>是因为House不想我在这
<8-4,Foreman>I'm here because house doesn'tabcwant me to be here.

190
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,320
<8-5,Cuddy>他拒绝放你去搞临床试验?
<8-5,Cuddy>I'm guessing he saidabcno to the clinical trials.

191
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,770
<8-6,Foreman>他不需要我的
<8-6,Foreman>He didn't need to say no.

192
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,340
<8-6,Foreman>只因为想说拒绝而拒绝
<8-6,Foreman>He just wanted to say no.

193
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,000
<8-7,Cuddy>House做事只为了私利?
<8-7,Cuddy>House did somethingabcsolely out of self-interest?

194
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,330
<8-7,Cuddy>让人毛骨悚然呢
<8-7,Cuddy>That's freaky.

<8-8,Foreman>- 不认为你会越级批准我?abc- 不会
<8-8,Foreman>- Don't suppose you'd want to override?abc- No.

196
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,320
<8-9,Cuddy>你这样做想证明些什么?
<8-9,Cuddy>What do you think this is gonna prove?

197
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,480
<8-10,Foreman>有什么关系?
<8-10,Foreman>Does it matter?

198
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,170
<8-10,Foreman>觉得你这可能需要些帮手而已
<8-10,Foreman>Just figured you couldabcuse some help down here.

199
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,100
<8-11,Cuddy>而你花两小时帮人擦鼻涕abc能惹恼House
<8-11,Cuddy>And you spending two hours wipingabcnoses will annoy house.

<8-11,Cuddy>如果这就是你的梦想 祝你好运
<8-11,Cuddy>If that is your dream,god bless.

210
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,920
<9-7,Foreman>事实上是个好主意
<9-7,Foreman>It's actually a smart idea.

211
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,700
<9-7,Foreman>所以其他医生首先就检查这项了
<9-7,Foreman>Which is why that'sthe firstabcthing the other doctors checked.

212

<9-12,Evan>You can make him better, right?

233
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,910
<11-1,Kutner>意味着我们仍不知是什么引致的
<11-1,Kutner>Means we still don'tabcknow what caused it.

234
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,960
<11-2,House>没错 干得好 Foreman.
<11-2,House>Yeah, we do. Niceob, foreman.

235
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,350
<11-3,Foreman>不是我换了她的药的
<11-3,Foreman>I didn't switch her meds.

236
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,280
<11-4,House>但你放手让一个同情心泛滥的人去干这活
<11-4,House>But your decision to stick it to theabcman clearly inspired oliver twist.

237
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,420
<11-5,Kutner>我根据她表现出的症状治疗
<11-5,Kutner>I treated her based on theabcsymptoms she presented.

238
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,640
<11-6,House>你根据同情孤儿症治疗abc还差点把她害死
<11-6,House>You treated her based on empathetic orphanabcsyndrome, and almost killed her in the process.

239
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,550
<11-7,Kutner>她用类固醇的时间不至于引起狂乱abc--这是个新症状
<11-7,Kutner>She wasn't on steroids long enough for itabcto cause the delirium--it's a new symptom.

240
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,120
<11-8,Taub>把血管炎排除掉的新症状
<11-8,Taub>One that rules out vasculitis.

241
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,510
<11-9,Kutner>也排除了心率不齐abc精神崩溃激发肾上腺素
<11-9,Kutner>And arrhytia. The psychoticabcbreak caused a surge of adrenaline,

242
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,700
<11-9,Kutner>但并无心跳不规则现象abc心脏没问题 我们都错了
<11-9,Kutner>but no irregular heartbeat. Heart'sabcnot the problem. We're both wrong.

243
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,380
<11-10,House>那是什么引起肺部问题和精神狂乱?
<11-10,House>So what causes lung issues and delirium?

244
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,780
<11-10,House>不能想当然地以为她健康又快乐?
<11-10,House>And is not based on wishfulabcthinking that she's safe and happy?

245
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,190
<11-11,Foreman>变异型心绞痛
<11-11,Foreman>Prinzmetal angina.

246
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,910
<11-12,House>闷闷不乐比多嘴却帮不上忙好
<11-12,House>Silent and unhappy isabcbetter than vocal and unhelpful.

247
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,750
<11-12,House>要是你做了你没做的超声波abc用了你没用的β-受体阻滞药
<11-12,House>If you'd run the echo that you didn't run beforeabcgiving her the beta-blockers that you didn't give her--

248
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,280
<11-12,House>听了Kutner刚刚说的话abc就会知道这不是心脏问题
<11-12,House>if you'd listened to what kutner justabcsaid, you'd know it's not a heart problem.

249
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,540
<11-13,Foreman>我不是说她的心脏
<11-13,Foreman>I'm not talking about her heart.

250
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,490
<11-13,Foreman>是说她的脑
<11-13,Foreman>I'm talking about her head.

251
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,880
<11-14,Thirteen>变异型心绞痛不会影响--
<11-14,Thirteen>Prinzmetalabcangina doesn't affect--

252
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,050
<11-15,Foreman>这可能会引发大脑血管痉挛
<11-15,Foreman>no reason it couldn't cause anabcartery in the brain to spasm.

253
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,040
<11-15,Foreman>导致精神错乱及肺水肿
<11-15,Foreman>Leads to the delirium andabcthe pulmonary edema.

254
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,930
<11-16,House>Foreman 让她用麦角新碱 引发血管痉挛abc然后做功能性磁共振 看哪根血管抽风了
<11-16,House>Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms,abcand run an fmri to see which artery's dancing.

255
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,470
<11-16,House>还有 当我说Foreman时abc我指的是...Foreman
<11-16,House>And when I say foreman,Iabcmean... foreman.

256
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,410
<11-16,House>我要他在文件上签名abc我要录像作实
<11-16,House>I want his signature on theabcpaperwork. I want videotape.

257
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,150
<11-16,House>我要他拿着今天的报纸和病人合影
<11-16,House>I want photographs of him withabcthe patient and today's newspaper.

258
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,500
<11-17,Foreman>行动吧 等你们准备好--
<11-17,Foreman>Set her up.Whenabcyou're ready--

259
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,250
<11-18,Thirteen>- House要你--abc- 走程序
<11-18,Thirteen>- house wants you--abc- to do the procedure.

260
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,340
<11-19,Foreman>当一切准备就绪 呼我
<11-19,Foreman>When you get everything set up,page me.

261
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,070
<11-20,Evan>这真是摄相机吗?
<11-20,Evan>That's really a camera?

262
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,460
<11-21,Foreman>很酷吧?
<11-21,Foreman>Pretty cool, huh?

263
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,220
<11-21,Foreman>它能拍摄其他镜头照不到的地方
<11-21,Foreman>This can go places theabcother scopes can'T.

264
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,050
<11-21,Foreman>Jonah 我要你把这颗药丸吞了
<11-21,Foreman>Jonah, I need you to swallow this pill.

265
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,580
<11-22,Jonah>我不要
<11-22,Jonah>Don't wanna.

266
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,230
<11-23,Foreman>不痛的 我保证
<11-23,Foreman>It doesn't hurt. Promise.

267
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,480
<11-24,Melinda>Jonah 求你了
<11-24,Melinda>Jonah, please.

268
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,080
<11-24,Melinda>这会让你好起来
<11-24,Melinda>To help make you better.

269
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,760
<11-25,Foreman>我不想当坏叔叔 但你不肯的话abc我们只好硬来咯
<11-25,Foreman>I don't want to be mean, but if youabcdon't do this,we'll have to make you.

270
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,120
<11-26,Evan>这是能量丸 不只是相机
<11-26,Evan>it's a power pill. It's not ust a camera.

271
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,820
<11-26,Evan>会让你的肌肉变强壮
<11-26,Evan>It makes your muscles grow.

272
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,490
<11-26,Evan>和我们吃的维他命一样
<11-26,Evan>Like the vitamins we take.

273
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,590
<11-26,Evan>但这是秘方炮制的
<11-26,Evan>Except this was made withabca secret formula.

274
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,360
<11-27,Melinda>你做得很好 甜心 你很勇敢
<11-27,Melinda>You did great, sweetheart.abcYou're very brave.

<11-28,Foreman>Jonah很幸运
<11-28,Foreman>jonah's lucky.

276
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,350
<11-28,Foreman>我在你这年纪 对我弟弟可凶了
<11-28,Foreman>I was pretty cruel to my littleabcbrother when I was your age.

277
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,820
<11-29,Evan>为什么?
<11-29,Evan>Why?

278
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,140
<11-30,Foreman>我以为当哥哥就得这样
<11-30,Foreman>I guess I thought that'sabcwhat big brothers did.

279
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,930
<11-30,Foreman>显然我错了
<11-30,Foreman>Obviously, I was wrong.

280
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,240
<11-31,Evan>他也是医生吗?
<11-31,Evan>Is he a doctor too?

281
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,010
<11-32,Foreman>不是
<11-32,Foreman>No.

282
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,230
<11-33,Melinda>吞了药丸会痒吗 宝贝?
<11-33,Melinda>Does the pill tickle,sweetie?

283
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,980
<11-34,Foreman>他不会有感觉abc你笑什么 你哥哥?
<11-34,Foreman>he can't feel it. What'sabcfunny, your brother?

284
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,410
<11-36,Foreman>- 怎么回事?abc- 我不知道
<11-36,Foreman>- What's happening?abc- I don't know.

285
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,970
<12-1,Foreman>你们最近关系怎么样?
<12-1,Foreman>How you guys getting along?

286
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,310
<12-2,Chase>你为什么突然关心这个了?
<12-2,Chase>And you suddenly care why?

287
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,620
<12-3,Foreman>House上星期问起你们
<12-3,Foreman>House was asking questions last week.

288
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,210
<12-4,Cameron>我猜Foreman需要我们帮忙abc又担心我俩在闹别扭 会分了神
<12-4,Cameron>I assume foreman needs us, and he's worried thatabcif we're sniping, we might be distracted.

289
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,830
<12-5,Chase>- 这也太瞧不起人了 对吧?abc- 非常
<12-5,Chase>- That's kind of insulting, isn't it?abc- Very.

290
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,460
<12-7,Foreman>显然你们好得很
<12-7,Foreman>You're obviously fine.

291
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
<12-7,Foreman>我要为一个笑个不停的病人作鉴别诊断
<12-7,Foreman>I need a differential forabcuncontrollable giggling.

292
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,720
<12-8,Chase>他才4岁 小孩子爱笑
<12-8,Chase>He's four. They laugh.

293
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,150
<12-8,Chase>没错
<12-8,Chase>Yeah.

294
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,030
<12-9,Foreman>腹泻和吐血不会让人有心思傻笑
<12-9,Foreman>Nothing like diarrhea and bloody vomitabcto put you in the mood to goof around.

295
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,700
<12-9,Foreman>我把他从头到脚检查了一遍
<12-9,Foreman>I've looked down oneabcend and up the other.

296
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,590
<12-9,Foreman>所有结果都显示没有问题
<12-9,Foreman>All the tests came back clean.

297
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,610
<12-9,Foreman>我实在找不出原因
<12-9,Foreman>I can't figure this out.

298
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,380
<12-10,Cameron>找不到? 你共事的不是还有abc三位医生和一个瘸子愤青吗?
<12-10,Cameron>You can't? Don't you work with threeabcother doctors and a grouchy gimp?

299
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,420
<12-11,Foreman>这不是House的病例
<12-11,Foreman>This isn't house's case.

300
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,830
<12-12,Chase>你知道的 无论你想证明什么abc都只是徒劳无功
<12-12,Chase>Just so you know,whatever you'reabctrying to prove, it won't be enough.

301
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,590
<12-13,Foreman>得走了
<12-13,Foreman>Gotta go.

302
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,910
<13-2,Kutner>- 对不起abc- 你没有错过什么 痉挛还没发作
<13-2,Kutner>sorry. You didn't missabcmuch. No spasms yet.

303
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,020
<13-2,Kutner>大脑前动脉和后动脉都没有异样
<13-2,Kutner>Nothing in the anterior orabcposterior cerebral arteries.

304
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,750
<13-3,Sophia>还有多久?
<13-3,Sophia>How much longer?

305
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,580
<13-4,Kutner>还有几分钟就好
<13-4,Kutner>Just a few more minutes.

306
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,470
<13-4,Kutner>收养你的家庭住这附近abc还是你得转学?
<13-4,Kutner>Were your foster homes all around here,abcor did you have to change schools?

307
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,690
<13-5,Sophia>谈论糟糕的养父母有助使我放松吗?
<13-5,Sophia>Is chatting about lousy fosterabcparents supposed to relax me?

308
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,520
<13-6,Foreman>左中动脉看来没问题
<13-6,Foreman>Left middle cerebral artery looks good.

309
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,030
<13-7,Kutner>我的养父母人很好
<13-7,Kutner>My foster parents were great.

310
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,250
<13-7,Kutner>我想 大部分人收养孩子abc是因为他们想做件好事
<13-7,Kutner>I think most foster parents do itabcbecause they want to do something decent.

311
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,000
<13-8,Sophia>所以你没去要求独立生活许可
<13-8,Sophia>Which is why you didn't get emancipated.

312
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,900
<13-9,Foreman>椎动脉附近没有异样
<13-9,Foreman>Nothing around the vertebral artery.

313
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,070
<13-9,Foreman>没有痉挛迹象
<13-9,Foreman>No sign of spasms.

314
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,000
<13-10,Kutner>但这很奇怪
<13-10,Kutner>But that's odd.

315
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,100
<13-10,Kutner>你如何得知父母的死讯?
<13-10,Kutner>How'd you find out about your parents?

316
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,620
<13-11,Sophia>我说过了 州警说的
<13-11,Sophia>I told you. State trooper.

317
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,270
<13-12,Kutner>你看这里
<13-12,Kutner>Look at that.

318
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,630
<13-13,Foreman>动脉没问题 你可以停了
<13-13,Foreman>Arteries are fine. You can stop.

319
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,510
<13-13,Foreman>不是这里
<13-13,Foreman>Not that.

320
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,170
<13-14,Kutner>我忘了 是他去你家abc还是把你叫到警察局?
<13-14,Kutner>I forget,did he come to your houseabcor call you down to the station?

321
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,840
<13-15,Sophia>他来我家
<13-15,Sophia>came to my house.

322
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,920
<13-15,Sophia>我伏在那人身上哭了一小时
<13-15,Sophia>I cried into the guy's shirt for an hour.

323
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,110
<13-17,Kutner>功能性磁共振能指出血液流向哪里
<13-17,Kutner>Fmris tell us where the blood flow is.

324
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,690
<13-17,Kutner>你在用大脑的边缘部分思考
<13-17,Kutner>You were using your limbic region.

325
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,670
<13-17,Kutner>当我们运用想象力时abc这部分会被点亮
<13-17,Kutner>It lights up when we use our imagination.

326
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,020
<13-17,Kutner>当我们说真话时 它不会被点亮
<13-17,Kutner>It doesn't lig up whenabcwe're telling the truth.

327
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,470
<13-17,Kutner>你的父母没死 对吧?
<13-17,Kutner>Your parents aren't dead,are they?

328
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,150
<13-17,Kutner>我冒着丢饭碗的危险abc让你用另一种疗法--
<13-17,Kutner>I risked my job, put you onabca different treatment--

329
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
<13-18,Sophia>磕药的事我没撒谎
<13-18,Sophia>I didn't lie about the drugs.

330
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,300
<13-19,Kutner>那你为什么谎称父母死了?
<13-19,Kutner>Then why lie about your parents?

331
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,250
<13-20,Sophia>因为我宁愿他们已经死了
<13-20,Sophia>Because i wish they were dead.

332
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,510
<13-20,Sophia>这样我才要求独立生活abc因为我爸爸强暴了我
<13-20,Sophia>I got emancipated becauseabcmy dad raped me.

333
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,010
<13-20,Sophia>我妈却装作没事发生
<13-20,Sophia>And my mom pretended it didn't happen.

334
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,120
<14-1,Kutner>没有痉挛 没有血流障碍abc也没有脑功能紊乱
<14-1,Kutner>no signs of spasm, impededabcblood flow, or brain dysfunction.

335
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,270
<14-1,Kutner>不是变异型心绞痛
<14-1,Kutner>It's not prinzmetals.

336
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,420
<14-1,Kutner>功能性磁共振的结果abc证明House是对的
<14-1,Kutner>All the fmri showed is house was right.

337
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,370
<14-1,Kutner>她在撒谎
<14-1,Kutner>She was lying.

338
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,490
<14-2,House>没有意义 除非是撒谎abc引起了肺水肿和精神错乱

448
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,480
<17-30,Foreman>测试没有显示--
<17-30,Foreman>Testsabcdidn't show--

449
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,870
<17-31,House>因为它披上了隐形斗篷--
<17-31,House>because it found a cloak ofabcinvisibility hiding--

450
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,320
<17-32,Foreman>砷被内脏吸收了abc血液测试发现不了
<17-32,Foreman>arsenic gets absorbed in the internal organsabcso it doesn't show up in the blood tests.

451
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,090
<17-32,Foreman>检测她的头发
<17-32,Foreman>Test her hair.

452
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,650
<17-32,Foreman>如果呈阳性 用螯合疗法将其排出血液
<17-32,Foreman>If it's positive,chelateabcit out of her blood.

453
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,660
<18-1,Chase>不是癌症 不是卟啉症
<18-1,Chase>no cancer, no porphyria.

454
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,410
<18-2,Foreman>你把我找来就为了看阴性结果?
<18-2,Foreman>You paged me with negative test results?

455
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,610
<18-3,Chase>是的 这意味着我们无能为力了
<18-3,Chase>Yes, because it means we're done.

456
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,460
<18-3,Chase>我们找不出病因 这孩子问题大了
<18-3,Chase>Since we still don't know what'sabcwrong, this kid has a real problem.

457
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,910
<18-3,Chase>和House说了没?
<18-3,Chase>Talk to house?

458
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,300
<18-4,Foreman>这不是他的病例
<18-4,Foreman>Not his case.

459
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,720
<18-5,Chase>某个点是我和Cameron无法企及的
<18-5,Chase>There's a point whenabccameron and I aren't enough.

460
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,010
<18-6,Foreman>我们还没到那点
<18-6,Foreman>We're not there.

461
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,570
<18-7,Foreman>我们要做进一步检测
<18-7,Foreman>We need to run some more tests.

462
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,260
<18-8,Melinda>一星期前 他还是个成天和abc他哥哥玩耍的快乐小男孩
<18-8,Melinda>A week ago, he was a happy littleabcboy playing with his brother,

463
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,310
<18-8,Melinda>现在却连头都抬不起来了
<18-8,Melinda>and now he can barely lift his head.

464
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,560
<18-9,Foreman>我们会找出病因 我只要--
<18-9,Foreman>We'll figure thisabcout. I just need--

465
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,790
<18-10,Evan>妈!救命!
<18-10,Evan>mom! Help!

466
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,960
<18-11,Foreman>叫急救车来!
<18-11,Foreman>We need a crash cart!

467
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,070
<18-13,Foreman>- 出什么事了?abc- 他的心跳停止了
<18-13,Foreman>- What's going on?abc- He's in cardiac arrest.

468
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,030
<18-14,Chase>让他们出去
<18-14,Chase>Get them outta here.

469
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,850
<18-15,Chase>让开
<18-15,Chase>Clear.

470
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,450
<18-16,Foreman>没反应 再来
<18-16,Foreman>Nothing. Go again.

471
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,630
<18-15,Chase>让开
<18-15,Chase>Clear.

472
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,170
<18-18,Foreman>心跳恢复了
<18-18,Foreman>He's back.

473
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,370
<18-19,Chase>Foreman 我们到那点了
<18-19,Chase>foreman. We're there.

474
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,650
<19-1,Thirteen>螯合治疗大功告成
<19-1,Thirteen>Chelation's complete.

475
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,360
<19-1,Thirteen>你体内的砷已被清除
<19-1,Thirteen>You're arsenic-free.

476
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,360
<19-2,Sophia>那我可以出院了?
<19-2,Sophia>So I can get outta here?

477
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,210
<19-3,Thirteen>明天一早
<19-3,Thirteen>In the morning.

478
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,710
<19-3,Thirteen>就这样了?
<19-3,Thirteen>That's it?

479
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,260
<19-4,Sophia>没有建议?
<19-4,Sophia>No advice?

480
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,730
<19-4,Sophia>不警告我"以后小心 孩子"?
<19-4,Sophia>No "be careful out there, kiddo?"

481
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,550
<19-5,Thirteen>你想听我的建议?
<19-5,Thirteen>You want my advice?

482
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,690
<19-6,Sophia>虽然我不想 但我料想你会说
<19-6,Sophia>Want is one thing,expect's another.

483
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,950
<19-7,Thirteen>我也希望能告诉你怎么做
<19-7,Thirteen>I wish I could tell you what to do.

484
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,320
<19-7,Thirteen>但你很坚强
<19-7,Thirteen>But you're strong.

485
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,080
<19-7,Thirteen>你作出了正确的抉择
<19-7,Thirteen>You've make good choices.

486
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,050
<19-7,Thirteen>你会没事的
<19-7,Thirteen>You'll be fine.

487
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,910
<19-8,Sophia>谢谢
<19-8,Sophia>Thanks.

488
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,870
<19-9,Thirteen>拿4毫克劳拉西泮来!
<19-9,Thirteen>Need four milligrams lorazepam!

489
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,710
<19-10,Thirteen>痉挛过后 我们重做了核磁共振
<19-10,Thirteen>after the seizure, we ran a new mri.

490
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,920
<19-10,Thirteen>这是Sophia三天前的脑子abc这是今天的
<19-10,Thirteen>This is sophia's brain three daysabcago, this is her brain today.

491
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,440
<19-11,Taub>脑损伤
<19-11,Taub>lesions.

492
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,400
<19-12,Kutner>离奇的损伤abc不知从哪冒出来了
<19-12,Kutner>Magical lesions,whichabcappear out of nowhere.

493
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,650
<19-13,House>她先是被治好了 接着又不行了
<19-13,House>She was cured,then she wasn't.

494
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,540
<19-14,Thirteen>速度比癌症的损伤快
<19-14,Thirteen>Lesions grew too fast for cancer.

495
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,190
<19-15,Taub>可能是感染 耐甲氧西林金葡菌
<19-15,Taub>Could be infection. Mrsa.

496
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,430
<19-16,Thirteen>那她的白细胞计数得高过天花板了
<19-16,Thirteen>Wbc count would be through the roof.

497
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,010
<19-17,House>把砷弄回去
<19-17,House>Put the arsenic back.

498
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,080
<19-18,Taub>你要对一个几乎被毒死的病人继续下毒?
<19-18,Taub>you wanna treat a patient nearly poisonedabcto death by giving her more poison?

499
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,310
<19-19,House>某物虽被称之为毒药abc但并非一定对你有害
<19-19,House>Just because we call something aabcpoison doesn't mean it's bad for you.

500
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,520
<19-20,Thirteen>砷差点没害死她
<19-20,Thirteen>It was killing her.

501
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,750
<19-21,House>但她现在还是快死了abc可见砷不是罪魁祸首
<19-21,House>But since she's still dying, theabcarsenic obviously wasn't killing her.

502
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,190
<19-21,House>她现在情况更糟 说明砷能救她的命
<19-21,House>And since she's now getting worse, theabcarsenic was obviously fighting the killer.

503
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,940
<19-21,House>英雄事迹啊
<19-21,House>It's a hero.

504
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,620
<19-21,House>可得好好宣扬一下
<19-21,House>We should be organizing a parade.

505
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,620
<19-22,Taub>那砷能治什么?
<19-22,Taub>So what does arsenic treat?

506
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,210
<19-23,Kutner>梅毒 有青霉素前 都是用砷治
<19-23,Kutner>Syphilis. Before penicillin,abcthe treatment was arsenic.

507
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,700
<19-24,Taub>已经排除了性病的可能 就算是
<19-24,Taub>We already ruled out stds,andabceven if we were wrong,

508
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,860
<19-24,Taub>那么多砷 也早该杀光她体内的梅毒了
<19-24,Taub>that much arsenic in her systemabcwould've wiped out the syphilis.

509
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,500
<19-25,Thirteen>急性早幼粒细胞白血病也能用砷治
<19-25,Thirteen>Acute promyelocytic leukemia's stillabctreated with arsenic.

510
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,530
<19-26,Taub>急性早幼粒细胞白血病可以解释abc除去砷之后的器官损伤
<19-26,Taub>Apl explains the lesions and why theyabcappeared after we took the arsenic out.

511
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,030
<19-27,House>那就再用回砷
<19-27,House>So, put the arsenic back.

512
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,290
<19-28,Thirteen>还是有个问题
<19-28,Thirteen>We still have a problem.

513
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,490
<19-28,Thirteen>砷只能拖延白血病 无法根治
<19-28,Thirteen>Arsenic slows leukemia,butabcit can't cure it.

514
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,350
<19-28,Thirteen>要想活到17岁 她得接受骨髓移植
<19-28,Thirteen>If she wants to see 17, she'sabcgonna need a bone marrow transplant.

515
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,190
<19-29,Taub>兄弟姐妹或父母是最佳供体
<19-29,Taub>Best match would be aabcsibling or a parent.

516
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,630
<19-30,House>活检脑部损伤 确定她要死了abc再给她上满砷
<19-30,House>Biopsy a lesion,confirm that she'sabcdying, then load her up with arsenic.

517
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,750
<19-30,House>确保她活着 直到说服她 强奸犯的骨髓
<19-30,House>Keep her alive till youabccan convince her that rapist marrow

518
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,610
<19-30,House>和纵容强奸犯的骨髓一样管用
<19-30,House>and rapist-enabling marrow workabcjust as well as the unleaded stuff.

519
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,720
<19-31,Foreman>我们得谈谈
<19-31,Foreman>We need to talk.

520
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,160
<19-32,House>是关于你瞒着我的那个孩子 病例?
<19-32,House>This about the case you didn'tabcwant me to know about?

521
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,230
<19-33,Foreman>- Cuddy告诉你的?abc- 是Foreman你自己
<19-33,Foreman>- Cuddy?abc- Foreman.

522
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,410
<19-34,House>一个16岁的病人几天之内就要死了abc你却没有犹豫
<19-34,House>You didn't flinch when you found out about aabcsixteen-year-old who could be dying in the next few days.

523
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,300
<19-34,House>说明你手头有个年龄更小abc死得更快的病人
<19-34,House>Means you're here about someone evenabcyounger dying even faster.

524
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,740
<19-35,Foreman>他需要你
<19-35,Foreman>He needs you.

525
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,030
<19-36,House>但他已经有你了啊
<19-36,House>But he has you.

526
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,310
<19-37,Foreman>这孩子就快死了
<19-37,Foreman>This boy is going to die.

527
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,830
<19-37,Foreman>你就这么自私 不顾他死活?
<19-37,Foreman>You selfish enough to let it happen?

528
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,690
<19-38,House>锅子还笑壶太黑?
<19-38,House>Pot calling a kettle a pot?

529
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,810
<19-39,Foreman>你是个伪君子
<19-39,Foreman>You're a hypocrite.

530
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,210
<19-39,Foreman>我们的工作就是查出病因abc你理应救这孩子
<19-39,Foreman>If our job is to find out what'sabckilling patients, you'd help this kid.

531
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,680
<19-39,Foreman>但你就爱玩心理战 好像谁都没你厉害
<19-39,Foreman>But you'd rather play mind games to proveabcyou're the only one with magical powers.

532
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,100
<19-40,House>你不是想单干么?
<19-40,House>Wanted something all your own?

533
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,800
<19-40,House>去啊
<19-40,House>Now you got it.

534
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,760
<19-41,House>我不会善罢甘休的
<19-41,House>Your disengagement won't work.

535
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
<19-42,Wilson>看得出来
<19-42,Wilson>I can see that.

536
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,940
<19-43,House>你以为你告诉我该做什么abc我就会本能地反抗
<19-43,House>You think that when you tell me what Iabcshould do, my instincts are to push back,

537
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,760
<19-43,House>所以要是你什么都不说abc我就会照你的想法去做
<19-43,House>so that by not telling me what you think Iabcshould do, I'll do what you thinkI should do.

538
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,940
<19-44,Wilson>我咋这么爱绕呢
<19-44,Wilson>I sound convoluted.

539
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,850
<19-45,House>走为上计既不巧妙 也不奏效
<19-45,House>Disengagement isabcneither artful nor effective.

540
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,670
<19-46,Wilson>所以 要是我不行动abc你也就什么都不做?
<19-46,Wilson>So my not doing anythingabcisn't causing you to do anything?

541
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,120
<19-47,House>没错
<19-47,House>Right.

542
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,920
<19-48,Wilson>我无所谓
<19-48,Wilson>I'm okay with that.

543
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,300
<19-49,House>不 你才不是呢
<19-49,House>No, you're not.

544
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,890
<19-49,House>你生来就有主见 还爱强迫别人接受
<19-49,House>You are designed to have opinionsabcand to force them on people.

545
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,850
<19-50,Wilson>听上去真绝望
<19-50,Wilson>I'm starting to sound desperate.

546
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,510
<19-51,Wilson>别乱动我的东西
<19-51,Wilson>Don't screw with my stuff.

547
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,380
<20-1,Sophia>我只需要个血型一致的供体 是么?
<20-1,Sophia>I just need a donor with the sameabcblood type or something, right?

548
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,360
<20-2,Thirteen>事实上 骨髓更复杂一些
<20-2,Thirteen>Actually, bone marrow'saabclittle more complex.

549
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,620
<20-2,Thirteen>最佳供体是直系亲属
<20-2,Thirteen>The best donors are immediate family.

550
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,300
<20-3,Sophia>但骨髓库里有好多捐赠者呢
<20-3,Sophia>But those donor banks haveabcthousands of names.

551
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,510
<20-4,Thirteen>- 父母DNA的匹配可能性更大...abc- 不行
<20-4,Thirteen>- Your parents' similar dna givesabcyou a much better chan-- - no.

552
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,760
<20-5,Sophia>要是这么做 我这辈子都欠他们
<20-5,Sophia>If I do this, I'll owe my life to them.

553
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,980
<20-5,Sophia>就意味着从前的一切都无可厚非
<20-5,Sophia>It'd mean everything elseabcthat had happened was somehow okay.

554
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,340
<20-5,Sophia>他们不配
<20-5,Sophia>They don't deserve that.

555
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,000
<20-5,Sophia>我的生命中不需要他们
<20-5,Sophia>They're not in my life.

556
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,470
<20-5,Sophia>如果这意味着死亡 那就让我去死
<20-5,Sophia>If that means I'm dead,then I'm dead.

557

<20-5,Sophia>我有亨廷顿舞蹈症

<20-6,Taub>Don't know when it'll happen, butabcit'll be sooner than I ever planned.

560
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,650
<20-6,Taub>而我会尽量拖延时间
<20-6,Taub>And I'd do anything to stop it.

561
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,740
<20-6,Taub>因为唯一正确的选择
<20-6,Taub>Because the only wayabcto mak anything right,

<21-1,Thirteen>你没这权利
<21-1,Thirteen>You had no right.

568
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,610
<21-2,Taub>试图说服她做正确的事?
<21-2,Taub>To try to convinceabcher to do the right thing?

569
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,760
<21-3,Thirteen>对她撒谎
<21-3,Thirteen>To lie to her.

570
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,570
<21-4,Taub>故事是真的 谁在乎说的是谁呢?
<21-4,Taub>It's a true story. Whoabccares if it's not my story?

571
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,530
<21-5,Thirteen>- 这是我的生活abc- 也是她的
<21-5,Thirteen>- It's my life.abc- It's her life.

572
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,960
<21-6,Taub>我死不死不是重点 她应该活下去
<21-6,Taub>Point wasn't I'm dying.abcPoint was she should live.

573
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,340
<21-6,Taub>这故事本该你来讲
<21-6,Taub>You should have told her.

574
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,400
<21-6,Taub>但你却叫她报警 寄希望于DNA标记
<21-6,Taub>Instead you tell her to call theabccops, give her stats on dna markers.

575
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,660
<21-6,Taub>死板透顶 一点也不人性化
<21-6,Taub>Everything's by the book.abcNothing's ever personal.

576
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,440
<21-7,House>有人要睡觉呢!
<21-7,House>Trying to sleep here!

<21-9,House>Run the donor banks. I'm going home.

579
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,340
<21-10,Thirteen>我们得找到她父母
<21-10,Thirteen>We need to track down her parents.

580
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,640
<21-11,House>我猜她否定了这个提议
<21-11,House>I assume she's alreadyabcsaid noto that idea,

581
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,840
<21-11,House>不然的话 何必鼓足勇气才敢说
<21-11,House>or there'd be no need to screwabcup your courage before saying it.

582
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,540
<21-12,Thirteen>心灵有创伤的孩子无法正常思考
<21-12,Thirteen>Children who've beenabcthrough trauma can't think clearly.

583
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,580
<21-12,Thirteen>心灵有创伤 还快要死了的孩子--
<21-12,Thirteen>Children who've beenabcthrough trauma and are dying--

584
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,510
<21-13,House>看来只有我还在意病人的权利
<21-13,House>guess I'm the only one whoabccares about patient rights.

585
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,040
<21-14,Thirteen>她的选择会害死她自己
<21-14,Thirteen>What she wants could kill her.

586
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,030
<21-14,Thirteen>她真正需要的 才能挽救她
<21-14,Thirteen>What she needs could save her.

587
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,190
<21-15,House>我们的工作是找到病因abc不是治愈他们的慢性愚昧
<21-15,House>Our job is to find out what's killingabcpatients, not treat them for chronic idiocy.

588
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,530
<21-16,Thirteen>愚昧才是她的症结
<21-16,Thirteen>Idiocy is what's killing her.

589
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,550
<21-17,House>这我们可治不了 我要回家了
<21-17,House>And since we can't cureabcthat,I'm going home.

590
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,180
<21-18,Thirteen>我们能救活这病人 但你abc只想着找到自己的答案
<21-18,Thirteen>We could save this patient, but allabcyou care about is getting your answer.

591
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,720

<22-1,Cameron>有什么好奇怪的
<22-1,Cameron>Can't see why you're surprised.

<22-2,Foreman>他的自负会害死我的病人
<22-2,Foreman>His ego's killing my patient.

597
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,920
<22-3,Cameron>你在乎这个病例是因为abc他不能干预你
<22-3,Cameron>You liked this ase because heabcwasn't looming over you.

598
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,100
<22-3,Cameron>你能自己拿主意
<22-3,Cameron>The decisions were yours.

599
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,600
<22-3,Cameron>现在只有一点不同 他决定不插手了
<22-3,Cameron>Only difference nowabcishe decided not to loom.

600
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,610
<22-3,Cameron>你的病人还是会死
<22-3,Cameron>Doesn't change the fact thatabcyour patient's dying.

601
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,950
<22-4,Foreman>我们漏掉了什么? 档案里没有的?
<22-4,Foreman>What are we missing?abcWhat's not in the file?

<22-5,Chase>The mother, over burdened atabcthe end of her rope.

<22-7,Chase>是她带他来看医生的 孩子心跳骤停时abc她也在场
<22-7,Chase>She brought him into the clinic, wasabcwith him when he went into cardiac arrest.

607
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,320
<22-8,Foreman>他哥哥会察觉到 会说的
<22-8,Foreman>The brother would haveabcnoticed, said something.

608
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,460
<22-8,Foreman>Evan比他妈妈保护欲还强
<22-8,Foreman>Evan's even more protective than she is.

609
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,370
<22-9,Chase>也许是哥哥
<22-9,Chase>Then maybe it's the brother.

610
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,500
<22-10,Cameron>他才八岁
<22-10,Cameron>He's eight.

611
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,430
<22-11,Chase>可能是嫉妒
<22-11,Chase>Could be jealous.

612
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,900
<22-12,Foreman>恰恰相反
<22-12,Foreman>He's the opposite of jealous.

613

<22-12,Foreman>他干什么都惦记着Jonah
<22-12,Foreman>He includes jonah in everything he does.

616
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,410
<22-14,Cameron>要不然就是去追杀House了
<22-14,Cameron>Either that or he's off to kill house.

<24-1,Thirteen>you stole her identity.

631
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,570
<24-2,Sophia>这是自我保护
<24-2,Sophia>To protect myself.

632
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,930
<24-2,Sophia>这样他们才找不到我
<24-2,Sophia>So they can't find me.

<24-3,Thirteen>我们可以保护你

<24-5,Thirteen>你肯定伪造了脱离监管协议
<24-5,Thirteen>You obviously forged theabcemancipation papers.

639

<24-5,Thirteen>即使找到供体 手术也要你父母同意
<24-5,Thirteen>Even if we had a donor, we'd stillabcneed your parents' consent to treat you.

00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,890
<24-6,Sophia>假装没见过那女孩

642
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,540
<24-7,Thirteen>联系你父母不代表你们要团聚
<24-7,Thirteen>Calling your parents doesn'tabcmean a family reunion.

643
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,140
<24-7,Thirteen>甚至不需要见他们
<24-7,Thirteen>You don't even have to see them.

644
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,720
<24-8,Sophia>等我病得再重些 情况紧急了
<24-8,Sophia>When I get sickabcenough,it'll be an emergency.

654
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,620
<25-5,Evan>我以为多吃点 他就能更强壮
<25-5,Evan>I thought more would make him strong.

655
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,320
<25-5,Evan>我不是有意让他生病的
<25-5,Evan>I didn't mean to make him sick.

656
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,620
<25-6,Foreman>他会好起来的
<25-6,Foreman>He's gonna be okay.

657
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,840
<25-7,Evan>他会恨我
<25-7,Evan>He's gonna hate me.

658

<25-8,Foreman>手足之情是很奇妙的
<25-8,Foreman>Well, that's the greatabcthing about brothers.

<25-8,Foreman>你犯了错误 但他们仍然爱你
<25-8,Foreman>You can make mistakes,andabcthey'll still love you.

662
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,330
<26-3,Thirteen>匹配度只有一半
<26-3,Thirteen>It's only a three out of six.

663
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
<26-4,House>那就别给她用
<26-4,House>So don't treat her.

664
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,480
<26-5,Kutner>她恐怕撑不过这个星期
<26-5,Kutner>She may not last the week.

665
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,380
<26-5,Kutner>一半匹配总比没有好
<26-5,Kutner>Partial's better than nothing.

666

<26-7,Thirteen>- 那就给她用吧abc- 会有排异反应的
<26-7,Thirteen>- So treat her.abc- She'll reject it.

667
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,440
<26-7,Thirteen>她会很虚弱 即使有更好的供体abc她也无法进行第二次手术
<26-7,Thirteen>And she'll be too weak to tryabcagain when a better match turns up.

668
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,430
<26-8,House>该我说话了 是不?
<26-8,House>It's my turn now,right?

669
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,910
<26-9,Kutner>前提是 还有更好的供体
<26-9,Kutner>If a better match turns up.

670
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,690
<26-10,House>等你们决定了 再来找我
<26-10,House>Well, when you decide,get back to me.

671
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,090
<26-11,Taub>她很害怕
<26-11,Taub>She's scared.

672
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,240
<26-12,House>明显还怕得不够
<26-12,House>Not scared enough.

673
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,260
<26-12,House>跟她说 情绪反应是很不理性的
<26-12,House>Tell her the thing about emotional reactionsabcis they're definitionally irrational.

674
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,380
<26-12,House>或者说 是愚蠢的
<26-12,House>Or stupid.

675
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,400
<26-12,House>你习惯怎么说都行
<26-12,House>Might wanna phraseabcthat in your own words.

676
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,280
<26-13,Taub>她不想让父母因为abc救了她的命而感到欣慰
<26-13,Taub>She wants to deny her parents theabcsatisfaction of saving her life.

677
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,370
<26-14,House>那是你对她的情绪反应abc做出的理性解释
<26-14,House>That's your rational explanation ofabcher emotional response.

678
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,430
<26-15,Thirteen>这就是她的解释
<26-15,Thirteen>That was her explanation.

679
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,910
<26-16,House>挺合理的么
<26-16,House>That makes sense.

680
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,340
<26-16,House>她过了多久才这么说的?
<26-16,House>How long did it takeabcher to come up with that?

681
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,980
<26-17,Taub>几乎是立马
<26-17,Taub>It was her immediate reaction.

682
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,670
<26-18,House>这就没道理了
<26-18,House>That doesn't make sense.

683
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,130
<26-19,Kutner>解释很合理 却反而说不通了?
<26-19,Kutner>The fact that it makesabcsense doesn't make sense?

684
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,050
<26-20,House>情绪是即刻的
<26-20,House>Emotional is immediate.

685
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,930
<26-20,House>她一下就这么理智
<26-20,House>She went to rational first.

686
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,190
<26-20,House>说明压根没有牵扯到感情
<26-20,House>Means there was no emotional to process.

687
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,870
<26-21,Taub>你是说 她说被强奸是撒谎了?
<26-21,Taub>You're saying she'sabclying about being raped?

688
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
<26-22,House>也不是她第一次了
<26-22,House>Wouldn't be her first.

689
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,390
<26-23,Thirteen>她是以此为借口 掩饰更深的创伤
<26-23,Thirteen>She lied about one trauma toabccover a worse trauma.

690
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,930
<26-24,House>那么 还有什么比强奸更糟呢?
<26-24,House>So... what's worse than rape?

691
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,650
<27-1,House>嗨 我是House医生
<27-1,House>Hi, I'm dr. House.

<27-1,House>What did you do?

693
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,850
<27-3,House>- 我没...abc- 肯定有事发生过 但不是强奸
<27-3,House>- I don't-- - somethingabchappened,but it wasn't rape.

694
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,840
<27-4,Sophia>信不信由你
<27-4,Sophia>Believe whatever you want.

695
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,230
<27-5,House>你很恐慌 顽固 还不让别人同情你
<27-5,House>You're scared,and stubborn, and youabcdon't like people feeling sorry for you.

696
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,190
<27-5,House>为什么不让?
<27-5,House>Why not?

697
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,420
<27-6,Sophia>我不要人怜悯
<27-6,Sophia>I don't want pity.

698
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,940
<27-6,Sophia>我只想过正常的生活
<27-6,Sophia>I just wanna be normal.

699
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,070
<27-7,House>但你知道你做不到
<27-7,House>But you know you're not.

700
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,640
<27-7,House>你要别人看到你很独立 应付得很好
<27-7,House>You need people to see how independentabcyou are, how well you're coping.

701
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,620
<27-7,House>这样他们就看不到你abc遍体鳞伤 不知所措
<27-7,House>So they won't see theabclost,hurt little girl.

702
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,820
<27-7,House>因为你不这么看
<27-7,House>Because that's not what you see.

703
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,160
<27-7,House>你只看到你犯下的大错...
<27-7,House>You see someone who didabcsomething terrible...

704
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,970
<27-7,House>活该因此忍受痛苦
<27-7,House>who deserves to suffer.

705
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,850
<27-7,House>不配继续活下去
<27-7,House>Who doesn't deserve to live.

706
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,590
<27-7,House>你究竟做了什么?
<27-7,House>What did you do?

707
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,040
<27-8,House>我们终究会找到你的父母...
<27-8,House>Eventually,we'll find your parents...

708
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,050
<27-8,House>就算是仅仅为了送回遗体
<27-8,House>if only to deliver the body.

709
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,270
<27-9,Sophia>他们不会在乎的
<27-9,Sophia>Then they won't care.

710
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,980
<27-10,House>你真白痴
<27-10,House>You're an idiot.

<27-11,Sophia>I was supposed to watch him.

715
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,100
<27-11,Sophia>当时他在洗澡
<27-11,Sophia>He was in the bath.

716
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,830
<27-11,Sophia>我还能听见他在笑
<27-11,Sophia>I could hear him laughing.

717
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,340
<27-11,Sophia>他们每看我一眼 感觉abc就好像我又害死他一次
<27-11,Sophia>Every time they look atabcme,it's like I kill him again.

<27-12,House>如果你不接受父母的骨髓...
<27-12,House>If you don't take yourabcparents' bone marrow...

719
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,010
<27-12,House>你就会害死他们的另一个孩子
<27-12,House>you'd be killing their other child.

720
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,740
<27-12,House>即使他们现在不恨你 那时也会的
<27-12,House>If they don't hateabcyou now,they will then.

721
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,290
<27-13,Sophia>我不在乎
<27-13,Sophia>I don't care.
