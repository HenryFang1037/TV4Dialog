<4-2,Police Officer>先生  请问您认识他吗
<4-2,Police Officer>Sir, do you know this man?

<5-3,Cuddy>我得重新安排下个月的工作日程
<5-3,Cuddy>And I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.

49
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,660
<5-4,House>这不算什么
<5-4,House>That's nothing.

50
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,970
<5-4,House>我今早在陌生的床上醒过来
<5-4,House>I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,220
<5-5,Nurse Jeffrey>不管你睡的哪张床都是错的
<5-5,Nurse Jeffrey>Any bed you're in is the wrong one.

52
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,790
<5-6,House>你妈妈可不是这么教你的
<5-6,House>That's not what your mama said.

57
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,970
<5-8,House>我睡在邻居家孩子的床上
<5-8,House>It was the neighbor's kid's bed.

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,290
<5-8,House>幸亏埃斯特班还喜欢跟妈妈睡
<5-8,House>Luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy.

59
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,720
<5-9,Cuddy>你到底喝了多少
<5-9,Cuddy>How drunk were you?

62
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,550
<5-11,Cuddy>你根本就不该喝酒  至少...
<5-11,Cuddy>You shouldn't be drinking at all, much less--

63
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,390
<5-12,House>你活像埃斯特班的妈妈
<5-12,House>You sound just like Esteban's mom.

64
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,430
<5-13,Cuddy>你今天出门诊吧
<5-13,Cuddy>I need you in the clinic.

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,140
<5-14,House>抱歉  我很忙
<5-14,House>Sorry, I'm busy.

66
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,570
<5-15,House>告诉我你有一个病例
<5-15,House>Tell me you have a case.

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
<5-15,House>就算你没有
<5-15,House>You know, even if you don't.

<5-17,House>Sounds interesting. I'll take it.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,730
<5-17,House>我欠你一次

71
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,050
<5-17,House>现在告诉我  你没有病例
<5-17,House>Now tell me you don't have a case.

72
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,510
<5-18,Chase>我真有个病例
<5-18,Chase>I really do have a case.

73
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,160
<5-19,House>这下扯平了
<5-19,House>We're even.

74
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,040
<6-1,House>你们该去度蜜月呀
<6-1,House>You guys know how to honeymoon.

75
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,190
<6-2,Taub>这位是豪斯医生  失语症和昏厥
<6-2,Taub>This is Dr. House. Aphasia and syncope.

76
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,790
<6-3,Nicole>他不能说话了
<6-3,Nicole>He can't speak.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,870
<6-4,House>"失语症"指的就是失声
<6-4,House>"Aphasia" Is greek for loss of voice.

78
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,650
<6-5,Chase>我们已经排除了感染  声带受伤或中风
<6-5,Chase>We've ruled out infection, vocal cord damage, and stroke.

79
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,260
<6-6,House>有很多家伙会在圣坛前昏倒
<6-6,House>A lot of guys syncope at the altar.

80
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,160
<6-6,House>这说的是"出现幻觉"
<6-6,House>It's greek for "Having the vapors."

81
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,540
<6-7,Taub>我们排除了所有常见的导致昏倒的原因
<6-7,Taub>We ruled out all the common causes of fainting:

82
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,010
<6-7,Taub>低血压  低血糖
<6-7,Taub>Low blood pressure, hypoglycemia,

83
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,990
<6-7,Taub>脱水
<6-7,Taub>Dehydration.

84
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,020
<6-8,House>别说"啊"
<6-8,House>Don't say "Ah."

85
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,650
<6-9,Nicole>知道是什么病吗
<6-9,Nicole>Do you know what it is?

86
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,060
<6-10,House>侧躺下  把衣服拉起来
<6-10,House>Roll on your side and lift up your gown.

87
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,170
<6-11,House>还有一项他们没检查
<6-11,House>There's one thing they didn't test for.

88
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,210
<6-12,Nicole>检查什么
<6-12,Nicole>A test for what?

89
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,150
<6-13,House>假装
<6-13,House>Faking.

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,200
<6-15,House>测试呈阳性
<6-15,House>Test was positive.

91
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,050
<6-16,Ted>我  我能说话了
<6-16,Ted>I-I can--I can talk.

92
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,750
<6-16,Ted>我没有在装
<6-16,Ted>I-I wasn't faking.

93
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,590
<6-16,Ted>现在我突然能说话了
<6-16,Ted>My voice just came back right now.

94
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,310
<6-17,House>你要说服的人可不是我
<6-17,House>Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince.

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,720
<6-18,Nicole>我知道他没在装
<6-18,Nicole>I know he wasn't faking.

96
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,990
<6-19,House>如果她相信  她可能就是个婚姻捍卫者
<6-19,House>Well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper.

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,800
<6-20,Taub>那昏厥又怎么解释呢
<6-20,Taub>What about the syncope?

98
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,130
<6-21,House>这...
<6-21,House>Well, the--

99
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,350
<6-22,House>她连这也相信了
<6-22,House>Is she buying this too?

100
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,790
<6-23,Nicole>他为什么要装
<6-23,Nicole>Why would he fake anything?

101
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,040
<6-24,House>发慌呗
<6-24,House>Kryo podia.

102
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,410
<6-24,House>这表示"犹豫不决"
<6-24,House>It's greek for "Duh."

103
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,120
<6-24,House>不过你还是会留着你们的婚戒
<6-24,House>Still, you get to keep the engagement ring.

104
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,610
<6-25,Taub>我觉得他不是装出来的
<6-25,Taub>I don't think he was faking.

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,150
<6-26,House>那是因为你比较容易上当
<6-26,House>That's because you're more gullible than I am.

106
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,130
<6-26,House>比如  我就不相信
<6-26,House>For instance, I don't believe

107
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
<6-26,House>是你取消了你们的开放式婚姻
<6-26,House>That you called off your open marriage.

108
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,140
<6-26,House>我敢肯定是你老婆叫停的
<6-26,House>I believe your wife called it off,

109
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,780
<6-26,House>而你没告诉她
<6-26,House>And you called off telling her

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,820
<6-26,House>你其实根本就不想取消
<6-26,House>That you weren't calling it off.

111
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,900
<6-26,House>男人决不会把婚姻的免死金牌当垃圾丢掉
<6-26,House>A guy doesn't throw a golden ticket in the trash.

112
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,470
<6-27,Taub>同理  那人也不该
<6-27,Taub>The same way a guy doesn't give up

113
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,680
<6-27,Taub>放弃收入颇丰的医疗事业来给你打工
<6-27,Taub>A lucrative medical practice to come work for you?

114
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,050
<6-28,House>这正是你出轨的原因
<6-28,House>That's exactly why you dabble.

115
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,130
<6-28,House>你这是在利用职场得意换取
<6-28,House>You're compensating for your professional conquests

116
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
<6-28,House>情场得意啊
<6-28,House>With sexual ones.

117
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,710
<6-28,House>我可没这么简单
<6-28,House>I'm not that predictable.

118
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,880
<6-29,Taub>比如说  你可能想不到
<6-29,Taub>For example, you're probably not expecting me

119
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,450
<6-29,Taub>今晚我想请你共进晚餐
<6-29,Taub>To ask you out for dinner tonight.

120
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,220
<6-30,House>不必了  谢谢
<6-30,House>No, thanks.

121
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,330
<6-31,Taub>你连考虑都不考虑吗
<6-31,Taub>You won't even consider it?

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,500
<6-32,House>我快速地考虑过了
<6-32,House>I did, just very quickly.

123
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,180
<6-33,Taub>事实是  自从我取消了开放式婚姻
<6-33,Taub>The truth is, since I called this thing off,

124
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,890
<6-33,Taub>我妻子一直心存感激
<6-33,Taub>My wife has been very grateful

125
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,360
<6-33,Taub>因此我可以迟点回家
<6-33,Taub>And I could do with a down night.

126
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,460
<6-33,Taub>如果我是和上司一起出去
<6-33,Taub>If I go out with the boss,

127
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,370
<6-33,Taub>没人会怪我
<6-33,Taub>Nobody can blame me.

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,790
<6-34,House>好吧  如果你带你老婆一起去
<6-34,House>Okay. If you bring your wife.

129
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,470
<6-35,Taub>不行  关键是
<6-35,Taub>No. That's the point.

130
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,600
<6-35,Taub>-我需要些...  -你撒谎
<6-35,Taub>- I need a little-- - You're lying.

131
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,700
<6-37,Taub>我没有
<6-37,Taub>I'm not lying.

132
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,650
<6-38,House>那我就不去了
<6-38,House>Then I'm not going.

133
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,160
<6-39,Taub>好吧  方缇尼餐厅  晚上8点半
<6-39,Taub>Okay. Fontina at 8:30.

134
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,390
<7-1,Ted>你相信我  对吧
<7-1,Ted>You believe me, right?

135
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,770
<7-2,Nicole>我当然相信你
<7-2,Nicole>Of course I believe you.

136
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,540
<7-3,Ted>那我们结婚吧
<7-3,Ted>Then let's do it.

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,150
<7-3,Ted>我们叫辆车  马上去礼堂
<7-3,Ted>We'll tell a cab to take us to ac right now

138
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,120
<7-3,Ted>把仪式举行完
<7-3,Ted>And get it done.

139
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,390
<7-3,Ted>你没开玩笑吧
<7-3,Ted>You're serious?

140
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,200
<7-4,Nicole>你才刚从急诊室出来
<7-4,Nicole>You just walked out of the emergency room.

141
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,570
<7-5,Ted>没错  我这不是出来了嘛
<7-5,Ted>Exactly. I walked out.

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,010
<7-5,Ted>感觉相当好
<7-5,Ted>I feel great.

143
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,790
<7-6,Nicole>我们倒是有礼服可以穿
<7-6,Nicole>Well, we do have the clothes for it.

144
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,320
<7-7,Nicole>泰德  怎么了
<7-7,Nicole>Ted, what's wrong?

145
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,580
<7-7,Nicole>你...  怎么了
<7-7,Nicole>Are you--what's wrong?

146
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,030
<7-7,Nicole>我的天哪  谁来帮帮我们
<7-7,Nicole>Oh, my god. Can somebody help us?

147
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,170
<7-7,Nicole>拜托  拜托快点
<7-7,Nicole>Please! Please hurry.

148
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,010
<7-7,Nicole>呼气  我的老天
<7-7,Nicole>Just breathe. Oh, my god.

149
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,400
<8-1,House>肯定还有更好的办法来取消婚礼吧
<8-1,House>There's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding.

150
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,000
<8-1,House>比如  写个微博
<8-1,House>A tweet, for example.

151
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,750
<8-2,Foreman>胸腔积液
<8-2,Foreman>Pleural effusion.

152
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,320
<8-3,Taub>你觉得他的肺也是假装的
<8-3,Taub>You think his lung is faking it?

153
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,500
<8-4,Foreman>这积液起码有200毫升
<8-4,Foreman>There's at least 200 CCs of fluid in there.

154
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,980
<8-5,House>好吧  那我们就当他所有的病症都是真的
<8-5,House>Okay, let's say all his symptoms are real.

155
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,720
<8-5,House>那解释下不用祷告  也没有圣母玛利亚
<8-5,House>Explain how one of them suddenly went away

156
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,960
<8-5,House>其中一个病症怎么就突然好了
<8-5,House>Without using the words "Virgin" Or "Mary."

157
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,800
<8-6,Foreman>如果胸腔积液是系统紊乱引起的话
<8-6,Foreman>If the pleural effusion's caused by something systemic,

158
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,380
<8-6,Foreman>那这就能解释他另外两个症状
<8-6,Foreman>It could explain his other two symptoms.

159
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,780
<8-6,Foreman>不管你是否相信他
<8-6,Foreman>And so whether you believe him or not,

160
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,590
<8-6,Foreman>我们要做的就是搞清是什么引起胸腔积液
<8-6,Foreman>All we have to figure out is what caused the PE.

161
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,260
<8-7,Chase>急诊室已经排除了感染
<8-7,Chase>ER ruled out infection.

162
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,480
<8-7,Chase>嗜酸细胞计数排除了寄生虫的可能性
<8-7,Chase>Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.

163
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,990
<8-8,House>他可没告诉我们  他在用什么药
<8-8,House>A medication he's not telling us about.

164
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,490
<8-9,Taub>你真的很不相信这个人  是吗
<8-9,Taub>You really don't trust this guy, do you?

165
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,770
<8-10,House>我连急诊的诊断都不信
<8-10,House>I don't even trust the ER.

166
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,780
<8-10,House>我们自己来排除感染的可能性
<8-10,House>Let's rule out infections ourselves.

167
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,450
<8-10,House>叩诊肺部  查出国史
<8-10,House>Tap his lungs, send cultures,

168
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,290
<8-10,House>查细胞是否癌变  测量血压
<8-10,House>Run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure.

169
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,700
<8-11,Chase>我们已经...
<8-11,Chase>We already--

170
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,010
<8-12,House>这次做的时候  讨论婚礼看看
<8-12,House>This time, talk about nuptials while you do it.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,580
<8-12,House>去他家查查其它所有东西
<8-12,House>Check his home for everything else.

172
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,020
<8-13,Thirteen>他三个月前刚和未婚妻一起搬进去
<8-13,Thirteen>He just moved in with his fiancee three months ago.

173
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,900
<8-13,Thirteen>中毒反应显露迹象可能需要更长时间
<8-13,Thirteen>Toxic exposure could take longer than that to manifest.

174
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,550
<8-14,House>你去检查他的爱巢
<8-14,House>You check his love nest.

175
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,550
<8-14,House>你们两个去检查他时髦的单身公寓
<8-14,House>You two check his swinging bachelor pad.

176
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,330
<8-15,Taub>现在有别人在住是吗
<8-15,Taub>That somebody else now lives in?

177
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,230
<8-16,House>我估计是把
<8-16,House>I assume so.

178
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,090
<9-1,Taub>别打碎玻璃  别
<9-1,Taub>Not the glass. No!

179
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,260
<9-2,Taub>这地方看着很  60年代
<9-2,Taub>The place looks like...1960s?

180
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,860
<9-2,Taub>涂料里可能含铅
<9-2,Taub>Could have lead paint.

181
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,280
<9-3,Thirteen>你觉得一个27岁的家伙有异食癖吗
<9-3,Thirteen>You think a 27-year-old has pica?

182
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,650
<9-4,Taub>若这能让我们在屋主回来前离开这里的话
<9-4,Taub>If it gets us out of here before the owner comes back,

183
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,830
<9-4,Taub>没错
<9-4,Taub>yes.

184
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,040
<9-5,Thirteen>你会对那个可爱的理疗师说什么
<9-5,Thirteen>What'd you tell that cute physio?

185
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,950
<9-6,Taub>说我改主意了
<9-6,Taub>That I changed my mind.

186
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,860
<9-7,Thirteen>不  你没有
<9-7,Thirteen>No, you didn't.

187
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,700
<9-7,Thirteen>你比平时紧张
<9-7,Thirteen>You're more nervous than usual.

188
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,840
<9-8,Taub>因为这次破门而入的确"破"了
<9-8,Taub>Because this b and e has actual b.

190
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,090
<9-8,Taub>什么
<9-8,Taub>Wha...

191
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,300
<9-9,Thirteen>是个吊顶
<9-9,Thirteen>That's a suspended ceiling.

192
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,820
<9-10,Taub>你干什么呢
<9-10,Taub>What are you doing?

193
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,600
<9-11,Thirteen>我想看看上面是什么
<9-11,Thirteen>I want to see what's above it.

194
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,780
<9-12,Taub>更多的天花板
<9-12,Taub>More ceiling.

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,490
<9-13,Thirteen>由40年前的吸音板组成
<9-13,Thirteen>Made of 40-year-old acoustic tile.

196
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,090
<9-14,Taub>石棉肺  我喜欢
<9-14,Taub>Asbestosis. I like it.

197
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,500
<9-14,Taub>我到车里等你
<9-14,Taub>I'll be in the car.

198
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,780
<9-15,Cotter>搞什么
<9-15,Cotter>What the hell?

199
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,380
<9-16,Taub>没事
<9-16,Taub>Uh, it's okay.

200
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,420
<9-16,Taub>我们是医生
<9-16,Taub>We're doctors.

201
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,760
<9-16,Taub>没人在家  所以
<9-16,Taub>Nobody was home, so--

202
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,260
<9-17,Cotter>我要打电话叫警察
<9-17,Cotter>Well, I'm calling the police.

203
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,200
<9-18,Thirteen>你认识泰德·泰勒吗
<9-18,Thirteen>Do you know Ted Taylor?

204
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,010
<9-18,Thirteen>他过去住在这里
<9-18,Thirteen>He used to live here.

205
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
<9-19,Cotter>是  他怎么了
<9-19,Cotter>Yeah. What about him?

206
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,380
<9-20,Thirteen>他是我们的病人
<9-20,Thirteen>He's our patient

207
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,190
<9-20,Thirteen>在普林斯顿  普兰斯堡
<9-20,Thirteen>at Princeton Plainsboro.

208
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,660
<9-21,Cotter>他没事吧
<9-21,Cotter>Is he okay?

209
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,840
<9-22,Thirteen>我们觉得他可能有石棉肺
<9-22,Thirteen>We think he may have asbestosis

210
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,500
<9-22,Thirteen>因为你们的天花板材料
<9-22,Thirteen>From your ceiling tiles.

211
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,920
<9-23,Cotter>他们不是石棉的  我搬来前检查过了
<9-23,Cotter>They're not asbestos. I had 'em checked when I moved in.

212
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,780
<9-23,Cotter>他病得多严重
<9-23,Cotter>How sick is he?

213
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,130
<9-24,Taub>他是你的朋友吗
<9-24,Taub>Is he a friend of yours?

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,500
<9-25,Cotter>曾经是
<9-25,Cotter>He was.

215
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,810
<9-25,Cotter>实际上  他曾做了我三年的男友
<9-25,Cotter>Actually, he was my boyfriend for three years.

216
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,890
<10-1,Ted>-我不是同志  -真的吗
<10-1,Ted>- I'm not gay. - Really?

217
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,960
<10-2,House>因为这能解释你的临阵畏缩
<10-2,House>'cause it would certainly explain the cold feet.

218
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,830
<10-2,House>还有你的男友
<10-2,House>Oh, and the boyfriend.

219
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,660
<10-3,Taub>那么你是双性恋了
<10-3,Taub>So you're bisexual?

220
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,480
<10-4,Ted>不  我是直男
<10-4,Ted>No, I'm straight.

221
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,220
<10-4,Ted>寇特  你们遇见的那家伙  他是同志
<10-4,Ted>Cotter, the guy you met, he's gay.

222
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,360
<10-4,Ted>他看上我了  我就离开了
<10-4,Ted>He had a crush on me. I left.

223
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,040
<10-5,Thirteen>-三年后吗  -有可能
<10-5,Thirteen>- After three years? - Well, it's possible.

224
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,390
<10-6,House>和同志一起睡
<10-6,House>It doesn't mean you're gay just '

225
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,780
<10-6,House>不足以说明你是同志
<10-6,House>cause the guy you're sleeping with is.

226
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,220
<10-7,Ted>我们没有一起睡
<10-7,Ted>We weren't sleeping together.

227
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,560
<10-7,Ted>这有什么关系
<10-7,Ted>What's this got to do with anything?

228
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,630
<10-8,Taub>肺穿刺显示单核细胞增多症
<10-8,Taub>Lung tap turned up mononucleosis.

229
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,140
<10-8,Taub>急诊通常不查这个
<10-8,Taub>ER doesn't routinely test for it.

230
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,680
<10-8,Taub>这解释了胸腔积液
<10-8,Taub>It explains the PE

231
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,850
<10-8,Taub>还有  可能是没有临床症状的
<10-8,Taub>And can be virtually asymptomatic.

232
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,960
<10-9,House>我们好奇27岁的人怎么患上单细胞增多症的
<10-9,House>So we got to wondering,  how does a 27-year-old get mono?

233
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,040
<10-9,House>对于"接吻病"来说  你的年纪有点大
<10-9,House>You're a little old for the kissing disease,

234
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,250
<10-9,House>除非你的免疫系统有缺陷
<10-9,House>Unless your immune system is compromised.

235
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
<10-10,Thirteen>若有任何无保护性行为
<10-10,Thirteen>If there's been any unprotected sex,

236
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,490
<10-10,Thirteen>我们需要检测HIV
<10-10,Thirteen>We'll need to test for HIV.

237
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,700
<10-11,Ted>任何一种性行为都没有
<10-11,Ted>There's been no sex of any kind.

238
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,680
<10-12,House>好吧  我会找你未婚妻检测HIV
<10-12,House>Okay. I'll go test your fiancee for HIV.

239
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,190
<10-12,House>她是那种好奇心强的人吗
<10-12,House>Is she the curious sort?

240
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,920
<10-13,Ted>慢着
<10-13,Ted>Wait.

241
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,220
<10-13,Ted>可能有些接触
<10-13,Ted>There may have been some contact,

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
<10-13,Ted>不过  我不同志
<10-13,Ted>But I'm not gay.

243
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,810
<10-14,House>鸡奸  10大最常见家庭事故之一
<10-14,House>Sodomy, one of the top ten most common household accidents.

244
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,240
<10-15,Ted>我做过不少傻事
<10-15,Ted>I did a lot of stupid things,

245
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,540
<10-15,Ted>但我浪子回头了
<10-15,Ted>But I turned my life around.

246
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,060
<10-15,Ted>我和你们中的任何一个一样是直男
<10-15,Ted>I'm as straight as any of you.

247
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,370
<10-16,Ted>你没必要相信我
<10-16,Ted>You don't have to believe me.

248
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,620
<10-16,Ted>我就是说  你可以给我做检测
<10-16,Ted>I'm just saying you can test me...

249
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,580
<10-16,Ted>只要别告诉妮可
<10-16,Ted>As long as you don't tell nicole.

250
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,000
<10-17,Thirteen>管她什么事
<10-17,Thirteen>What business is it of hers?

251
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,540
<11-1,Chase>我不觉得他和异性恋女人结婚有什么不对
<11-1,Chase>I don't see anything wrong with him marrying a straight woman.

252
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,390
<11-2,Thirteen>这样说如何  他们两个都会不幸
<11-2,Thirteen>How about, it'll make them both miserable?

253
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,590
<11-3,Chase>和大多数异性恋婚姻一样
<11-3,Chase>Just like most straight marriages.

254
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,770
<11-3,Chase>他有权利生活  自由  还有不快乐
<11-3,Chase>He's got the right to life, liberty, and unhappiness,

255
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,710
<11-3,Chase>和我们一样
<11-3,Chase>Like the rest of us.

256
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,580
<11-4,Taub>别看我
<11-4,Taub>Absolutely no reason to look at me.

257
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,960
<11-5,Chase>我没说这是个好主意
<11-5,Chase>I'm not saying it's a great choice.

258
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,750
<11-5,Chase>-只是说这是他的选择  -还得是她的
<11-5,Chase>- Just saying it's his choice. - It has to be hers as well,

259
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,580
<11-6,Thirteen>不能只是因为她不知道他是同志
<11-6,Thirteen>which it can't be as long as she doesn't know he's gay.

260
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,790
<11-7,Chase>这现状得意保持的原因
<11-7,Chase>Which is how it's gonna stay

261
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,260
<11-7,Chase>因为我们没有权利去告诉她
<11-7,Chase>Since we have no right to tell her.

262
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,130
<11-8,Thirteen>就好象你从来没有违反过规章制度
<11-8,Thirteen>Like you've never bent the rules.

263
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
<11-9,Chase>你和男人约会  你和女人约会
<11-9,Chase>You date guys. You date girls.

264
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,820
<11-9,Chase>我推测到了一定时候  你得作出选择
<11-9,Chase>I assume at some point, you're gonna make a choice.

265
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,860
<11-10,Thirteen>关于我是什么样的人  我没有撒谎
<11-10,Thirteen>I don't lie about who I am.

266
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,100
<11-11,Chase>病人撒谎从来没有困扰过你吗
<11-11,Chase>Patients lying never bothered you before.

267
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,370
<11-12,Taub>此前  病人从没为了性取向撒谎
<11-12,Taub>Patients weren't lying about their sexual orientation before.

268
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,410
<11-13,Chase>那么只是问题针对个人时你才下判断
<11-13,Chase>So you're only judgmental when it gets personal.

269
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,560
<11-14,Thirteen>就因为他们太过脆弱无法面对现实
<11-14,Thirteen>Does it bother me that people hurt others

270
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,200
<11-14,Thirteen>我就该烦恼吗
<11-14,Thirteen>Because they're too weak to face the truth?

271
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,070
<11-14,Thirteen>是呀  对此很遗憾
<11-14,Thirteen>Yeah. Sorry about that.

272
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,250
<11-15,Taub>告诉我她不是在看我
<11-15,Taub>Tell me she's not looking at me.

273
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,740
<11-16,Chase>-他是阴性吗  -对
<11-16,Chase>- He's negative? - Yep.

274
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,590
<11-17,Taub>看来成为同志没有让他生病
<11-17,Taub>Looks like being gay didn't make him sick.

275
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,600
<11-18,Thirteen>那么或许是成为直男而导致的
<11-18,Thirteen>So maybe being straight did.

276
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,050
<12-1,Thirteen>检测是阴性  没有HIV
<12-1,Thirteen>The test was negative. No HIV.

277
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,300
<12-2,Ted>我告诉过你
<12-2,Ted>I told you.

278
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,330
<12-3,Thirteen>你没有告诉我们的是
<12-3,Thirteen>What you didn't tell us

279
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,340
<12-3,Thirteen>你是如何浪子回头的
<12-3,Thirteen>Is how you turned your life around.

280
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,290
<12-3,Thirteen>-会很困难  -没错
<12-3,Thirteen>- It can be pretty hard. - It was.

281
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,290
<12-5,Thirteen>完全靠自己是绝对不可能的
<12-5,Thirteen>Downright impossible on your own.

282
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,840
<12-6,Ted>我和一些人谈了
<12-6,Ted>I talked to some people.

283
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,970
<12-7,Thirteen>不仅仅是聊天  是吧
<12-7,Thirteen>It was more than just talk, wasn't it?

284
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,430
<12-7,Thirteen>我知道这是隐私
<12-7,Thirteen>I know this is personal stuff.

285
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,140
<12-7,Thirteen>我是来帮你的  不是揭发你的
<12-7,Thirteen>I'm here to help you, not out you.

286
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,500
<12-8,Ted>我接受了治疗
<12-8,Ted>I had therapy.

287
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,140
<13-1,Thirteen>转化治疗
<13-1,Thirteen>Conversion therapy.

288
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,520
<13-1,Thirteen>参加为期三周的强化康复露营
<13-1,Thirteen>Went to a camp for three weeks of intensive rehabilitation.

289
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,160
<13-1,Thirteen>看同志色情片的时候 给他注射催吐剂
<13-1,Thirteen>They injected him with emetics while he watched gay porn.

290
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,400
<13-2,Chase>阿扑吗啡吗
<13-2,Chase>Apomorphine?

291
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,580
<13-3,Thirteen>还是氯化锂  或着环磷酰胺
<13-3,Thirteen>Or lithium chloride or cyclophosphamide.

292
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,680
<13-3,Thirteen>他不知道
<13-3,Thirteen>He doesn't know.

293
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,020
<13-3,Thirteen>若那样还是没用
<13-3,Thirteen>And when that didn't work,

294
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,090
<13-3,Thirteen>他们给他注射雄性荷尔蒙
<13-3,Thirteen>They shot him up with male hormones.

295
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,700
<13-4,Foreman>这样的化学伤害可以解释胸腔积液成因
<13-4,Foreman>A chemical assault like that could explain the pe.

296
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,020
<13-5,Thirteen>电休克疗法可以解释其它的
<13-5,Thirteen>And the ECT explains the rest.

297
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,950
<13-6,Taub>他们给他用了电休克疗法为了把他扳直吗
<13-6,Taub>They gave him electroconvulsive therapy to make him straight?

298
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,000
<13-7,House>将他高尚的权利给电击出来
<13-7,House>To zap the fabulous right out of him.

299
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,940
<13-8,Thirteen>神经损伤导致失语症
<13-8,Thirteen>Neural damage accounts for the aphasia.

300
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,640
<13-9,Foreman>电休克疗法不会造成神经损伤
<13-9,Foreman>ECT doesn't cause neural damage.

301
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,960
<13-10,House>除非是在
<13-10,House>Unless it was done

302
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,990
<13-10,House>Liberace博士的猛男庸医营地
<13-10,House>At Dr. Liberace's he-man quackery camp.

304
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,540
<15-2,Thirteen>做个脑电图
<15-2,Thirteen>Run an EEG.

305
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,500
<13-10,House>看看他们是把他扳直了
<13-10,House>See if they straightened him

306
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,080
<13-10,House>还是把他脑子给搞乱了
<13-10,House>or just scrambled him.

307
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,740
<14-1,Taub>抱歉  我完全忘了
<14-1,Taub>Sorry. I completely forgot.

308
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,280
<14-1,Taub>我太太刚开始上陶艺课  每周二8点
<14-1,Taub>My wife just started a ceramics class tuesdays at 8:00.

309
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,330
<14-1,Taub>距离这里开车半小时
<14-1,Taub>It's a half-hour drive from here.

310
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,710
<14-1,Taub>10点半前她不会回来
<14-1,Taub>She won't be back till 10:30.

311
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,760
<14-1,Taub>她和她的朋友Marly一起参加的
<14-1,Taub>She's taking it with her girlfriend Marly.

312
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,330
<14-1,Taub>她希望能做个茶具
<14-1,Taub>She hopes to make a tea service.

313
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,670
<14-2,House>你想给她打电话吗
<14-2,House>You want to call her?

314
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,480
<14-2,House>不用  我已经短信她了

315
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,800
<14-2,House>她来了
<14-2,House>And here she is now.

316
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,190
<14-3,House>我认为你还在和那个理疗师鬼混
<14-3,House>I think you're still seeing the physio.

317
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,900
<14-3,House>你车里有套备用西装
<14-3,House>You've got a backup suit in your car.

<14-15,House>做茶具
<14-15,House>Making a tea service.

336
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,160
<15-1,Nicole>我一定是在休息室睡着了
<15-1,Nicole>Hi, I must have fallen asleep in the lounge.

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,400
<15-1,Nicole>他们在干什么

339
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,280

<15-4,Thirteen>We're looking for neurological damage

341
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,090
<15-4,Thirteen>那可能导致他的症状

345
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,910
<15-8,Thirteen>不是个意外
<15-8,Thirteen>It wasn't an accident.

346
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,790
<15-8,Thirteen>是在他遇见你之前
<15-8,Thirteen>It was before he met you.

347
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,300
<15-9,Nicole>那么发生什么了  他当时住院了吗

348
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,670
<15-10,Thirteen>你该问问他的
<15-10,Thirteen>You should ask him about it.

349
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,360
<15-10,Thirteen>他们有结果了
<15-10,Thirteen>They have the results.

350
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,640
<15-11,Foreman>似乎一切正常
<15-11,Foreman>Everything looks normal.

351
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,970
<15-12,Chase>看这个
<15-12,Chase>Look at this.

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,220
<15-13,Foreman>β波峰值形成
<15-13,Foreman>Beta waves are spiking.

353
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,220
<15-14,Nicole>这表示什么
<15-14,Nicole>What's that mean?

354
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,750
<15-15,Foreman>还不确定
<15-15,Foreman>I'm not sure.

355
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,370
<15-16,Chase>他晕过去了  急救车
<15-16,Chase>He's coding. Crash cart.

356
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,240
<15-17,Nicole>他怎么了
<15-17,Nicole>What's happening to him?

357
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,850
<15-18,Foreman>突发心脏停搏
<15-18,Foreman>He's having a heart attack.

358
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,200
<15-18,Foreman>充电  闪开
<15-18,Foreman>Charging. Clear.

359
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,910
<16-1,Foreman>心电图显示无异常
<16-1,Foreman>EKG showed no abnormalities.

360
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,950
<16-2,Chase>那是什么引致他心脏骤停
<16-2,Chase>So what caused the arrest?

361
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
<16-3,House>有四种方法可以让心脏停跳
<16-3,House>Four ways to stop a heart.

362
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,440
<16-3,House>电生理的问题  供血不足的问题
<16-3,House>Electrical problems, restricted blood flow,

363
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,570
<16-3,House>以及血流到它不该去的地方
<16-3,House>Blood where it shouldn't be,

364
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,780
<16-3,House>休克  堵塞  出血
<16-3,House>Shocks, blocks, or bleeds.

365
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,150
<16-4,Chase>你这才三种办法
<16-4,Chase>I think that's three things.

366
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,460
<16-5,House>还有欺骗
<16-5,House>And cheating.

367
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,300
<16-5,House>噢  错了  不好意思
<16-5,House>Oh, no. Sorry.

368
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,640
<16-5,House>这是让人心碎的方法
<16-5,House>That's how you break a heart.

369
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:02,160
<16-6,Taub>我在特顿找到一个周五晚上的陶艺班
<16-6,Taub>I found a ceramics class in Trenton on friday nights

370
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,600
<16-6,Taub>人已经满了所以我妻子不能和我一起参加了
<16-6,Taub>That was full so my wife couldn't join me.

371
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,280
<16-6,Taub>诱发电位分析排除了休克
<16-6,Taub>Ep study ruled out shocks.

372
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,400
<16-7,House>现在你只要去找点陶博制造的陶器就行了
<16-7,House>Now you just have to find some pottery by Taub.

373
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,010
<16-7,House>越蹩脚的越好
<16-7,House>The lamer it looks, the better.

374
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,410
<16-8,Foreman>那我们去做个血管造影
<16-8,Foreman>So we'll do an angio

375
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
<16-8,Foreman>看看是不是哪里堵塞或出血
<16-8,Foreman>to see if it's blocks or bleeds.

376
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,650
<16-9,House>你应该当个医生
<16-9,House>You should be a doctor.

377
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,230
<16-10,Thirteen>我今晚会去个新开张的女同志酒吧看看
<16-10,Thirteen>I'm gonna check out this new lesbian bar tonight.

378
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,510
<16-11,House>你的生活真棒
<16-11,House>Your life is awesome.

379
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,920
<16-12,Thirteen>你要不要来
<16-12,Thirteen>You want to come?

380
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,630
<17-1,Wilson>我正在告诉一个三十三岁的女人
<17-1,Wilson>I was telling a 33-year-old woman

381
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,910
<17-1,Wilson>她得了乳癌
<17-1,Wilson>that she has breast cancer.

382
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,550
<17-3,Wilson>-不  你没有  -你怎么知道
<17-3,Wilson>- No, you weren't. - How do you know?

383
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,690
<17-3,Wilson>因为如果是的话
<17-3,Wilson>Because if you were,

384
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,360
<17-4,House>你需要看见她眼中的痛苦
<17-4,House>you'd need to see the pain in her eyes

385
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
<17-4,House>这样她才能看见你的眼里的关怀
<17-4,House>so she could see the concern in yours.

386
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,750
<17-4,House>你干吗安排我和我的那班子人约会
<17-4,House>Why are you setting me up on dates with my team?

387
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,200
<17-4,House>陶博约我是古怪
<17-4,House>Taub asking me out was quirky,

388
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,480
<17-4,House>但是十三约我像是小猫喵喵叫
<17-4,House>But thirteen doing it is a barking cat.

389
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,440
<17-5,Wilson>我这样做是为你好
<17-5,Wilson>I'm doing it to help you.

390
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,210
<17-6,House>给我安排个热辣美女  但又不能跟她睡
<17-6,House>By setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with?

391
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,560
<17-6,House>还偏偏是十三
<17-6,House>And thirteen?

392
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,330
<17-7,Wilson>我和萨姆相处的时间越来越多了
<17-7,Wilson>I've been spending more time with Sam.

393
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,740
<17-7,Wilson>我知道你不好受
<17-7,Wilson>I know it's been hard on you.

394
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,240
<17-7,Wilson>我想如果有人和你作伴...
<17-7,Wilson>I figured if you had some company--

395
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,740
<17-8,House>我不需要你的帮助
<17-8,House>I don't need your help.

396
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,720
<17-9,Wilson>那就想成是在帮隔壁家那个四岁的娃
<17-9,Wilson>Then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.

397
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,030
<17-10,House>我给了他一块钱
<17-10,House>I gave him a dollar.

398
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,570
<17-10,House>你花了多少
<17-10,House>How much did you have to pay?

399
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,740
<17-10,House>没有
<17-10,House>Nothing.

400
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,280
<17-11,Wilson>我就告诉他们你可能情绪低落
<17-11,Wilson>I just told them you might be feeling down

401
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,580
<17-11,Wilson>他们愿意陪你
<17-11,Wilson>and it was in their self-interest

402
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,990
<17-11,Wilson>是他们自己的想法
<17-11,Wilson>to keep you company.

403
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,670
<17-11,Wilson>一百块
<17-11,Wilson>100 bucks.

404
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,240
<17-11,Wilson>福曼跟我要两百
<17-11,Wilson>Foreman held out for 200.

405
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,990
<17-11,Wilson>豪斯  我很担心你
<17-11,Wilson>House, I'm worried about you.

406
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,430
<17-11,Wilson>你可能最终落得坐牢  甚至更糟
<17-11,Wilson>You could have ended up in jail or worse.

407
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,740
<17-12,House>用罪恶感折磨你
<17-12,House>Racking you with guilt.

408
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,480
<17-12,House>所以是我干蠢事你给我奖赏
<17-12,House>So I do something really stupid and you reward me.

409
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,530
<17-12,House>读任何一本家长指南你都知道
<17-12,House>Read any parenting manual.

410
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,500
<17-12,House>这不是在帮我  这是帮你自己
<17-12,House>That's not helping me. That's helping you.

411
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,940
<17-13,Wilson>好  我是为我自己  为了我爱情
<17-13,Wilson>Fine, I did it for me, for my relationship,

412
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,720
<17-13,Wilson>完全出于自私自利
<17-13,Wilson>out of pure self-interest.

413
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,970
<17-14,House>好吧
<17-14,House>Okay.

414
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,340
<17-15,Wilson>你愿意接受
<17-15,Wilson>You'll do it?

415
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,550
<17-16,House>为了你
<17-16,House>For you.

416
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,720
<17-17,Wilson>谢谢
<17-17,Wilson>Thank you.

417
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,160
<17-18,House>不过这行不通的
<17-18,House>It's not gonna work, though.

418
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,030
<17-18,House>也许吧
<17-18,House>Maybe.

419
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,040
<17-19,Wilson>不过在女同志酒吧呆一晚能有多糟
<17-19,Wilson>But how bad can a night out at a lesbian bar be?

420
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,130
<18-1,Nicole>嘿  感觉怎么样
<18-1,Nicole>Hey. How are you doing?

421
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,210
<18-2,Ted>二十七岁就有心脏病
<18-2,Ted>Heart attack at 27.

422
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,990
<18-3,Nicole>他们说你头部受过外伤
<18-3,Nicole>Um, they said you had a head trauma.

423
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,300
<18-4,Ted>我从折叠梯上摔下来  撞了头
<18-4,Ted>I fell off a stepladder and--and hit my head.

424
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,650
<18-4,Ted>是个傻乎乎的意外
<18-4,Ted>It was a stupid accident.

425
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,760
<18-5,Nicole>一次意外
<18-5,Nicole>An accident.

426
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,610
<18-6,Thirteen>我们要为你的血管造影做准备了
<18-6,Thirteen>We need to prep you for your angio.

427
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,650
<18-7,Taub>安定会帮助你放松下来
<18-7,Taub>Valium will help you relax.

428
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,100
<18-8,Thirteen>我们要从你的股动脉穿入一根导线
<18-8,Thirteen>We're gonna run a line through your femoral artery.

429
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,140
<18-10,Nicole>泰德  他心脏又停了吗
<18-10,Nicole>Ted? He's having another heart attack?

430
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,950
<18-11,Thirteen>我想不是  他的心跳似乎很正常
<18-11,Thirteen>I don't think so. His heart rate seems normal.

431
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,100
<18-12,Taub>你还好吗
<18-12,Taub>Are you okay?

432
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,740
<18-12,Taub>你们不是在讨论结婚计划吧
<18-12,Taub>You weren't discussing wedding plans, were you?

433
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,690
<18-12,Taub>不是
<18-12,Taub>No.

434
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,190
<18-13,Ted>我想我只是...
<18-13,Ted>I guess I just...

435
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,400
<18-14,Taub>晕了
<18-14,Taub>Fainted.

436
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,380
<18-14,Taub>P.O.T.S.
<18-14,Taub>P.O.T.S.

437
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,160
<19-1,House>体位性心动过速综合征
<19-1,House>Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

438
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,860
<19-1,House>他一竖起身子血压就急速下降
<19-1,House>Bp plummets when he's upright,

439
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,470
<19-1,House>一躺下就回复正常
<19-1,House>Reverts to normal when he's lying down.

440
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,910
<19-2,Taub>我们两次给他量血压  他都是躺着的
<19-2,Taub>He was lying down both times we took his blood pressure.

441
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,320
<19-3,Thirteen>持续低血压  可能诱发心脏骤停
<19-3,Thirteen>Protracted hypotension could have induced his heart attack.

442
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,430
<19-3,Thirteen>也能解释昏厥  以及他的失语症
<19-3,Thirteen>Also explains the syncope. And his aphasia.

443
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,540
<19-4,Taub>他原本直着身子  你让他躺下去
<19-4,Taub>He was upright, then you laid him down on the bed

444
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,780
<19-4,Taub>然后测了他的反应
<19-4,Taub>to test him.

445
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,420
<19-4,Taub>血压回复正常  他又可以发出声音了
<19-4,Taub>Bp reverted to normal. Voice came back.

446
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,090
<19-4,Taub>这和用针戳他毫不相干
<19-4,Taub>Jabbing him with the needle had nothing to do with it.

447
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,360
<19-5,Thirteen>产生P.O.T.S.的原因一般是
<19-5,Thirteen>P.O.T.S. can be brought on

448
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,210
<19-5,Thirteen>病毒或细菌感染  比如感染性单核血球病
<19-5,Thirteen>by a viral or bacterial infection such as mono.

449
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,940
<19-6,House>那就给他用足了氟氢可的松
<19-6,House>So load him up with fludrocortisone.

450
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,590
<19-7,House>你看没看你那陶艺班的课程描述
<19-7,House>You didn't read your ceramics course description, did you?

451
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,640
<19-8,Taub>看了  你也看了
<19-8,Taub>Yeah. You did?

452
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,300
<19-9,House>我保证你老婆看过
<19-9,House>As I'm sure your wife did.

453
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:35,970
<19-9,House>所以说我们都知道
<19-9,House>So we all know

454
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,680
<19-9,House>那个班现在在做七月四日[美国独立日]的主题
<19-9,House>they're doing a fourth of July theme.

455
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,330
<19-9,House>她会期待你的作品满是小星星
<19-9,House>She'll be expecting something star-spangled.

456
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,040
<20-1,Cotter>妮可
<20-1,Cotter>Nicole?

457

458
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
<20-3,Cotter>寇特·马克林
<20-3,Cotter>Cotter Macklin.

459
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,100
<20-3,Cotter>我是泰德的一个老朋友
<20-3,Cotter>I'm an old friend of Ted's.

460
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,200
<20-4,Nicole>你好
<20-4,Nicole>Hi.

461
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,780
<20-5,Cotter>他怎么样了
<20-5,Cotter>How's he doing?

462
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,400
<20-6,Nicole>他的心脏出现了骤停
<20-6,Nicole>Um, he had a heart attack.

463
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,760
<20-7,Cotter>天哪
<20-7,Cotter>Oh, my god.

464
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,990
<20-8,Nicole>医生给他换了些新药
<20-8,Nicole>They have him on some new meds.

465
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,600
<20-8,Nicole>他现在睡得很深
<20-8,Nicole>Really knocked him out.

466
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,240
<20-9,Cotter>你呢  还坚持得住吗
<20-9,Cotter>Well, how are you holding up?

467
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,620
<20-10,Nicole>我没事  谢谢
<20-10,Nicole>I'm okay. Thanks.

468
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,640
<20-11,Cotter>我给他带了这个
<20-11,Cotter>Um, I brought this for him.

469
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,950
<20-12,Nicole>这是他全世界最最喜欢的东西了
<20-12,Nicole>That's his favorite thing in the whole world.

470
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,890
<20-13,Cotter>我知道
<20-13,Cotter>I know.

471
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,750
<20-14,Nicole>你没在婚礼上  对吗
<20-14,Nicole>You weren't at the wedding, were you?

472
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,530
<20-15,Cotter>是的  我没收到邀请
<20-15,Cotter>No, I-I wasn't invited.

473
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,680
<20-15,Cotter>泰德和我吵了一架
<20-15,Cotter>Ted and I had a-a falling out.

474
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,090
<20-16,Nicole>你们是怎么认识的
<20-16,Nicole>How did you know each other?

475
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,470
<20-17,Cotter>我们大四的时候认识的
<20-17,Cotter>Um, we met senior year of college.

476
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,820
<20-17,Cotter>我们一起合住了一段日子
<20-17,Cotter>Yeah, we--we shared a house for a while.

477
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,220
<20-18,Nicole>你们是室友
<20-18,Nicole>You were roommates?

478
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,160
<20-19,Cotter>有三年
<20-19,Cotter>For three years.

479
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,520
<20-20,Cotter>我很抱歉
<20-20,Cotter>I'm--I'm sorry.

480
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,060
<20-20,Cotter>我只是想念他了
<20-20,Cotter>I-I just miss him.

481
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,580
<20-21,Nicole>我想你应该离开
<20-21,Nicole>I think you should leave.

482
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,910
<20-22,Cotter>我不该那样
<20-22,Cotter>I shouldn't have done that.

483
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,660
<20-23,Nicole>现在
<20-23,Nicole>Now.

484
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,860
<20-23,Nicole>请你走吧
<20-23,Nicole>Please.

485
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,380
<20-24,Cotter>我希望他会好起来
<20-24,Cotter>I hope he gets better.

486
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,490
<21-1,Thirteen>感觉如何
<21-1,Thirteen>Hey, how are you feeling?

487
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,830
<21-2,Ted>还不知道呢
<21-2,Ted>Hmm. Don't know yet.

488
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,000
<21-3,Taub>你各项指标情况良好
<21-3,Taub>Your numbers look good.

489
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,950
<21-3,Taub>我们会给你继续用这些药
<21-3,Taub>We're gonna keep you on these meds.

490
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,830
<21-4,Nicole>你睡着的时候有人来看你了
<21-4,Nicole>You had a visitor while you were asleep.

491
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,510
<21-5,Ted>是吗  谁
<21-5,Ted>Oh, yeah? Who?

492
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,190
<21-6,Nicole>寇特  他是谁
<21-6,Nicole>Cotter. Who is he?

493
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,420
<21-7,Ted>我毕业后和他合住一个房子
<21-7,Ted>I shared a house with him after college.

494
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,480
<21-7,Ted>我不知道他为什么会来
<21-7,Ted>I don't know why he would show up.

495
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,910
<21-8,Nicole>-就这样吗  -是啊
<21-8,Nicole>- That's it? - Yeah.

496
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,560
<21-9,Ted>为什么这么问  他说了什么
<21-9,Ted>Why? What did he say?

497
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,530
<21-10,Nicole>我要你来告诉我  泰德
<21-10,Nicole>I need to hear it from you, Ted.

498
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,560
<21-11,Ted>一天晚上  我喝得烂醉
<21-11,Ted>One night, I got really drunk

499
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,540
<21-11,Ted>然后我去床上睡觉
<21-11,Ted>and I went to bed.

500
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,150
<21-11,Ted>接着他来到我房间
<21-11,Ted>And he came into my room.

501
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,730
<21-11,Ted>就这样顺理成章地
<21-11,Ted>One thing led to another.

502
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,950
<21-11,Ted>这件事完全是个错误
<21-11,Ted>The whole thing was a mistake.

503
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,990
<21-12,Nicole>你是说你和他发生了关系
<21-12,Nicole>Are you saying you had sex with him?

504
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,970
<21-13,Ted>我当时醉得不省人事
<21-13,Ted>I was drunk and confused.

505
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,070
<21-14,Nicole>你是同志吗
<21-14,Nicole>You're gay?

506
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,220
<21-14,Nicole>不是的
<21-14,Nicole>No.

507
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,970
<21-15,Ted>我原以为我是
<21-15,Ted>I thought I was.

508
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,990
<21-15,Ted>我甚至下决心要告诉我的家人
<21-15,Ted>I even made up my mind to tell my family.

509
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,630
<21-15,Ted>我站在浴室的镜子前
<21-15,Ted>I stood in front of the bathroom mirror,

510
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,340
<21-15,Ted>想让自己兴奋起来
<21-15,Ted>psyching myself up.

511
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,920
<21-15,Ted>但我所感到的只有厌恶
<21-15,Ted>All I could see was disgust.

512
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,900
<21-15,Ted>也正是那个时候我明白了
<21-15,Ted>And that's when I realized,

513
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,350
<21-15,Ted>我厌恶的不是承认自己是同志
<21-15,Ted>I didn't hate the thought of admitting I was gay

514
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,450
<21-15,Ted>不是因为我感到羞愧
<21-15,Ted>because I was ashamed.

515
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,460
<21-15,Ted>我厌恶是因为我根本不是同志
<21-15,Ted>I hated the thought because I wasn't gay.

516
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,250
<21-15,Ted>就在那一天我寻求了帮助
<21-15,Ted>And that was the day I went to get help.

517
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,830
<21-16,Nicole>这么说你并不是同志
<21-16,Nicole>So you're not gay?

518
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,740
<21-17,Ted>他们治好了我  妮可
<21-17,Ted>They cured me, Nicole.

519
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,160
<21-17,Ted>头部受伤其实是说这件事
<21-17,Ted>That's what all the head trauma is about.

520
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,430
<21-17,Ted>我很抱歉我没有告诉你
<21-17,Ted>I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

521
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,370
<21-17,Ted>但这一切已经成为了过去
<21-17,Ted>But it's--it's all in the past now.

522
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,220
<21-17,Ted>不再重要了
<21-17,Ted>It doesn't matter anymore.

523
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,250
<21-18,Nicole>怎么了
<21-18,Nicole>What is it?

524
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,560
<21-19,Ted>我的头
<21-19,Ted>Oh, my head!

525
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,380
<22-1,Taub>他头疼得厉害
<22-1,Taub>He's got severe headaches.

526
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,250
<22-2,House>我也头疼
<22-2,House>So do I.

527
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,970
<22-2,House>是该叫牌还是加注看双料内听顺子呢
<22-2,House>Should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?

528
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,650
<22-2,House>不对
<22-2,House>No.

529
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,260
<22-3,House>-有没可能是感染  -我们也这样想
<22-3,House>- What about infection? - That's what we're thinking.

530
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,270
<22-4,Taub>脑部感染可以解释头疼
<22-4,Taub>Cerebral infection would explain the headaches,

531
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,740
<22-4,Taub>可能引起直立性心动过速
<22-4,Taub>could have caused P.O.T.S.

532
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,240
<22-4,Taub>如果是真菌引起的  可能感染到心脏
<22-4,Taub>If it's fungal, it could have spread to the heart.

533
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,990
<22-5,House>我说的是你
<22-5,House>I was talking about you.

534
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,970
<22-5,House>我们的小陶绅士有没有风流快活过
<22-5,House>Has the little gent been wearing a tent?

535
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,550
<22-6,Taub>提醒我下  这跟你有什么关系
<22-6,Taub>Remind me why that has anything to do with you.

536
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,490
<22-7,House>生活分心工作也分心
<22-7,House>A distracted person makes a distracted professional.

537
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,630
<22-8,Taub>破坏我家庭就能让我专心咯
<22-8,Taub>And destroying my marriage will help me focus.

538
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,710
<22-8,Taub>很有可能
<22-8,Taub>Probably.

539
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,020
<22-9,House>做脊椎穿剌   化验脑脊液
<22-9,House>Do a spinal tap. Run the CSF.

540
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,300
<22-9,House>我说的还是你
<22-9,House>Still talking about you.

541
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,140
<22-9,House>不过如果你乐意  可以给病人也做
<22-9,House>But you can do it on the patient, too, if you want.

543
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,420
<23-1,House>她呢
<23-1,House>What about her?

544
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,130
<23-2,Thirteen>酒保
<23-2,Thirteen>The bartender?

545
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,940
<23-3,House>这里只有她不是来找乐子的
<23-3,House>She's the only one who's not here for fun.

546
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,510
<23-4,Thirteen>相信我  她不是异性恋
<23-4,Thirteen>Trust me, she's not straight.

547
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,920
<23-5,House>既然你同志雷达这么敏感
<23-5,House>If your gaydar is so great,

548
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,590
<23-5,House>怎么会看到病人男朋友才知道
<23-5,House>how come you didn't know about the patient

549
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,730
<23-5,House>他是同志的
<23-5,House>till you met his boyfriend?

550
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,570
<23-6,Thirteen>他是带着新娘来的
<23-6,Thirteen>The guy walked in with his bride.

551
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,950
<23-6,Thirteen>我一时没反应过来
<23-6,Thirteen>It took me a while to rotate my dish.

552
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,860
<23-6,Thirteen>他这么对她真是太过分了
<23-6,Thirteen>It's unbelievable what he's doing to her.

553
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,660
<23-7,House>你认为他不爱她
<23-7,House>You don't think he loves her?

554
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,240
<23-8,Thirteen>他或许是爱她的
<23-8,Thirteen>He may love her,

555
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,810
<23-8,Thirteen>可他有和其他男人上床的需求
<23-8,Thirteen>but he needs to have sex with other men.

556
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,110
<23-9,House>陶博是爱他妻子的
<23-9,House>Taub loves his wife,

557
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,160
<23-9,House>可他有和其他女人上床的需求
<23-9,House>but he needs to have sex with other women.

558
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,500
<23-10,Thirteen>是  陶博这么对他妻子也很过分
<23-10,Thirteen>Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to her too,

559
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,700
<23-10,Thirteen>可这不是一回事
<23-10,Thirteen>But it's hardly the same.

560
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,150
<23-10,Thirteen>我们的病人要对妻子忠诚
<23-10,Thirteen>To be faithful to his wife,

561
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,980
<23-10,Thirteen>就要否认自己的身份
<23-10,Thirteen>our patient has to deny his identity.

562
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,150
<23-10,Thirteen>陶博只需要
<23-10,Thirteen>Taub just needs to...

563
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,060
<23-11,House>克服生理需求
<23-11,House>To resist a biological imperative?

564
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,440
<23-12,Thirteen>面对甜点  直接拒绝要比
<23-12,Thirteen>It is easier to say no to dessert

565
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,740
<23-12,Thirteen>假装不爱吃甜点容易得多
<23-12,Thirteen>than to pretend you don't eat.

566
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,920
<23-13,House>从不节食之人如是说
<23-13,House>Says someone who's obviously never been on a diet.

567
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,500
<23-14,Thirteen>没错  我的生活如清风般自由
<23-14,Thirteen>Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.

568
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,810
<23-15,House>你事业成功  人又聪敏
<23-15,House>You're successful, smart,

569
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,820
<23-15,House>有腿的东西都对你垂涎三尺
<23-15,House>and you attract everything that moves.

570
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,390
<23-15,House>你要总想着自己活不到50岁
<23-15,House>If you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50,

571
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,630
<23-15,House>谁也没办法
<23-15,House>that's your choice.

572
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,510
<23-16,Thirteen>知道吗  你说的对
<23-16,Thirteen>You know what? I agree with you.

573
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,550
<23-16,Thirteen>我顾影自怜是自找的  那你呢
<23-16,Thirteen>My self-pity's optional. What about yours?

574
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,950
<23-18,Taub>脑脊液感染化验阴性
<23-18,Taub>CSF was negative for infection,

575
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,030
<23-18,Taub>但他的头疼症状更重了
<23-18,Taub>and his headaches are worse.

576
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,400
<23-19,House>我们刚刚还谈论你呢
<23-19,House>We were just talking about you.

577
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,970
<23-20,Taub>拜托别了
<23-20,Taub>Please don't.

578
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,010
<23-21,Chase>不是直立性心动过速  又回到原点了
<23-21,Chase>It's not P.O.T.S., so we're back to square one.

579
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,420
<23-22,House>不完全是
<23-22,House>Not quite.

580
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,960
<23-22,House>做过脊椎穿剌之后头疼加剧
<23-22,House>You did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse.

581
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,460
<23-23,Chase>吗啡用量已经快超标了
<23-23,Chase>We're maxing him out on morphine.

582
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,230
<23-24,House>他有漏液
<23-24,House>He sprung a leak.

583
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,240
<23-24,House>脑脊液正从穿刺处流失
<23-24,House>He's losing CSF from the tap site.

584
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,850
<23-25,Taub>是我们令头疼加剧的
<23-25,Taub>We made his headaches worse?

585
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,020
<23-26,House>事实上  只是你
<23-26,House>Just you, actually.

586
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,530
<23-27,Chase>仍然不能解释
<23-27,Chase>That still wouldn't explain

587
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
<23-27,Chase>他最初为什么头疼
<23-27,Chase>why he got the headaches in the first place.

588

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,430
<29-2,Chase>他的理疗师给他用过激素
<29-2,Chase>His therapists loaded him with hormones.

739
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,280
<29-3,Foreman>雄性激素不能下奶吧
<29-3,Foreman>Male hormones don't make you lactate.

740
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,360
<29-4,Chase>除非它们破坏了你的甲状腺
<29-4,Chase>Except they could screw up your thyroid.

741
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,490
<29-5,Foreman>用药是三个月前了
<29-5,Foreman>That was over three months ago.

742
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,240
<29-5,Foreman>而他昨晚才开始下奶
<29-5,Foreman>We just started milking him last night.

743
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,240
<29-6,Chase>所以是其他东西破坏了甲状腺
<29-6,Chase>So something else screwed up his thyroid.

744
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,220
<29-6,Chase>甲亢  慢性甲状腺炎症
<29-6,Chase>Graves, hashimoto's.

<29-8,Taub>也能解释
<29-8,Taub>Could also explain

748
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,710
<29-8,Taub>他的性问题
<29-8,Taub>His libido

749
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,820
<29-8,Taub>和心脏系统问题

750
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:47,370
<29-9,Thirteen>如果肿瘤足够大  他会头疼并昏厥
<29-9,Thirteen>And if the tumor's big enough, his headaches and syncope.

751
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,150
<29-10,Chase>除非我们  排除他是癌症的可能性
<29-10,Chase>Except we-- we cleared him for cancer.

752
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,930
<29-11,Taub>我没说"癌症"
<29-11,Taub>Didn't say "Cancer."

753
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,500
<29-11,Taub>泌乳素瘤可以是良性的
<29-11,Taub>Prolactinomas can be benign.

754
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,390
<29-12,House>检查他的泌乳素水平
<29-12,House>Check his prolactin level,

755
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,100
<29-12,House>然后给他做脑垂体核磁共振
<29-12,House>then mri his pituitary.

756
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,390
<30-1,Wilson>听起来你们昨晚玩得不赖
<30-1,Wilson>Sounds like you had fun last night.

757
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,090
<30-2,House>你相信奇斯吗
<30-2,House>You believe chase?

758
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,310
<30-3,Wilson>我相信福曼
<30-3,Wilson>I believe foreman.

759
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,550
<30-3,Wilson>而且他们和你一起玩得很开心
<30-3,Wilson>And they had fun with you.

760
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,400
<30-3,Wilson>发生了什么
<30-3,Wilson>What happened?

761
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,210
<30-4,House>我觉得他们可以成为我的朋友
<30-4,House>I realized that they could be my friends.

762
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,930
<30-5,Wilson>你是认真的吗
<30-5,Wilson>You're serious.

763
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,010
<30-6,House>然后我清醒过来
<30-6,House>And then I sobered up.

764
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,510
<30-7,Wilson>你没有醉的太厉害
<30-7,Wilson>You weren't that drunk.

765
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,190
<30-7,Wilson>昨晚你成功找到了
<30-7,Wilson>You managed to find your way

766
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,490
<30-7,Wilson>回到自己小床上的路
<30-7,Wilson>Into your own little bed last night.

767
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,030
<30-8,House>我觉得我在火箭飞船图案的床单上睡得更香
<30-8,House>I think I sleep better in rocket ship sheets.

768
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,410
<30-9,Wilson>不  你想把这归罪于醉酒  这很容易
<30-9,Wilson>No, you want to blame this on the booze, but that's easy.

769
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,950
<30-9,Wilson>但改变却很难
<30-9,Wilson>Change is hard.

770
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,730
<30-10,House>而智慧的意义就在于能分清
<30-10,House>And wisdom is knowing the difference

771
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,040
<30-10,House>你所能够改变的
<30-10,House>Between what you can change...

<30-10,House>And what you were born with.

773
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,800
<30-11,Wilson>而怯懦就是把
<30-11,Wilson>And cowardice is labeling

774
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,150
<30-11,Wilson>不想改变说成是与生俱来
<30-11,Wilson>What you don't want to change as innate.

775
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,960
<30-12,Wilson>这场辩论我赢了
<30-12,Wilson>I was winning this argument.

<30-19,House>With a possessive pronoun.

784
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,950
<30-20,Ted>这样  这样好多了
<30-20,Ted>Oh, wow, that-- that's better.

785
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,470
<30-21,Ted>好了  够了
