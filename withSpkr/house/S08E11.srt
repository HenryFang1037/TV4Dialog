1
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,260
<1-1,Taub>血压  赶紧恢复血压啊
<1-1,Taub>Pressure. I need pressure.

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,070
<1-2,Adams>凯莉钳穿上缝线给我  我需要肾上腺素
<1-2,Adams>Get me sutures on a Kelly. Need an EPI.

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,440
<1-2,Adams>安排手术室  准备10单位血  通知创伤科
<1-2,Adams>Get OR. Ten unpacked. Alert trauma.

4
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,200
<1-2,Adams>我们得记录下这是一场正式听证会
<1-2,Adams>Let the record show that we are officially convening

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,180
<1-2,Adams>有关于2012年2月3日209病房里
<1-2,Adams>a disciplinary hearing regarding the events

6
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,870
<3-1,Cofield>所发生的事
<3-1,Cofield>of February 3, 2012 in patient room 209.

7
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,490
<3-1,Cofield>豪斯医生  这份记录将会
<3-1,Cofield>Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed

8
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,310
<3-1,Cofield>同其它文件和判决材料
<3-1,Cofield>and published along with

9
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,670
<3-1,Cofield>一起转录及公布
<3-1,Cofield>all supporting documentation and rulings.

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,650
<3-1,Cofield>在开始前  你还有什么疑问吗
<3-1,Cofield>Do you have any questions before we get started?

11
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,470
<3-1,Cofield>有
<3-1,Cofield>Yeah.

12
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,290
<3-2,House>你到底是谁
<3-2,House>Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,770
<3-3,Cofield>我是沃尔特·科菲尔德  仁爱医院的
<3-3,Cofield>I'm Walter Cofield, Chief of Neurology,

14
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,240
<3-3,Cofield>神经内科主任
<3-3,Cofield>Mercy Hospital.

15
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,740
<3-3,Cofield>今天  你的命运我说了算
<3-3,Cofield>I'll be deciding your fate today.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,270
<3-3,Cofield>科菲尔德
<3-3,Cofield>Cofield.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,270
<3-4,House>在你去仁爱医院之前
<3-4,House>You were the Residency Director at Hopkins

25
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,540
<3-4,House>是霍普金斯医院的原住院医生主管
<3-4,House>before you moved to Mercy,

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,890
<3-4,House>也就是说
<3-4,House>which means it's safe to assume

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,210
<3-4,House>福曼是你一手培养的
<3-4,House>that you trained Foreman,

29
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,020
<3-4,House>也就意味着他很相信你
<3-4,House>which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,840
<3-5,Cofield>这次听证会的对象不是我  豪斯医生
<3-5,Cofield>This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,010
<3-5,Cofield>我知道你想把矛头指向我
<3-5,Cofield>I know you'd like to make it about me,

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,710
<3-5,Cofield>好让你为自己开脱
<3-5,Cofield>because then it wouldn't be about you.

35
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,360
<3-5,Cofield>他选自己过去的恩师
<3-5,Cofield>It's interesting

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,230
<3-6,House>来审现在的恩师  真有意思
<3-6,House>that he'd pick the old mentor to judge the new one.

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,860
<3-7,Cofield>是挺有意思  但无关紧要
<3-7,Cofield>Interesting, but not relevant.

39
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,740
<3-7,Cofield>另一方面  这个病例的真实情况...
<3-7,Cofield>The facts of this case, on the other hand--

40
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,020
<3-8,House>真实情况都在病历里写着呢
<3-8,House>The facts are in the file.

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,330
<3-8,House>总监：
<3-8,House>zlean

42
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,480
<3-8,House>如果你看不懂我的字
<3-8,House>If you have trouble reading my handwriting,

43
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,550
<3-8,House>医学顾问：
<3-8,House>徐

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,410
<3-8,House>给我打电话
<3-8,House>give me a call.

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,730
<3-8,House>我要回去工作了
<3-8,House>I'm going back to work.

47
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,840
<3-9,Cofield>如果我只参考病历做决断的话
<3-9,Cofield>If I just consider the file,

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,140
<3-9,Cofield>你可占不到什么便宜
<3-9,Cofield>the facts aren't in your favor.

49
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,930
<3-9,Cofield>有事实证明你应该被停职
<3-9,Cofield>The facts say you should be suspended,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,040
<3-9,Cofield>按我的理解
<3-9,Cofield>which, from what I understand,

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,150
<3-9,Cofield>这样的话  你的假释也就得终止了
<3-9,Cofield>would mean a revocation of your parole.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,570
<3-10,House>病人是个32岁的高中化学老师
<3-10,House>The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher.

53
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,870
<3-10,House>他在慢跑时昏倒
<3-10,House>He collapsed while out jogging.

54
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
<3-10,House>他四肢瘫痪
<3-10,House>He was paralyzed in all four extremities

55
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,270
<3-10,House>然而扫描结果...
<3-10,House>despite the fact that the scans...

56
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,380
<4-1,Foreman>显示没有中风或者其它结构性病变的迹象
<4-1,Foreman>Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.

57
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,200
<4-2,House>那赶紧去通缉一辆
<4-2,House>Put out an APB for a car

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
<4-2,House>保险杠上有人形凹槽的汽车吧
<4-2,House>with a man-shaped dent in the grill.

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,800
<4-3,Foreman>没有骨折  没有创伤
<4-3,Foreman>No broken bones, no signs of trauma.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,810
<4-4,House>横贯性脊髓炎
<4-4,House>Transverse myelitis.

61
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,070
<4-4,House>真无聊
<4-4,House>Boring.

62
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,280
<4-5,Foreman>核磁共振没有增强
<4-5,Foreman>No enhancement on the MRI.

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,700
<4-5,Foreman>我不知道下一步该怎么办了
<4-5,Foreman>I just don't know what to do.

64
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,680
<4-5,Foreman>求你了  你得帮我搞定这个病人
<4-5,Foreman>Please, you have to help me solve this thing.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,850
<5-1,House>我就加了点诗意嘛
<5-1,House>A little poetic license.

66
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,930
<5-2,Cofield>你干什么呢
<5-2,Cofield>What are you doing?

67
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,020
<5-3,House>吃我的维柯...他命
<5-3,House>Taking my vic-amins.

68
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,320
<5-4,Cofield>那是维柯丁吗
<5-4,Cofield>Those are Vicodin?

69
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,460
<5-4,Cofield>你最近动过手术吗
<5-4,Cofield>Did you have surgery recently?

70
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,160
<5-5,House>大概十年前吧
<5-5,House>About a decade ago.

71
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,180
<5-5,House>我的腿疼可算不来时间
<5-5,House>My leg is no good at judging time.

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,880
<5-6,Cofield>你在处理这个病例期间有没有服用维柯丁
<5-6,Cofield>Were you taking Vicodin during this case?

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,710
<5-6,Cofield>有
<5-6,Cofield>Yes.

74
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,130
<5-7,House>在处理过去九年间的所有病例时都这样
<5-7,House>And during about nine years of previous cases.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,430
<5-7,House>我这么做是经过许可的
<5-7,House>My process is proven.

76
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,550
<5-7,House>好事常有
<5-7,House>Good things usually happen.

77
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,020
<5-7,House>坏事不常有
<5-7,House>Bad things sometimes happen.

78
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,900
<5-8,Cofield>当出了状况时
<5-8,Cofield>And when bad things happen,

79
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
<5-8,Cofield>我们就得搞明白是哪块出了问题
<5-8,Cofield>we should figure out what went wrong,

80
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,740
<5-8,Cofield>这样我们才能吸取教训改正错误
<5-8,Cofield>so we can learn from it and correct it.

81
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,680
<5-9,House>是这样我们就能横加指责
<5-9,House>So that we can assign blame

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,110
<5-9,House>而不是意识到
<5-9,House>instead of recognizing

83
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,180
<5-9,House>有时就是会出状况
<5-9,House>that bad things sometimes happen.

84
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,270
<5-9,House>弄成这样谁都没错
<5-9,House>It was nobody's fault.

85
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,530
<5-10,Cofield>之后怎么了
<5-10,Cofield>And then what happened?

86
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,090
<6-1,House>有能力的人就去营生
<6-1,House>Those who can, do.

88
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,870
<6-1,House>没能力的人就去教书
<6-1,House>Those who can't, teach.

89
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,780
<6-1,House>不会教书的  教体育
<6-1,House>Those who can't teach, teach gym.

90
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
<6-1,House>不会教体育的
<6-1,House>Those who can't move their arms or legs

91
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,860
<6-1,House>便要教我们嘲笑他人
<6-1,House>teach us to laugh at others.

92
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,780
<6-1,House>豪斯真的是这么陈述病人情况的吗
<6-1,House>House actually presented the case in that way,

93
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,880
<6-1,House>还是你故意让他难堪
<6-1,House>or are you just trying to make him look bad?

94
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,830
<6-1,House>我为什么要故意让他难堪
<6-1,House>Why would I be trying to make him look bad?

95
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,050
<6-1,House>可能是你并不很隐晦地想暗示
<6-1,House>Could be your not-so-subtle way of implying

96
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,560
<6-1,House>这是豪斯的错
<6-1,House>this was House's fault.

97
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,290
<8-1,Adams>鉴于发生的事实
<8-1,Adams>Given what's happened, it's understandable

98
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,960
<8-2,Cofield>你在你的证词里带有感情色彩是很正常的
<8-2,Cofield>that your opinion would color your testimony,

99
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,010
<8-2,Cofield>但我只想知道你当时说了什么
<8-2,Cofield>but I just want to know what you said, what you did,

100
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,710
<8-2,Cofield>做了什么  是怎么想的
<8-2,Cofield>and what you were thinking at the time.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,440
<8-3,Adams>我认为不是他的错
<8-3,Adams>I don't think it was his fault.

102
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,570
<8-4,Cofield>告诉我你最初的判断
<8-4,Cofield>Just tell me your initial theory.

103
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,550
<8-5,Taub>我一开始认为病人是肝有问题
<8-5,Taub>I thought the patient had a liver problem.

104
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,880
<8-5,Taub>肝性脑病可以解释他昏过去
<8-5,Taub>Hepatic encephalopathy explained why he passed out,

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,490
<8-5,Taub>以及四肢瘫痪的原因
<8-5,Taub>why he couldn't move his limbs.

106
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,560
<8-6,Cofield>但豪斯不同意你的观点
<8-6,Cofield>But that's not the idea House went with.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,920
<8-7,Park>他认为陶博的想法很蠢
<8-7,Park>He thought Taub's idea was stupid.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,510
<8-8,Cofield>那你是怎么想的
<8-8,Cofield>And what about your idea?

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,090
<8-9,Park>他认为我的想法也很蠢
<8-9,Park>He thought that was stupid too.

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,380
<8-10,Cofield>不  我是问  你的想法是什么
<8-10,Cofield>No, I meant, what was it?

111
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,270
<8-11,Park>我认为病人是正常压力性脑积水
<8-11,Park>Oh. I thought the patient had normal pressure hydrocephalus.

112
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,520
<8-12,Cofield>那为什么豪斯认为这是个蠢主意
<8-12,Cofield>And why did House think that was stupid?

113
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,820
<8-13,House>得了吧
<8-13,House>Oh, come on.

114
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,470
<8-13,House>除非你也是个蠢蛋
<8-13,House>Unless you're an idiot,

115
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,790
<8-13,House>不然你肯定知道我为什么认为朴克是蠢货
<8-13,House>you know why I thought Park was an idiot.

116
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,420
<8-14,Cofield>患者腰椎穿刺术中起始脑脊液压力低
<8-14,Cofield>The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,980
<8-15,House>我就是这么说的
<8-15,House>That's what I said.

118
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,480
<9-1,House>不对  你这个笨蛋
<9-1,House>No, you idiot.

119
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,470
<8-14,Cofield>患者腰椎穿刺术中起始脑脊液压力低
<8-14,Cofield>The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.

120
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,590
<9-1,House>下次睁大你们的眼睛仔细看看检查结果好不好
<9-1,House>Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.

121
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,690
<9-1,House>你是在故意惹我生气
<9-1,House>Are you intentionally trying to get me

122
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,840
<10-1,Cofield>想让我讨厌你吗
<10-1,Cofield>to dislike you?

123
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,110
<10-2,House>那不是我  是椅子说的
<10-2,House>That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,500
<10-3,Cofield>你明知这是在录证词  还要用
<10-3,Cofield>You're testifying, for the record,

125
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,650
<10-4,House>"睁大你们的眼睛"这句话吗
<10-4,House>that you actually used the phrasing "Unsquint your eyes"?

126
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,790
<10-3,Cofield>这可不是你展露内疚的地方
<10-3,Cofield>It's not the place to exercise your guilt.

127
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,340
<10-4,House>我真的说了这句话
<10-4,House>I actually used the phrasing

128
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,790
<10-4,House>"睁大你们的眼睛"
<10-4,House>"Unsquint your eyes".

129
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,160
<10-4,House>他的血钾过低
<10-4,House>He's hypokalemic.

130
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,510
<11-1,Chase>可能意味着心脏有问题
<11-1,Chase>Could indicate a problem with his heart,

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,180
<11-2,Adams>-这可能是...  -心电图正常
<11-2,Adams>- which would-- - EKG was normal.

132
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,800
<11-3,House>但奇斯  真正仔细看
<11-3,House>But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time

133
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,210
<11-3,House>检查结果的医生说的有道理
<11-3,House>to read the lab reports, has a point.

134
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,740
<11-3,House>这家伙的钾太低了
<11-3,House>The guy's potassium is off.

135
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,990
<11-3,House>可能是甲亢性瘫痪  给他用...
<11-3,House>Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on...

136
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,270
<12-1,House>类固醇  丙基硫氧嘧啶  β受体阻滞剂
<12-1,House>Steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.

137
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,720
<12-2,Cofield>这些橙色的印记是怎么弄到病历上的
<12-2,Cofield>And how did these orange smudges get on the patient files?

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,910
<12-2,Cofield>你真的假的
<12-2,Cofield>Seriously?

139
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,680
<12-3,House>你接下来就准备问这问题吗
<12-3,House>That's your follow-up?

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,990
<12-3,House>我吃了好多奇多  而且忘了洗手
<12-3,House>I eat a lot of cheetos. I forget to wash my hands.

142
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,560
<12-3,House>我吃的零食跟这病例有关吗
<12-3,House>Is my snacking really relevant to this case?

143
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,410
<12-4,Cofield>如果这些真是奇多圈的印记的话  有可能
<12-4,Cofield>Might be, if these were actually cheetos' stains.

144
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,360
<12-4,Cofield>到底是什么
<12-4,Cofield>What are they?

145
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,920
<13-1,Chase>真的假的  豪斯
<13-1,Chase>Seriously, House?

146
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,240
<13-2,House>你还能怪我啊
<13-2,House>You're blaming me?

147
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,510
<13-2,House>你用的是亚当斯的洗发水
<13-2,House>You used Adams' shampoo.

148
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,680
<13-3,Adams>不是我干的
<13-3,Adams>I didn't do it.

149
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,120
<13-3,Adams>那只是个无伤大雅的小恶作剧
<13-3,Adams>It was a harmless prank.

150
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,620
<13-3,Adams>我的团队成员都很有个性
<13-3,Adams>My team is made up of Type-A personalities.

151
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,450
<14-1,House>他们偶尔都需要放松一下
<14-1,House>They need something to break the tension

152
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,050
<14-1,House>以缓解他们的压力
<14-1,House>every once in a while.

153
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,440
<14-2,Cofield>也就是说这是一个增进团队凝聚力的活动吗
<14-2,Cofield>So this was a team-building exercise?

154
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,920
<14-3,Adams>他是这么说的吗
<14-3,Adams>Is that what he called it?

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,040
<14-4,Cofield>他是这么暗示的
<14-4,Cofield>That's what he implied.

156
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,780
<14-5,Adams>豪斯更喜欢混乱  而不是团结
<14-5,Adams>House prefers chaos over cohesion.

157
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,220
<14-5,Adams>他坚信同事间意见相左
<14-5,Adams>He believes that disagreement and mistrust

158
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,100
<14-5,Adams>互不信任会激发出好点子
<14-5,Adams>lead to better ideas.

159
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,520
<14-5,Adams>他说的没错
<14-5,Adams>He's not wrong.

160
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,300
<14-6,Cofield>你是说他说的对吗
<14-6,Cofield>As opposed to being right?

161
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,610
<14-6,Cofield>那么你们就给病人用了类固醇
<14-6,Cofield>So you treated with steroids.

162
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,300
<14-6,Cofield>-之后怎么样了  -起效果了
<14-6,Cofield>- And then what happened? - They worked.

163
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,880
<14-7,Adams>我们的病人醒了
<14-7,Adams>Our patient woke up.

164
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,200
<15-4,Bill>比尔
<15-4,Bill>Bill?

165
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
<15-1,Emily>你能听见我吗
<15-1,Emily>Can you hear me?

166
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,150
<15-1,Emily>能
<15-1,Emily>Yeah.

167
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,160
<15-2,Bill>我好渴
<15-2,Bill>I'm thirsty.

168
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,370
<15-3,Adams>这很正常
<15-3,Adams>That's normal.

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
<15-3,Adams>你已经昏迷了几个小时了
<15-3,Adams>You've been in a coma for several hours.

170
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,880
<15-3,Adams>能告诉我你的名字吗
<15-3,Adams>Can you tell me your name?

171
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,110
<15-4,Bill>比尔
<15-4,Bill>Uh, Bill.

172
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,850
<15-4,Bill>比尔·科普曼
<15-4,Bill>Bill Koppelman.

173
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,860
<15-4,Bill>能告诉我发生了什么吗
<15-4,Bill>Can you tell me what happened to me?

174
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,560
<15-5,Taub>我们正在治疗你的甲状腺亢进
<15-5,Taub>We're treating you for an overactive thyroid.

175
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,350
<15-5,Taub>我们认为这是你昏倒和不能动的病因
<15-5,Taub>We think that's why you passed out and couldn't move.

176
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,460
<15-6,Adams>你能动下手指吗
<15-6,Adams>Can you wiggle your fingers for me?

177
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,520
<15-7,Jordan>他会好起来吗
<15-7,Jordan>Is he going to be okay?

178
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,680
<15-8,Taub>不好意思  只有家庭成员才可以进来
<15-8,Taub>Excuse me, but only family members are allowed.

179
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,900
<15-9,Bill>没关系
<15-9,Bill>It's okay.

180
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,380
<15-9,Bill>他们是我的学生
<15-9,Bill>They're my students.

181
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,290
<15-10,Jordan>学校里的每个人都非常担心你
<15-10,Jordan>Everyone back at school is so worried about you.

182
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,890
<15-11,Madison>他生病是因为那次爆炸吗
<15-11,Madison>Is he sick because of the explosion?

183
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,360
<16-1,Cofield>-什么爆炸  -什么爆炸
<16-1,Cofield>- What explosion? - What explosion?

184
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,470
<16-1,Cofield>什么爆炸
<16-1,Cofield>What explosion?

185
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,020
<16-2,Taub>他在班上做的化学实验
<16-2,Taub>A chemistry demonstration he was doing

186
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,380
<16-2,Taub>出了问题
<16-2,Taub>for his class went wrong.

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,020
<16-3,Cofield>为什么这点没记录在病史上
<16-3,Cofield>Why was it not already in the patient history?

188
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,220
<16-4,Taub>因为当时病人失去意识了
<16-4,Taub>Because the patient was unconscious.

189
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,040
<16-5,Cofield>但我以为豪斯医生同病人妻子聊过了
<16-5,Cofield>But I'm assuming Dr. House spoke to the wife.

190
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,270
<16-6,Taub>妻子并不知道那次爆炸
<16-6,Taub>The wife didn't know about the explosion.

191
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,630
<16-6,Taub>并且是我对她进行的询问
<16-6,Taub>And I was the one who questioned her,

192
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,270
<16-6,Taub>因此如果这算是疏忽的话
<16-6,Taub>so, if there was an oversight,

193
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,660
<16-6,Taub>那责任在我
<16-6,Taub>it was mine.

194
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,520
<16-7,Cofield>难道豪斯医生认为病人的病史不重要吗
<16-7,Cofield>Does Dr. House not attach importance to patient histories?

195
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,480
<16-8,Taub>不  他认为病史至关重要
<16-8,Taub>No, he thinks they're crucial.

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,450
<16-8,Taub>只是和病人共处一间屋子里
<16-8,Taub>He just doesn't think being in the same room

197
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,360
<16-8,Taub>并不重要
<16-8,Taub>as the patient is crucial.

198
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,300
<16-8,Taub>豪斯认为避免和病人接触
<16-8,Taub>House thinks avoiding patients

199
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,920
<16-8,Taub>可以使他尽可能保持客观的判断
<16-8,Taub>allows him to stay as objective as possible.

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,820
<16-8,Taub>他没错
<16-8,Taub>He's not wrong.

201
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,860
<16-9,Cofield>听上去像是为他的懒惰找了个冠冕堂皇的借口
<16-9,Cofield>Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.

202
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,740
<16-10,House>那也没错
<16-10,House>That's also true.

203
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,460
<16-10,House>无论怎样  有人替我干
<16-10,House>Either way, I'm covered.

204
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,040
<16-10,House>如果你想得到准确的病史
<16-10,House>If you want an accurate patient history,

205
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,750
<16-10,House>不要询问病人本人
<16-10,House>don't ever talk to the patient.

206
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,340
<16-10,House>人人都会撒谎
<16-10,House>Everybody lies.

207
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,650
<16-10,House>除我以外
<16-10,House>Except me.

208
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,680
<16-10,House>对你
<16-10,House>To you.

209
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,290
<16-10,House>我绝不会在这里撒谎
<16-10,House>Would never do that.

210
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,670
<16-11,Cofield>好吧  就算你是对的
<16-11,Cofield>Okay. Say you're right.

211
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,600
<16-11,Cofield>如果是你在屋子里
<16-11,Cofield>If you had actually been in the room,

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
<16-11,Cofield>询问那个病人
<16-11,Cofield>questioning the patient,

213
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,250
<16-11,Cofield>你就能看到他的肢体语言
<16-11,Cofield>you could read body language,

214
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,830
<16-11,Cofield>问些后续问题
<16-11,Cofield>you could ask follow-up questions,

215
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,360
<16-11,Cofield>警告他欺骗你的后果
<16-11,Cofield>warn him of the costs of lying to you.

216
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,500
<16-12,House>别忘了还能严刑逼供
<16-12,House>Don't forget the thumbscrews.

217
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,810
<16-13,Cofield>你能否承认
<16-13,Cofield>Can you dispute the possibility that,

218
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,570
<16-13,Cofield>如果你更早的接触到病人
<16-13,Cofield>had you visited the patient sooner,

219
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,100
<16-13,Cofield>也许同他的妻子
<16-13,Cofield>maybe talked to the wife,

220
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,920
<16-13,Cofield>或是他的学生聊聊
<16-13,Cofield>been directed to one of the students,

221
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,810
<16-13,Cofield>这个病例的结果可能会大不相同吗
<16-13,Cofield>that this case might have ended very differently?

222
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,040
<17-1,Bill>那并不能完全算是一次爆炸
<17-1,Bill>It wasn't exactly an explosion.

223
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,910
<17-1,Bill>那是一次可控反应
<17-1,Bill>It was a controlled reaction

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,380
<17-1,Bill>只是有点失控
<17-1,Bill>that went a little haywire.

225
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,200
<17-2,Jordan>那就是一次爆炸
<17-2,Jordan>It was too an explosion.

226
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,000
<17-2,Jordan>西蒙·哈里斯用他的手机拍下了全过程
<17-2,Jordan>Simon Harris filmed the whole thing on his camera phone

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,240
<17-2,Jordan>并且放到了Youtube上
<17-2,Jordan>and posted it on YouTube.

228
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,410
<17-3,Madison>已经有七万五千次的点击率了
<17-3,Madison>It got, like, over 75,000 hits already.

229
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,340
<17-4,Emily>听上去你出名了亲爱的
<17-4,Emily>Looks like you've gone viral, Hon.

230
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,360
<17-4,Emily>他失去知觉
<17-4,Emily>He had a loss of consciousness,

231
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,160
<17-4,Emily>暂时性麻痹...
<17-4,Emily>temporary paralysis...

232
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,830
<18-1,House>但当我被告知病人开始咳血时
<18-1,House>But when I was told the patient coughed up blood,

233
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,910
<18-1,House>事情开始变得有意思了
<18-1,House>then things really started to get interesting.

234
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,250
<18-2,Cofield>你的病人不但要忍受双倍的疼痛并且伴有咳血
<18-2,Cofield>Your patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood,

235
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,130
<18-2,Cofield>你居然觉得有趣吗
<18-2,Cofield>and you found that interesting?

236
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,030
<18-3,House>怎么  难道不好吗
<18-3,House>Why, is that bad?

237
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,420
<18-4,Cofield>确实有趣
<18-4,Cofield>It's interesting.

238
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,490
<18-4,Cofield>我每年都做这个实验
<18-4,Cofield>I do this demonstration every year.

239
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,880
<19-1,Bill>一般都是助教帮我准备器材
<19-1,Bill>I usually have a student aide help me set it up,

240
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,290
<19-1,Bill>很明显今年他加了过多的氢氟酸
<19-1,Bill>and apparently this year he added extra hydrofluoric acid,

241
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,350
<19-1,Bill>这正是发生爆炸的原因
<19-1,Bill>which is why it exploded.

242
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,170
<19-1,Bill>那个助教只是想录个高点击率的视频
<19-1,Bill>The student aide was just trying to make a viral video,

243
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,000
<19-1,Bill>没想伤害任何人
<19-1,Bill>not hurt anyone.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,630
<20-1,Adams>结果事与愿违
<20-1,Adams>Ended up doing both.

245
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,500
<20-1,Adams>因此我们认为病人吸入了大剂量的
<20-1,Adams>So we figured the patient inhaled the extra large dose

246
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,990
<20-1,Adams>氢氟酸导致
<20-1,Adams>of hydrofluoric acid and...

247
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,850
<20-1,Adams>肺部灼伤
<20-1,Adams>Burned his lungs,

248
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,490
<21-1,Adams>因此他才会咳血
<21-1,Adams>which is why he coughed up blood.

249
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,690
<21-2,Taub>就好像烧坏肺叶能解释
<21-2,Taub>If only burnt lungs explained

250
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,440
<21-2,Taub>晕倒和麻痹一样
<21-2,Taub>the passing out and paralysis.

251
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,470
<21-3,Park>爆炸能  重新看一遍视频
<21-3,Park>The explosion does. Check out the video again.

252
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,860
<21-3,Park>他的头撞到了墙
<21-3,Park>He smacked his head against the wall.

253
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,310
<21-3,Park>如果那导致了脑干肿胀
<21-3,Park>If that caused swelling in his brainstem,

254
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,110
<21-3,Park>最终会引起知觉丧失
<21-3,Park>that would have led to eventual loss

255
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
<23-1,Park>以及身体麻痹
<23-1,Park>of consciousness and paralysis.

256
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,790
<22-1,Park>我们讨论了一会
<22-1,Park>So we discussed it a little longer,

257
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,610
<22-1,Park>然后豪斯决定用肝素进行治疗
<22-1,Park>and House decided to treat with Heparin.

258
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,010
<22-2,Cofield>我不介意你说的更详细些
<22-2,Cofield>I wouldn't mind a couple more details.

259
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,970
<22-3,Park>是肝素气雾剂
<22-3,Park>It was aerosolized Heparin.

260
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,740
<22-4,Cofield>你跳过了鉴别诊断的过程
<22-4,Cofield>You skipped over the actual DDX,

261
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,370
<22-4,Cofield>而现在你移开了你的目光
<22-4,Cofield>and now you're averting your eyes.

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,640
<22-4,Cofield>我对当时的情况越来越好奇了
<22-4,Cofield>I'm growing more and more curious by the moment.

263
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,820
<23-1,Park>他的头撞到了墙
<23-1,Park>He smacked his head against the wall.

264
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,120
<23-1,Park>如果那导致了脑干肿胀
<23-1,Park>If that caused swelling in his brainstem,

265
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,750
<23-1,Park>最终会引起知觉丧失
<23-1,Park>that would have led to eventual loss

266
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,690
<23-1,Park>以及身体麻痹
<23-1,Park>of consciousness and paralysis.

267
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,380
<23-2,House>所有人不许动
<23-2,House>Nobody move.

268
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,690
<23-2,House>他  他戴了什么
<23-2,House>He--he had on a what?

269
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,030
<24-1,Cofield>防毒面具
<24-1,Cofield>Gas mask.

270
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,030
<24-2,Park>那个臭弹是奇斯做的
<24-2,Park>The stink bomb was Chase's.

271
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,030
<24-2,Park>他是想为橘色头发的事进行报复
<24-2,Park>He was getting revenge for the orange hair

272
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,670
<24-2,Park>因此把它藏在了豪斯的办公室里
<24-2,Park>and rigged it in House's office.

273
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,960
<24-2,Park>但豪斯发现了
<24-2,Park>But House found it.

274
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,680
<25-1,House>我有答案了你们才能走
<25-1,House>You can leave when I have an answer.

275
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,400
<25-2,Chase>如果我们知道问题的话
<25-2,Chase>It might help if we knew the question.

276
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,600
<25-3,House>如何治疗
<25-3,House>How do we treat

277
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
<25-3,House>肺叶里的化学灼伤
<25-3,House>chemical burns inside the lungs?

278
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,350
<25-4,Adams>也许可以用水进行
<25-4,Adams>Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage

279
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,570
<25-4,Adams>支气管肺泡灌洗
<25-4,Adams>to wash 'em out with water.

280
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,770
<25-5,House>不好意思  我的错  我该说清楚的
<25-5,House>Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified.

281
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,380
<25-3,House>如何才能治疗肺叶内的
<25-3,House>How do we treat chemical burns

282
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,970
<25-5,House>化学灼伤而不杀死病人
<25-5,House>inside the lungs without killing the patient?

283
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,980
<25-6,Park>磺胺嘧啶银盐治疗化学灼伤很有效
<25-6,Park>Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.

284
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,360
<25-7,House>灼伤类乳液会导致他更快的被溺死
<25-7,House>Burn cream would drown him faster than water.

285
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,190
<25-7,House>还有吗
<25-7,House>Well?

286
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,300
<25-8,Taub>肝素气雾剂
<25-8,Taub>Aerosolized Heparin.

287
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,890
<25-9,House>我喜欢
<25-9,House>Me likey.

288
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,470
<25-10,Park>但那还在试验阶段
<25-10,Park>But that's only experimental.

289
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,230
<25-10,Park>从没进行过临床应用
<25-10,Park>It's never actually been used before.

290
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,590
<25-11,House>不完全是
<25-11,House>Not true.

291
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,980
<26-1,House>已经在羊身上用过了
<26-1,House>Been used in sheep.

292
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,030
<26-3,House>病人情况恶化很快
<26-3,House>The guy was going downhill fast.

293
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,200
<26-3,House>我们需要进行某种治疗以...
<26-3,House>We needed a treatment that was a...

294
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,600
<26-3,House>改变这种情况
<26-3,House>slope changer.

295
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,030
<26-4,Cofield>因此你就打碎了那个二氧化硫的臭弹
<26-4,Cofield>So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?

296
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,690
<26-5,House>相当于一次团队建设训练
<26-5,House>It was a team-building exercise.

297
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,790
<26-6,Cofield>不  你这是操纵
<26-6,Cofield>No. It was manipulation.

298
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,180
<26-6,Cofield>你迫使你的团队为了离开那间屋子而
<26-6,Cofield>You were pressuring your team into coming up

299
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,050
<26-6,Cofield>想出一个不安全的治疗方案
<26-6,Cofield>with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.

300
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,890
<26-7,House>你说是压力  我觉得是启发
<26-7,House>You say pressure, I say inspire.

301
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,880
<26-7,House>常规安全的方法不会起作用的
<26-7,House>The usual safe ideas were not gonna work.

302
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,420
<26-7,House>肝素气雾剂可能有用
<26-7,House>Aerosolized Heparin might.

303
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,420
<26-8,Cofield>其他人就这么同意了吗
<26-8,Cofield>And everyone else just went along with this?

304
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,760
<26-8,Cofield>不
<26-8,Cofield>No.

305
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,530
<26-9,Park>我告诉豪斯我认为那是个错误
<26-9,Park>I told House I thought it was a mistake.

306
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,990
<26-10,Cofield>那是你当时的原话吗
<26-10,Cofield>And those were your exact words?

307
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,710
<26-11,Park>我想我的原话是他疯了
<26-11,Park>I think I might have said insane.

308
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,130
<26-12,Cofield>你认为他疯了但还是任他为所欲为
<26-12,Cofield>You thought it was insane, and yet you let it happen.

309
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,370
<26-14,Cofield>-不  我...- 如果你在病人安全方面
<26-14,Cofield>- No, I-- - If you disagree

310
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,200
<26-14,Cofield>不同意豪斯医生的意见   医生
<26-14,Cofield>with Dr. House on patient safety, Doctor,

311
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,580
<26-14,Cofield>你的职责就是说出来
<26-14,Cofield>it is your duty to speak up.

312
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,830
<26-14,Cofield>否则你也同样应受到谴责
<26-14,Cofield>Otherwise, you are equally to blame.

313
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,320
<26-15,Park>我确实说了  我努力了
<26-15,Park>I did speak up. I tried.

314
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,990
<26-16,Cofield>但你失败了
<26-16,Cofield>And you failed.

315
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,970
<26-17,Park>因此我去找了福曼医生
<26-17,Park>And that's why I went to Dr. Foreman.

316
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,770
<27-1,Park>肝素可能会导致血液
<27-1,Park>The Heparin could cause the patient to bleed

317
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,610
<27-1,Park>更快的流入病人肺中
<27-1,Park>into his lungs even faster.

318
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,760
<27-2,Foreman>这方案是很疯狂
<27-2,Foreman>It is crazy,

319
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
<27-2,Foreman>但豪斯不是为了发疯而发疯
<27-2,Foreman>but House doesn't do crazy just for crazy's sake.

320
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,720
<27-2,Foreman>如果他认为这是唯一能帮助病人的方法...
<27-2,Foreman>If he thinks this is the only way to help your patient...

321
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,740
<27-3,Cofield>当你让我调查这个病例时
<27-3,Cofield>You did not tell me you were involved in this case

322
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,900
<27-3,Cofield>你没告诉我你也参与其中
<27-3,Cofield>when you asked me to do this.

323
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,060
<27-4,Foreman>我没有
<27-4,Foreman>I wasn't.

324
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,360
<27-4,Foreman>对于肝素的决定
<27-4,Foreman>The Heparin decision

325
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,380
<27-4,Foreman>对结果没有任何影响
<27-4,Foreman>didn't have anything to do with the outcome.

326
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,330
<27-5,Cofield>若豪斯的决定你都给予通行
<27-5,Cofield>If signing off on everything House does is a pattern,

327
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,330
<27-5,Cofield>就会影响到豪斯的行为
<27-5,Cofield>it affects the way House behaves,

328
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,450
<27-5,Cofield>进而影响到豪斯的团队
<27-5,Cofield>it affects the way House's team reacts

329
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,830
<27-5,Cofield>如何回应他的行为
<27-5,Cofield>to the way House behaves.

330
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,350
<27-5,Cofield>豪斯...
<27-5,Cofield>House...

331
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,990
<27-6,Foreman>是天才
<27-6,Foreman>is brilliant.

332
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,730
<27-6,Foreman>多数时候  我都不会反对他的决定
<27-6,Foreman>I give him the benefit of the doubt most of the time

333
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,640
<27-6,Foreman>因为我见识过他的能力
<27-6,Foreman>because I've seen what he can do.

334
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,800
<27-7,Cofield>让豪斯出狱 是你当院长以来
<27-7,Cofield>Getting House out of prison is the biggest decision

335
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,030
<27-7,Cofield>做出的最大的决定  不是吗
<27-7,Cofield>you've made as Dean of Medicine, right?

336
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,450
<27-7,Cofield>如果他在此次听证后被停职
<27-7,Cofield>And if he's suspended as a result of this hearing,

337
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,840
<27-7,Cofield>就违反了假释条例  得重回监狱
<27-7,Cofield>he violates his parole and he goes back.

338
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,380
<27-7,Cofield>估计这会让院长的头衔成为你的过去
<27-7,Cofield>And that probably leaves you as former Dean of Medicine.

339
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,870
<27-8,Foreman>应该是的
<27-8,Foreman>I suppose so.

340
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,620
<27-9,Cofield>你让我来监督这事并非因为
<27-9,Cofield>You didn't choose me to oversee this

341
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,460
<27-9,Cofield>你认为我能保持客观
<27-9,Cofield>because you thought I could be objective.

342
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,530
<27-9,Cofield>你选中我是因为  你以为我会保你万全
<27-9,Cofield>You chose me because you thought I'd have your back

343
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,660
<27-9,Cofield>对于会导致你被炒鱿鱼的决定
<27-9,Cofield>and I'd think twice about making a decision

344
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,380
<27-9,Cofield>我会慎重考虑
<27-9,Cofield>that would get you fired.

345
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,570
<27-9,Cofield>艾瑞克
<27-9,Cofield>Eric.

346
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,070
<27-9,Cofield>很抱歉
<27-9,Cofield>I'm sorry.

347
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,710
<27-9,Cofield>但若你这放虎归山的险招
<27-9,Cofield>But if your get-House-out-of-jail-free

348
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,060
<27-9,Cofield>是搬起石头砸自己的脚
<27-9,Cofield>experiment blows up in your face,

349
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,420
<27-9,Cofield>帮你渡过难关可不是我的责任
<27-9,Cofield>it's not my job to get you out of it.

350
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,290
<28-1,Cofield>在你决定使用肝素后
<28-1,Cofield>After you'd administered the Heparin,

351
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,750
<28-1,Cofield>我发现病历中有张出院许可
<28-1,Cofield>I see there was a discharge order on the chart,

352
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,470
<28-1,Cofield>但病人从未出院
<28-1,Cofield>and yet the patient never left.

353
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,630
<28-2,Adams>豪斯让病人先做治疗式沐浴
<28-2,Adams>House ordered a therapeutic bath first

354
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,810
<28-2,Adams>以洗去爆炸后残留的化学物质
<28-2,Adams>to wash off any residual chemicals from the blast.

355
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,110
<28-2,Adams>但我们另有发现
<28-2,Adams>But we wound up finding something.

356
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,430
<28-2,Adams>你发了点皮疹
<28-2,Adams>You have a bit of a rash.

357
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,910
<28-2,Adams>能把两臂抬高吗
<28-2,Adams>Can you raise both your arms?

358
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,530
<29-1,Adams>让我检查下面积有多大
<29-1,Adams>I just need to see how far it goes.

359
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,150
<29-2,Bill>你跟我说我会好转的
<29-2,Bill>You told me I was going to be okay.

360
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,170
<29-2,Bill>但我的身体还是有问题
<29-2,Bill>And now there's still something wrong with me.

361
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,820
<29-3,Park>这可能不是大问题
<29-3,Park>It probably doesn't mean anything,

362
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,450
<29-3,Park>我们只是确认一下
<29-3,Park>but we want to make sure.

363
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,730
<29-4,Bill>就知道你这么说
<29-4,Bill>Of course you do.

364
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,010
<29-4,Bill>我要离开这里
<29-4,Bill>I got to get out of here, okay?

365
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,390
<29-6,Bill>-放轻松  -让我离开这
<29-6,Bill>- Just relax. - Please just let me get out of here.

366
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,520
<29-7,Adams>很快就好
<29-7,Adams>It'll just take a minute.

367
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,110
<29-7,Adams>我们只是要看一下皮疹
<29-7,Adams>We just need to get a good look at the rash.

368
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,130
<30-1,Park>皮疹吗  那个不是问题
<30-1,Park>The rash? That was nothing.

369
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,500
<30-1,Park>只是因为躺了一天捂得
<30-1,Park>Just some irritation from lying in bed all day.

370
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,950
<30-1,Park>问题在于病人的精神状态
<30-1,Park>The problem was the patient's brain.

371
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,820
<30-1,Park>他吓坏了
<30-1,Park>He freaked out.

372
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,880
<30-1,Park>我要走
<30-1,Park>I got to--I got to get out.

373
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,520
<30-1,Park>我一定要走
<30-1,Park>I got to get out of here.

374
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,220
<30-1,Park>说"吓坏了"有点夸张
<30-1,Park>"Freak out" is a little strong.

375
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,130
<30-1,Park>当时我的观点是
<30-1,Park>In my opinion at the time,

376
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,640
<32-1,Adams>皮疹才是会致死的病因
<32-1,Adams>it was the rash that was gonna kill him.

377
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,570
<32-1,Adams>链状球菌感染
<32-1,Adams>Invasive strep.

378
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,650
<32-2,Cofield>有证据支持的合理诊断
<32-2,Cofield>Reasonable theory, supported by the evidence.

379
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,530
<32-3,Park>症状表明是精神错乱
<32-3,Park>The evidence pointed to psychosis.

380
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,390
<32-3,Park>因为我们在他初入院时
<32-3,Park>We caused it by giving him steroids

381
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,730
<32-3,Park>给他用了类固醇
<32-3,Park>when he first came in.

382
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,510
<32-4,Cofield>你的观点呢
<32-4,Cofield>What'd you think?

383
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,570
<32-5,Taub>我认为朴克和亚当斯的观察都对
<32-5,Taub>I thought Park and Adams were both right

384
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,860
<32-5,Taub>但她俩的结论都错了
<32-5,Taub>but that their conclusions were both wrong.

385
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,530
<32-5,Taub>神经症状和皮疹都是
<32-5,Taub>The neuro symptoms and the rash were both signs

386
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,500
<32-5,Taub>病人所患病的症状
<32-5,Taub>of an underlying disease.

387
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,320
<32-5,Taub>再加上肺部问题  结合起来是韦格纳病
<32-5,Taub>Together with the lung, it added up to Wegener's.

388
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,050
<32-6,Cofield>三个能干的医生
<32-6,Cofield>How does Dr. House handle it

389
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,680
<32-6,Cofield>得出三个不同但皆有理的诊断
<32-6,Cofield>when three smart doctors come up with

390
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,770
<32-6,Cofield>这时豪斯医生要怎么办
<32-6,Cofield>three different but equally valid ideas?

391
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,830
<32-7,House>我会进行诊断性试验
<32-7,House>I run a diagnostic trial.

392
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,180
<33-1,House>给病人使用高剂量类固醇
<33-1,House>Start the patient on high-dose steroids.

393
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,180
<33-1,House>一石多鸟
<33-1,House>Multiple birds, single stone.

394
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,290
<33-1,House>若陶博是对的  他就能立刻病愈出院
<33-1,House>If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured.

395
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,110
<33-1,House>若亚当斯是对的  他会发烧
<33-1,House>If Adams is right, he'll spike a fever,

396
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,470
<33-1,House>出现低血压  我们再对症下药
<33-1,House>get hypotensive, we can treat it.

397
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,240
<33-1,House>他便能病愈出院
<33-1,House>He can walk out of here cured.

398
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,290
<33-1,House>若朴克是对的
<33-1,House>If Park is right,

399
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,140
<33-1,House>他就会大发神经
<33-1,House>he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us,

400
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,870
<33-1,House>能确认病因在于大脑
<33-1,House>we can cross "brain" off the list,

401
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,150
<34-1,House>做出诊断  他也能病愈出院
<34-1,House>diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.

402
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,810
<34-1,House>你是让我更快做决定吗
<34-1,House>Are you trying to make this easy for me?

403
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,230
<34-2,Cofield>你自己承认
<34-2,Cofield>By your own admission,

404
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,770
<34-2,Cofield>若给病人用类固醇
<34-2,Cofield>if you give the patient steroids,

405
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,540
<34-2,Cofield>会有三分之二的几率变得更严重
<34-2,Cofield>two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.

406
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,840
<34-3,House>若不能给出诊断
<34-3,House>What was making the patient worse

407
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
<34-3,House>才会让病情更严重
<34-3,House>was not having a diagnosis.

408
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,020
<34-3,House>这是得出结论的最快方式
<34-3,House>This was the fastest way to get it.

409
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,080
<34-3,House>这算是完美的诊断学时刻
<34-3,House>It was a perfect diagnostic moment.

410
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,390
<34-4,Cofield>考虑到发生的事情
<34-4,Cofield>In light of what happened,

411
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,120
<34-4,Cofield>你还认为这是完美的诊断学时刻吗
<34-4,Cofield>you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?

412
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,060
<34-5,House>是的
<34-5,House>Yes.

413
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,750
<34-5,House>我的理论考虑到了所有医学结果
<34-5,House>My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes.

414
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,970
<34-5,House>但没考虑到我的手下会不听话
<34-5,House>It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.

415
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,850
<5-2,Cofield>你在干什么
<5-2,Cofield>What are you doing?

416
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,910
<35-1,Adams>我觉得关于链状球菌你说得对
<35-1,Adams>I think you're right about the strep.

417
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,880
<35-2,Chase>等待时做下活检也无伤大雅
<35-2,Chase>Can't hurt to biopsy the rash while we're waiting.

418
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,640
<35-3,Adams>谢谢
<35-3,Adams>Thanks.

419
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,580
<36-1,Adams>当时  这看起来是个好主意
<36-1,Adams>At the time, it seemed like a good idea.

420
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,710
<36-2,Cofield>我知道这很难
<36-2,Cofield>I know this is hard,

421
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,990
<36-2,Cofield>但请你一五一十的告诉我接下来发生了什么
<36-2,Cofield>but please tell me exactly what happened next.

422
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,330
<37-1,Chase>来点儿麻醉
<37-1,Chase>Draw up a little anesthetic.

423
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,640
<37-2,Adams>2毫升利多卡因
<37-2,Adams>Two CCs Lidocaine.

424
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,760
<37-3,Bill>离我远点
<37-3,Bill>Get away from me.

425
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,180
<37-4,Chase>你是在医院里  冷静下来
<37-4,Chase>You're in a hospital. Calm down.

426
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,450
<37-5,Adams>安全警报
<37-5,Adams>Code Grey!

427
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,730
<38-1,Cofield>所以你认为原因在于你的团队
<38-1,Cofield>So your position is that your team's disobedience

428
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,140
<38-2,House>-不守指令  -我没这么说
<38-2,House>- caused this? - That's not what I said.

429
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,840
<38-3,Cofield>你说你没料到他们没按你说的做
<38-3,Cofield>You said you didn't anticipate their defiance.

430
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,330
<38-3,Cofield>就是在暗示  不然的话一切都没问题
<38-3,Cofield>You implied that all would have been fine otherwise.

431
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,770
<38-5,Cofield>那你说是谁的错
<38-5,Cofield>So who do you blame,

432
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,050
<38-3,Cofield>亚当斯医生  还是奇斯医生
<38-3,Cofield>Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase?

433
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,170
<38-3,Cofield>或两人都是
<38-3,Cofield>Or both?

434
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,170
<38-4,House>两人个都不是
<38-4,House>I don't blame either one.

435
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,650
<38-5,Cofield>那你说是谁呢  豪斯医生
<38-5,Cofield>So who do you blame, Dr. House?

436
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,840
<39-1,Adams>安全警报
<39-1,Adams>Code Grey!

437
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,660
<39-2,Adams>拿氟哌啶醇[强效安定]
<39-2,Adams>Get haloperidol.

438
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,590
<39-3,Taub>我来
<39-3,Taub>Got it.

439
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,460
<39-5,Adams>我的天  奇斯
<39-5,Adams>Oh, my God, Chase.

440
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
<39-6,Taub>准备手术室  推个轮床过来
<39-6,Taub>Prep the O.R. and get a gurney.

441
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,960
<39-6,Taub>开始静脉注射
<39-6,Taub>Start an I.V.

442
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,400
<39-7,Adams>出血点一定在这儿
<39-7,Adams>Come on. The bleeder's got to be in here.

443
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,290
<39-8,Taub>-找到了  -哪条动脉
<39-8,Taub>- Got it. - Which artery?

444
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,800
<39-9,Adams>是他的心脏
<39-9,Adams>It's his heart.

445
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,570
<40-1,Adams>幸运的是  只是刀尖伤到了心肌
<40-1,Adams>Fortunately, only the knife tip reached the cardiac muscle.

446
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,040
<40-1,Adams>在左心室划了一道口子
<40-1,Adams>Made a laceration in the left ventricle

447
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,170
<40-1,Adams>大约有我食指尖那么大
<40-1,Adams>about the size of the tip of my index finger.

448
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,280
<40-1,Adams>那时  只有我手指堵上伤口
<40-1,Adams>At that moment, he could only stay alive

449
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,820
<40-1,Adams>他才能活下去
<40-1,Adams>as long as my finger plugged the hole.

450
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,750
<40-1,Adams>躺在地上的很可能是我
<40-1,Adams>It could have been me on the floor.

451
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,620
<40-1,Adams>本该是我
<40-1,Adams>It should have been me.

452
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,990
<40-1,Adams>那是我的诊断
<40-1,Adams>It was my theory.

453
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,540
<40-1,Adams>我在病人眼前晃针头
<40-1,Adams>I held the needle in front of the patient

454
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,690
<40-1,Adams>让他精神错乱起来
<40-1,Adams>that set off his paranoia.

455
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,820
<40-1,Adams>如果你在找是谁的错
<40-1,Adams>If you're looking for someone to blame...

456
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,830
<40-1,Adams>那就是我
<40-1,Adams>blame me.

457
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,430
<40-2,Cofield>请继续
<40-2,Cofield>Please continue.

458
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,130
<41-1,Adams>出现异位性搏动
<41-1,Adams>Getting some ectopy.

459
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,750
<41-3,Park>-让一让  -颈动脉搏动很强
<41-3,Park>- Coming through. - Good carotid pulse.

460
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,670
<41-4,Adams>正常吗
<41-4,Adams>Regular?

461
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,680
<41-6,Adams>-不  -出现室性期前收缩
<41-6,Adams>- No. - Got a PVC.

462
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,270
<41-7,Nurse>大家让一让
<41-7,Nurse>Got to move it, people.

463
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,930
<42-1,House>我的诊断试验有效果
<42-1,House>My diagnostic test worked.

464
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,350
<42-1,House>证明病人患有类固醇诱发性精神病
<42-1,House>It proved the patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.

465
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,850
<42-2,Cofield>这就是你对这一情况的反映吗
<42-2,Cofield>And that's what you took away from this situation?

466
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,520
<42-3,House>精神问题并非是症状之一
<42-3,House>The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.

467
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,810
<42-4,Cofield>你的同事被捅伤了
<42-4,Cofield>Your colleague was stabbed.

468
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,610
<42-4,Cofield>你是说你不关心吗
<42-4,Cofield>Are you telling me you didn't care?

469
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,480
<43-1,House>情况有多糟
<43-1,House>How bad is it?

470
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,750
<43-2,Taub>很糟
<43-2,Taub>Bad.

471
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,170
<43-2,Taub>给我补片
<43-2,Taub>Patch.

472
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,370
<43-3,Adams>-准备好了吗  -我不能移开手指
<43-3,Adams>- Ready? - I can't take my finger out.

473
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,340
<43-3,Adams>他会大出血  我觉得他挺不过去
<43-3,Adams>He'll bleed. I don't think he can take it.

474
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,820
<43-4,House>血氧量已饱和
<43-4,House>Oxygenation's at 100%.

475
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,090
<43-4,House>也只能听天由命了
<43-4,House>He's as ready as he's gonna be.

476
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,040
<43-5,Taub>我们得放手一搏
<43-5,Taub>We got to go for it.

477
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,610
<43-6,Adams>听我口令
<43-6,Adams>On my count.

478
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,430
<43-7,Adams>一  二  三
<43-7,Adams>One, two, three.

479
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,810
<43-8,Taub>缝合
<43-8,Taub>Suture.

480
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,500
<43-9,Park>好了  血压稳定
<43-9,Park>Got it. BP is stable.

481
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,520
<43-10,Taub>补片堵住了伤口
<43-10,Taub>Patch is holding.

482
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,860
<43-11,House>他的心跳是多少
<43-11,House>What was his heart rate?

483
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,280
<43-12,Park>他没有心跳
<43-12,Park>He doesn't have one.

484
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,950
<43-12,Park>-他还在心脏分流  -不是奇斯的
<43-12,Park>- He's on bypass. - Not Chase.

485
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,690
<43-13,House>病人的心跳
<43-13,House>The patient.

486
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,690
<43-14,Adams>你这是在鉴别诊断吗
<43-14,Adams>You're DDX-ing?

487
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,450
<43-15,House>朴克  跟我来
<43-15,House>Park, come with me.

488
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,330
<43-15,House>这儿有陶博负责
<43-15,House>Taub's got this.

489
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,590
<43-16,Park>就是因为你不听我言
<43-16,Park>My friend is here

490
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,570
<43-16,Park>奇斯才会如此下场
<43-16,Park>because you didn't listen to me.

491
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,240
<43-17,House>我有听你的  是奇斯没听我的
<43-17,House>I did listen to you. Chase didn't listen to me.

492
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,100
<43-17,House>事到如今
<43-17,House>At this point,

493
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,250
<43-17,House>你在这里只是图个心里安慰
<43-17,House>being here makes you feel better.

494
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,120
<43-17,House>你既帮不了奇斯也帮不了我们的病人
<43-17,House>You're not helping Chase or our patient.

495
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,140
<43-17,House>好吧
<43-17,House>Fine.

496
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,550
<44-1,Cofield>他就这么离开了
<44-1,Cofield>So he just walked out?

497
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,550
<44-2,Taub>确实没他什么事儿
<44-2,Taub>There really was nothing for him to do.

498
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,750
<44-3,Cofield>你不觉得
<44-3,Cofield>Speaks to a certain callousness

499
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,520
<44-3,Cofield>豪斯医生很无情吗
<44-3,Cofield>on Dr. House's part, don't you think?

500
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,850
<44-4,Taub>谁管他是不是冷酷无情
<44-4,Taub>Who cares if House was callous?

501
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
<44-4,Taub>你要为了这个惩罚他吗
<44-4,Taub>Are you gonna punish callousness?

502
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,260
<44-5,Cofield>但你不认为同情心
<44-5,Cofield>But you agree that empathy

503
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,320
<44-5,Cofield>是身为医生非常重要的品质吗
<44-5,Cofield>is a useful quality for doctors?

504
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,450
<44-6,Taub>这不是豪斯的问题
<44-6,Taub>House is not the problem.

505
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,620
<44-7,Cofield>你的朋友被刺伤了
<44-7,Cofield>Your friend got stabbed.

506
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,860
<44-7,Cofield>生命垂危
<44-7,Cofield>He may die from those wounds.

507
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,930
<44-7,Cofield>如果你在那个房间里
<44-7,Cofield>If you had been in that room,

508
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,820
<44-7,Cofield>可能被刺伤的人就是你
<44-7,Cofield>maybe that could have been you.

509
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,730
<44-8,Taub>我才不会进那个房间
<44-8,Taub>I wouldn't have been in the room.

510
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,830
<44-9,Cofield>你是在暗示  奇斯他是咎由自取吗
<44-9,Cofield>Implicitly, you just said that Chase was at fault.

511
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,470
<44-10,Taub>我们都知道精神失常
<44-10,Taub>We all knew a psychotic episode

512
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,790
<44-10,Taub>是三种可能的结果之一
<44-10,Taub>was one of the three possible outcomes.

513
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,410
<44-10,Taub>而奇斯带了把手术刀进房间
<44-10,Taub>And Chase brought a scalpel in there.

514
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,310
<44-10,Taub>他的举动威胁到了亚当斯医生
<44-10,Taub>He endangered Dr. Adams,

515
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,720
<44-10,Taub>那个病人  以及他自己
<44-10,Taub>he endangered himself, and he endangered the patient.

<44-11,Caufield>谢谢
<44-11,Caufield>Thank you.

<45-5,House>Would it make a difference?

<45-12,Chase>'Cause I can't feel my legs.

542
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,470
<46-1,Cofield>奇斯医生

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,540
<46-2,Chase>是我
<46-2,Chase>Yeah.

545
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,400
<46-3,Cofield>我是沃尔特·科菲尔德
<46-3,Cofield>I'm Walter Cofield.

546
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,030
<46-3,Cofield>我是位神经病学家
<46-3,Cofield>I'm a neurologist over at...

547
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,960
<46-4,Chase>我知道你是谁
<46-4,Chase>I know who you are.

548
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,570
<46-4,Chase>很好
<46-4,Chase>Good.

549
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,510
<46-5,Cofield>你现在能回答几个问题吗
<46-5,Cofield>Think you're up for answering a couple questions?

550
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,820
<46-6,Chase>我又没法站起来逃跑
<46-6,Chase>Well, it's not like I can get up and run away.

551
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,620
<46-6,Chase>开个玩笑
<46-6,Chase>Wasn't my best joke.

552
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,320
<46-7,Cofield>我笑是因为
<46-7,Cofield>I'm smiling because,

553
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,350
<46-7,Cofield>在过去十二个小时里
<46-7,Cofield>for the last 12 hours,

554
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,690
<46-7,Cofield>我一直以为你头发是橘黄色的
<46-7,Cofield>I've been picturing you with orange hair.

555
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,830
<46-8,Chase>我染回来了
<46-8,Chase>I dyed it back.

556
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,090
<46-9,Cofield>你迁怒于豪斯医生吗
<46-9,Cofield>Were you angry with Dr. House?

557
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,990
<46-10,Chase>这是个恶作剧
<46-10,Chase>It was a prank.

558
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,120
<46-10,Chase>家常便饭了
<46-10,Chase>It wasn't uncommon.

559
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,240
<46-11,Cofield>我略有耳闻
<46-11,Cofield>So I've heard.

560
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,080
<46-11,Cofield>但并不是说你不会生气
<46-11,Cofield>That doesn't mean you couldn't get angry.

561
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,250
<46-11,Cofield>你之后的行为可能就是因为这事儿
<46-11,Cofield>Might actually contribute to that reaction.

562
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,400
<46-12,Chase>我能问问这有什么关系吗
<46-12,Chase>May I ask why that matters?

563
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,610
<46-12,Chase>你是要证明我分心了
<46-12,Chase>Are you trying to prove that I was distracted,

564
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,150
<46-12,Chase>我的判断出现了偏差是吗
<46-12,Chase>that my judgment was compromised?

565
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,090
<46-13,Cofield>奇斯医生  你认为谁该
<46-13,Cofield>Who do you think was at fault

566
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,490
<46-13,Cofield>为你的遭遇负责呢
<46-13,Cofield>for what happened to you, Dr. Chase?

567
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,940
<46-14,Chase>同样  这有什么关系吗
<46-14,Chase>Again, why does it matter?

568
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,170
<46-15,Cofield>你是个聪明人
<46-15,Cofield>You're a smart doctor.

569
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,340
<46-15,Cofield>你对这儿发生的事比谁都清楚
<46-15,Cofield>You know what happened here better than anyone,

570
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,780
<46-15,Cofield>而且你和豪斯医生共事的时间
<46-15,Cofield>and you've worked with Dr. House

571
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,910
<46-15,Cofield>比谁都长
<46-15,Cofield>longer than anyone.

572
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,710
<46-15,Cofield>我觉得自从受伤开始
<46-15,Cofield>And I suspect that you've spent every minute

573
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,290
<46-15,Cofield>你也一直在琢磨
<46-15,Cofield>since this has happened

574
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,450
<46-15,Cofield>谁该为此负责这个问题
<46-15,Cofield>trying to answer that very question.

575
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,100
<46-15,Cofield>我觉得谁都没错
<46-15,Cofield>I don't think it was anyone's fault.

576
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,100
<46-16,Chase>当时我很生气
<46-16,Chase>I was angry,

577
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,840
<46-16,Chase>但是我并没有分心
<46-16,Chase>but I wasn't distracted.

578
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,860
<46-16,Chase>我认为  如果我还有机会
<46-16,Chase>And I think that, if there's any chance

579
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,330
<46-16,Chase>站立行走的话
<46-16,Chase>I'm gonna walk again,

580
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,460
<46-16,Chase>也是因为豪斯医生天才般的医术
<46-16,Chase>it's because Dr. House is a genius.

581
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,720
<47-1,House>能感觉到热吗
<47-1,House>How about warmth?

582
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
<47-1,House>能感觉盖着的床单吗
<47-1,House>Can you feel the sheets on your skin?

583
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,570
<47-2,Chase>都说了什么都感觉不到
<47-2,Chase>I just said I don't feel anything.

584
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,530
<47-2,Chase>豪斯  你要客观啊
<47-2,Chase>Objectivity, House.

585
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,040
<47-2,Chase>会是创伤后脊髓空洞症吗
<47-2,Chase>What about posttraumatic syringomyelia?

586
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,670
<47-2,Chase>蛛网膜下腔形成的脊髓空洞
<47-2,Chase>Syrinx formed in the subarachnoid space,

587
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,510
<47-2,Chase>阻碍脑脊液的流动
<47-2,Chase>blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.

588
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,320
<47-3,Adams>这意味着这是永久性损伤
<47-3,Adams>That'd mean the damage was permanent.

589
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,890
<47-3,Adams>不对
<47-3,Adams>No.

590
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,870
<47-4,House>别考虑神经了
<47-4,House>Forget the nerves.

591
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,320
<47-5,Taub>豪斯  如果这是完全瘫痪的话
<47-5,Taub>House, if it's total paralysis,

592
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,290
<47-5,Taub>-他一定是  -不一定
<47-5,Taub>- he must have  - Not necessarily.

593
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,640
<47-6,House>考虑一下动脉
<47-6,House>Think arteries.

594
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,950
<47-6,House>脊柱的血液供应被切断了
<47-6,House>Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off.

595
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,510
<47-6,House>是根动脉的血栓
<47-6,House>It's a clot in the radicular artery.

596
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,020
<47-7,Chase>是可以治疗的
<47-7,Chase>That could be fixable.

597
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,540
<47-8,House>准备栓子切除术
<47-8,House>Prep a room for an embolectomy.

598
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,030
<47-8,House>在造成更大伤害前
<47-8,House>Let's get that thing out of there

599
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,140
<47-8,House>把血栓取出来
<47-8,House>before it does any more damage.

600
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,560
<47-9,Chase>如果不是血栓呢
<47-9,Chase>And if it's not a clot?

601
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,000
<47-10,House>那你去问福曼医院的保险是否
<47-10,House>Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance

602
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,740
<47-10,House>能报销残疾人专用车
<47-10,House>covers ramp-vans.

603
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,620
<48-1,Park>已经穿过主动脉

<48-3,Adams>Sensory level is at L5.

606
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,110
<48-3,Adams>这一定是下降段
<48-3,Adams>It must be the descending branch.

607
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,950
<48-4,Chase>能让我看监视器吗
<48-4,Chase>Can I see the monitor?

608
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,860
<48-5,Park>停住
<48-5,Park>Stop there.

00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,390
<48-7,Taub>我们还没取出来呢
<48-7,Taub>We still got to get it out.

612
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,710
<48-7,Taub>还是有可能造成永久性损伤
<48-7,Taub>Still could have done permanent damage.

613
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,980
<48-8,House>病人没有患植物神经功能失调
<48-8,House>Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation.

614
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,130
<48-8,House>他的尿液袋中有血迹
<48-8,House>There's blood in his urine bag.

615
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,950
<48-8,House>肾脏在衰竭

<48-9,Adams>-豪斯  现在没空  -就得现在
<48-9,Adams>- House, not now. - Got to be now.

617
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,200
<48-10,House>一旦普林斯顿综合医院有床位福曼就要把
<48-10,House>Foreman is transferring our guy to Princeton General

618
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,520
<48-10,House>病人转到那里去
<48-10,House>as soon as there's a bed available.

619
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,930
<48-10,House>他号称自打出了刺伤事件这边的医生
<48-10,House>Says the doctors here can no longer be objective

620
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,380
<48-10,House>无法客观行医了
<48-10,House>since the stabbing.

621
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,460
<48-10,House>就在这样一个
<48-10,House>In the middle of a procedure

622
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,660
<49-1,Cofield>事关你性命的手术中
<49-1,Cofield>that could basically save your life,

623
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,900
<49-1,Cofield>豪斯还想来拉人
<49-1,Cofield>House is actually trying to drag people away?

624
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,680
<49-1,Cofield>你怎么会和这种人共事
<49-1,Cofield>How do you work with a guy like that?

625
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,330
<49-2,Chase>他没有想拉人的意思
<49-2,Chase>He wasn't trying to pull anybody away.

626
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,610
<49-2,Chase>他们已经拒绝参与那个病例了
<49-2,Chase>Everyone had already refused to work on that case.

627
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,380
<49-2,Chase>他心知肚明
<49-2,Chase>He knew the answer.

628
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,180
<49-2,Chase>他是想来看看我
<49-2,Chase>He wanted to check on me.

629
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,910
<49-2,Chase>但他要找个借口
<49-2,Chase>But he needed an excuse.

630
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,780
<49-2,Chase>否则别人会说他关心我
<49-2,Chase>Otherwise, he could be accused of caring.

631
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,450
<49-3,Cofield>这么说你的证词是
<49-3,Cofield>So your testimony is that

632
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,090
<49-3,Cofield>正是豪斯医生的这种完全漠视的态度
<49-3,Cofield>Dr. House's complete lack of concern

633
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,320
<49-3,Cofield>体现出他深沉的关心
<49-3,Cofield>is evidence of his deep concern?

634
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,190
<49-3,Cofield>刚才是你动了下吗
<49-3,Cofield>Did you just do that?

635
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,270
<49-4,Chase>什么
<49-4,Chase>What?

636
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,530
<49-5,Cofield>你动下脚趾
<49-5,Cofield>Wiggle your toes.

637
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,270
<49-6,Cofield>你感觉到了吗
<49-6,Cofield>Do you feel that?

638
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,650
<49-6,Cofield>恭喜你
<49-6,Cofield>Congratulations.

639
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,550
<49-6,Cofield>确实是血栓引起的
<49-6,Cofield>It was the clot.

640
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
<49-6,Cofield>造成短时间动脉闭塞
<49-6,Cofield>Short occlusion time of the artery,

641
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,000
<49-6,Cofield>等肿胀消退后  你应该...
<49-6,Cofield>when the swelling goes down, you should...

642
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,360
<49-6,Cofield>至少能恢复一部分腿部功能
<49-6,Cofield>gain back at least some of the function.

643
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,730
<49-6,Cofield>对不起  还有件事
<49-6,Cofield>One more thing. Sorry.

644
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,000
<49-6,Cofield>你知道把手术刀
<49-6,Cofield>You knew that your patient was at risk

645
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,700
<49-6,Cofield>放在病人可触及的地方
<49-6,Cofield>for a psychotic break

646
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,530
<49-6,Cofield>他会有精神崩溃的危险
<49-6,Cofield>when you brought a scalpel within his reach.

647
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,360
<49-6,Cofield>为什么无视这个风险
<49-6,Cofield>Why did you ignore that risk?

648
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,910
<49-7,Chase>我觉得就皮疹的想法我是对的
<49-7,Chase>I thought I was right about the rash.

649
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,480
<49-7,Chase>若回到当时  我还会那么做
<49-7,Chase>I would do it again.

650
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,520
<49-8,Cofield>同感
<49-8,Cofield>I thought so.

651
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,560
<49-9,Chase>就这么一句"同感"吗
<49-9,Chase>What, that's it? "I thought so"?

652
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,860
<49-9,Chase>你到底什么意思
<49-9,Chase>What the hell does that mean?

653
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,600
<49-10,Cofield>你肆无忌惮的公然藐视你的上司
<49-10,Cofield>You brazenly defied your boss.

654
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,870
<49-10,Cofield>现在的问题是
<49-10,Cofield>Now that happened

655
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,590
<49-10,Cofield>要么是豪斯医生自认为那没有关系
<49-10,Cofield>either because Dr. House has established that that's okay in his world,

656
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,010
<49-10,Cofield>要么是他的恶作剧让你分心了
<49-10,Cofield>or his prank war distracted you,

657
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,070
<49-10,Cofield>亦或是豪斯把用药当做游戏
<49-10,Cofield>or House makes medicine a game,

658
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,840
<49-10,Cofield>而你只是想打败他
<49-10,Cofield>and you just wanted to beat him.

659
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,310
<49-10,Cofield>不管怎样
<49-10,Cofield>Whatever the reason,

660
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,360
<49-10,Cofield>你都可能再也无法行走
<49-10,Cofield>it boils down to the fact that you may never walk again

661
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,570
<49-10,Cofield>全是因为豪斯营造了让你们鲁莽行事的氛围
<49-10,Cofield>because House created an atmosphere that promotes recklessness.

662
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:36,230
<50-1,Cofield>这是最后一轮讯问
<50-1,Cofield>This will be our last round of questions.

663
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,800
<50-1,Cofield>我已经和奇斯医生谈过了
<50-1,Cofield>I've spoken with Dr. Chase.

664
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,930
<50-1,Cofield>知道吧  他已经能动了
<50-1,Cofield>You know he regained movement.

665
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,920
<50-2,House>不知道
<50-2,House>No.

666
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,620
<50-3,Cofield>对于奇斯医生受伤的事
<50-3,Cofield>Are you really this indifferent

667
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,510
<50-3,Cofield>你真的无动于衷吗
<50-3,Cofield>to the fact that Dr. Chase is hurt?

668
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,160
<50-4,House>你停止录音是因为谈话与案件无关
<50-4,House>We're going off the record because this is irrelevant,

669
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,640
<50-4,House>还是你想打我呢
<50-4,House>or are you gonna hit me?

670
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,010
<50-5,Cofield>你为什么不去道歉
<50-5,Cofield>Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry--

671
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,280
<50-6,House>我没有错
<50-6,House>I didn't do anything wrong.

672
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,410
<50-7,Cofield>这不是认罪
<50-7,Cofield>It's not an admission of guilt.

673
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,450
<50-7,Cofield>他是你的朋友  而且情况很不好
<50-7,Cofield>He's your friend, and he's not well.

674
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,750
<50-8,House>他只是我的同事
<50-8,House>He's a coworker.

675
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,420
<50-9,Cofield>是一个你认识了十年
<50-9,Cofield>Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years

676
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,670
<50-9,Cofield>差点见了阎王
<50-9,Cofield>who nearly died

677
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,840
<50-9,Cofield>至今仍在担心是否能再次走路的同事
<50-9,Cofield>and who's still scared he may not walk.

678
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,280
<50-10,House>你会因为我态度恶劣解雇我吗
<50-10,House>Are you going to have me fired for bad manners?

679
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,080
<50-11,Cofield>只是试图了解你
<50-11,Cofield>Just trying to understand you.

680
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,350
<50-11,Cofield>为什么像你这样身在要位
<50-11,Cofield>Why a man in your position,

681
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,350
<50-11,Cofield>才华横溢
<50-11,Cofield>with your abilities,

682
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,940
<50-11,Cofield>却总是做混蛋事呢
<50-11,Cofield>is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.

683
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,390
<50-12,House>能不能恢复录音走完这个过场啊
<50-12,House>Could we go back on the record and get this over with?

684
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,280
<50-13,Cofield>把维柯丁收起来  豪斯医生
<50-13,Cofield>Put the Vicodin away, Dr. House.

685
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,450
<50-14,House>我腿疼
<50-14,House>My leg hurts.

686
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,040
<50-15,Cofield>有意思吗
<50-15,Cofield>Is that supposed to be funny?

687
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,270
<50-16,House>两起爆炸
<50-16,House>Two explosions.

688
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,030
<50-17,Cofield>还没结束呢
<50-17,Cofield>We're not done here.

689
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,590
<51-1,House>等等
<51-1,House>Hey, hold on.

690
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,560
<51-2,EMT 1>关门
<51-2,EMT 1>Close it up.

691
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,410
<51-3,House>把他抬出来
<51-3,House>Take him out of there.

692
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,330
<51-4,EMT 1>福曼医生知道你会这样
<51-4,EMT 1>Dr. Foreman said you'd try this.

693
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,930
<51-4,EMT 1>所以让我转告你这已经不是你的病人了
<51-4,EMT 1>Said to tell you he's no longer your patient.

694

698
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,560
<51-9,House>你丈夫的淋巴有肿瘤
<51-9,House>Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.

699
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,740
<51-10,Emily>你之前的诊断都是错的
<51-10,Emily>You've been wrong every time.

700
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,170
<51-11,House>好吧  这次肯定错不了
<51-11,House>Yeah, well, not this time.

701
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,690
<51-11,House>教室里的爆炸
<51-11,House>The explosion in the classroom

702
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,690
<51-11,House>导致癌细胞扩散
<51-11,House>caused the cancer cells to break open.

703
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,340
<51-11,House>也就是肿瘤溶解综合症
<51-11,House>It's called tumor lysis syndrome.

704
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,030
<51-11,House>他体内的电解质失调
<51-11,House>His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates,

705

<51-12,Emily>What about the psychotic break?

710
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,970
<51-13,House>是我们的原因
<51-13,House>Turns out we caused that.

711
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,510
<51-13,House>他还能治
<51-13,House>This is treatable. Okay?

<51-13,House>告诉新医生
<51-13,House>You have to tell the new doctors

713

00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,710
<52-3,House>好吧  我又回来了  继续做声明
<52-3,House>Well, I'm walking back. I'm not done testifying.

718
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,020
<52-4,Foreman>显然已经结束了
<52-4,Foreman>Apparently you were.

719
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,880
<52-4,Foreman>他说明天做决定
<52-4,Foreman>Said he'd have his decision tomorrow.

720
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,520
<52-4,Foreman>这次案子很棘手
<52-4,Foreman>This case is a fiasco.

721
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,290
<52-4,Foreman>我一夜未眠
<52-4,Foreman>Didn't sleep last night.

722
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,040
<53-1,Cofield>显然  豪斯医生才华横溢
<53-1,Cofield>Dr. House is obviously brilliant...

723
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,410
<53-2,House>众所周知
<53-2,House>Well, I think we've heard enough.

724
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
<53-1,Cofield>但是豪斯医生也很棘手
<53-1,Cofield>But Dr. House is also a fiasco.

725
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,660
<53-3,Cofield>如果我让他免责
<53-3,Cofield>If I were to exonerate him,

726
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,470
<53-3,Cofield>宽恕他的幼稚鲁莽
<53-3,Cofield>condone his completely reckless, immature,

727
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,950
<53-3,Cofield>甚至于厌世的习惯
<53-3,Cofield>almost misanthropic behavior,

728
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,020
<53-3,Cofield>那就意味着
<53-3,Cofield>I would essentially be sending a message

729
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,060
<53-3,Cofield>告诉医院里的所有医生
<53-3,Cofield>to all the other doctors in this hospital

730
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,890
<53-3,Cofield>他的这种行为是被允许的
<53-3,Cofield>that it's okay to act that way and--

731
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,460
<53-4,Emily>抱歉
<53-4,Emily>Sorry.

732
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,680
<53-5,Cofield>我们还没说完
<53-5,Cofield>We're in the middle of something.

733
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
<53-5,Cofield>我知道
<53-5,Cofield>I know.

734
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,090
<53-6,Emily>我是来找豪斯医生的
<53-6,Emily>I came to speak with Dr. House.

735
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,680
<53-6,Emily>他们告诉我他在这里
<53-6,Emily>And when they told me he was in here,

736
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,050
<53-6,Emily>我觉得有责任告诉大家
<53-6,Emily>I thought I should say something.

737
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,040
<53-6,Emily>我是说
<53-6,Emily>I mean...

738
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,390
<53-6,Emily>他并不是我所见过的医生中人最好的
<53-6,Emily>He wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.

739
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,550
<53-7,House>这也是众所周知的
<53-7,House>Well, I think we've heard enough.

740
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,790
<53-8,Emily>但他是对的
<53-8,Emily>But he was right.

741
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,410
<53-8,Emily>他们发现肿瘤了
<53-8,Emily>They found the tumor.

742
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,160
<53-8,Emily>他们在进行血浆置换术清除肿瘤细胞
<53-8,Emily>They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.

743
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,040
<53-8,Emily>据说应该能痊愈
<53-8,Emily>They expect a full recovery.

744
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,520
<53-8,Emily>他救了我丈夫的命
<53-8,Emily>He saved my husband's life.

745
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,370
<53-8,Emily>说完了
<53-8,Emily>I guess that's it.

746
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,660
<53-8,Emily>再次感谢
<53-8,Emily>Thanks again.

747
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,590
<53-9,Cofield>正如我所说
<53-9,Cofield>As I was saying,

748
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,880
<53-9,Cofield>豪斯医生的治疗过程是危险不当的
<53-9,Cofield>Dr. House's process is dangerous, inappropriate.

749
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,280
<53-9,Cofield>但是结果是有效的
<53-9,Cofield>But he is effective.

750
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,590
<53-9,Cofield>我认为若改变那个治疗过程
<53-9,Cofield>I've decided that I would be doing this hospital

751
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:39,730
<53-9,Cofield>无疑将会对医院带来损失
<53-9,Cofield>a disservice if I did anything to change that process.

752
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,320
<53-9,Cofield>恭喜你  豪斯医生
<53-9,Cofield>Congratulations, Dr. House.

753
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,850
<53-9,Cofield>无人需对此次事件负责
<53-9,Cofield>This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.

754
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,380
<53-10,House>懦夫
<53-10,House>Coward.

755
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,620
<53-11,Cofield>什么
<53-11,Cofield>Excuse me?

756
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,770
<53-12,House>你记了20页纸的笔记
<53-12,House>You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there.

757
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,760
<53-12,House>你至少得折腾我们半小时吧
<53-12,House>You were expecting to bore us for at least half an hour.

758
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,020
<53-12,House>这是我的假释表
<53-12,House>You got my parole form in here.

759
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,910
<53-12,House>你本来打算送我回监狱
<53-12,House>You were gonna send me back to prison.

760
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,840
<53-13,Foreman>豪斯  别说了
<53-13,Foreman>House, stop.

761
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,760
<53-13,Foreman>好事常有
<53-13,Foreman>Good things usually happen;

762
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,850
<53-14,House>坏事不常有
<53-14,House>bad things sometimes happen.

763
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,310
<53-14,House>那个差点做了寡妇的女人
<53-14,House>The fact that that would-be widow

764
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,450
<53-14,House>及时进来感化了你那软弱感伤的心
<53-14,House>came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart

765
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,190
<53-14,House>而且他的丈夫也被救活了
<53-14,House>and the fact that her husband's gonna live

766
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,290
<53-14,House>这都与我是否做错无关
<53-14,House>does not change whether or not I did the right thing.

767
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,280
<54-1,House>你是怎么瞒过我
<54-1,House>How'd you get the firing wire

768
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,650
<54-1,House>把火线装进维柯丁的瓶子里的
<54-1,House>into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?

769
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,170
<54-2,Chase>我有理由这么做吗
<54-2,Chase>Why'd I even have to?

770
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,030
<54-2,Chase>橙色的头发是怎么回事
<54-2,Chase>What was the point of the orange hair?

771
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,740
<54-3,House>你头发的味道和亚当斯一样
<54-3,House>Your hair smelled like Adams.

772
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,790
<54-3,House>但你不可能瞒过我和她在一起
<54-3,House>And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing,

773
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,790
<54-3,House>那就是你只是用了她的洗发水
<54-3,House>it means you were just doing her shampoo.

774
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,750
<54-3,House>说明你是和某个新认识的女孩出去喝酒到天明
<54-3,House>Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl

775
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,910
<54-3,House>或者压根没新女孩
<54-3,House>or because there is no new girl.

776
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,520
<54-3,House>你为了省时在医院洗澡
<54-3,House>You were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital

777
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,970
<54-3,House>因为你懒得买洗发水
<54-3,House>because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.

778
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,520
<54-3,House>所以我找到个方式通知你别迟到
<54-3,House>So I found a way to let you know to not be late.

779
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,480
<54-4,Chase>为什么不直接告诉我
<54-4,Chase>You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?

780
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,240
<54-5,House>那有什么意思
<54-5,House>What fun would that be?

781
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,870
<54-6,Chase>这不好玩
<54-6,Chase>None of this is fun, House.

782
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,810
<54-7,House>他们认为你被刺
<54-7,House>They decided that your being stabbed...

783
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,670
<54-7,House>无人需要负责
<54-7,House>Was nobody's fault.

784
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,470
<54-7,House>他们错了
<54-7,House>They're wrong.

785
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,440
<54-7,House>抱歉
<54-7,House>I'm sorry.

786
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,140
<54-8,Chase>还有事吗
<54-8,Chase>Anything else?

787
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,450
<54-8,Chase>我很忙
<54-8,Chase>I'm kind of busy.

788
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,110
<54-9,House>没了
<54-9,House>No. That was it.

789
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,740
<54-10,Chase>准备好了
<54-10,Chase>I've got it.
