<10-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>Means...

223
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,130
<10-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>我错了
<10-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>I was wrong.

224
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
<11-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>血凝块如果移动到心肺 会有生命危险
<11-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>If a clot reaches his lungs/or his heart,it'll kill him.

225
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,250
<11-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我没说错
<11-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>It's true.

226
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,920
<11-3,GREG HOUSE>是没错 你在浪费时间
<11-3,GREG HOUSE>We all know it's true.You/just wasted our time.

227
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,280
<11-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>那你又在干吗?
<11-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>And what you're doing?

228
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
<11-5,GREG HOUSE>- 参加竞争的又不是我/- Taub去哪了?
<11-5,GREG HOUSE>- I'm not competing./- Where's taub?

229
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,590
<11-6,GREG HOUSE>Foreman跟着他呢
<11-6,GREG HOUSE>Foreman was following him.

230
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,780
<11-7,LAWRENCE KUTNER>所以你又呼了Taub
<11-7,LAWRENCE KUTNER>So you paged taub.

231
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,620
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>不然我还能怎么办
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>Didn't see that I had much choice.

232
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,720
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>血涂片里有裂红细胞
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>He has schistocytes in his blood smear.

233
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,710
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>说明是DIC(弥散性血管内凝血)导致了血凝块
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>Which means the d.i.c.'s/causing clotting.

234
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,990
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>可又是什么导致了DIC呢?
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>What's causing the d.i.c.?

235
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,050
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>- 毒品污染/- 刚才那回合你已输了
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>- Drug impurities./- You lost your round.

236
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,030
<11-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>新症状新回合 肯定与毒品有关
<11-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>New symptom,new round.This/has to be drug related.

237
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,290
<11-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>医生就是这样害死病人的
<11-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>This is how doctors kill patients.

238
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,840
<11-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>- 总是忽略事实 想当然/- 瘾君子吸毒是想当然?
<11-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>- By seeing the stereotype instead of the truth./- Drug addicts use drugs is a stereotype?

239
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,850
<11-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>毒品有害是想当然?
<11-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>Drugs are bad is a stereotype?

240
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,950
<11-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>- 失败者.../- 疟疾
<11-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>- Losers lose is.../- Malaria.

241
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,350
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>他好几年没出过境了
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>He hasn't left the country in years.

242
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>疟疾会复发
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Malaria's relapsing/recurring.

243
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,850
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>他可能已患病好几年了
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>For all we know he could/have been sick for years.

244
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,330
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>这不仅符合DIC的症状
<11-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>It explains not just the d.i.c.

245
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,220
<11-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>还有出血 疲劳 发烧
<11-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>And the bleeding,but/the tiredness,fever.

246
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,850
<11-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>...所有被我们归结到毒品上的症状
<11-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>Everything we attributed to drugs.

247
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,370
<11-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>是啊 这个搞庞克的家伙/染上疟疾的可能性比吸毒大?
<11-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>Oh,yeah,it's much more likely that this ass/punk rocker was exposed to malaria than drugs?

248
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,880
<11-15,GREG HOUSE>如果你总是对的 那刚刚就不会错了
<11-15,GREG HOUSE>If you were always right,then/you wouldn't have just been wrong.

249
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,090
<11-15,GREG HOUSE>不会让他用尼古丁贴片过毒瘾
<11-15,GREG HOUSE>Or let the patient mainline nicotine.

250
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,530
<11-15,GREG HOUSE>不会糟蹋了眼球模型/那是我高分通过医学考试 外婆给的奖励
<11-15,GREG HOUSE>Or ravaged my anatomical model,which/grandma house bought me when I aced my mcats.

251
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,250
<11-16,LAWRENCE KUTNER>那是周二一个医药代表拿来的
<11-16,LAWRENCE KUTNER>A pharmaceutical rep/left that here on tuesday.

<11-17,GREG HOUSE>我外婆做兼职
<11-17,GREG HOUSE>Grandma does some part-time work.

<11-18,LAWRENCE KUTNER>那个美女才三十来岁
<11-18,LAWRENCE KUTNER>The rep was a 30-something babe.

<11-19,GREG HOUSE>谢谢 我屁股像她
<11-19,GREG HOUSE>Thank you.I got her hips.

<11-19,GREG HOUSE>自豪地获胜
<11-19,GREG HOUSE>Carry it with pride.

256

<11-20,GREG HOUSE>蛇蝎女 进入败部复活
<11-20,GREG HOUSE>Manipulative bitch,you're/wanted in the loser's circle.

<11-21,GREG HOUSE>你为何讨厌瘾君子?
<11-21,GREG HOUSE>Why do you hate drug addicts?

258
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,880
<11-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>你的情况不一样
<11-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>Your situation is different.

259
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,070
<11-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>你按处方用药
<11-22,AMBER VOLAKIS>You're taking a necessary prescription.

260
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,260
<11-23,GREG HOUSE>我知道...我棒极了
<11-23,GREG HOUSE>I know...i'm fabulous.

261
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,200
<11-23,GREG HOUSE>我也不是那个病人
<11-23,GREG HOUSE>And I'm not the patient.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,020
<11-24,AMBER VOLAKIS>我不能对瘾君子有意见吗?
<11-24,AMBER VOLAKIS>I'm not allowed to have/a problem with junkies?

263
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,520
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>可以
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>You're allowed.

264
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,320
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>但总有个原因
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>There's gotta be a reason.

265
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,570
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>他是个病人 和你素不相识
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>He's a patient.You don't know him.

266
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,720
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>而你却厌恶他
<11-25,GREG HOUSE>But you hate him.

267
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,420
<11-26,AMBER VOLAKIS>他在虚度人生
<11-26,AMBER VOLAKIS>He's throwing his life away.

268
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,750
<11-27,GREG HOUSE>因为他有自己的准则?
<11-27,GREG HOUSE>'cause he's setting his own terms?

269
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,700
<11-27,GREG HOUSE>不必整天担心随堂测验?
<11-27,GREG HOUSE>Not living in fear of every pop quiz?

270
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,480
<11-28,AMBER VOLAKIS>我们不是在讨论他吗
<11-28,AMBER VOLAKIS>I thought we were talking about him.

271
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,250
<11-29,GREG HOUSE>和他一点关系也没有
<11-29,GREG HOUSE>We were never talking about him.

272
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,390
<11-29,GREG HOUSE>你为什么害怕失败?
<11-29,GREG HOUSE>Why are you afraid to lose?

273
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,950
<11-30,AMBER VOLAKIS>你想解雇我 就因为我太好胜?
<11-30,AMBER VOLAKIS>Are you gonna fire me/because I like to win?

274
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,100
<11-31,GREG HOUSE>想知道原因而已
<11-31,GREG HOUSE>Just want to know the reason.

275
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,280
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>我看过场足球比赛
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>I watched this football game once.

276
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,030
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>发现了一个奇怪的现象
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>And I noticed something odd.

277
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,600
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>踢赢了的队伍比较快乐
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>The winning team was the happy one.

278
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,700
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>所以选择赢
<11-32,AMBER VOLAKIS>I did the math.

279
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,460
<11-33,GREG HOUSE>这个病人也很快乐
<11-33,GREG HOUSE>Our patient's happy.

280

<11-34,AMBER VOLAKIS>他是个白痴
<11-34,AMBER VOLAKIS>He's an idiot.

281
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,810
<11-35,GREG HOUSE>他是个快乐的白痴
<11-35,GREG HOUSE>He's a happy idiot.

282
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,660
<11-35,GREG HOUSE>他颠覆了你的世界观
<11-35,GREG HOUSE>That screws with your world view.

283
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,950
<11-35,GREG HOUSE>失败可以让人如释重负 不是吗?
<11-35,GREG HOUSE>There's something freeing/about being a loser,isn't there?

284
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,880
<11-36,AMBER VOLAKIS>- 你为什么害怕.../- 因为妈妈不够爱我
<11-36,AMBER VOLAKIS>- Why are you afraid.../- Mommy didn't love me enough.

285
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,010
<11-36,AMBER VOLAKIS>爸爸对我期望太高
<11-36,AMBER VOLAKIS>Daddy expected too much from me.

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,020
<11-36,AMBER VOLAKIS>之类的!
<11-36,AMBER VOLAKIS>Something!

287
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,050
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>即便如此
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>Let's assume that's true.

288
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,090
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>我知道我在你们看来有缺陷
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>I get how that can make/me a screwed-up person.

289
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,380
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>如果我不择手段是为了追求真相/这对病人又有什么坏处?
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>But how is my willingness to do anything/to get the right answer bad for my patients?

290
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,340
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>或者换句你容易理解的话来说
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>Or put in terms you can understand,

291
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,740
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>你觉得这么做有错?
<11-37,AMBER VOLAKIS>how is it bad for you?

<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>我没让你去拿药
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>I didn't ask you to pick up the meds.

<12-1,CHRIS TAUB>我想做个好同事
<12-1,CHRIS TAUB>I'm trying to be a good colleague.

<12-1,CHRIS TAUB>你帮House开药 换取高分
<12-1,CHRIS TAUB>You're trying to boost your score/by prescribing drugs for house.

295
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,450
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>要不怎么会有两个袋子?
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>Why else would you have a second bag?

296
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,800
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>我又没说是要做你的好同事
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>Didn't say good colleague to you.

297
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,010
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>你没忘记手上还有个病人吧
<12-2,CHRIS TAUB>You realize we still have a patient.

<12-3,CHRIS TAUB>才不关心那个病人
<12-3,CHRIS TAUB>Don't care about the patient.

<12-4,CHRIS TAUB>得了 别忽悠我了
<12-4,CHRIS TAUB>Okay,you're jerking me around.

<12-4,CHRIS TAUB>- 作为一个医生 你不可能.../- 我珍惜生命
<12-4,CHRIS TAUB>- There's no reason to be a doctor if you don't.../- I care about life.

303
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,360
<12-5,CHRIS TAUB>可我不在乎他的生命/他自己都不在乎 我干吗要?
<12-5,CHRIS TAUB>I just don't care about his.He/doesn't care.Why should i?

304
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,140
<12-5,CHRIS TAUB>- 我宁可花些时间来.../- 拍老板的马屁
<12-5,CHRIS TAUB>- My time is better spent.../- Kissing up to your boss.

<12-6,CHRIS TAUB>一般医生在一个病人身上只花十八秒/他只有这么多时间
<12-6,CHRIS TAUB>Average doctor cuts off a patient 18 seconds into/a history because that's all the time he's got.

306
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,580
<12-6,CHRIS TAUB>可我们六人却围着个一心求死的人瞎忙活
<12-6,CHRIS TAUB>Meanwhile six of us are ministering/to a guy with a death wish.

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,860
<12-6,CHRIS TAUB>那你干吗做这份工作?
<12-6,CHRIS TAUB>So why do you want the job?

308
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,080
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>总之不是想为人民服务
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>Not because I'm maximizing/my service to mankind.

309
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,340

316

<13-3,GREG HOUSE>He wanted people to listen,but apparently/didn't want people toenjoylistening.

<13-6,JAMES WILSON>是你把它们摆到了桌面上

<13-7,GREG HOUSE>你一向把支票本放在家里
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>You usually keep your checkbook at home.

<13-7,GREG HOUSE>这样就可以找借口不借钱给我
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>It's your go-to excuse for/why you can't lend me money.

325

433
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,380
<20-4,AMBER VOLAKIS>他知道我们在这里
<20-4,AMBER VOLAKIS>He knows where we are.

434
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,180
<20-5,GREG HOUSE>因为他跟着你!

<20-6,ERIC FOREMAN>He had a bleeding problem.

437
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,450
<20-7,CHRIS TAUB>可能引起呼吸停止
<20-7,CHRIS TAUB>That could cause respiratory arrest.

438
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,100
<20-8,GREG HOUSE>我不原谅他的自残行为/你刚才的话 我当没听见
<20-8,GREG HOUSE>If I wanted to forgive his drano-drinking/ways,I wouldn't ignore what you just said.

439
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,150
<20-9,CHRIS TAUB>可能是神经系统感染
<20-9,CHRIS TAUB>Could be an infection.

440
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,070
<20-10,GREG HOUSE>不会 腰椎穿刺没问题
<20-10,GREG HOUSE>No,the lumbar puncture's clear.

441
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,330
<20-11,CHRIS TAUB>什么腰椎穿刺?
<20-11,CHRIS TAUB>Uh,what lumbar puncture?

442
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,780
<20-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>你没批准那个检查
<20-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>You didn't authorize that test.

<20-13,GREG HOUSE>没错 不过 我现在有检查结果
<20-13,GREG HOUSE>True,and yet,here I am with the results.

444
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,800
<20-14,LAWRENCE KUTNER>13以为是细菌性脑膜炎
<20-14,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Thirteen thought it was/bacterial meningitis.

446
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,840
<20-15,ERIC FOREMAN>无害检查
<20-15,ERIC FOREMAN>It was a harmless test.

447
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,170
<20-15,ERIC FOREMAN>病人安危还是值得关注的 不是吗?
<20-15,ERIC FOREMAN>The patient's welfare still/counts for something,doesn't it?

448
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,460
<20-16,GREG HOUSE>扣50分
<20-16,GREG HOUSE>Minus 50.

449
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,540
<20-17,LAWRENCE KUTNER>慢性肺栓塞能解释呼吸的问题/咳血是来自肺部的
<20-17,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Chronic pulmonary embolism would explain the/breathing problem and the blood coming from his lungs.

450
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,350
<20-19,AMBER VOLAKIS>- 我会做.../- 不用进行任何测试
<20-19,AMBER VOLAKIS>- I'll run an.../- You're not running any tests.

451

<20-19,AMBER VOLAKIS>He knows it's not p.e.s.The/guy's d-dimer's normal.

452
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,070
<20-21,AMBER VOLAKIS>- 那不排除.../- 被授权做一项检查 她却做了8项
<20-21,AMBER VOLAKIS>- That doesn't always rule out.../- Go in to run one test,run eight more like she did,find out which one's right.

453
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,570
<20-21,AMBER VOLAKIS>查出正确的 回来给出聪明的猜测
<20-21,AMBER VOLAKIS>Then comes back with a brilliant guess.

<20-22,GREG HOUSE>- 真是这样?/- 不
<20-22,GREG HOUSE>- Is this true?/- no.

455
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,520
<20-24,GREG HOUSE>太糟糕了 你本可以因聪明加40分
<20-24,GREG HOUSE>Too bad,'cause that would have/earned you 40 points for cleverness.

456
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,670
<20-24,GREG HOUSE>分数给Amber
<20-24,GREG HOUSE>The points go to amber.

<20-26,GREG HOUSE>- 他不会做检查 对吗?/- 他不会
<20-26,GREG HOUSE>- He's not gonna run the tests,is he?/- I don't think so.

460
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,620
<21-1,JIMMY QUIDD>我出什么问题了?
<21-1,JIMMY QUIDD>So what's wrong with me?

461
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,450
<21-2,GREG HOUSE>你是问除了你的音乐 还有那些毛病?
<21-2,GREG HOUSE>You mean besides your music?

462
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,800
<21-3,JIMMY QUIDD>当然 我演奏的不是你喜欢的/就不叫音乐了
<21-3,JIMMY QUIDD>Oh,well,sure,'cause I don't play your/kind of music,it's not music,right?

463

<21-5,JIMMY QUIDD>我不是...为听众演奏 明白吗?
<21-5,JIMMY QUIDD>Look,I don't... I don't/play for an audience,okay?

465
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,220
<21-6,GREG HOUSE>那你站在台上演出/真是个奇怪的选择
<21-6,GREG HOUSE>Well,then,that stage you/stand on is an odd choice.

466
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,860
<21-7,JIMMY QUIDD>我只是...为自己 懂吗?
<21-7,JIMMY QUIDD>I just... I do it for me,okay?

467
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,290
<21-7,JIMMY QUIDD>不是为你
<21-7,JIMMY QUIDD>I don't do it for you.

468
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,180
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>人这辈子有三种选择
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>You have three choices in this life.

<21-8,GREG HOUSE>做个好人 争取 或者放弃
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>Be good,get good,or give up.

470
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,330
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>你选了第四种
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>You've gone for column "d."

471
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,070
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>为什么?
<21-8,GREG HOUSE>Why?

472
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,440
<21-9,GREG HOUSE>简单的答案 是如果不曾努力/就不会失败
<21-9,GREG HOUSE>Simple answer is if you/don't try,you can't fail.

473
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,320
<21-9,GREG HOUSE>你真的这么简单?
<21-9,GREG HOUSE>Are you really that simple?

474
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,100
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>有些人...喜欢我的音乐
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>Look,you know,some people...

475
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,970
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>可绝大多数人受不了
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>they like my music.most/people can't stand it.

476
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,300
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>他们只是耸耸肩 无视我
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>but they just sort of/just shrug and ignore me.

477
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,630
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>但其中有个别人非得来告诉我
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>but a few,the feel like/they have to tell me

478
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,420
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>我搞糟了
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>what I'm screwing up.

479
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,560
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>荒废了年岁
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>you know,what I'm wasting.

480
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,730
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>他们为什么在意?
<21-10,JIMMY QUIDD>why do they care?

481
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,130
<21-11,GREG HOUSE>你心脏附近有特殊的肿块
<21-11,GREG HOUSE>you have some peculiar/masses near your heart.

482
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,030
<21-12,JIMMY QUIDD>多特殊?
<21-12,JIMMY QUIDD>peculiar how?

483
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,180
<21-13,GREG HOUSE>不像你的音乐/它们会引起情感反应
<21-13,GREG HOUSE>well,unlike your music,they/elicit some emotional response.

484
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,760
<21-14,GREG HOUSE>真怪
<21-14,GREG HOUSE>that's odd.

485
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,730
<21-15,JIMMY QUIDD>什么?
<21-15,JIMMY QUIDD>what?

486
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,020
<21-16,GREG HOUSE>你在意我喜不喜欢你的音乐/却不在意自己的生死
<21-16,GREG HOUSE>you care if I appreciate your music,but/you don't care if you live or die.

487
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,770
<21-17,GREG HOUSE>也许答案就这么简单
<21-17,GREG HOUSE>maybe the answeris that simple.

488
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,000
<22-1,JAMES WILSON>我怎么道歉都不够
<22-1,JAMES WILSON>I can't apologize enough.

489
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,320
<22-1,JAMES WILSON>对你 对你的家人
<22-1,JAMES WILSON>to you,to your family.

490
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,590
<22-1,JAMES WILSON>也许没什么技术上的责任 但...
<22-1,JAMES WILSON>there may not be any/technical liability here,but...

491
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,890
<22-2,JAMES WILSON>你把支票撕了 觉得不该要我的钱?
<22-2,JAMES WILSON>you're ripping it up because you think/it would be wrong to take money from me?

492
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,890
<22-2,JAMES WILSON>不该只要这点钱
<22-2,JAMES WILSON>I think it would be wrong to take/so little money from you.

493
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,590
<22-3,JAMES WILSON>- 你损失了6000块.../- 你毁了我的生活
<22-3,JAMES WILSON>- you're out 6,000.../- you ruined my life.

<22-4,JAMES WILSON>这是我第一次 活在当下
<22-4,JAMES WILSON>for the first time in my life,I/was living in the present.

496
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,860
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>因为只剩下三个月时间
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>'cause that's all there was.

497
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:41,060
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>你告我 不是为了错误的诊断/是为了正确的诊断?
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>you're suing me not for the wrong/diagnosis,but for the right one?

498
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,130
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>你和律师谈过了吗?
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>have you spoken to a lawyer?

499
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,570
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>你给我幸福感觉...
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>you gave me happiness...

500
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,610
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>现在又将幸福带走
<22-5,JAMES WILSON>and then you took it away.

501
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,130
<23-1,CHRIS TAUB>肯定不是栓塞
<23-1,CHRIS TAUB>definitely no emboli.

502
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,200
<23-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>相当模糊
<23-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>it's pretty fuzzy.

503
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,880
<23-3,GREG HOUSE>对于拍照 我觉得我干得不错
<23-3,GREG HOUSE>hey,for point and shoot/I thought I did okay.

504
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,070
<23-4,CHRIS TAUB>影像模糊 因为他一直在抖/吸毒的后遗症
<23-4,CHRIS TAUB>it's fuzzy because he was still shaking/'cause he was coming down from the heroin.

505
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,860
<23-4,CHRIS TAUB>其他人呢?
<23-4,CHRIS TAUB>where is everybody else?

506
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,870
<23-5,GREG HOUSE>诊所被隔离了
<23-5,GREG HOUSE>the clinic's been quarantined.

507
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,530
<23-5,GREG HOUSE>进来个病人 有类似禽流感症状
<23-5,GREG HOUSE>a patient came in with/avian flu-like symptoms.

508
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,790
<23-5,GREG HOUSE>又多50块可花
<23-5,GREG HOUSE>and 50 extra dollars in spending money.

509
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,610
<23-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>能再做一次影像检查么?
<23-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>can you do this echo again?

510
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,520
<23-7,GREG HOUSE>好了 不知感激 扣5分!
<23-7,GREG HOUSE>okay,minus five for ingratitude!

511
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,900
<23-7,GREG HOUSE>没说 "谢谢你 House医生"
<23-7,GREG HOUSE>no "thank you,Dr. House."

512
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,330
<23-7,GREG HOUSE>没说 "给你一瓶可待因减轻痛苦"/一句都没有
<23-7,GREG HOUSE>no "here's a bottle of codeine for/your troubles,Dr. House." oh,no.

513
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,310
<23-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我是问 能不能给他点镇静剂/让他不动 然后再检查一遍
<23-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I was asking if you could do it again after/giving him a sedative to keep him still.

514
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,490
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>可以
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>I could.

515
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,890
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>这样绝对能看出问题
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>we'd definitely get the answer.

516
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,330
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>但镇静剂会减弱他的呼吸驱动
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>but since the opiates would/decrease his respiratory drive,

517
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,700
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>他已经呼吸困难了/要我害死病人 扣10分
<23-9,GREG HOUSE>and he already can barely breathe,minus/ten for asking me to kill the patient.

518
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,940
<23-10,CHRIS TAUB>会不会是先天性缺陷?
<23-10,CHRIS TAUB>what if it's a congenital defect?

519
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,900
<23-10,CHRIS TAUB>心脏上的血管异常?
<23-10,CHRIS TAUB>an anomalous vessel on his heart?

520
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,520
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>你还记得 心脏负责供血
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>you know that the heart/does the blood stuff,right?

521
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,300
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>肺才负责呼吸  是吧?
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>and the lungs do the breathing.

522
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,680
<23-12,CHRIS TAUB>如果血管缠绕住气管呢?
<23-12,CHRIS TAUB>if the vessel wrapped/around his trachea?

523
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,040
<23-13,GREG HOUSE>- 你要我做什么?/- 核磁共振血管成像
<23-13,GREG HOUSE>- what do you want me to do?/- mra.

524
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,700
<23-14,CHRIS TAUB>看能不能得到血管的清晰图像
<23-14,CHRIS TAUB>see if you can get a clear/picture of that vessel.

525
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,720
<23-15,CHRIS TAUB>什么... 等等 为什么?
<23-15,CHRIS TAUB>what... wait... what... what... why?

526
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,860
<23-16,GREG HOUSE>你说过影像不清晰 因为病人在抖
<23-16,GREG HOUSE>you said the picture sucked/because the patient was shaking.

527
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,200
<23-16,GREG HOUSE>核磁共振血管成像会更糟
<23-16,GREG HOUSE>mra will be worse.

528
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,080
<23-17,CHRIS TAUB>我们必须得到血管影像
<23-17,CHRIS TAUB>we have to get a picture.

529
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,970
<23-18,GREG HOUSE>你的好点子 还不如不说
<23-18,GREG HOUSE>you were doing better/before you had a good idea.

530
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,760
<23-19,CHRIS TAUB>没有影像 我们还能怎么看到?
<23-19,CHRIS TAUB>how can we see it if/we don't take a picture?

531
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,120
<23-20,GREG HOUSE>就像你能看见我吧?
<23-20,GREG HOUSE>you can see me,right?

532
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,450
<24-1,GREG HOUSE>我们想看他的心脏
<24-1,GREG HOUSE>we want to look at his heart.

533
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,340
<24-1,GREG HOUSE>用眼看
<24-1,GREG HOUSE>with our eyes.

534
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,820
<24-2,ROBERT CHASE>那是说 我在手术台上害死病人
<24-2,ROBERT CHASE>so I kill the patient/on my operating table.

535
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,850
<24-2,ROBERT CHASE>你继续测试你的队员/我面对Cuddy的暴怒
<24-2,ROBERT CHASE>you get to keep testing your team/and I take the heat from cuddy.

536
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,780
<24-3,GREG HOUSE>如果病人真死了 没错 那会很棒
<24-3,GREG HOUSE>if it goes that/way,yeah,that'll be excellent.

537
