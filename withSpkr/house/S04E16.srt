<3-13,JAMES WILSON>If you restart it, it'll keep racing, shoot/off free radicals, and kill her brain.

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,270
<3-13,JAMES WILSON>我们冷冻她并进行旁路循环/直至你对她确诊为止
<3-13,JAMES WILSON>We ice her down,put her on/bypass until you've diagnosed her.

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,630
<3-14,GREG HOUSE>这不是解决问题的办法
<3-14,GREG HOUSE>This is not a solution.

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,090
<3-14,GREG HOUSE>你所做的一切只是为了拖延
<3-14,GREG HOUSE>All you're doing is pressing pause.

52

<3-15,JAMES WILSON>这可以给你更多时间找出病因
<3-15,JAMES WILSON>It gives you more/time to find a diagnosis.

53
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,540
<3-15,JAMES WILSON>House 这是Amber

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,180
<4-4,ERIC FOREMAN>我们为什么要这样做?
<4-4,ERIC FOREMAN>Why are we doing this?

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,390
<4-5,GREG HOUSE>争取时间思考
<4-5,GREG HOUSE>Bought us time to think.

65
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,990
<4-5,GREG HOUSE>一定是外伤引发了某个之前存在的心脏问题
<4-5,GREG HOUSE>The trauma must have stimulated/a pre-existing heart condition.

66

68
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,510
<5-3,GREG HOUSE>太好了 让我们探个究竟
<5-3,GREG HOUSE>Great, let's explore that.

69
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,940
<5-3,GREG HOUSE>赶紧给她上一剂万能药
<5-3,GREG HOUSE>Quick, get her on panacea.

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,710
<5-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我们可以通过查找动脉阻断缩小范围
<5-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>we can narrow it down by/looking for arterial blockages.

71
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,400
<5-5,ERIC FOREMAN>怎么找?用超声心动图?
<5-5,ERIC FOREMAN>How? On an echo?

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,180
<5-5,ERIC FOREMAN>当不存在室壁运动时/是看不到室壁运动的
<5-5,ERIC FOREMAN>Can't see wall motion/when there's no motion.

73
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,360
<5-6,ERIC FOREMAN>心电图?也不行/心脏正处于停止状态
<5-6,ERIC FOREMAN>Ekg, nope. Heart's in the off position.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,450
<5-6,ERIC FOREMAN>铊扫描成像?/对一颗冷冻心脏不起作用
<5-6,ERIC FOREMAN>Thallium uptake scan?/Useless on a cold heart.

75
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,440
<5-7,GREG HOUSE>够了 我们懂了:/她的心脏停止了跳动
<5-7,GREG HOUSE>Yeah, we get it. Her/heart's not beating.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,790
<5-7,GREG HOUSE>这令诊断变得更加困难
<5-7,GREG HOUSE>It's gonna make it harder to diagnose.

77
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,960
<5-7,GREG HOUSE>难道她不会在你大发牢骚时死掉/还有别的建议吗?
<5-7,GREG HOUSE>On the other hand, she's not gonna die/while you're whining about it. What else?

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,330
<5-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>还有一个方法可以缩小范围
<5-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>There is another way to narrow it down.

79
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,500
<5-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>如果你在车祸前真的看到了Amber的症状
<5-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>If you really did see a symptom/in amber before the crash,

80
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,460
<5-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>毒扁豆碱上次帮你恢复了记忆
<5-8,LAWRENCE KUTNER>physostigmine helped/your memory last time.

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,820
<5-9,CHRIS TAUB>干脆用氰化物(剧毒药)得了
<5-9,CHRIS TAUB>Why not cyanide?

82
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,010
<5-9,CHRIS TAUB>他已经衰弱不堪了/他需要的是睡眠
<5-9,CHRIS TAUB>He's a mess. He needs to sleep.

83

<5-9,CHRIS TAUB>我今早才心脏病发了一回
<5-9,CHRIS TAUB>I had a heart attack this morning.

<5-10,GREG HOUSE>午饭前不能再磕药了
<5-10,GREG HOUSE>I can't do any more drugs till lunch.

85
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,350
<5-10,GREG HOUSE>给她做个血管造影/即便对停止的心脏也能发现损伤
<5-10,GREG HOUSE>Get her an angiogram. It could/show damage even in a stopped heart.

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,840
<5-10,GREG HOUSE>其余的人去搜索她的公寓
<5-10,GREG HOUSE>The rest of you search her apartment.

<5-10,GREG HOUSE>毒素 重金属 毒品/任何可能导致她心动过速的东西
<5-10,GREG HOUSE>Toxins, heavy metals, drugs, anything/that might make her heart race.

88
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,440
<5-11,CHRIS TAUB>我要知道 有没有涉及诊疗/你却不能公开的事?
<5-11,CHRIS TAUB>I need to know if there's anything medically/relevant that you couldn't share publicly.

89
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,560
<5-12,GREG HOUSE>你代表性乱者互诫会来指引我么？
<5-12,GREG HOUSE>Is this a philanderers/anonymous tervention?

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,200
<5-13,CHRIS TAUB>显然你昨晚喝了酒
<5-13,CHRIS TAUB>You were obviously drinking last night.

91
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,300
<5-13,CHRIS TAUB>也许你带Amber去了酒吧
<5-13,CHRIS TAUB>Maybe you took amber to a bar.

92
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,410
<5-14,GREG HOUSE>我一个人骑摩托车离开了这里
<5-14,GREG HOUSE>I left here on my motorcycle alone.

93
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,350
<5-15,CHRIS TAUB>但最后你们醉醺醺地一起上了巴士
<5-15,CHRIS TAUB>You ended up drunk on a bus together.

94
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,710
<5-15,CHRIS TAUB>也许你在酒吧里遇到了Amber
<5-15,CHRIS TAUB>Maybe you met amber in the bar.

95
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,770
<5-16,GREG HOUSE>我没有和她越轨
<5-16,GREG HOUSE>I was not having an affair with her.

<5-17,CHRIS TAUB>要是你不记得就不能这么说
<5-17,CHRIS TAUB>You can't really say that/if you don't remember.

<5-18,GREG HOUSE>我失去了4小时的记忆 不是4个月
<5-18,GREG HOUSE>I lost four hours, not four months.

98
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,850
<5-19,CHRIS TAUB>也许这是第一次
<5-19,CHRIS TAUB>Maybe it was the first time.

99
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,620
<5-20,CHRIS TAUB>如果你们在一起喝的酒/你们会不会磕药了?
<5-20,CHRIS TAUB>If you drank together, any/chance you did any drugs?

<6-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>她可能在其中一个人身上/染上了某种病
<6-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>she could have caught/something from one of them.

104
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,930
<6-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>把它拷到U盘上 我们离开这里吧
<6-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Copy it to a thumb drive./Let's get out of here.

107
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,910
<6-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>也许她会描述她去了什么地方
<6-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Maybe she narrates where they are.

108
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,000

<6-5,JAMES WILSON>and... action.

109

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,930
<6-11,LAWRENCE KUTNER>这根本不相干
<6-11,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Not even close to relevant.

114
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,130
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>正如我们不知道什么有问题
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>As long as we don't know what's wrong,

115
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,650
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我们也不知道什么才有关系
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>we don't know what's relevant.

116
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,760
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>是的 说不定他们俩在一堆石棉上做爱了
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Yeah, maybe they're having/sex on a pile of asbestos.

117
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,000
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>去看吧
<6-12,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Go watch it.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,330
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>如果我们在一个陌生人的家里/你会看这段视频
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>If we were in a stranger's house,/you'd be watching the video.

119
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,510
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你改变了你的行为/因为她是你的朋友
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>You altered your behavior/because you're friends with her.

120
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,070
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你没事吧?
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Are you okay?

121
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,570
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我们根本不该治疗她
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>We shouldn't be treating her at all.

122
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,580
<6-14,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我去搜一下卫生间
<6-14,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I'm gonna search her bathroom.

123
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,880
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你还好吗?
<6-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>are you okay?

124
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,100
<7-2,GREG HOUSE>当一个幻像这么问的时候/我不能回答"很好"
<7-2,GREG HOUSE>Can't really say yes when/it's a hallucination asking.

125
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,330
<7-3,AMBER VOLAKIS>别担心 你只是在作梦
<7-3,AMBER VOLAKIS>Don't worry,you're just dreaming.

126
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,780
<7-4,GREG HOUSE>我在你身上看到了什么症状?
<7-4,GREG HOUSE>What symptom did I see in you?

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,510
<7-4,GREG HOUSE>- 肌肉颤动-/- 无聊
<7-4,GREG HOUSE>- A myoclonic jerk-/- boring.

128
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,670
<7-6,GREG HOUSE>一个异常的神经学症状被称为"无聊"?
<7-6,GREG HOUSE>An incredibly rare neurological/symptom is boring?

129
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,660
<7-6,GREG HOUSE>我是在别人的潜意识里吗?
<7-6,GREG HOUSE>Am I in someone else's subconscious?

130
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,480
<7-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>我们昨晚干了什么?
<7-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>What did we do last night?

131
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,170
<7-8,GREG HOUSE>我约了你喝酒?
<7-8,GREG HOUSE>Was I meeting you for a drink?

132
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,830
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>仅此而已?
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>Is that all it was?

133
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:23,680
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>一个男人觉得一个女人很漂亮/欣赏她的智慧
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>A man thinks a woman is beautiful,/admires her intelligence,

134
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,690
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>欣赏她为了得到自己想要的东西/不择手段
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>admires the way she has/to get whatever she wants,

135
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,770
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>她具备他所拥有并喜爱的特质
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>the things he likes about himself.

136
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,590
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>也许她...
<7-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>Maybe she ...

137
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,730
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>一直以来都对他有意思
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>always had a little thing for him.

138
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,910
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>他的智慧 他蓝色的眼眸
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>His mind. His blue eyes.

139
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,290
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>但有人挡在了他们中间 所以...
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>But someone gets between them. So...

140
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,630
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>他们决定相约到一家偏僻的小酒吧见面
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>They decide to meet one night/at an out-of-the-way little bar.

141
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,070
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>这听起来是否似曾相识?
<7-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>Does that sound familiar?

142
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,790
<7-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>你对我的感觉是否似曾相识?
<7-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>Do I feel familiar?

143
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,000
<7-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>你有什么感觉?
<7-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>What do you feel?

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,270
<8-1,GREG HOUSE>电流
<8-1,GREG HOUSE>Electricity.

145
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,190
<8-1,GREG HOUSE>电流
<8-1,GREG HOUSE>Electricity.

146
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,050
<8-2,GREG HOUSE>我确信我看到了症状
<8-2,GREG HOUSE>I know I saw the symptom.

147
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,800
<8-2,GREG HOUSE>而这段记忆锁在我的大脑里了
<8-2,GREG HOUSE>I know the memory's locked in my brain.

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
<8-2,GREG HOUSE>现在我知道如何开启它了
<8-2,GREG HOUSE>Now I know how to get it.

149
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,370
<8-3,LISA CUDDY>不行
<8-3,LISA CUDDY>No.

150
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,610
<8-4,GREG HOUSE>你甚至还不知道我要说什么
<8-4,GREG HOUSE>You don't even know what/I'm talking about.

151
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,140
<8-5,LISA CUDDY>你需要休息
<8-5,LISA CUDDY>You need to rest.

152
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,420
<8-5,LISA CUDDY>我目前还没听说什么研究/把电流和休息联系起来
<8-5,LISA CUDDY>I have yet to hear about any/study linking electricity and rest.

153
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,170
<8-5,LISA CUDDY>深部脑刺激
<8-5,LISA CUDDY>Deep brain stimulation.

154
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,130
<8-6,GREG HOUSE>已经得到证实了
<8-6,GREG HOUSE>It's been proven.

155
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,680
<8-6,GREG HOUSE>电脉冲直接刺激脑丘下部/可以唤醒细节性记忆
<8-6,GREG HOUSE>Electrical impulses applied directly to the/hypothalamus could evoke detailed memories.

156
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,390
<8-7,LISA CUDDY>我说错了 在裂开的颅骨上钻洞/再打霹雳进去 的确非常有助休息
<8-7,LISA CUDDY>My mistake,drilling a hole and shooting lightning/bolts into an already-cracked skull is very restful,

157
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,930
<8-7,LISA CUDDY>而且绝无生命危险
<8-7,LISA CUDDY>it's not fatal at all.

158
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,390
<8-8,JAMES WILSON>她说得没错 你要去睡觉
<8-8,JAMES WILSON>She's right. You need to sleep.

159
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,900
<8-9,LISA CUDDY>脑波活动突增
<8-9,LISA CUDDY>Brain activity spiked.

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,010
<8-9,LISA CUDDY>Amber
<8-9,LISA CUDDY>Amber.

161
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,550
<8-10,JAMES WILSON>Amber 是我
<8-10,JAMES WILSON>Amber. It's me.

162
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,100
<8-11,GREG HOUSE>偶尔的突增很常见
<8-11,GREG HOUSE>Random spikes are common.

163
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,850
<8-12,LISA CUDDY>闭嘴
<8-12,LISA CUDDY>Shut up.

164
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,660
<8-13,JAMES WILSON>你会没事的
<8-13,JAMES WILSON>It's gonna be okay.

165
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,240
<8-13,JAMES WILSON>我在这儿陪着你
<8-13,JAMES WILSON>I'm here with you.

166
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,070
<8-14,GREG HOUSE>小组有发现
<8-14,GREG HOUSE>The team has found something.

167
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,480
<8-14,GREG HOUSE>你能不能问问她/我们可不可以走开一下?
<8-14,GREG HOUSE>Can you ask her if we can be excused?

168
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,480
<9-1,GREG HOUSE>怎么了?
<9-1,GREG HOUSE>What?

169
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,950
<9-2,ERIC FOREMAN>冠状动脉血管造影呈阴性
<9-2,ERIC FOREMAN>Coronary angio was negative.

170
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,220
<9-3,CHRIS TAUB>毒理测试也是
<9-3,CHRIS TAUB>So was the tox screen.

171
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,950
<9-4,JAMES WILSON>这就是你们的发现?测试呈阴性?
<9-4,JAMES WILSON>That's what you found? Negative tests?

172
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,000
<9-4,JAMES WILSON>我说过了 她不磕药
<9-4,JAMES WILSON>I could have told you/she doesn't do drugs.

173
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,620
<9-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我们在她的公寓里找到了这些 对不起
<9-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>We found these in her apartment. Sorry.

174
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,860
<9-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>处方减肥丸 抗抑郁药物 安非他明
<9-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Prescription diet pills./Ssris, amphetamines.

175
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,470
<9-6,CHRIS TAUB>减肥丸导致的二尖瓣结构损伤/可以解释心动过速
<9-6,CHRIS TAUB>diet pills cause structural damage to the/mitral valve,could explain the tachycardia.

176
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,790
<9-7,JAMES WILSON>要服下足以损伤心脏的剂量/她就成瘾君子了 我能察觉到
<9-7,JAMES WILSON>She'd have to be an addict to take enough/for it to damage her heart. I'd know.

177
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,370
<9-8,GREG HOUSE>那你知道她把药藏在维生素瓶子里吗?
<9-8,GREG HOUSE>Did you know that she was/hiding them in her vitamins?

178
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,530
<9-9,ERIC FOREMAN>我们要让她回复体温
<9-9,ERIC FOREMAN>we have to warm her back up.

179
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,790
<9-9,ERIC FOREMAN>心脏重新搏动/才能做CT确定
<9-9,ERIC FOREMAN>Get her heart beating so/we can do a ct to confirm.

180
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,400
<9-10,JAMES WILSON>不 我们已经讨论过了
<9-10,JAMES WILSON>No, we've been over this.

181
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,850
<9-10,JAMES WILSON>重启她的心脏会导致脑损伤/并且会灼伤她的心脏肌肉
<9-10,JAMES WILSON>Starting her heart could cause brain/damage, could burn out the heart muscle.

182
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,970
<9-11,GREG HOUSE>在不启动的情况下测试她的心脏
<9-11,GREG HOUSE>Test her heart without starting it.

183
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,430
<9-11,GREG HOUSE>剖开胸腔 手指顺着静脉血管检查二尖瓣
<9-11,GREG HOUSE>Crack her chest open, reach a finger inside/the pulmonary vein, run it across the valve.

184
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,150
<9-12,ERIC FOREMAN>这个过程难道就安全了？
<9-12,ERIC FOREMAN>That's the safer course?

185
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,450
<9-13,GREG HOUSE>如果我们错了便是
<9-13,GREG HOUSE>It is if we're wrong.

186
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,330
<9-14,ERIC FOREMAN>什么时候开始 我们假定自己是错误的了?
<9-14,ERIC FOREMAN>When did we start assuming we're wrong?

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,000
<9-15,ERIC FOREMAN>- 如果这是别的病人-/- 如果二尖瓣钙化 我们就知道答案了
<9-15,ERIC FOREMAN>- If this were any other patient- - if/the valve is calcified, that's our answer.

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,250
<9-16,GREG HOUSE>也就可以采取治疗了 去吧
<9-16,GREG HOUSE>That's our cure. Go.

189
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,220
<9-17,GREG HOUSE>13.
<9-17,GREG HOUSE>Thirteen.

190
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,000
<9-17,GREG HOUSE>谁发现了这些减肥丸?
<9-17,GREG HOUSE>Who found the diet pills?

191
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,510
<9-17,GREG HOUSE>Kutner
<9-17,GREG HOUSE>Kutner.

192
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,170
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>你甚至没进卫生间 对不敌?
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>You didn't even go in/the bathroom, did you?

193
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,130
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>你突然在讨论时变得沉默了
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>You're suddenly mute/in the differentials.

194
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,180
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>一个吹气娃娃都比你有用
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>A blow-up doll would be more useful.

195
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,370
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>还有 是的 这是我第一次用/吹气娃娃来打反面比方
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>And yes, that's the first time I've ever/implied something negative about a blow-up doll.

196
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,440
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>这是Amber 我不--
<9-18,GREG HOUSE>It's amber.I don't-

197
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,340
<9-19,GREG HOUSE>正常来说 我会很感兴趣/但今天 我不在乎
<9-19,GREG HOUSE>normally, I'd be fascinated./Today, don't care.

198
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,450
<9-19,GREG HOUSE>不管是什么 忘了它 专心工作
<9-19,GREG HOUSE>Get over whatever it is and do your job.

199
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,770
<10-1,ROBERT CHASE>等等 看她的眼睛
<10-1,ROBERT CHASE>wait. Look at her eye.

200
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,690
<10-2,CHRIS TAUB>出现了黄疸
<10-2,CHRIS TAUB>She's jaundiced.

201
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,020
<10-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>她的肝脏正在衰竭
<10-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Her liver's shutting down.

202
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,650
<10-4,ROBERT CHASE>减肥药不会引起肝脏衰竭
<10-4,ROBERT CHASE>Diet pills don't kill the liver.

203
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,540
<10-5,ROBERT CHASE>把她送回重症监护室
<10-5,ROBERT CHASE>Put her back in icu.

204
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,490
<11-1,ERIC FOREMAN>肾脏衰竭表示病原正在扩散
<11-1,ERIC FOREMAN>liver failure means whatever/this thing is it's spreading,

205
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,990
<11-1,ERIC FOREMAN>即使她处于冷冻状态
<11-1,ERIC FOREMAN>despite the fact that she's frozen.

206
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,880
<11-1,ERIC FOREMAN>肝脏和心脏衰竭可能是抗胰蛋白酶缺乏
<11-1,ERIC FOREMAN>hepatic and heart failure could/mean antitrypsinase deficiency.

207
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,810
<12-1,ERIC FOREMAN>我们可以用一根针探进她的肝部
<12-1,ERIC FOREMAN>We can stick a needle in her liver.

208
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,310
<12-1,ERIC FOREMAN>如果看到纤维化 她就对了
<12-1,ERIC FOREMAN>If we see fibrosis,she's right.

209
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,850
<12-2,GREG HOUSE>Amber喝雪利酒吗?
<12-2,GREG HOUSE>Does amber drink sherry?

210
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,740
<12-3,CHRIS TAUB>心脏也可以解释
<12-3,CHRIS TAUB>And the cardio fits just as well.

211
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,180
<12-3,CHRIS TAUB>但我们没有办法知道/我们量不了她的体温
<12-3,CHRIS TAUB>But there's no way we can tell,/since we can't take her temperature.

212
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,600
<12-4,GREG HOUSE>我做了个梦
<12-4,GREG HOUSE>I had a dream.

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,330
<12-4,GREG HOUSE>她给我倒了一杯雪利酒
<12-4,GREG HOUSE>She was pouring me a glass.

214
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,560
<12-4,GREG HOUSE>但我只喝苏格兰威士忌 啤酒/杜松子酒和朗姆酒...
<12-4,GREG HOUSE>And since I'm a scotch,/beer, gin, and rum man...

215
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,830
<12-5,CHRIS TAUB>如果我们让她恢复体温/就可以知道她有没有受到感染了
<12-5,CHRIS TAUB>if we warm her back up,we should be/able to tell if she's got an infection.

216
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,300
<12-6,JAMES WILSON>没错 病原恣意扩散直至杀死她/我们就能得出诊断了
<12-6,JAMES WILSON>Yes, we can get a diagnosis by letting/the disease run rampant until it kills her.

217
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,700
<12-6,JAMES WILSON>要是病原正在扩散/我们必须使它慢下来
<12-6,JAMES WILSON>If it's spreading, we/need to slow this even more.

218
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,380
<12-6,JAMES WILSON>我们要把她的体温降得更低
<12-6,JAMES WILSON>We've gotta cool her down further.

219
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,530
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>我知道你爱她/你怕她会死
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>I know you love her and/you're scared she's gonna die.

220
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,480
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>但把体温一降再降不是治疗的方法
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>But just making her colder/and colder isn't a cure.

221
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,860
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>不能解决现实问题
<12-7,CHRIS TAUB>It's not dealing with the reality.

222
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,890
<12-8,GREG HOUSE>雪利酒代表某些东西
<12-8,GREG HOUSE>Sherry means something.

223
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,450
<12-9,JAMES WILSON>Amber根本不喝雪利酒/House 你能不能回到--
<12-9,JAMES WILSON>amber doesn't even drink/sherry. House.Can we get back--

224
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,780
<12-10,GREG HOUSE>她喝的话就代表不了什么
<12-10,GREG HOUSE>if she did drink sherry,it/would mean nothing.

225
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,330
<12-10,GREG HOUSE>正因为她不喝 显然我的潜意识/想要暗示某些事情
<12-10,GREG HOUSE>Since she doesn't, my subconscious is/obviously trying to make some other point.

226
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,670
<12-11,LAWRENCE KUTNER>巴士路线的第三个路口/右拐有个Sharrie酒吧
<12-11,LAWRENCE KUTNER>There's a sharrie's bar on/third right off the bus route.

227
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,890
<12-13,GREG HOUSE>Wilson说的没错 要再降低她的体温
<12-13,GREG HOUSE>Wilson's right. We/need to make her colder.

228
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,340
<12-14,CHRIS TAUB>往她身上放更多的冰块/只会推迟诊断
<12-14,CHRIS TAUB>Putting more ice on her is/just delaying the diagnosis.

229
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,230
<12-15,GREG HOUSE>不是身上 是体内
<12-15,GREG HOUSE>Not on, in.

230
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,900
<12-15,GREG HOUSE>用冰浆填满她的肺部
<12-15,GREG HOUSE>Fill her lungs with slurry.

231
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,580
<12-17,GREG HOUSE>- 你要去哪里?/- 带Wilson出去喝杯酒
<12-17,GREG HOUSE>- Where are you going?/- I'm taking wilson out for a drink.

232
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,070
<13-1,JAMES WILSON>是这个地方吗?
<13-1,JAMES WILSON>Is this the place?

233
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,360
<13-2,GREG HOUSE>也许
<13-2,GREG HOUSE>Maybe.

234
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,470
<13-4,BARTENDER>我猜你来这儿...
<13-4,BARTENDER>I assume you are here...

235
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,450
<13-5,BARTENDER>是为了这个
<13-5,BARTENDER>for these.

236
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,310
<13-6,GREG HOUSE>你有没有见过我和一个/高个白种女人一起来?
<13-6,GREG HOUSE>Did you see me here with/a tall blonde woman?

237
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,240
<13-7,BARTENDER>有 你喝到第七杯苏格兰威士忌时 她来了
<13-7,BARTENDER>Yeah, I think she joined/you after scotch number seven.

238
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,370
<13-8,GREG HOUSE>她样子像是病了吗?
<13-8,GREG HOUSE>Did she seem sick?

239
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,430
<13-8,GREG HOUSE>她打喷嚏
<13-8,GREG HOUSE>She sneezed.

240
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,880
<13-9,BARTENDER>我给了她一张餐巾
<13-9,BARTENDER>I gave her a napkin.

241
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,230
<13-10,GREG HOUSE>你看到她的痰是什么颜色的吗?
<13-10,GREG HOUSE>Did you see the color of the sputum?

242
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,570
<13-11,BARTENDER>你是说鼻涕吧
<13-11,BARTENDER>I assume sputum means snot.

243
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,640
<13-11,BARTENDER>听着 我在这儿看到了/无数醉醺醺的小妞
<13-11,BARTENDER>Look, I see a lot of/drunk chicks in here.

244
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,280
<13-11,BARTENDER>我可没工夫闲下来分析/你女友鼻涕疙瘩的颜色
<13-11,BARTENDER>I didn't have time to stop and analyze/the color of your girlfriend's boogers.

245
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,240
<13-12,GREG HOUSE>她不是我女朋友 天才
<13-12,GREG HOUSE>She's not my girlfriend,genius.

246
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,550
<13-13,BARTENDER>她很性感 你似乎对她有意思/她还给你买了酒
<13-13,BARTENDER>She was hot, you seemed into/her, and she bought you drinks.

247
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,470
<13-14,BARTENDER>至少在昨晚 她是你女朋友
<13-14,BARTENDER>Last night,she was your girlfriend.

248
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,380
<13-15,FLASHBACK>痰液带血表示有寄生虫
<13-15,FLASHBACK>Blood in the sputum could mean parasites.

249
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,510
<13-16,GREG HOUSE>最近去过旅游吗?
<13-16,GREG HOUSE>Any recent travel?

250
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,220
<13-17,JAMES WILSON>你似乎对她有意思?
<13-17,JAMES WILSON>You seemed into her?

251
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,910
<13-18,GREG HOUSE>如果他有脑子就不用当酒保了
<13-18,GREG HOUSE>If he had a brain, he/wouldn't be tending bar.

252

<13-19,GREG HOUSE>新的症状是 打喷嚏
<13-19,GREG HOUSE>Sneezing's a new symptom.

253
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,660
<13-19,GREG HOUSE>假设流鼻涕是因为感染
<13-19,GREG HOUSE>Let's assume the runny/nose means an infection.

254
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,840
<14-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>House和你说了什么
<14-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>What did house have to say?

255
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,950
<14-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>他说我是被狼养大的狼孩/所以用同只手使用刀和叉
<14-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>He told me I was raised by wolves and that's/why I use the same hand for my fork and knife.

256
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,900
<14-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>灌冰浆的管子不是这条
<14-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Not that one. The slurry tube.

257
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,330
<14-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我明白这次和以往不同
<14-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I know this is different.

258
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,160
<14-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>但谁都难免一死
<14-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>But it's not. Everyone dies.

259
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,990
<14-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>她还活着
<14-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>She's not dead.

260
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,760
<14-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>可你清楚她就快不行了
<14-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>You're reacting this/way because she might be--soon.

261
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,590
<14-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>没错 为什么你一点都不伤心
<14-4,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Yeah, I am. Why aren't you?

<14-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我是印度人 姓氏却是kutner.
<14-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I'm an indian guy named kutner.

<14-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你未怀疑过我来自什么样的家庭吗
<14-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Ever wonder what happened to my parents?

264
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,750
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>- 抱歉 没注意过/- 那是我才六岁
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>- I'm sorry,I didn't-/- I was six years old.

265
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,880
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我经常放学后在父母店里帮忙
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I used to like helping out in my/parents' store after school.

266
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,340
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>一个男人走进来抢劫
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Guy walks into rob the place.

267
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,220
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>杀害了我的父母 这一点也不公平
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Ends up shooting them both. Wasn't fair.

268
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,090
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我过了很久才接受这个事实/但是生活就是这样
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Took years,but I had to accept/that's just the way it was.

269
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,000
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你到底要不要帮我往肺里塞冰浆
<14-6,LAWRENCE KUTNER>So you gonna help me fill/her lungs up or not?

270
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,990
<15-1,GREG HOUSE>告诉我 你们发现了/肝脏切片查出浸润 微小发炎
<15-1,GREG HOUSE>Tell me that the liver biopsy showed/infiltrates, minor inflammation.

271
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,250
<15-2,CHRIS TAUB>没错/你怎么--?
<15-2,CHRIS TAUB>Yeah./How--?

272
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,220
<15-3,GREG HOUSE>因为纸巾上的鼻涕
<15-3,GREG HOUSE>Snot on a napkin.

273
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,130
<15-3,GREG HOUSE>- 心脏的问题,再加上肺浸润.../- 是乙型肝炎
<15-3,GREG HOUSE>- Add the heart,infiltrates.../- hep B.

274
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,200
<15-5,GREG HOUSE>给她注射病毒抗原干扰素
<15-5,GREG HOUSE>Start her on iv interferon.

275
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,100
<15-5,GREG HOUSE>我去告诉Wilson
<15-5,GREG HOUSE>I'll go tell wilson.

276
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,040
<15-6,ERIC FOREMAN>好主意
<15-6,ERIC FOREMAN>Good idea.

277
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,640
<15-6,ERIC FOREMAN>因为我才是那个 刚经历车祸/早上还心脏病突发 需要睡觉的人
<15-6,ERIC FOREMAN>And I'll go nap because I was concussed/last night and had a heart attack this morning.

278
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,120
<15-6,ERIC FOREMAN>我去告诉Wilson 你去休息
<15-6,ERIC FOREMAN>I'll tell wilson;you go sleep.

279
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,010
<16-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>乙型肝炎? 真是荒谬
<16-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>Hepatitis b is a lame diagnosis.

280
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,920
<16-2,GREG HOUSE>老天 我睡着后比醒着更受折磨
<16-2,GREG HOUSE>Oh, god, I get less rest when I'm asleep.

281
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,010
<16-3,AMBER VOLAKIS>我死而复生 这就是你的反应?
<16-3,AMBER VOLAKIS>I rise from the dead,and/that's the reaction I get?

282
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,600
<16-4,GREG HOUSE>对不起 如果我知道/我会提前离开犹太人教派
<16-4,GREG HOUSE>I'm sorry. If I had known, I would/have started a breakaway jewish sect.

283
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,080
<16-4,GREG HOUSE>乙肝符合你的症状
<16-4,GREG HOUSE>Hep b fits.

284
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,310
<16-5,GREG HOUSE>你干吗这么做
<16-5,GREG HOUSE>Why are you doing that?

285
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,700
<16-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>因为乙肝不符合
<16-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>Because hep b doesn't fit.

286
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,580
<17-1,GREG HOUSE>把她翻过来
<17-1,GREG HOUSE>Turn her ver.

287
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,650
<17-2,CHRIS TAUB>我们正要开始注射干扰素的第二步
<17-2,CHRIS TAUB>We're about to start a/second course of interferon.

288
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,950
<17-3,GREG HOUSE>把她翻过来 也许就不用注射了
<17-3,GREG HOUSE>Which she might not/need once you turn her over.

289
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,420
<17-3,GREG HOUSE>她的腰背处
<17-3,GREG HOUSE>Small of her back.

290
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,600
<17-4,CHRIS TAUB>有淤伤
<17-4,CHRIS TAUB>she's bruised.

291
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,050
<17-4,CHRIS TAUB>-这个有什么重要的?/- 靠近看
<17-4,CHRIS TAUB>- Why is that significant?/- Look closer.

292
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,060
<17-5,GREG HOUSE>有皮疹
<17-5,GREG HOUSE>a rash.

293
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,840
<17-6,ERIC FOREMAN>你怎么知道是在她腰背处
<17-6,ERIC FOREMAN>How did you know what/was on the small of her back?

294
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,140
<17-7,GREG HOUSE>如果不是我在做梦/就是我的记忆开始恢复
<17-7,GREG HOUSE>Either I'm still asleep,/or I'm starting to remember.

295
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,600
<18-1,CHRIS TAUB>看起来象流行性感冒的皮疹
<18-1,CHRIS TAUB>looks like an influenza rash.

296
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,790
<18-2,ERIC FOREMAN>感冒不会造成她的多个器官衰竭
<18-2,ERIC FOREMAN>The flu wouldn't be/killing her organs one by one.

297
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,190
<18-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>皮肌炎
<18-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Dermatomyositis.

298
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,800
<18-4,GREG HOUSE>那不会造成她心跳过快
<18-4,GREG HOUSE>Wouldn't speed up her heart.

299
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,460
<18-4,GREG HOUSE>也许是对干扰素的过敏反应
<18-4,GREG HOUSE>Maybe it's an allergic/reaction to the interferon.

300
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,810
<18-5,GREG HOUSE>难道两天前我在公车上看到的皮疹/是对刚刚注射的干扰素过敏
<18-5,GREG HOUSE>Yes, the symptom that I saw on the bus was a rare interferon/allergy that flares up two days before you take it.

301
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,220
<18-6,JAMES WILSON>你怎么看到她背后皮疹的
<18-6,JAMES WILSON>How did you see the rash down there?

302
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,000
<18-7,GREG HOUSE>我不知道 也许她弯下了腰
<18-7,GREG HOUSE>I don't know. Maybe she leaned over.

303
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,950
<18-8,ERIC FOREMAN>也许根本不是皮疹
<18-8,ERIC FOREMAN>Maybe it's not a rash at all.

304
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,300
<18-8,ERIC FOREMAN>可能是脓疮
<18-8,ERIC FOREMAN>It could be an abscess.

305
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,080
<18-9,GREG HOUSE>13 插针进去/如果有脓 Foreman就对了
<18-9,GREG HOUSE>Thirteen, stick a needle in there./If there's pus,foreman's right.

306
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,560
<18-9,GREG HOUSE>超声波比较安全
<18-9,GREG HOUSE>Ultrasound is safer.

307
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,590
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>我又不是要你拿针穿透她
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>I'm not asking you to stick a/needle all the way through.

308
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,670
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>Taub 你来做
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>Taub, you do it.

309
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,670
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>等一下 我可以做
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>No, wait, I can do it.

310
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,200
<18-11,GREG HOUSE>很显然 你不行
<18-11,GREG HOUSE>No, apparently, you can't.

311
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,760
<18-12,CHRIS TAUB>没有滑动迹象
<18-12,CHRIS TAUB>It's not fluctuant.

312
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,030
<18-13,CHRIS TAUB>干净的 没脓
<18-13,CHRIS TAUB>Clear. It's not pus.

313
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,930
<18-14,ERIC FOREMAN>说明是个囊包
<18-14,ERIC FOREMAN>Means it's vesicular.

314
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,530
<18-14,ERIC FOREMAN>落基山斑疹热/(由扁虱传播)
<18-14,ERIC FOREMAN>Rocky mountain spotted fever.

315
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,860
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>我们上周和朋友一起吃饭
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>We had dinner with a friend last week.

316
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,230
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>我们帮他们遛了遛狗
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>We walked their dogs.

317
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,460
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>她可能沾到了虱子
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>I guess she could have gotten a tick.

318
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,510
<18-16,ERIC FOREMAN>可以用强力霉素治疗
<18-16,ERIC FOREMAN>It's treatable. Doxycycline.

319
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,120
<18-17,GREG HOUSE>抗生素需要8个小时才能见效
<18-17,GREG HOUSE>Allow eight hours for the/antibiotics to take effect,

320
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,170
<18-17,GREG HOUSE>到时再回升体温 激活她心脏
<18-17,GREG HOUSE>then we warm her up,shock her heart.

321
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,520
<18-18,JAMES WILSON>等一等 等一等
<18-18,JAMES WILSON>Wait a minute,wait a minute.

322
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,540
<18-18,JAMES WILSON>如果诊断错误 把她解冻可能会杀了她
<18-18,JAMES WILSON>If we're wrong, restarting her/heart could kill her.

323
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,990
<18-18,JAMES WILSON>先做例血培养
<18-18,JAMES WILSON>Run blood cultures first.

324
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,770
<18-19,ERIC FOREMAN>最快的治疗办法就是对症下药
<18-19,ERIC FOREMAN>The fastest way to test is to treat.

325
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,330
<18-19,ERIC FOREMAN>就算错了 也有时间换其他治疗方案
<18-19,ERIC FOREMAN>If we're wrong,it still should/give us time to try something else.

<18-21,ERIC FOREMAN>从来没有百分百把握
<18-21,ERIC FOREMAN>We're never 100% certain.

334
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,070
<18-24,GREG HOUSE>听我的 去做例血培养

<25-53,GREG HOUSE>不要吃它
<25-53,GREG HOUSE>Don't do it.

466
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,690
<25-54,GREG HOUSE>不是感冒 是因为她吃的药
<25-54,GREG HOUSE>It wasn't the flu. It's/what she did for it.

467
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,420
<25-54,GREG HOUSE>她是服用三环癸胺导致中毒
<25-54,GREG HOUSE>She has amantadine poisoning.

468
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,210
<25-55,JAMES WILSON>而车祸毁了她的肾脏
<25-55,JAMES WILSON>The crash destroyed her kidneys.

<25-55,JAMES WILSON>她的身体无法过滤那些毒素
<25-55,JAMES WILSON>Her body couldn't filter the drugs.

<25-55,JAMES WILSON>她过量服用三环癸胺/解释了心脏和肝脏的衰竭...
<25-55,JAMES WILSON>She ods on amantadine,explains/the heart, the liver...

<25-55,JAMES WILSON>我们只要给她做血液透析/把毒素滤去就行了
<25-55,JAMES WILSON>we just need to start her on/dialysis and flush the drugs out.

472
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,040
<25-56,JAMES WILSON>怎么了?
<25-56,JAMES WILSON>What? What's wrong?

473
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,760
<25-57,GREG HOUSE>三环癸胺会与蛋白质结合在一起
<25-57,GREG HOUSE>Amantadine binds with proteins.

474
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,240
<25-57,GREG HOUSE>透析无法从滤去蛋白质
<25-57,GREG HOUSE>Dialysis can't clear/it out of the blood.

475
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,200
<25-58,GREG HOUSE>我们无能为力
<25-58,GREG HOUSE>There's nothing we can do.

<25-60,JAMES WILSON>Amber.

478
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,600
<25-61,GREG HOUSE>Amber.
<25-61,GREG HOUSE>Amber.

479

<25-62,ROBERT CHASE>他在抽搐  Wilson 快过来帮忙
<25-62,ROBERT CHASE>Seizing. Wilson, I need help here.

480

<26-1,ERIC FOREMAN>House 处于局部痉挛综合症中
<26-1,ERIC FOREMAN>House suffered a complex partial seizure.

481

<26-1,ERIC FOREMAN>巨大晃动加大了他的头骨裂缝/造成了脑出血
<26-1,ERIC FOREMAN>The violent shaking widened his/skull fracture, causing a brain bleed.

482
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:24,370
<27-1,ERIC FOREMAN>在他恢复意识之前/我们无法估测是否造成了精神损伤
<27-1,ERIC FOREMAN>We won't know if there's any cognitive/impairment until he's out of the coma.

483
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,970
<27-3,ERIC FOREMAN>他对三环癸胺的诊断是对的
<27-3,ERIC FOREMAN>He was right about the amantadine.

484
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,650
<27-3,ERIC FOREMAN>Amber的身体无法滤出毒素
<27-3,ERIC FOREMAN>Amber's body couldn't filter it out.

485
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,290
<27-3,ERIC FOREMAN>所以她长时间心跳加速
<27-3,ERIC FOREMAN>That's what caused her heart to/beat too fast for too long.

486
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,770
<27-4,ERIC FOREMAN>造成了无法修补的结构损伤
<27-4,ERIC FOREMAN>It caused irreparable structural damage.

487
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,390
<27-4,ERIC FOREMAN>无论是电击或者冰冻她
<27-4,ERIC FOREMAN>Didn't matter if/they shocked her or froze her.

488
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,860
<27-5,ERIC FOREMAN>她的心脏在救护车上就停止跳动了
<27-5,ERIC FOREMAN>Her heart was dead once it/stopped in that ambulance.

<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>她所有的器官都已损坏

491
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,970
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>不够资格做手术移植
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>She can't qualify.

492
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,230
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>我们无能为力
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>There's nothing we can do.

493
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,070
<28-3,ERIC FOREMAN>已经没有办法挽救了
<28-3,ERIC FOREMAN>Nothing we could have done.

494
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,670
<29-1,JAMES WILSON>该读取死亡时间了

<29-2,LISA CUDDY>Could probably survive a/few more hours on bypass.

497
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,480
<29-2,LISA CUDDY>我们可以停用麻药 让她苏醒过来/给你们一个机会---
<29-2,LISA CUDDY>We could wean her off anesthesia,/wake her up, give you a chance to--

498

<29-3,JAMES WILSON>那样太残忍了 不要---
