11
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,410
<1-3,Treiber>这是致死原因
<1-3,Treiber>as the instigating event.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,640
<1-3,Treiber>不幸的是  病历上说
<1-3,Treiber>Unfortunately, the medical records show

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,060
<1-3,Treiber>本扎医生从没有怀疑过是心脏病
<1-3,Treiber>that Dr. Penza never suspected heart disease,

14
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,650
<1-3,Treiber>而是误诊为哮喘  给予激素治疗
<1-3,Treiber>instead giving steroids for an erroneous diagnosis of asthma,

15
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,620
<1-3,Treiber>导致致命的心室撕裂

22
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,610
<1-4,Treiber>我很冷

<2-2,House>"面对死神  我的生活就此改变"
<2-2,House>"Staring death in the face has changed my life."

46
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,340
<2-2,House>真是俗套啊
<2-2,House>What a cliche.

47

<2-3,Wilson>人因此而过上更有意义的生活才俗呢
<2-3,Wilson>The cliche is to lead a more meaningful life.

48
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,020
<2-3,Wilson>而我发了毒誓
<2-3,Wilson>I've taken a holy vow

49
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,400
<2-3,Wilson>接下来要过没有意义的日子
<2-3,Wilson>to lead a less meaningful one.

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,960
<2-3,Wilson>我穷尽一生在关心别人
<2-3,Wilson>I've spent my life caring,

52
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,830
<2-3,Wilson>现在是时候自私一下  漠不关心
<2-3,Wilson>Now it's time for selfishness, indifference,

53
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,280
<2-3,Wilson>迎接肤浅的新生活了
<2-3,Wilson>and embracing the shallow.

<2-4,House>你三天后拍片

<2-4,House>癌症会要你命之前  你消磨时间的方式
<2-4,House>until you find out if your cancer's gonna kill it for you.

57
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,180
<2-5,Wilson>我花了七万五  买了辆可笑又不实用的车
<2-5,Wilson>I just paid $75,000 for a ridiculously impractical car,

58
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,110
<2-5,Wilson>这可是肤浅至极了啊
<2-5,Wilson>the depth of shallowness.

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,560
<2-6,House>岁月可没饶了大卫·卡西迪
<2-6,House>The years have not been kind to David Cassidy.

71
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,940
<2-7,Wilson>为了实现愚蠢的白日梦
<2-7,Wilson>I'm neglecting my patients

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,290
<2-7,Wilson>我要对我的病人不闻不问
<2-7,Wilson>to fulfill a silly fantasy.

73
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,340
<2-7,Wilson>这是教科书般的自私和漠不关心
<2-7,Wilson>Textbook selfishness and indifference.

74
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,240
<2-8,House>或者你已经把你的病人都安排好了

<3-2,House>问题解决
<3-2,House>Case solved.

88
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,280
<3-2,House>描述一下

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,030
<3-2,House>"有意思"的过去式是什么
<3-2,House>what's the past-tense of "interesting?"

<3-3,Foreman>No prior history of mental illness,

91
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,190
<3-3,Foreman>在你说是由抗病毒药物引起之前

92
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,330
<3-3,Foreman>我已经把它排除了
<3-3,Foreman>I've already ruled that out.

93
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,890
<3-3,Foreman>且虚无妄想综合征无法解释
<3-3,Foreman>Plus, Cotard's doesn't explain

94
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,490
<3-1,Foreman>他的手为何感觉异常
<3-1,Foreman>the paresthesia in his hand.

95

<3-3,Foreman>他只相信你

98

<3-5,House>威尔森的拍片安排在周末
<3-5,House>Wilson's scan is at the end of the week.

102
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,440
<3-5,House>若牛逼的化疗让肿瘤缩小到可以进行手术了
<3-5,House>If his kick-ass chemo shrunk the tumor to an operable size,

103
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,430
<3-5,House>他就能活下来
<3-5,House>he'll live.

104
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,340
<3-5,House>如果没有  他就死定了
<3-5,House>If it didn't, he'll die.

105
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,510
<3-6,Adams>这一定很难熬
<3-6,Adams>That must be very hard.

106
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,170
<3-6,Adams>我们能帮上什么忙吗
<3-6,Adams>Is there anything we can do?

107
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,840
<3-7,House>除了围个圈祈祷  还能干啥
<3-7,House>Other than the prayer circle, what is there?

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,570
<3-8,Adams>也许是丙肝

<3-8,Adams>胆红素血清蛋白水平无异常

<3-9,Chase>Doesn't explain the tingly hand

113
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,990
<3-9,Chase>和奇斯为什么恨他
<3-9,Chase>or why Chase hates him.

114
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,870
<3-9,Chase>我不恨他  是他恨我
<3-9,Chase>I don't hate him. He hates me.

115
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,950
<3-10,Taub>他痛恨所有医生  而且恨是双向的
<3-10,Taub>He hates all doctors, and it's mutual.

116
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,250
<3-11,Park>他只恨那些搞砸的医生
<3-11,Park>He only hates the ones that screw up,

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,470
<3-11,Park>还有你
<3-11,Park>and you.

118
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,150
<3-11,Park>那些医生恨特莱柏
<3-11,Park>And they only hate Treiber

119
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,810
<3-11,Park>是因为他发现了他们的失误
<3-11,Park>because he finds their mistakes.

120
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,480
<3-12,Taub>在死人身上找错误简单多了
<3-12,Taub>Mistakes are a wee bit easier to find on a dead patient.

121
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,070
<3-12,Taub>这么大的区别他看不出来
<3-12,Taub>A distinction he fails to recognize.

<3-12,Taub>他就是找茬
<3-12,Taub>He's a rat.

<3-13,Park>是谁通过让医生更负责更专注
<3-13,Park>Who makes the hospital a safer place

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,130
<3-13,Park>从而保障医院的治愈率的
<3-13,Park>by keeping doctors accountable and focused.

125
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,460
<3-14,Chase>会不会他从尸体上传染上什么病
<3-14,Chase>What if he got something from a cadaver?

126
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,470
<3-15,Adams>他经手的可不少了
<3-15,Adams>He handles a lot of 'em.

127
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,230
<3-15,Adams>你的意思是要逐一作鉴别诊断吗
<3-15,Adams>You suggesting we DDX them all?

128
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,190
<3-16,Chase>不用  就最后一个
<3-16,Chase>No, just his last one.

<3-16,Chase>她膝盖不好
<3-16,Chase>She had bad knees.

130

<3-16,Chase>她用二甲基亚砜治疗关节痛
<3-16,Chase>She used dimethyl sulfoxide for joint pain.

131
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,650
<3-16,Chase>除颤仪产生的电流
<3-16,Chase>Current from the defibrillator

132
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,480
<3-16,Chase>可使其产生二甲硫
<3-16,Chase>could've converted it to dimethyl sulfate.

133
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,710
<3-16,Chase>当特莱柏切开她时
<3-16,Chase>When Treiber cut into her,

134
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,980
<3-16,Chase>毒素通过她的血液散发出来
<3-16,Chase>her blood released toxic fumes.

135
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,810
<3-17,Taub>那样的话所有在地下室的人都会生病
<3-17,Taub>Everyone in the basement would be sick.

136
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,940
<3-17,Taub>气体也不会扩散得那么快
<3-17,Taub>Gas would've dissipated quickly.

137
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,080
<3-18,Park>他肺部正常  血栓更合理一点
<3-18,Park>His lungs are fine. Blood clots make more sense.

138
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
<3-18,Park>血栓在手部可以解释他的感觉异常
<3-18,Park>One in his hand explains the paresthesia,

139
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,970
<3-18,Park>血栓在颈动脉可以解释他的精神错乱
<3-18,Park>one in his carotid explains the psychotic episode.

140
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,570
<4-5,Treiber>你们俩去找暴露出来的毒素
<4-5,Treiber>You two look for toxic exposure.

141
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,840
<4-6,Adams>亚当斯  你去帮奇斯
<4-6,Adams>Adams, you can help Chase ultrasound

142
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,790
<4-1,Treiber>给他的死敌做B超  找那邪恶的血栓
<4-1,Treiber>his evil nemesis for evil clots.

143
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,160
<4-1,Treiber>我知道豪斯不喜欢见病人
<4-1,Treiber>I know House doesn't like seeing his patients,

144
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,150
<4-1,Treiber>但同事找他看病  就不能特别对待吗
<4-1,Treiber>but doesn't a fellow doctor rate an exception?

145
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,190
<4-2,Adams>精神症状似乎是间断发作
<4-2,Adams>Psychosis appears to be intermittent.

146
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,870
<4-3,Treiber>我多几句嘴就是想确认一下
<4-3,Treiber>Just snapped out of it long enough to ask

147
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,570
<4-3,Treiber>这检查是不是豪斯让做的
<4-3,Treiber>if House actually ordered this test.

148
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,360
<4-4,Chase>别担心
<4-4,Chase>Don't worry.

149
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,390
<4-4,Chase>我们只是在执行他的命令罢了
<4-4,Chase>We're simply carrying out his direct orders.

150
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,140
<4-5,Treiber>对  我忘了你就是被雇来干这活的
<4-5,Treiber>Right. Forgot it's what you were hired to do.

151
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
<4-5,Treiber>这无所谓  他的误诊率是0.17
<4-5,Treiber>Which is fine, his diagnostic error metric

152
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,510
<4-5,Treiber>比医院平均水平0.32低多了
<4-5,Treiber>is .17 compared to the hospital average of .32.

153
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,370
<4-6,Adams>你真的认为你能用数据
<4-6,Adams>You actually think you can quantify

154
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,950
<4-6,Adams>来评估每位医生吗
<4-6,Adams>the value of every doctor?

155
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,890
<4-7,Treiber>应该统计统计吧
<4-7,Treiber>Someone should.

156
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,990
<4-7,Treiber>而我正是唯一能看清一切的人
<4-7,Treiber>And since I'm the only one who sees everything.

157
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,700
<4-8,Chase>可不是  雇你来就是要你
<4-8,Chase>Right, you were hired to diagnose people

158
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,980
<4-8,Chase>诊断死人的
<4-8,Chase>after they're already dead.

159
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,350
<4-8,Chase>未见血管管腔狭窄及血栓
<4-8,Chase>No sign of stenosis or clots.

160
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,610
<5-1,Park>每个医生  诊断  治疗方式  结果
<5-1,Park>Every doctor, every diagnosis, every treatment, every result.

161
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,950
<5-1,Park>真是惊人
<5-1,Park>It's pretty impressive.

162
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,230
<5-2,Taub>真是个阴谋论者
<5-2,Taub>It's pretty Orwellian.

163
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,170
<5-2,Taub>Orwellian  源自英国作家乔治·奥威尔
<5-2,Taub>比喻极权式的统治方式

164
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,380
<5-2,Taub>全是暗码
<5-2,Taub>All written in his secret code.

165
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,210
<5-3,Park>他必须保密
<5-3,Park>He has to keep it confidential.

166
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,820
<5-4,Taub>就像万塞会议
<5-4,Taub>Just like the Wannsee Conference.

168
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,450
<5-5,Park>用"老大哥"打比喻还不够吗
<5-5,Park>The "Big Brother" metaphor wasn't pointed enough for you?

170
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,210
<5-5,Park>还要加上希特勒
<5-5,Park>You had to throw in Hitler?

171
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,610
<5-5,Park>几年前
<5-5,Park>A couple years ago,

172
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,710
<5-5,Park>他发现了儿童死亡之间的联系
<5-5,Park>he noticed a link in child deaths,

173
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,700
<5-5,Park>彻底改变了医院制度
<5-5,Park>and it's completely changed hospital policies all over--

174
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,850
<5-6,Taub>我知道  特莱柏是书呆子之王
<5-6,Taub>I get it. Treiber is nerd king.

175
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,490
<5-6,Taub>我们杀的越多  他救的就越多
<5-6,Taub>The more people we kill, the more lives he saves.

176
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,140
<5-6,Taub>二甲硫检查结果呈阴性
<5-6,Taub>Test is negative for dimethyl sulfate.

177
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,310
<5-6,Taub>她的血液中无毒
<5-6,Taub>Her blood is not toxic.

178
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,860
<5-7,Park>那我们应该找找别的毒物源
<5-7,Park>Then we should look for toxic exposure from something else.

179
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,510
<5-8,Taub>你真的认为医院会白痴到
<5-8,Taub>You really think the hospital is idiotic enough

180
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,410
<5-8,Taub>连有毒器具也提供吗
<5-8,Taub>to issue toxic supplies?

181
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,010
<5-9,Park>你没看到他的工具吗
<5-9,Park>Have you seen his tools?

182
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,190
<5-9,Park>特莱柏不总是用医院标准工具
<5-9,Park>Treiber doesn't always use hospital-issue.

183
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,590
<5-10,Taub>那他才是白痴吗
<5-10,Taub>Then he's the idiot?

184
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,130
<5-11,Park>不是  我可不想
<5-11,Park>No, but I don't want to

185
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,190
<5-11,Park>向豪斯做解释
<5-11,Park>explain that assumption to House.

186
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,460
<5-11,Park>-有发现了  -有发现了
<5-11,Park>- Found something. - Found something.

187
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,390
<6-1,Wilson>我们应该来次自驾游
<6-1,Wilson>Thought we'd make it a road trip.

188
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,930
<6-1,Wilson>80年代的音乐  垃圾食品  啤酒
<6-1,Wilson>'80s music, junk food, beer.

189
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,450
<6-2,House>我和牙医有约
<6-2,House>I have a dental appointment,

190
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,430
<6-2,House>现在就打电话预约
<6-2,House>that I'm going to make now.

191
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,150
<6-3,Wilson>我会让你开车哦
<6-3,Wilson>Ah. I'll let you drive.

192
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,410
<6-4,House>只为一连三天听你哭诉
<6-4,House>Not worth listening to you whine

193
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,770
<6-4,House>你的心情和恐惧  不值得
<6-4,House>about your feelings and fears for three days.

194
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,490
<6-5,Wilson>不可能的事  我已经发誓了
<6-5,Wilson>It's not gonna happen. I've taken a vow.

195
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,470
<6-6,House>人是不会变的  你是人  因此我不去
<6-6,House>People don't change. You are a person, ergo, pass.

196
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,320
<6-7,Wilson>这就是为何我带上了这个
<6-7,Wilson>Yes, that's why I brought this.

197
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,040
<6-7,Wilson>20毫升丙泊酚[麻醉剂]
<6-7,Wilson>20CCs of propofol.

198
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,590
<6-7,Wilson>你可以自愿和我走
<6-7,Wilson>You can accompany me willingly,

199
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,370
<6-7,Wilson>不然我就在你不经意的时候
<6-7,Wilson>or I will, when you least expect it,

200
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,410
<6-7,Wilson>往你血管里注射一小瓶这玩意
<6-7,Wilson>inject the contents of this vial into your bloodstream.

201
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,530
<6-7,Wilson>摔倒可引起脑震荡
<6-7,Wilson>The fall might result in a concussion,

202
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,970
<6-7,Wilson>或者骨折
<6-7,Wilson>or fractures,

203
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,120
<6-7,Wilson>也许你会走运
<6-7,Wilson>or you might get lucky

204
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,350
<6-7,Wilson>醒来后发现人在阿伦敦[滨州]
<6-7,Wilson>and simply wake up somewhere near Allentown

205
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,390
<6-7,Wilson>只是有点头疼
<6-7,Wilson>with a nasty headache.

206
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,610
<6-7,Wilson>选择权还是你的  而且你可别忘了
<6-7,Wilson>The choice is yours, and in case you've forgotten,

207
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,320
<6-7,Wilson>我怎样都无所谓
<6-7,Wilson>I am indifferent.

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,650
<6-7,Wilson>明早8点出发
<6-7,Wilson>We leave tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

209
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,000
<6-8,Chase>没血栓
<6-8,Chase>No clots.

210
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,330
<6-9,Park>没毒素
<6-9,Park>No gas.

211
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,800
<6-10,Taub>可我们发现了这个
<6-10,Taub>But we found enough of this

212
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,660
<6-10,Taub>多得足以引起尸变了
<6-10,Taub>to reanimate the entire morgue.

213
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,220
<6-10,Taub>他以咖啡因为食
<6-10,Taub>He's jacked on caffeine.

214
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,400
<6-10,Taub>兴奋剂所致精神病
<6-10,Taub>Stimulant psychosis.

215
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,810
<6-11,House>我又一次完成了对他的诊断
<6-11,House>How many times do I have to solve this case?

216
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,900
<6-12,Adams>我们要做的就是
<6-12,Adams>So all we have to do is

217
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,800
<6-12,Adams>水化治疗并观察24小时
<6-12,Adams>hydrate and observe him for 24 hours.

219
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,590
<6-12,Adams>为何不告诉他这是你的主意
<6-12,Adams>Why don't you tell him it was your idea?

220
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,910
<6-12,Adams>也许他会对你有所改观
<6-12,Adams>He might warm up to you.

221
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,440
<6-12,Adams>如果邮箱里收到一只耳朵
<6-12,Adams>If you get an ear in the mail,

222
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,410
<6-12,Adams>十有八九是我的
<6-12,Adams>it's probably mine.

223
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,280
<7-1,Treiber>我的腹部
<7-1,Treiber>My abdomen!

224
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,370
<7-1,Treiber>我的腹部疼
<7-1,Treiber>It's my abdomen!

225
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,210
<7-2,Park>撤药反应而已
<7-2,Park>It's just the effects of withdrawal.

226
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,340
<7-2,Park>这种疼痛属正常
<7-2,Park>The pain is normal.

227
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,200
<7-3,Treiber>不  不
<7-3,Treiber>No! No!

228
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
<7-3,Treiber>这不对劲
<7-3,Treiber>This isn't right!

229
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,760
<8-1,Chase>腹部胀痛
<8-1,Chase>Abdominal pain and distention

230
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,920
<8-1,Chase>这么说应该不是兴奋剂所致精神病
<8-1,Chase>Means we were wrong about stimulant psychosis.

231
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,050
<8-2,Park>可能是同时患多种病
<8-2,Park>It could be coexistent problems.

232
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,650
<8-2,Park>也许只是肠梗阻
<8-2,Park>He might just have an obstruction.

233
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,250
<8-3,Adams>你知道豪斯是怎么看巧合这种事的
<8-3,Adams>You know what House says about coincidences.

234
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,450
<8-3,Adams>我为他做检查时  未发现任何包块
<8-3,Adams>I didn't feel any masses when I examined him,

235
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,020
<8-3,Adams>也没有肠音
<8-3,Adams>and no bowel sounds.

236
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,180
<8-4,Taub>豪斯去哪儿了
<8-4,Taub>Where's House?

237
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,680
<8-5,Adams>他还没来呢  威尔森也是
<8-5,Adams>He hasn't come in yet, and neither has Wilson.

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,580
<8-5,Adams>我已经给他打了三次电话了
<8-5,Adams>I've--I've already tried him three times.

239
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,870
<8-6,Taub>又来了
<8-6,Taub>Here we go again.

240
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,910
<8-6,Taub>糖尿病可能引起手部
<8-6,Taub>Diabetes could cause nerve damage in his hand,

241
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,170
<8-6,Taub>和内脏神经受损  而且
<8-6,Taub>and guts, and--

242
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,050
<8-7,Park>但是他的血糖水平正常
<8-7,Park>Except his glucose levels are normal.

243
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,610
<8-7,Park>而且如果他有糖尿病  肯定早就说了
<8-7,Park>And he probably would've mentioned he was a diabetic.

244
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,100
<8-8,Chase>会不会是溃疡性结肠炎
<8-8,Chase>What about ulcerative colitis?

245
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,280
<8-8,Chase>先前的发作引起血栓形成
<8-8,Chase>Earlier attacks caused thrombosis--

246
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,670
<8-9,Adams>我们早已试着找过血块
<8-9,Adams>We already looked for clots,

247
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,800
<8-9,Adams>而且他的大便潜血阴性
<8-9,Adams>and there was no blood in his stool.

248
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,610
<8-10,Taub>再试试打给他
<8-10,Taub>Try him again.

249
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,230
<8-10,Taub>还有威尔森的
<8-10,Taub>And Wilson's.

250
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,970
<8-11,Chase>不管他们在哪儿  似乎不愿意被打扰
<8-11,Chase>Wherever they are, they don't want to be disturbed.

251
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,450
<8-11,Chase>我们走78号公路
<8-11,Chase>We take 78.

252
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,300
<8-11,Chase>可以沿路把各种美食吃个遍
<8-11,Chase>We can do those "sweet treats and salty eats snack food trail."

253
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,240
<9-1,Wilson>我的旅游  我做主
<9-1,Wilson>My trip, my itinerary.

254
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,570
<9-1,Wilson>我们今天得开300英里
<9-1,Wilson>We have to cover 300 miles today

255
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,080
<9-1,Wilson>这样才有时间在明天4点前
<9-1,Wilson>to be there with plenty of time

256
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,170
<9-1,Wilson>赶到朱莉那
<9-1,Wilson>to catch Julie by 4:00 tomorrow.

257
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,270
<9-1,Wilson>我不是说过要让你开车吗
<9-1,Wilson>And that thing I said about letting you drive,

258
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,420
<9-1,Wilson>我撒谎了
<9-1,Wilson>I lied.

259
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,770
<9-2,Wilson>怎么了
<9-2,Wilson>What?

260
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,310
<9-3,House>我  我真是佩服
<9-3,House>I'm--I'm impressed.

261
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,590
<9-3,House>不是说你的车技
<9-3,House>Not by that.

262
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,600
<9-3,House>是说你这么努力  维持毫不在乎的假象
<9-3,House>But by your real effort to maintain the facade.

263
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,670
<9-3,House>几乎一小时了
<9-3,House>It's been almost an hour,

264
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,940
<9-3,House>还没提到那个不容忽视的话题呢
<9-3,House>and there's been no mention of the elephant in the car.

265
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,540
<9-4,Wilson>我拒绝探讨这个话题
<9-4,Wilson>Well, I declined the elephant option.

266
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,620
<9-5,House>三天之后  你就会得知
<9-5,House>In three days, you're gonna find out

267
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,220
<9-5,House>自己是死是活
<9-5,House>if you live or die.

268
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,870
<9-5,House>你不想谈这个话题
<9-5,House>You don't want to talk about it.

269
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,820
<9-6,Wilson>我不想  但显然你想谈
<9-6,Wilson>No, but obviously you do.

270
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,650
<9-7,House>那我们是要谈谈
<9-7,House>So, we're gonna talk about it,

271
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,990
<9-7,House>但也是因为是我想谈
<9-7,House>but because I want to.

272
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,590
<9-8,Wilson>我不想讨论这件事
<9-8,Wilson>I am neither talking about it,

273
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,390
<9-8,Wilson>也不想讨论为何不谈这件事
<9-8,Wilson>nor talking about not talking about it.

274
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,730
<9-9,House>你这种人叫你不谈也不行
<9-9,House>You are hard-wired to talk about it.

275
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,030
<9-9,House>这是你的应付方式  这就是你
<9-9,House>It's how you cope, it's who you are.

276
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,840
<9-10,Wilson>是吗  不过
<9-10,Wilson>Yeah, well,

277
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,590
<9-10,Wilson>从现在开始  我就不是我了
<9-10,Wilson>from now on, I'm not me.

278
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,050
<9-10,Wilson>我是...我是...
<9-10,Wilson>I'm...I'm...

279
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,720
<9-10,Wilson>凯尔·卡洛威
<9-10,Wilson>Kyle Calloway.

281
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,960
<9-11,House>你的色情明星名是鲁斯蒂·帕卡得
<9-11,House>I thought your porn name was Rusty Packard.

282
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,060
<9-12,Wilson>凯尔无忧无虑  有大侠风范
<9-12,Wilson>Kyle is roguish, carefree,

283
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,750
<9-12,Wilson>和詹姆斯·威尔森全然不是一路人
<9-12,Wilson>and shares no qualities with James Wilson.

284
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,220
<9-13,House>凯尔会开手动档吗
<9-13,House>Can Kyle drive stick?

285
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,360
<10-1,Adams>豪斯不在的话  特莱柏不会配合治疗
<10-1,Adams>Treiber won't let us do anything without House.

286
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,660
<10-2,Chase>豪斯自动放弃这个病例了
<10-2,Chase>House just took himself off the case.

287
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,730
<10-2,Chase>你说检查的时候未见肠音
<10-2,Chase>You said no bowel sounds when you examined him.

288
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,350
<10-2,Chase>是根本没有呢  还是声音较轻
<10-2,Chase>"No" like diminished, or none at all?

289
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,150
<10-4,Taub>-是根本没有  -你觉得是肠套叠
<10-4,Taub>- None. - You think it's an intussusception?

290
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,660
<10-5,Chase>如果是的话  很可能是癌症
<10-5,Chase>If it is, it could mean cancer's behind everything.

291
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,070
<10-5,Chase>给他拍个腹部平片
<10-5,Chase>Let's get a plain film of his abdomen.

292
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,840
<10-5,Chase>只要不是豪斯的意见
<10-5,Chase>Treiber will refuse any procedure

293
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,620
<10-6,Chase>特莱柏都不会同意的
<10-6,Chase>that wasn't ordered by House.

294
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,320
<10-6,Chase>别告诉他不就得了
<10-6,Chase>Only if he knows it wasn't.

295
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,540
<10-7,Taub>这家伙最喜欢找医生的麻烦
<10-7,Taub>You want to lie to a guy whose favorite pastime

296
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,660
<10-7,Taub>你还要对他撒谎
<10-7,Taub>is getting doctors fired.

297
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,100
<10-8,Chase>我们都是经过严格医疗训练的医生
<10-8,Chase>We're adults with advanced medical training,

298
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,070
<10-8,Chase>不是些没人管的毛孩子
<10-8,Chase>not children left alone with scissors.

299
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,310
<10-8,Chase>就做个X光片
<10-8,Chase>It's one X-ray.

300
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,350
<11-1,House>如果带着手机
<11-1,House>If we had a phone,

301
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,150
<11-1,House>我们就能找个像样点的地方
<11-1,House>we could've found somewhere a little less charming.

302
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,950
<11-2,Wilson>如果带着手机  你肯定会打电话
<11-2,Wilson>If we had a phone, you'd be making calls,

303
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,460
<11-2,Wilson>下毛片  玩愤怒的小鸟
<11-2,Wilson>downloading porn, and playing angry birds.

304
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,310
<11-2,Wilson>这次旅行我说了算  我就喜欢这里
<11-2,Wilson>This trip is about me, and I like this place.

305
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,760
<11-3,House>这事儿和你不希望我带手机没关系
<11-3,House>This is not about you not wanting me to have a phone.

306
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,160
<11-3,House>是你太软弱
<11-3,House>You're weak.

307
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,090
<11-3,House>你知道自己会退缩
<11-3,House>You knew that you'd backslide

308
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,630
<11-3,House>给你哭哭啼啼的前妻和父母打电话
<11-3,House>and spend your time talking to teary ex-wives and your parents,

309
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,270
<11-3,House>安慰他们别太担心你的病
<11-3,House>trying to make them feel better about you being sick.

310
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,610
<11-3,House>培根汉堡配薯条看上去很难吃
<11-3,House>Bacon burger with fries looks awful.

311
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,630
<11-4,Wilson>我尝尝吧
<11-4,Wilson>I'll have that.

312
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,960
<11-4,Wilson>我要个大汉堡
<11-4,Wilson>I'll have the big one.

313
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,250
<11-5,Waitress>你肯定吗  那个要79美元
<11-5,Waitress>You sure? It's $79.

314
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,660
<11-6,Wilson>要是在一小时内吃完
<11-6,Wilson>Unless I finish it in an hour,

315
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,310
<11-6,Wilson>就是免费的
<11-6,Wilson>in which case, it's free.

316
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,290
<11-6,Wilson>那可是两公斤的牛排啊
<11-6,Wilson>It's an 80-ounce steak.

317
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,790
<11-7,Wilson>我饿着呢  再来杯冰茶
<11-7,Wilson>I'm hungry. And an iced tea, please.

318
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,360
<11-4,Wilson>上大汉堡
<11-4,Wilson>Big one's up!

319
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,120
<11-8,House>这地方可不能刷信用卡
<11-8,House>This place doesn't take credit cards.

320
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,990
<11-9,Wilson>我这顿会免单的
<11-9,Wilson>My meal is going to be free,

321
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,590
<11-9,Wilson>而且  我的名字还会刻在痛苦之墙上
<11-9,Wilson>and I'm going to be inducted into the wall of pain.

322
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,740
<11-9,Wilson>痛苦之墙
<11-9,Wilson>大汉堡之家

323
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,890
<11-9,Wilson>你好啊  凯尔

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,540
<12-1,Taub>腹部平片正常
<12-1,Taub>Belly film was normal.

325
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,140
<12-1,Taub>未见肠套叠及肠梗阻征象
<12-1,Taub>No sign of an intussusception or any other obstruction.

326
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,830
<12-2,Trieber>豪斯说有的
<12-2,Trieber>House says it's there.

327
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,440
<12-3,Chase>豪斯也会犯错
<12-3,Chase>Sometimes House is wrong.

328
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,800
<12-4,Treiber>彻底检查下
<12-4,Treiber>Run my bowel.

329
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,180
<12-5,Taub>那可是个大手术
<12-5,Taub>That's serious surgery.

330
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,000
<12-5,Taub>要全身麻醉  且恢复时间长
<12-5,Taub>General anesthesia, long recovery...

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,280
<12-6,Chase>如你需要更多证据可做个钡灌肠
<12-6,Chase>We can do a contrast enema if you need more proof.

332
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,070
<12-7,Treiber>我见过无数死者  都是正常的检查结果
<12-7,Treiber>I have drawers filled with people who had clean scans.

333
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,050
<12-7,Treiber>我很清楚很容易出现漏查
<12-7,Treiber>I know how easy it is to miss something

334
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,560
<12-7,Treiber>除非是直接用手和眼睛
<12-7,Treiber>unless you use your own hands and eyes,

335
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,930
<12-7,Treiber>给我做彻底检查
<12-7,Treiber>run my bowel.

336
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,210
<12-8,Chase>你的感受我们会告诉豪斯
<12-8,Chase>We'll let House know how you feel.

337
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,790
<12-9,Treiber>我的感受就是肚子疼死了
<12-9,Treiber>How I feel is twisted in white-hot agony.

338
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,410
<12-9,Treiber>他的诊断是检查肠套叠
<12-9,Treiber>His orders were to look for an intussusception.

339
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,040
<12-9,Treiber>在彻底检查之前  我拒绝其他检查
<12-9,Treiber>Until you actually do that, I refuse any other tests.

340
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,330
<12-10,Chase>好吧
<12-10,Chase>Fine.

341
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,350
<12-11,Taub>不行  不行  我们得和...
<12-11,Taub>Uh, no. Not fine. We need to talk...

342
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,350
<12-11,Taub>我要你给我做手术
<12-11,Taub>And I want you to do the surgery.

343
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,360
<12-11,Taub>数据上来看  你是医院里最好的外科医生
<12-11,Taub>Statistically, you're the best surgeon in the hospital.

<13-3,House>胜券在握
<13-3,House>You've got this.

<13-4,Waitress>15 seconds!

352
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,440
<13-5,House>别嚼了  直接吞
<13-5,House>Now, don't chew, just swallow.

353
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,390
<13-5,House>硬吞
<13-5,House>Muscle it down!

354

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,290
<13-6,Waitress>看在上帝份上  吞啊
<13-6,Waitress>For the love of god, swallow!

357
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,660
<13-7,Waitress>三  二  一
<13-7,Waitress>Three, two, one...

358
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,080
<13-7,Waitress>时间到
<13-7,Waitress>Time!

359
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,050
<13-8,House>成了  成了
<13-8,House>Yes! Yes!

360
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,140
<13-8,House>你个混蛋干得太好了
<13-8,House>Oh, you magnificent bastard!

361
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,470
<13-8,House>笑一个
<13-8,House>Smile!

362
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,150
<13-8,House>还算吃完了  对吧
<13-8,House>That still counts, though, right?

363
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,160
<14-1,Treiber>没情绪吧
<14-1,Treiber>No hard feelings, right?

364
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,270
<14-2,Chase>等你醒了就知道了
<14-2,Chase>You'll find out when you wake up.

365
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,650
<14-2,Chase>你真觉得我是个优秀的医生
<14-2,Chase>If you really think I'm a good doctor,

366
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,240
<14-2,Chase>为什么把我当白痴一样
<14-2,Chase>why do you treat me like an idiot?

367
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,650
<14-3,Treiber>不是说你没天赋
<14-3,Treiber>It's not because you lack talent.

368
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,180
<14-3,Treiber>只是因为你浪费了才华
<14-3,Treiber>It's 'cause you've wasted it.

369
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,370
<14-3,Treiber>你知道吗  我和你同一年申请
<14-3,Treiber>Did you know I applied to be a fellow with House

370
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,620
<14-3,Treiber>在豪斯手下工作
<14-3,Treiber>the same year as you?

371
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,360
<14-4,Chase>不知道
<14-4,Chase>No.

372
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,860
<14-5,Treiber>我放弃了其他项目  搬了家
<14-5,Treiber>Quit my other program, relocated,

373
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,020
<14-5,Treiber>和女友分了手
<14-5,Treiber>broke up with my girlfriend.

374
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,530
<14-5,Treiber>后来  你父亲通了关系
<14-5,Treiber>Then your father made a call,

375
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,030
<14-5,Treiber>那位子就被你抢去了
<14-5,Treiber>and suddenly you had the spot.

376
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,340
<14-6,Chase>那是将近十年前的事情吧
<14-6,Chase>That was almost ten years ago.

377
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,450
<14-7,Treiber>你知道  若是我跟了豪斯
<14-7,Treiber>Do you know what I could've done

378
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,370
<14-7,Treiber>三年之内  会有怎样的成就吗
<14-7,Treiber>after even three years with House?

379
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,840
<14-7,Treiber>很可能去疾病控制中心
<14-7,Treiber>Gone to the CDC,

380
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,250
<14-7,Treiber>或世界卫生组织
<14-7,Treiber>W.H.O.

381
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,660
<14-7,Treiber>在一个从未听说过
<14-7,Treiber>Started a diagnostics department

382
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,850
<14-7,Treiber>诊断部的医院  建立自己的部门
<14-7,Treiber>someplace they'd never even heard of such a thing.

383
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,290
<14-7,Treiber>你拥有了一切
<14-7,Treiber>You've been given everything.

384
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,230
<14-7,Treiber>相貌  才华
<14-7,Treiber>Looks, talent,

385
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,220
<14-7,Treiber>连同我的未来
<14-7,Treiber>my future.

386
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,030
<14-7,Treiber>九年过去了  看看你现在的样子
<14-7,Treiber>Nine years later, look what you've done with it.

387
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,870
<15-2,House>吃饭吃到吐的感觉还不错吧
<15-2,House>Must be nice to be puking for the old-fashioned reasons.

388
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,190
<15-3,Wilson>很高兴我挑战过了
<15-3,Wilson>I'm glad I did it.

389
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,510
<15-3,Wilson>你看到那些人为我加油的样子吗
<15-3,Wilson>You see those people out there cheering for me?

390
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,630
<15-3,Wilson>我是个英雄
<15-3,Wilson>I was a hero.

391
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,980
<15-3,Wilson>就那么一小会儿
<15-3,Wilson>For one fleeting moment,

392
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,560
<15-3,Wilson>就因为那么愚蠢的事
<15-3,Wilson>for an incredibly stupid reason,

393
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,690
<15-3,Wilson>在一群无缘再见的傻瓜心中  我是英雄
<15-3,Wilson>for a bunch of morons I'll never see again.

394
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,520
<15-3,Wilson>老天  这感觉真好
<15-3,Wilson>God, it felt good.

395
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,510
<15-3,Wilson>失陪了
<15-3,Wilson>And now, if you'll excuse me.

396
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,150
<15-3,Wilson>我吐完想再吃点甜点
<15-3,Wilson>I think I've made room for dessert.

397
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,400
<16-1,Chase>你打算跟着豪斯干多久
<16-1,Chase>How long do you think you'll work for House?

398
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,470
<16-2,Taub>只要他允许  一直干下去
<16-2,Taub>As long as he lets me.

399
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,430
<16-3,Chase>豪斯在监狱的时候
<16-3,Chase>When House was in prison,

400
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,810
<16-3,Chase>你在仁爱医院干整容
<16-3,Chase>You worked at Mercy in plastics, right?

401
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,140
<16-3,Chase>你知道那会我干什么吗
<16-3,Chase>Know what I did?

402
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,740
<16-3,Chase>冲浪  整整九个月
<16-3,Chase>Surfed. For nine months.

403
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,760
<16-4,Taub>是啊  要不是我有两个孩子要养
<16-4,Taub>Yes, and if I didn't have two daughters

404
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,780
<16-4,Taub>有赡养费要交
<16-4,Taub>and alimony,

405
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,220
<16-4,Taub>我可能也去冲浪了
<16-4,Taub>I might have done the same.

406
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,330
<16-5,Chase>学徒阶段之后  你就应该自立门户
<16-5,Chase>A fellowship's supposed to train you to stand on your own.

407
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,620
<16-5,Chase>福曼当了院长
<16-5,Chase>Foreman's dean of the hospital,

408
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,020
<16-5,Chase>卡梅隆在芝加哥医院当了急症部主任
<16-5,Chase>Cameron's head of emergency medicine in Chicago.

409
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,810
<16-6,Taub>卡特那和安波儿死了
<16-6,Taub>And Kutner and Amber are dead.

410
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,700
<16-6,Taub>十三说不定在什么小岛上享受鱼水之欢
<16-6,Taub>And thirteen is having sweet, sapphic sex on some island.

411
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,600
<16-7,Chase>看这个
<16-7,Chase>Look at this.

412
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,340
<16-7,Chase>小肠这里
<16-7,Chase>The small intestine.

413
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,790
<16-8,Taub>是肠套叠吗
<16-8,Taub>Is it an intussusception?

414
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,710
<16-8,Taub>不是
<16-8,Taub>No.

415
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,900
<16-8,Taub>看来被特莱柏说中了
<16-8,Taub>Guess Treiber was right.

416
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,240
<17-1,Adams>他就没查过语音信箱
<17-1,Adams>He hasn't checked his voicemail.

417
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,340
<17-2,Taub>也没看邮箱
<17-2,Taub>Or his email.

418
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,170
<17-3,Park>已经快24小时了
<17-3,Park>It's been almost 24 hours.

419
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,510
<17-3,Park>是不是该通知福曼或叫警察啊
<17-3,Park>Shouldn't we call Foreman or the police?

420
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,140
<17-3,Park>我想他算是逃犯了吧
<17-3,Park>I think this makes him a fugitive.

421
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,950
<17-3,Park>我们不用通知任何人
<17-3,Park>We don't have to tell anyone.

422
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,470
<17-4,Park>特莱柏的症状最先出现在额叶
<17-4,Park>Treiber's symptoms started in his frontal lobe,

423
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,720
<17-4,Park>然后波及神经系统
<17-4,Park>and moved through his nervous system,

424
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,430
<17-5,Chase>手  小肠  肌肉
<17-5,Chase>hands, bowels, muscles.

425
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,840
<17-5,Chase>-间歇性卟啉症  -他正在发作期
<17-5,Chase>- Intermittent porphyria. - He's in the middle of an attack.

426
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,060
<17-5,Chase>应用血红素治疗  等得越久
<17-5,Chase>The longer we wait to treat with hemin,

427
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,100
<17-5,Chase>造成的伤害越大
<17-5,Chase>the more damage it causes.

428
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,810
<17-6,Adams>我们应告诉他豪斯不知所踪  瞒得越久
<17-6,Adams>The longer we wait to tell him House isn't running the case,

429
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,580
<17-6,Adams>才会带来更大的伤害
<17-6,Adams>the more damage that causes.

430
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,550
<17-6,Adams>这是欺瞒病人
<17-6,Adams>It's fraud.

431
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,120
<17-7,Chase>若我们诊断错误  这才会是问题
<17-7,Chase>It's only an issue if we're wrong.

432
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,540
<17-8,Adams>这回可不是照X光片这么简单
<17-8,Adams>It's more than one X-ray.

433
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,990
<17-8,Adams>也不仅仅是做探查性手术了
<17-8,Adams>more than exploratory surgery, even.

434
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,700
<17-8,Adams>万一你错了  用此药会造成生理损伤
<17-8,Adams>This is a drug that will damage him if you're wrong.

435
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,000
<17-9,Chase>道理是一样的
<17-9,Chase>Same principle.

436
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,870
<18-1,Wilson>我想来次3P
<18-1,Wilson>I want a threesome.

437
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,230
<18-2,House>要不咱俩先单练吧
<18-2,House>Shouldn't we try a twosome first?

438
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,420
<18-3,Wilson>是和两个女的
<18-3,Wilson>Two women.

439
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,420
<18-5,Wilson>我知道大家可能夸大其词
<18-5,Wilson>I know they're probably overrated,

440
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,950
<18-5,Wilson>而我完事后可能会极其失望
<18-5,Wilson>and I'll probably be gravely disappointed.

441
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,170
<18-5,Wilson>但我还是想试一次
<18-5,Wilson>But I want one anyway.

442
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,440
<18-6,House>不  你不想
<18-6,House>No, you don't.

443
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,330
<18-7,Wilson>凯尔想来一炮
<18-7,Wilson>Well, Kyle wants one.

444
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,070
<18-8,House>你变身为凯尔才一天
<18-8,House>Kyle's only one day old.

445
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,630
<18-8,House>哪知道自己要什么
<18-8,House>He doesn't know what he wants.

446
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,020
<18-8,House>我不关心结果
<18-8,House>I don't want to think about consequences.

447
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,670
<18-8,House>我不在乎...
<18-8,House>I don't want to think about--

448
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,280
<18-8,House>我什么都不在乎
<18-8,House>I don't want to think about anything.

449
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,020
<18-8,House>只想经历一下
<18-8,House>I just want to do.

450
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,550
<18-8,House>行
<18-8,House>OKay.

451
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,780
<18-9,House>那你必须完全按我说的做
<18-9,House>I need you to do exactly what I tell you.

452
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,850
<18-9,House>没问题
<18-9,House>Yeah, yeah.

453
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,010
<19-1,Treiber>卟啉症吗
<19-1,Treiber>Porphyria?

454
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,970
<19-2,Chase>我知道麻醉让你难以集中精力
<19-2,Chase>I know the anesthesia makes it hard to focus,

455
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,130
<19-2,Chase>但我们需要立即开始给你用血红素
<19-2,Chase>but we need to start you on hemin right away.

456
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,130
<19-2,Chase>豪斯对这个诊断很有把握
<19-2,Chase>House believes very strongly.

457
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,000
<19-2,Chase>这是正确的方案
<19-2,Chase>This is the right call.

458
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,730
<19-3,Treiber>好吧
<19-3,Treiber>Okay.

459
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,860
<19-3,Treiber>这玩意不服帖
<19-3,Treiber>This thing is peeling.

460
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,110
<20-1,Wilson>没办法  这就是胆小的代价
<20-1,Wilson>Well, that is the cost of cowardice.

461
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,700
<20-2,House>你应该真剃光头的
<20-2,House>Should've gone for the real thing.

462
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,350
<20-3,Wilson>我感觉我在欺骗别人
<20-3,Wilson>I feel like I'm cheating.

463
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,050
<20-4,House>第一  若你没得癌症这才是欺骗
<20-4,House>A, it is only cheating if you don't have cancer,

464
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,940
<20-4,House>第二  现在是周三下午
<20-4,House>and B, it's Wednesday afternoon.

465
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,340
<20-4,House>没什么人
<20-4,House>Pickings are slim.

466
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,830
<20-4,House>而更重要的是  没人喝醉
<20-4,House>And more importantly, sober.

467
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,410
<20-4,House>患癌症这招用来钓妹子屡试不爽
<20-4,House>The cancer cut is the surest way to the pity pooty party.

468
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,330
<20-4,House>搞定一个  还差一个
<20-4,House>One down, one to go.

469
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,580
<20-4,House>什么  等等
<20-4,House>What? Wait, wait, wait.

470
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,970
<20-4,House>她同意了吗
<20-4,House>She said yes?

471
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,160
<20-5,House>我可是要3P哦
<20-5,House>To a threesome?

472
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,190
<20-5,House>她极富同情心
<20-5,House>She's empathetic.

473
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,370
<20-5,House>她是妓女吧
<20-5,House>She's a hooker.

474
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,040
<20-6,House>-还给我打折了呢  -不要
<20-6,House>- Gave me a cancer rate. - No.

475
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,470
<20-7,Wilson>我这辈子都没花钱找人上床过
<20-7,Wilson>I have never paid for sex in my life.

476
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,550
<20-8,House>不用你掏钱
<20-8,House>You still haven't.

477
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,660
<20-8,House>我请客
<20-8,House>It's my treat.

478
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,920
<20-8,House>你要么接受  要么自己在接下来的一小时里
<20-8,House>It's either that, or you find two very open-minded women

479
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,850
<20-8,House>找到两个开放的女人同时爱上你
<20-8,House>to fall in love with you in the next hour.

480
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,720
<20-9,Wilson>那个酒保看着不错
<20-9,Wilson>Bartender seems nice.

481
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,110
<20-10,House>挺女人的
<20-10,House>Seems female.

482
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,760
<20-11,Waitress>想要吃点什么吗
<20-11,Waitress>Want something to eat?

483
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,240
<20-12,House>我朋友身患癌症  命不久矣
<20-12,House>My friend is dying of cancer.

484
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,140
<20-13,Bartender>太可怜了
<20-13,Bartender>Oh, you poor thing.

485
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
<20-13,Bartender>我母亲两年前患癌症去世了
<20-13,Bartender>It took my mother two years ago.

486
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,020
<20-13,Bartender>但不要放弃希望
<20-13,Bartender>But you can't give up hope.

487
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,340
<20-14,House>他基本上是放弃了
<20-14,House>He's pretty much resigned.

488
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,640
<20-14,House>只想死前轰轰烈烈干一场
<20-14,House>Just wants to go out with a bang.

489
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,370
<20-14,House>话说回来  你什么时候下班
<20-14,House>And another pun, what time do you get off?

490
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,750
<21-1,Adams>出现胸腔积液  不是卟啉症
<21-1,Adams>Pleural effusions. It's not porphyria.

491
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,380
<21-2,Chase>我们需要放胸腔引流管
<21-2,Chase>We're gonna need to put in a chest tube.

492
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,550
<21-3,Treiber>我要见豪斯
<21-3,Treiber>I wanna talk to House.

493
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,710
<21-4,Adams>我们会原原本本地告诉他
<21-4,Adams>We'll tell him exactly what's happening.

494
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,810
<21-3,Treiber>我要亲自说
<21-3,Treiber>I wanna talk to him!

495
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,120
<21-5,Treiber>让豪斯来
<21-5,Treiber>I want House.

496
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,580
<21-5,Treiber>豪斯在哪里
<21-5,Treiber>Where is House?

497
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,750
<21-5,Treiber>他在哪呢
<21-5,Treiber>Where is he?

498
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,570
<21-5,Treiber>豪斯去哪了
<21-5,Treiber>Where's House?

499
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,250
<21-6,Chase>我们不知道
<21-6,Chase>We don't know.

500
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,290
<22-1,Wilson>你不用睡在外面的
<22-1,Wilson>You didn't have to sleep out here.

501
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,000
<22-1,Wilson>四个人太挤了
<22-1,Wilson>Four's a crowd.

502
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,010
<22-2,Wilson>其实她们很早就离开了
<22-2,Wilson>Apparently they left a long time ago.

503
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,550
<22-3,House>感觉如何
<22-3,House>So, how was it?

504
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,170
<22-3,House>那个酒保和性爱专家哪个好
<22-3,House>Was the amateur as good as the pro?

505
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,150
<22-4,Wilson>我说不清
<22-4,Wilson>It was confusing.

506
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,640
<22-4,Wilson>勉强吧
<22-4,Wilson>Perfunctory.

507
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
<22-4,Wilson>-有点伤感  -当我没问
<22-4,Wilson>- A bit sad. - Never mind.

508
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,790
<22-6,Wilson>但这正是我需要的
<22-6,Wilson>And exactly what I needed.

509
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,110
<22-6,Wilson>谢谢
<22-6,Wilson>Thank you.

510
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,920
<22-6,Wilson>你愿意请我吃早饭吗
<22-6,Wilson>You feel like buying me breakfast?

511
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,080
<22-6,Wilson>其中一人顺走了我的钱包
<22-6,Wilson>One of them stole my wallet.

512
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,720
<22-6,Wilson>他不起诉  算你走运
<22-6,Wilson>You're lucky he's not pressing charges.

513
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,970
<23-1,Chase>卟啉症是很合理的诊断
<23-1,Chase>Porphyria was a legitimate call.

514
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,800
<23-2,Taub>直到出现胸腔积液
<23-2,Taub>Until the pleural effusions.

515
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,650
<23-3,Chase>我们不过是做了豪斯在这会做的事
<23-3,Chase>We've done everything House would've done if he'd been here.

516
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,020
<23-3,Chase>你向病人撒谎了
<23-3,Chase>You lied to a patient.

517
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,070
<23-4,Chase>特莱柏的状况急剧恶化
<23-4,Chase>Treiber's condition is declining rapidly.

518
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,840
<23-4,Chase>他同意让我接手治疗
<23-4,Chase>He's agreed to let me take over the case.

519
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,200
<23-4,Chase>奇斯医生不能再与病人有任何接触
<23-4,Chase>Dr. Chase will have no further contact with the patient.

520
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,810
<23-5,Foreman>行
<23-5,Foreman>Fine.

521
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,680
<23-5,Foreman>我没说把你调离此案
<23-5,Foreman>I didn't say you were off the case.

522
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,950
<23-5,Foreman>坐下
<23-5,Foreman>Sit down.

523
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,160
<23-5,Foreman>做了心脏核磁共振
<23-5,Foreman>Ordered a cardiac MRI.

524
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,460
<23-5,Foreman>左心室增大
<23-5,Foreman>Enlargement of the left ventricle

525
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,540
<23-5,Foreman>表明是侵润性病变
<23-5,Foreman>suggests an infiltrative disease.

526
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,650
<23-6,Taub>是结节病
<23-6,Taub>It's sarcoidosis.

527
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,910
<23-7,Foreman>用皮质激素开始治疗
<23-7,Foreman>We'll start him on corticosteroids

528
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,540
<23-7,Foreman>并做心脏活检来确诊
<23-7,Foreman>and do a cardiac biopsy to confirm.

529
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,990
<23-8,Chase>我不同意  卟啉症这一诊断我弄错了
<23-8,Chase>I disagree. I was wrong about the porphyria,

530
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,870
<23-8,Chase>但关于神经系统的判断是正确的
<23-8,Chase>but I wasn't wrong about the nervous system.

531
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,570
<23-8,Chase>是朊病毒病
<23-8,Chase>It's a prion disease.

532
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,420
<23-8,Chase>所以他的症状才会发展得这么快
<23-8,Chase>That's why his symptoms have progressed so rapidly.

533
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,480
<23-9,Adams>很可能他暴露于病毒源而不自知
<23-9,Adams>It's possible he was exposed and didn't know it.

534
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,330
<23-9,Adams>尸检后  脑部要存放很久才做检查
<23-9,Adams>Brains are often stored and not tested until weeks after autopsy.

535
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,500
<23-10,Foreman>特莱柏很优秀  不会这么不谨慎
<23-10,Foreman>Treiber's too good to not take the right precautions.

536
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,640
<23-11,Chase>也许问题就在于他也这么想
<23-11,Chase>Maybe the problem is he thinks the same thing.

537
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,360
<23-11,Chase>他的工作就是建立在
<23-11,Chase>His job's built on the premise

538
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,340
<23-11,Chase>医生会犯错这一假设之上  他也是医生
<23-11,Chase>that doctors make mistakes; that includes him.

539
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,310
<23-11,Chase>我们应该做脑活检
<23-11,Chase>We should do a brain biopsy.

540
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,160
<23-12,Foreman>在这种情况下
<23-12,Foreman>In his condition?

541
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,730
<23-13,Chase>那我们只能在尸检时进行脑活检了
<23-13,Chase>Then we biopsy the brains in the morgue.

542
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,780
<23-13,Chase>找出感染他的东西
<23-13,Chase>Find the one that exposed him.

543
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,990
<23-14,Foreman>这简直就是大海捞针
<23-14,Foreman>It's a needle in a haystack.

544
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,140
<23-15,Chase>我们有四个人
<23-15,Chase>There's four of us.

545
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,250
<23-15,Chase>我们至少可以
<23-15,Chase>Come on, we can at least

546
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,300
<23-15,Chase>在你们做心脏活检的时候
<23-15,Chase>start him on amphotericin to halt the progress

547
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,400
<23-15,Chase>给他用两性霉素来控制病情
<23-15,Chase>while you do your heart biopsy.

548
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,780
<23-16,Taub>不  不行  两性霉素加上活检用的造影剂
<23-16,Taub>No, we can't. Amphotericin plus the contrast dye

549
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,840
<23-16,Taub>他的肾脏受不了
<23-16,Taub>for the biopsy would overwhelm his kidneys.

550
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,400
<23-16,Taub>我们只能二选其一
<23-16,Taub>We have to choose one or the other.

551
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,930
<23-17,Foreman>进行心脏活检
<23-17,Foreman>Biopsy his heart.

552
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,850
<24-1,House>钱包要放到迷你吧台的冰箱里
<24-1,House>Wallets go in the minibar freezer.

553
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,080
<24-1,House>如果没有迷你吧台那就要放到马桶水箱里
<24-1,House>If there's no minibar, the toilet tank.

554
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,140
<24-1,House>我只剩下二十块整了
<24-1,House>I've got exactly $20 left.

555
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,470
<24-2,Wilson>不好意思  我对招妓规则不熟悉
<24-2,Wilson>I'm sorry, I wasn't familiar with hooker protocol.

556
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,920
<24-2,Wilson>我们可以用你的信用卡
<24-2,Wilson>We can use your credit cards.

557
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,210
<24-3,House>不  不行
<24-3,House>No, we won't.

558
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,880
<24-3,House>我还在缓刑期
<24-3,House>I'm still on probation.

559
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,300
<24-3,House>没有经过允许出州
<24-3,House>Leaving the state without permission

560
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,880
<24-3,House>就真的会让我的缓刑期无限延长了
<24-3,House>will really P.O. my P.O.

561
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,780
<24-4,Wilson>没所谓
<24-4,Wilson>Doesn't matter.

562
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,740
<24-5,Wilson>我们都买不起回家的汽油
<24-5,Wilson>We can't even afford gas to get home.

563
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,490
<24-5,Wilson>已经比计划晚了三小时了
<24-5,Wilson>We're three hours behind schedule.

564
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,480
<24-5,Wilson>我们有足够的油去到朱莉那
<24-5,Wilson>We have enough gas to get to Julie.

565
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,350
<24-5,Wilson>其他的一切我都不在乎
<24-5,Wilson>I don't care about anything else.

566
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,430
<24-5,Wilson>又怎么了
<24-5,Wilson>What this time?

567
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,730
<24-6,House>我就想知道你这种状态会持续多久
<24-6,House>Just wondering how long this can last.

568
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,870
<24-7,Wilson>你还在寄希望于我幡然悔悟
<24-7,Wilson>You're still hoping that I'm gonna wake up

569
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,110
<24-7,Wilson>然后承认凯尔·卡洛威只是
<24-7,Wilson>and admit that Kyle Calloway is just

570
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,770
<24-7,Wilson>我为了找乐子编出来的破理由  对吗
<24-7,Wilson>some lame excuse to have some naughty thrills aren't you?

571
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,030
<24-8,House>事实上我希望你不是
<24-8,House>I'm actually hoping you won't.

572
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,240
<24-8,House>我喜欢凯尔
<24-8,House>I like Kyle.

573
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,640
<25-1,Wilson>不是吧
<25-1,Wilson>Oh, come on.

574
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,130
<25-1,Wilson>走啊  走啊
<25-1,Wilson>Move! Move!

578
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,770
<25-3,Wilson>豪斯
<25-3,Wilson>House.

579
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
<25-4,Wilson>你还好吗
<25-4,Wilson>You okay?

580
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,760
<24-3,House>我腿还是很疼
<24-3,House>My leg still hurts.

581
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,150
<25-1,Wilson>来吧
<25-1,Wilson>Come on.

582
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,660
<25-5,Wilson>我们有二十块得走十一英里
<25-5,Wilson>We got 20 bucks to go 11 miles.

583
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,340
<26-1,Park>你为什么不回寻呼
<26-1,Park>Why aren't you answering your pages?

584
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,770
<26-2,Chase>忙着呢
<26-2,Chase>Busy.

585
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,740
<26-3,Park>活检结果显示心肌纤维化
<26-3,Park>The biopsy showed fibrosis in his cardiac muscle.

586
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,660
<26-4,Chase>所以不是阮病毒病
<26-4,Chase>So it's not a prion disease.

587
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,630
<26-5,Park>就是说福曼也错了
<26-5,Park>It means Foreman was wrong too.

588
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,660
<26-5,Park>他要所有人去他办公室做鉴别诊断
<26-5,Park>He wants everyone to meet in his office to DDX.

589
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,990
<26-6,Chase>然后他来告诉我们病因是感染吗
<26-6,Chase>So he can tell us all it's an infection?

590
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,540
<26-7,Park>有意思  或者你应该考虑
<26-7,Park>Interesting. Or maybe you should consider

591
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,900
<26-7,Park>不要再这么幼稚下去
<26-7,Park>not being such a baby.

592
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,330
<26-7,Park>第一感觉是被尸体感染
<26-7,Park>First instinct was an exposure from a corpse.

593
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,210
<26-7,Park>特莱柏所有的时间都在这
<26-7,Park>Treiber spends all his time here.

594
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,590
<26-7,Park>如果不是有毒气体
<26-7,Park>If it's not toxic gas,

595
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,900
<26-7,Park>也不是阮病毒...
<26-7,Park>not prions...

596
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,790
<26-7,Park>那就是别的什么东西
<26-7,Park>Then it has to be something else.

597
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,620
<27-1,Foreman>他也不是完美的
<27-1,Foreman>He's not perfect.

598
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,130
<26-8,Park>你究竟是想治好他还是想让他丢脸
<26-8,Park>Are you trying to cure him or discredit him?

599
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,580
<26-9,Chase>特莱柏只知道我不是豪斯
<26-9,Chase>Treiber can only see me as not House.

600
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,500
<26-9,Chase>福曼也是这样
<26-9,Chase>Foreman too.

601
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,250
<26-9,Chase>他们没错
<26-9,Chase>And they're not wrong.

602
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,660
<26-10,Park>这么说你不到楼上来吗
<26-10,Park>So you're not coming upstairs.

603
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,460
<26-10,Park>不
<26-10,Park>No.

604
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,100
<26-11,Chase>等这个病例结束后
<26-11,Chase>And when this case is over,

605
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,720
<26-11,Chase>我就辞职
<26-11,Chase>I'm quitting.

606
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,550
<27-1,Foreman>他不会辞职
<27-1,Foreman>He's not quitting.

607
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,410
<27-2,Taub>他已经开始联系其他医院了
<27-2,Taub>He already called other hospitals.

608
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,980
<27-2,Taub>特莱柏确实惹到他了
<27-2,Taub>Treiber did get under his skin.

609
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,210
<27-3,Foreman>他会好的
<27-3,Foreman>He'll get over it.

610
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,920
<27-3,Foreman>纤维化应该是机体对感染的反应
<27-3,Foreman>Fibrosis has to be a response to an infection.

611
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,640
<27-4,Park>奇斯说过你会这么说的
<27-4,Park>Chase said you'd say that.

612
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,340
<27-5,Adams>我们再用活检样本检测一下病毒
<27-5,Adams>We'll test the biopsy samples for viruses

613
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,630
<27-5,Adams>然后给他用抗病毒药
<27-5,Adams>and start him on antivirals.

614
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,520
<27-6,Taub>你都不打算跟奇斯谈谈吗
<27-6,Taub>You're not even gonna talk to Chase?

615
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,790
<27-7,Foreman>他被刺中心脏都没离开
<27-7,Foreman>He didn't leave after he got stabbed in the heart.

616
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,090
<27-7,Foreman>我认为没问题
<27-7,Foreman>I think we're okay.

617
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,270
<27-8,Taub>要么你是对的
<27-8,Taub>Either you're right,

618
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,110
<27-8,Taub>你朋友只很沮丧而已
<27-8,Taub>and your friend is just really upset,

619
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,650
<27-8,Taub>或者你错了  他是出于理智作出这个决定
<27-8,Taub>or you're wrong, and he's come at this calmly and rationally,

620
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,520
<27-8,Taub>而你就会失去一名好医生
<27-8,Taub>and you're about to lose a good doctor.

621
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,660
<27-8,Taub>无论怎样...
<27-8,Taub>Either way...

<28-2,Wilson>伊娜说这里每十五分钟就会有一辆公共汽车
<28-2,Wilson>Ina said there's a bus every 15 minutes.

<28-11,House>她以为她在佛罗里达
<28-11,House>She thinks she's in Florida.

00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,070
<28-12,Wilson>再见了  凯尔

<28-12,Wilson>闭嘴吧
<28-12,Wilson>Oh, shut up.

652
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,520
<29-1,Foreman>发现什么了吗
<29-1,Foreman>Find anything?

653
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,970
<29-1,Foreman>还没
<29-1,Foreman>Not yet.

654
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,350
<29-2,Foreman>正在检测耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌
<29-2,Foreman>Running tests for MRSA.

655
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,390
<29-2,Foreman>你让所有人都担心你要辞职的事
<29-2,Foreman>You've got everybody worried about your quitting.

656
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,990
<29-3,Chase>你是作为我朋友还是老板在这说话的
<29-3,Chase>You here as my boss or my friend?

657
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,270
<29-4,Foreman>如果我是作为老板在这  那你早被停职了
<29-4,Foreman>If I was here as your boss, you'd be suspended by now.

658
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,950
<29-5,Chase>我在这里学到了很多
<29-5,Chase>I've learned a lot here.

659
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,470
<29-5,Chase>足够组建自己的团队了
<29-5,Chase>Enough to run my own team.

660
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,010
<29-5,Chase>是时候向前看了
<29-5,Chase>It's time I moved on.

661
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,640
<29-5,Chase>很不幸这是我去年的感觉了
<29-5,Chase>Unfortunately, that's how I felt last year.

662
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,070
<29-5,Chase>还有前年
<29-5,Chase>And the year before that.

663
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,540
<29-6,Foreman>或许你没离开是有原因的
<29-6,Foreman>Maybe there's a reason you haven't left.

664
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,950
<29-6,Foreman>你需要秩序
<29-6,Foreman>You need structure.

665
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,530
<29-6,Foreman>需要支撑
<29-6,Foreman>And support.

666
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,790
<29-6,Foreman>需要有人来做决断
<29-6,Foreman>Somebody else calling the shots.

667
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,230
<29-6,Foreman>你不是以老板或者朋友的身份来找我
<29-6,Foreman>You didn't come down here as my boss or my friend.

668
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,610
<29-7,Chase>你扮的是豪斯
<29-7,Chase>You came down as House.

669
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,210
<29-7,Chase>你想用激将法激我做出决定
<29-7,Chase>You're trying to insult me into making a decision.

670
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,060
<29-8,Foreman>你我都见过这招奏效
<29-8,Foreman>We've both seen it work.

671
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,800
<29-8,Foreman>你要么迎接挑战  并且辞职
<29-8,Foreman>Either you rise to the challenge and quit,

672
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,770
<29-8,Foreman>要么就留下
<29-8,Foreman>or you stay.

673
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,360
<29-8,Foreman>做好团队配合
<29-8,Foreman>As a team member.

674
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,760
<30-1,Park>特莱柏医生
<30-1,Park>Dr. Treiber!

675
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,070
<30-1,Park>特莱柏医生
<30-1,Park>Dr. Treiber.

676
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,340
<30-2,Park>换输液袋的时候他忽然没反应了
<30-2,Park>He stopped responding when I was changing his I.V. Bag.

677
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,340
<30-3,Taub>彼得  睁开眼睛
<30-3,Taub>Peter, open your eyes.

678
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,380
<30-3,Taub>昏迷
<30-3,Taub>Coma.

679
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,870
<31-1,Foreman>特莱柏昏迷了
<31-1,Foreman>Treiber's comatose.

680
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,180
<31-2,Taub>全体成员集合意见
<31-2,Taub>All brains on deck.

681
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,140
<31-3,Adams>哪里开始  我们认为你可能是对的
<31-3,Adams>Where should we start? We think you might be right.

682
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,560
<31-4,Chase>我错了
<31-4,Chase>I'm not.

683
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,360
<31-5,Park>你不可能都检过了
<31-5,Park>You couldn't have gone through all of these.

684
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,410
<31-6,Chase>不需要
<31-6,Chase>Don't have to.

685
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,570
<31-6,Chase>特莱柏的报告无可挑剔
<31-6,Chase>Treiber's reports are thorough to a fault.

686
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,400
<31-6,Chase>方法精益求精
<31-6,Chase>His methods are fastidious.

687
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,450
<31-6,Chase>答案不在这里
<31-6,Chase>The answer isn't down here.

688
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,550
<31-6,Chase>特莱柏没有疏漏  我们有
<31-6,Chase>Treiber didn't miss anything. We did.

689
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,510
<31-7,Foreman>怎讲
<31-7,Foreman>So what?

690
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,400
<31-7,Foreman>精神异常  腹痛  胸腔积液
<31-7,Foreman>Psychosis, abdominal pain, pleural effusions,

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,760
<31-7,Foreman>心脏扩大  昏迷
<31-7,Foreman>enlarged heart, coma.

692
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,240
<31-8,Park>自身免疫疾病  可能是肺出血肾炎综合征
<31-8,Park>Autoimmune, maybe Goodpasture's.

693
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,960
<31-9,Adams>肾脏无异常  血管炎
<31-9,Adams>Kidneys are fine. Vasculitis?

694
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,210
<31-10,Foreman>-没有发热  -淋巴瘤
<31-10,Foreman>- No fever. - Lymphoma?

695
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,860
<31-12,Foreman>心脏活检中早该发现
<31-12,Foreman>Would've seen it on the heart biopsy.

696
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,510
<31-13,Chase>洗手液
<31-13,Chase>Soap.

697
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,100
<31-13,Chase>是洗手液
<31-13,Chase>It's the soap.

698
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,510
<31-13,Chase>是我搞糟了
<31-13,Chase>I blew it.

699
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,180
<32-1,House>天哪  终于开始了
<32-1,House>Oh, God, here it comes.

700
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,980
<32-2,Wilson>一如既往
<32-2,Wilson>As always.

701
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,790
<32-2,Wilson>我不过想抛开一切取乐
<32-2,Wilson>All I wanted was some meaningless fun,

702
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,630
<32-2,Wilson>却连三天都坚持不了
<32-2,Wilson>and I couldn't even last three days.

703
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,610
<32-2,Wilson>熟睡中
<32-2,Wilson>Sound asleep.

704
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,730
<32-2,Wilson>这是梦话
<32-2,Wilson>I'm sleep talking.

705
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,180
<32-3,Wilson>实现毕生梦想的机会就摆在我的面前
<32-3,Wilson>I had the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream.

706
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,390
<32-4,House>我发誓  你不闭嘴
<32-4,House>I swear, I will jump out of this moving bus

707
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,490
<32-4,House>我就跳车
<32-4,House>if you don't shut up.

708
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,790
<32-5,Wilson>我却陪一个可悲的老妇坐了一个半钟头
<32-5,Wilson>But instead, I sat with a sad, old woman for 1 1/2 hours

709
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,750
<32-5,Wilson>分别才三秒钟她就忘了我的存在
<32-5,Wilson>who forgot I existed three seconds after she left.

710
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,090
<32-5,Wilson>最傻的是
<32-5,Wilson>And the stupidest thing.

711
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,960
<32-5,Wilson>我根本没喜欢过朱莉·克里斯蒂
<32-5,Wilson>I never even had a crush on Julie Christie.

712
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,280
<32-5,Wilson>高三时我疯狂地爱上梅拉妮·罗宾斯
<32-5,Wilson>In 12th grade I was madly in love with Melanie Robbins,

713
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,800
<32-5,Wilson>她长得像极了《日瓦戈医生》
<32-5,Wilson>who happened to look exactly like Julie Christie

714
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,670
<32-5,Wilson>里的朱莉·克里斯蒂
<32-5,Wilson>in Dr. Zhivago.

715
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,060
<32-5,Wilson>她也喜欢我
<32-5,Wilson>And she really liked me.

716
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,260
<32-5,Wilson>每天中午我们都在查理顿老师的教室里玩牌
<32-5,Wilson>Played spades every lunch period in Mr. Charlton's classroom.

717
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,830
<32-5,Wilson>当然了  她有别的追求者
<32-5,Wilson>But of course, there was this other guy.

718
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,810
<32-5,Wilson>厉害家伙  人缘好  有车
<32-5,Wilson>A great guy. Very popular. He had a car.

719
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,770
<32-5,Wilson>有乐队
<32-5,Wilson>He had a band,

720
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,980
<32-5,Wilson>留小胡子
<32-5,Wilson>a mustache...

721
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,260
<33-2,Chase>凯尔·卡洛威
<33-2,Chase>Kyle Calloway.

722
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,770
<33-3,Treiber>我当时想...
<33-3,Treiber>I assumed that...

723
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,080
<33-3,Treiber>我希望能和她一起去毕业舞会
<33-3,Treiber>I hoped that we would go to the senior prom together,

724
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,210
<29-1,Foreman>可是她求我帮忙
<29-1,Foreman>but she asked me for a favor.

725
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,300
<29-2,Foreman>她问
<29-2,Foreman>She asked...

726
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,580
<29-3,Chase>我介不介意她陪他去
<29-3,Chase>If I minded if she went with him.

727
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,060
<29-4,Foreman>她问我  介不介意
<29-4,Foreman>She asked me if I minded.

728
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,680
<35-4,House>我说不介意
<35-4,House>And I said I didn't.

729
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,580
<35-5,Chase>就是这样
<35-5,Chase>And that was it.

730
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,380
<35-6,House>而我刚刚又做了同样的事
<35-6,House>And I just did it again.

731
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,880
<35-7,Wilson>我放弃了
<35-7,Wilson>I let it go,

732
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,930
<35-7,Wilson>一如我放弃所有
<35-7,Wilson>like I let everything go.

733
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,830
<35-7,Wilson>所以我到了这里  坐在这辆巴士上
<35-7,Wilson>And here I am, sitting on this bus,

734
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,950
<35-7,Wilson>拿着用手表换来的车票
<35-7,Wilson>with tickets I bought with my watch,

735
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,270
<21-1,Adams>赶回家去  就为了
<21-1,Adams>heading back home, so a...

736
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,020
<21-2,Chase>为了让一次CT扫描决定我的命运
<21-2,Chase>a CT scan can decide my f-fate.

737
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,970
<21-3,Treiber>我不想回去  豪斯
<21-3,Treiber>I don't wanna go back, House.

738
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,530
<21-3,Treiber>我只想
<21-3,Treiber>I just...

739
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,900
<21-3,Treiber>我只想继续做凯尔
<21-3,Treiber>I just wanna keep being Kyle.

740
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,060
<32-6,House>凯尔会丢下巴士站那可悲的老妇不管
<32-6,House>Kyle would've ditched that sad, old woman from the bus stop.

741
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,280
<32-6,House>很可能也会丢下我
<32-6,House>Probably would've ditched me too.

742
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,340
<32-6,House>没了凯尔我也一样活
<32-6,House>I can live without Kyle.

743
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,630
<32-6,House>吃雪宝吗
<32-6,House>Snoball?

744
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,160
<32-6,House>看来这儿不是天堂
<32-6,House>Guess this isn't heaven.

745
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,630
<32-6,House>我们找到了罪魁祸首
<32-6,House>We found out who screwed up.

746
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,800
<32-6,House>你
<32-6,House>You.

747
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,160
<32-6,House>源头就是你那工业强度的抗菌洗手液
<32-6,House>It was your industrial-strength antibacterial soap.

748
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,120
<33-1,Treiber>其中额外添加的三氯生起了两种有效的作用
<33-1,Treiber>The additional triclosan does two things well:

749
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,830
<33-2,Chase>杀灭耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌
<33-2,Chase>Kills MRSA

750
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,560
<33-2,Chase>还有搞乱你的甲状腺
<33-2,Chase>and makes your thyroid look stupid.

751
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,760
<33-2,Chase>甲状腺误以为三氯是一种真正的荷尔蒙
<33-2,Chase>It thinks the triclosan is a real hormone

752
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,780
<33-2,Chase>然后关闭
<33-2,Chase>and closes up shop.

753
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,570
<33-2,Chase>长期超量使用
<33-2,Chase>Excessive use over time

754
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,020
<33-2,Chase>加上长期过量饮用这个
<33-2,Chase>combined with excessive use of this

755
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,700
<33-2,Chase>导致了甲状腺功能减退
<33-2,Chase>led to hypothyroidism.

756
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,540
<33-2,Chase>直到表现为精神异常才被诊断
<33-2,Chase>Which went undiagnosed until it presented with psychosis.

757
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,840
<33-2,Chase>急诊使用的镇静剂
<33-2,Chase>When the ER put you on the sedatives,

758
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,930
<33-2,Chase>导致你发生粘液性水肿
<33-2,Chase>it kicked you into myxedema crisis.

759
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,670
<33-3,Treiber>我还真没想过还有这种可能
<33-3,Treiber>Don't know that I ever would've thought of that.

760
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,920
<33-4,Chase>豪斯说生活充满讽刺
<33-4,Chase>House told us to look for irony.

761
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,150
<33-5,Treiber>救我的不是豪斯
<33-5,Treiber>This wasn't House.

762
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,860
<34-1,Chase>我的储物柜钥匙
<34-1,Chase>My locker key.

763
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,270
<34-2,Foreman>我会给你独立团队
<34-2,Foreman>I'll give you your own team.

764
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,090
<34-3,Chase>谢谢
<34-3,Chase>Thanks.

765
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,230
<34-3,Chase>到了我该走出阴影的时候
<34-3,Chase>But it's time to step out of the shadow.

767
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,560
<34-4,Foreman>是时候了
<34-4,Foreman>It's about time.

768
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,610
<34-4,Foreman>有消息吗
<34-4,Foreman>Any news?

769
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,550
<35-1,Chase>还没有
<35-1,Chase>Not yet.

770
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,470
<35-2,House>你来是让我劝你留下吗
<35-2,House>You come here so I could talk you out of it?

771
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,720
<35-3,Chase>我来谢你
<35-3,Chase>I came to say thank you.

772
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,890
<35-4,House>相处甚欢
<35-4,House>It's been fun.

773
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,440
<35-5,Chase>甚欢
<35-5,Chase>Fun?

774
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
<35-6,House>比"我们走过风风雨雨"
<35-6,House>Sounded pithier than...

775
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,170
<35-6,House>简练多了
<35-6,House>"We've shared a variety of situations."

776
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,660
<35-6,House>威尔森有消息告诉我
<35-6,House>Let me know about Wilson.

777
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,300
<35-7,Wilson>为什么放他走
<35-7,Wilson>Why did you let him go?

778
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,860
<35-8,House>宪法第十三修正案
<35-8,House>Legal loophole. 13th Amendment.

779
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,610
<35-8,House>亚伯拉罕·林肯戴帽子确实很有型
<35-8,House>Abraham Lincoln may have looked great in that hat,

780
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,100
<35-8,House>可他的劳工政策...
<35-8,House>but his labor policies...

781
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,710
<35-8,House>豪斯
<35-8,House>House.
