22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,490

<1-7,Lady>We do not provide child care.

23

<1-7,Lady>我很希望能帮上忙

<1-11,Lady>Did they tell you why?

37
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,610
<1-12,Lady>你知道吗
<1-12,Lady>Well, you know what?

38
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,540
<1-12,Lady>有时  你和那份工作没缘分  但是
<1-12,Lady>Sometimes, you just don't get the job, but...

39
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,210

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,650

<1-16,Lady>Oh, my God.

44
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,050
<1-17,Lady>来人啊  叫救护车
<1-17,Lady>Somebody call an ambulance!

67
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,050
<1-18,Park>我看你理发是为了什么
<1-18,Park>Why am I watching you cut your hair?

68
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,580
<1-19,House>如果我在家弄
<1-19,House>If I do it at home,

69
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,620
<1-19,House>就得我自己打扫
<1-19,House>I'm the one who has to clean it up.

70
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,150
<1-20,Park>有朋友在看你自己理发时感到好奇的吗
<1-20,Park>Does a friend watch you where it's happening, and wonder why?

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,370
<1-21,House>新生活  新面貌
<1-21,House>New life, new look.

72
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,430
<1-22,Park>那是不是意味着  你喜欢你的新生活
<1-22,Park>Does that mean you like your new life?

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,600
<1-23,House>如果你是问你会不会丢掉工作
<1-23,House>If you're asking if your job is safe,

74
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,690
<1-23,House>那得看你对你手中的病例有何说法
<1-23,House>that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.

75
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,390
<1-24,Park>看起来不太像是疑难杂症
<1-24,Park>It doesn't seem like much of a case.

76
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,190
<1-24,Park>尽管  我肯定是错的
<1-24,Park>Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.

77
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,240
<1-25,House>确实  告诉我为什么
<1-25,House>You are. Tell my why.

78
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,690
<1-26,Park>这家伙没吃早饭  在大热天
<1-26,Park>Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours

79
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,850
<1-26,Park>徒步数小时后晕倒
<1-26,Park>on a hot day without breakfast...

80
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,320
<1-26,Park>还真是匪夷所思
<1-26,Park>So that's really weird.

81
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,150
<1-27,House>急症室没发现什么问题
<1-27,House>E.R. found nothing wrong.

82
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,920
<1-27,House>然后我决定  我该检查下他的钱包
<1-27,House>Then I decided I should test his wallet.

83
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,250
<1-28,Park>他很有钱
<1-28,Park>He's rich?

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,490
<1-28,Park>那就是我们接这病例的原因吗
<1-28,Park>That's why we're taking the case?

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,110
<1-29,House>不  我们接这病例是因为没人知道
<1-29,House>No, we're taking the case because no one knows

86
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,300
<1-29,House>他得了什么病
<1-29,House>what's wrong with him.

87
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,250
<1-29,House>外加他很有钱
<1-29,House>And he's rich.

88
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,920
<1-30,House>亚当斯医生
<1-30,House>Dr. Adams.

89
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,580
<1-30,House>给她病历
<1-30,House>Give her the file.

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,430
<1-31,Park>我只有这一份
<1-31,Park>This is my only copy.

91
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,280
<1-32,House>我的工作方式依赖于一个团队
<1-32,House>My M.O. depends upon the use of a team.

92
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,180
<1-32,House>当然  那就需要
<1-32,House>Definitionally, that involves...

93
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,650
<1-32,House>不止一个人
<1-32,House>more than one person.

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
<1-32,House>所以我别无选择  给她病历
<1-32,House>So I really have no choice. Give her the file.

95
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,390
<1-33,Park>你雇不起一个团队
<1-33,Park>You can't afford a team.

96
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,860
<1-34,House>亚当斯是免费的[有空]
<1-34,House>Adams is free.

97
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,960
<1-34,House>我说的是她既有空
<1-34,House>And I'm referring both to her availability

98
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,030
<1-34,House>又不花钱
<1-34,House>and her price tag.

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,260
<1-34,House>新来的  见见早来的  反之亦然
<1-34,House>New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.

100
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
<1-35,Adams>你说的是  我们喝杯咖啡
<1-35,Adams>You said we were meeting for coffee.

101
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,790
<1-36,House>当有人邀请你喝咖啡
<1-36,House>Well, when someone asks if you want coffee,

102
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,090
<1-36,House>很明显  是有潜台词的
<1-36,House>they obviously don't just mean coffee.

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,680
<1-36,House>等等  你不会以为我指做爱吧
<1-36,House>Wait...did you think I was referring to sex?

104
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,650
<1-36,House>出去时能拉上百叶窗吗
<1-36,House>Would you shut the blinds on your way out?

105
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,050
<1-37,Adams>我以为你是想谈谈
<1-37,Adams>I thought you were referring to talking.

106
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,510
<1-38,House>聊医学
<1-38,House>Talking about medicine.

107
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,720
<1-38,House>准确说来  咱们来聊聊
<1-38,House>Specifically, as it refers to the guy

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,890
<1-38,House>那份病历上的病人  而她到现在还没给你
<1-38,House>whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.

109
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,320
<1-39,Adams>我不干  豪斯
<1-39,Adams>I'm not working, House.

110
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,620
<1-39,Adams>我在找一份有薪酬的工作
<1-39,Adams>I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.

111
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,090
<1-40,House>同时  像你这样
<1-40,House>In the meantime, there's no way

112
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,800
<1-40,House>爱做好事的人  肯定不会
<1-40,House>a do-gooder like you has been volunteering

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
<1-40,House>满大街跑
<1-40,House>all over town--

114
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,660
<1-40,House>到处喂猫施舍吧
<1-40,House>ladling kittens, spaying soup...

115
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,930
<1-41,Adams>在特伦顿有家免费诊所
<1-41,Adams>There is a free clinic in Trenton.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,640
<1-42,House>今天把这看成免费诊所吧
<1-42,House>Well, think of this as today's free clinic.

117
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,100
<1-42,House>只不过得疱疹的流浪汉少点
<1-42,House>Only with fewer bums with herpes.

118
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,510
<1-43,Park>我觉得我们手上这个不算病例
<1-43,Park>I don't think we actually have much of a case.

119
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,060
<1-43,Park>我认为不过是脱水
<1-43,Park>I think it's just dehydration.

120
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,810
<1-44,House>上次另一个医生
<1-44,House>What happened the last time

121
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,310
<1-44,House>告诉你我判断有误时  结果如何
<1-44,House>another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?

122
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,890
<1-45,Adams>我丢了工作
<1-45,Adams>I lost my job.

123
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,850
<1-46,House>你救了一条命
<1-46,House>You saved a life.

124
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,170
<1-46,House>有必要做B超检查吗
<1-46,House>Is an ultrasound really necessary?

125
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,910
<2-1,Benjamin>我现在感觉好多了
<2-1,Benjamin>I'm feeling much better now.

126
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,180
<2-2,Adams>你这年纪突然晕倒
<2-2,Adams>Oh, a sudden collapse at your age

127
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,640
<2-2,Adams>可能是心肌退变
<2-2,Adams>can indicate a deterioration of the heart muscle.

128
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,430
<2-2,Adams>很严重的病
<2-2,Adams>Pretty serious condition.

129
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,270
<2-3,Park>也可能只是脱水
<2-3,Park>It can also just be dehydration.

130
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,900
<2-3,Park>下次  你其实不必布衣打扮
<2-3,Park>Next time, you could probably drop the undercover act.

131
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,270
<2-4,Benjamin>我要是西装革履走进去
<2-4,Benjamin>I walk in in a suit,

132
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,510
<2-4,Benjamin>他们会全力表现出最好的一面
<2-4,Benjamin>and they're gonna put their best foot forward.

133
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,480
<2-4,Benjamin>再说  我也没有西装
<2-4,Benjamin>Also, I don't own a suit.

134
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,680
<2-5,Adams>你捐了百万美金  自己却连西装也没有
<2-5,Adams>You give away millions and you don't own a suit?

135
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,310
<2-6,Benjamin>也都捐掉了
<2-6,Benjamin>I gave those away too.

136
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,120
<2-6,Benjamin>有一天  我给庭院设计师开支票
<2-6,Benjamin>One day, I was writing a check to my landscaper,

137
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,690
<2-6,Benjamin>突然有了觉悟
<2-6,Benjamin>and it suddenly hit me--

138
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,520
<2-6,Benjamin>六千美金就为挪走花草  种批新的
<2-6,Benjamin>$6,000 to take out plants and put in different plants.

139
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,320
<2-6,Benjamin>这样我就能享眼福了
<2-6,Benjamin>So I can look at them.

140
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,260
<2-6,Benjamin>难道不该把钱花到更有意义的事上吗
<2-6,Benjamin>Shouldn't I use that money to do something important?

141
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,430
<2-7,Adams>你提到钱
<2-7,Adams>And by money,

142
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,530
<2-7,Adams>你指的是你所有的钱啊
<2-7,Adams>you mean all your money.

143
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
<2-8,Benjamin>我一开始捐一千万
<2-8,Benjamin>I started with 10 million,

144
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,200
<2-8,Benjamin>随后一想何不捐两千万呢
<2-8,Benjamin>and I couldn't think of a reason not to give 20,

145
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,980
<2-8,Benjamin>或四千万
<2-8,Benjamin>or 40.

146
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,860
<2-8,Benjamin>我想我一年两万五就够花了
<2-8,Benjamin>I figure I could live off $25,000 a year.

147
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,590
<2-8,Benjamin>住单卧的公寓

149
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,230
<2-8,Benjamin>就买一些必需品

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
<2-8,Benjamin>软件公司依旧是我的
<2-8,Benjamin>I still have my software company,

151
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,510
<2-8,Benjamin>等我挣更多的钱  我会继续捐
<2-8,Benjamin>and when I make more, I'll give that way too.

152
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,740
<3-1,Park>-这家伙疯了  -他只是慷慨而已
<3-1,Park>- He's nuts. - He's generous.

153
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,250
<3-3,Park>他神经系统出了问题
<3-3,Park>There's a neurological issue.

154
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,360
<3-3,Park>要把所有东西都捐了
<3-3,Park>He's getting rid of everything.

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,500
<3-4,Adams>他的超声心动图显示他没有心肌病
<3-4,Adams>His echocardiogram is negative for cardiomyopathy.

<3-4,Adams>头部CT没有中风或颅内出血的迹象
<3-4,Adams>Head CT showed no signs of stroke or hemorrhage.

157
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,940
<3-5,Park>他只有一条裤子
<3-5,Park>He has one pair of pants.

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,490
<3-6,Adams>像他这么有钱的人  一般都会
<3-6,Adams>Most people with his kind of money

159
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,940
<3-6,Adams>把钱花在约克夏身上
<3-6,Adams>are commissioning oil paintings

161
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,900
<3-6,Adams>给狗也画幅肖像画
<3-6,Adams>of their Yorkshire Terrier.

162
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,380
<3-6,Adams>本杰明为了帮助别人
<3-6,Adams>Benjamin is sacrificing

163
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,910
<3-6,Adams>毅然牺牲了自己舒适的生活
<3-6,Adams>his own comfort to help others.

164
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,180
<3-7,House>因为对他来说帮助别人就是种享受
<3-7,House>That's because helping others is his yorkie oil painting.

165
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,750
<3-8,Adams>这是高尚的品质
<3-8,Adams>That's good.

166
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,860
<3-8,Adams>不是有病
<3-8,Adams>Not sick.

167
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,220
<3-9,Park>这就是病  太天真了
<3-9,Park>That's naive and sick.

168
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,350
<3-9,Park>你要是真的想改变世界
<3-9,Park>You really want to improve things?

169
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,790
<3-9,Park>还是得从政策上入手
<3-9,Park>You do it through policy.

170
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,520
<3-9,Park>这家伙把钱都捐了  世界能有什么变化呢
<3-9,Park>This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?

171
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,570
<3-10,House>这也对  那些患艾滋病的儿童
<3-10,House>That's right, all those babies with AIDS,

172
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,790
<3-10,House>他们只是在利用我们
<3-10,House>they're just using us.

173
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,910
<3-11,Park>我父母刚到这里时身上只有八百块
<3-11,Park>My parents had $800 between them when they got here.

174
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,130
<3-11,Park>他们节衣缩食  东挪西借
<3-11,Park>They scraped and borrowed,

175
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,130
<3-11,Park>以供我们上好学校
<3-11,Park>so we could go to good schools,

176
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,050
<3-11,Park>而我卖命地工作学习
<3-11,Park>and I worked my ass off.

177
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,600
<3-11,Park>从来没人伸手帮过我
<3-11,Park>No one gave me a handout.

178
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,560
<3-11,Park>这鞭策我更加努力
<3-11,Park>It makes me work harder.

179
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,500
<3-12,House>我不同意
<3-12,House>Rebuttal.

180
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,700
<3-13,Foreman>你又在打什么坏主意呢
<3-13,Foreman>What's your evil plan?

181
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,560
<3-14,House>我对你的官腔表示抗议
<3-14,House>I object to your cynicism.

182
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,700
<3-15,Foreman>这是我努力争来的职位
<3-15,Foreman>It's been earned.

183
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,110
<3-14,House>我就是要抗议这个
<3-14,House>That's what I object to.

184
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,190
<3-16,House>新院长应该有广阔的胸怀
<3-16,House>The new dean of medicine has an ethical obligation

185
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,730
<3-16,House>对每一名员工
<3-16,House>to come in with a completely open mind

186
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,970
<3-16,House>都有一颗包容的心
<3-16,House>about all employees.

187
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,130
<3-16,House>所以就让我随心所欲一下
<3-16,House>Thus letting me blithely run roughshod

188
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,560
<3-16,House>至少四个礼拜吧
<3-16,House>for at least four weeks.

189
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,640
<3-17,Foreman>我想你是打算给他安排一堆检查
<3-17,Foreman>My theory is that you're running a battery of tests

190
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,520
<3-17,Foreman>让他相信是你救了他的命  之后忽悠他
<3-17,Foreman>to convince him that you saved his life,

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,540
<3-17,Foreman>让他出资把你原来的团队都雇回来
<3-17,Foreman>then con him into funding you to hire back your team.

192
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,350
<3-18,House>你说啥
<3-18,House>What?

193
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,700
<3-19,Park>你以前的团队
<3-19,Park>Your old team?

194
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,940
<3-18,House>你说啥
<3-18,House>What?

195
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,230
<3-21,Foreman>接受现实吧
<3-21,Foreman>This is your new reality.

196
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,360
<3-21,Foreman>你有你自己的办公室
<3-21,Foreman>You've got your office.

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,430
<3-21,Foreman>现在还有邻居
<3-21,Foreman>You've got neighbors.

198
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,090
<3-21,Foreman>你手下有一名雇员  一名志愿者
<3-21,Foreman>You've got one employee, one volunteer.

199
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,810
<3-21,Foreman>直到她找到一份有工资的工作
<3-21,Foreman>until she finds actual paid work,

200
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,740
<3-21,Foreman>或者实在忍受不了你了
<3-21,Foreman>or gets sick of you.

201
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,430
<3-22,House>我和奇斯还有陶博谈过了
<3-22,House>I talked to Chase and Taub.

202
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,150
<3-22,House>他们愿意回来
<3-22,House>They're willing to come back.

203
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,860
<3-23,Foreman>那十三呢
<3-23,Foreman>What about Thirteen?

204
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,530
<3-24,House>她就算了吧
<3-24,House>Not a good choice.

205
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,540
<3-24,House>她活不长了  所以她不是长久之计
<3-24,House>She's not long term because she has no long term.

206
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,010
<3-25,Foreman>她不接你电话  是吧
<3-25,Foreman>Not taking your calls?

207
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,970
<3-26,House>她会接的
<3-26,House>She will.

208
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,370
<3-27,Foreman>让那病人出院
<3-27,Foreman>Discharge the patient.

209
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,270
<3-28,House>他的昏厥无法解释
<3-28,House>Unexplained loss of consciousness

210
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,910
<3-28,House>有可能是心肌病
<3-28,House>could be cardiomyopathy,

211
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,240
<3-28,House>大脑缺氧  蛛网膜下腔出血...
<3-28,House>global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage--

212
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,610
<3-28,House>或者就是脱水
<3-28,House>Dehydration.

213
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,040
<3-29,Foreman>他打过点滴了  而且已经好转了
<3-29,Foreman>He was given fluids, and he got better.

214
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,550
<3-29,Foreman>而且我敢说检查结果显示  他是健康的
<3-29,Foreman>And I'm sure your tests have come up negative

215
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,080
<3-29,Foreman>要不你早让我闭嘴了
<3-29,Foreman>or you would have shut me up already,

216
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,580
<3-29,Foreman>这就是说他可以回家了
<3-29,Foreman>which means he goes home.

217
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,420
<3-30,Park>还有一个病征
<3-30,Park>There is a symptom...

218
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,290
<3-30,Park>他极其慷慨
<3-30,Park>extreme altruism.

219
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,780
<3-31,Foreman>你现在有两条路  豪斯
<3-31,Foreman>You've got two choices, House.

220
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,400
<3-31,Foreman>你可以承认你的病人
<3-31,Foreman>You can recognize that your patient

221
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,950
<3-31,Foreman>是一个健康的好人
<3-31,Foreman>is just a very nice, healthy guy,

222
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,220
<3-32,House>然后送他回家
<3-32,House>and send him home,

223
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,990
<3-31,Foreman>或者你把慷慨当做一种病征
<3-31,Foreman>or you can consider altruism a symptom,

224
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,240
<3-31,Foreman>这样  你也不能要他的钱
<3-31,Foreman>in which case, you cannot take his money.

225
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,700
<3-32,House>让他出院吧
<3-32,House>Send him home,

226
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
<3-32,House>然后再查查
<3-32,House>and check with admitting

227
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,880
<3-32,House>所有新入院病人的身家
<3-32,House>for the net worth of all new patients.

228
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,760
<4-1,Thirteen>我不会回来的  豪斯
<4-1,Thirteen>I'm not coming back, House.

229
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,800
<4-2,House>严谨点说  你现在就已经回来了
<4-2,House>Technically, you're back right now.

230
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,160
<4-3,Thirteen>你别再给我打电话了
<4-3,Thirteen>I need you to stop calling me.

231
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,370
<4-3,Thirteen>头十七条留言挺感人的  但...
<4-3,Thirteen>First 17 messages were cute, but--

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
<4-4,House>我要重组咱们的团队
<4-4,House>I'm putting the band back together.

233
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,030
<4-5,Thirteen>鉴于你从来没有来过我家
<4-5,Thirteen>Interesting that you never showed up at my place,

234
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,330
<4-5,Thirteen>用诚挚的邀请来烦我
<4-5,Thirteen>what with your love of annoying me

235
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,720
<4-5,Thirteen>而且你不接受拒绝  这挺有意思
<4-5,Thirteen>and your inability to take no for an answer.

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,710
<4-5,Thirteen>我猜你脚踝上有追踪器
<4-5,Thirteen>I'm guessing ankle monitor.

237
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,540
<4-6,House>我罪有应得
<4-6,House>Guilty as charged,

238
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,080
<4-6,House>真的
<4-6,House>literally.

239
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,490
<4-7,Thirteen>我已经不是医生了  豪斯
<4-7,Thirteen>I'm not a doctor anymore, House.

240
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,180
<4-8,House>工作是没了  但不至于放弃这个职业啊
<4-8,House>The job went away, but not the profession.

241
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,870
<4-8,House>你看着挺健康的  那么...
<4-8,House>You look healthy, so...

242
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,810
<4-8,House>肯定不是身体原因
<4-8,House>that's not it.

243
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,710
<4-8,House>你有男朋友了
<4-8,House>You met a boy,

244
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,950
<4-8,House>或是女朋友
<4-8,House>or a girl.

245
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,680
<4-8,House>你们俩相爱  想过幸福的生活
<4-8,House>Fall in love, wanna be happy.

246
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,490
<4-8,House>你决定好好享受你剩下的时光
<4-8,House>You decided to... enjoy what time you have left.

247
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,020
<4-8,House>你要去泰国
<4-8,House>You're going to Thailand.

248
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,460
<4-9,Thirteen>是女朋友
<4-9,Thirteen>Girl.

249
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,380
<4-9,Thirteen>我们打算去米科诺斯
<4-9,Thirteen>And Mykonos.

251
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,110
<4-10,Thirteen>其实我喜欢平平淡淡的生活
<4-10,Thirteen>Turns out I like boring.

252
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,020
<4-11,House>不对  你是想过平淡的生活
<4-11,House>No, you wanna like boring.

253
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,530
<4-11,House>但如果你真的喜欢平淡的生活
<4-11,House>But if you actually liked boring,

254
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,900
<4-11,House>你在五年级时就应该知道了
<4-11,House>you would have figured that out in fifth grade,

255
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,150
<4-11,House>因为那时你就很平淡
<4-11,House>when you were bored.

256
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,970
<4-12,Thirteen>别再给我打电话了
<4-12,Thirteen>Please stop calling me.

257
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,490
<4-13,House>不
<4-13,House>No.

258
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,110
<4-14,House>你专程跑来
<4-14,House>You showed up

259
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,630
<4-14,House>告诉我  不想我再打扰你
<4-14,House>to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.

260
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,870
<4-14,House>你言行不一致啊
<4-14,House>That's a mixed signal.

261
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,670
<4-14,House>我更愿意相信你的行动
<4-14,House>I will choose to listen to your actions

262
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,570
<4-14,House>而不是你说的话
<4-14,House>rather than your words.

263
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
<4-14,House>行动不会撒谎
<4-14,House>They're more honest.

264
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,300
<5-1,Benjamin>我有点糊涂了
<5-1,Benjamin>I'm a little confused.

265
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,600
<5-2,Park>此项测试是用于检测你是否
<5-2,Park>The test is designed to determine if you're--

266
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,640
<5-3,Benjamin>不  我是奇怪即要给我做检测
<5-3,Benjamin>No, I mean your running a test

267
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,700
<5-3,Benjamin>却又要让我出院
<5-3,Benjamin>and discharging me.

268
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,770
<5-3,Benjamin>我到底是不是脱水呢
<5-3,Benjamin>Was I dehydrated or not?

269
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
<5-4,Adams>我觉得是的
<5-4,Adams>I think so.

270
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,080
<5-4,Adams>但是  出于安全考虑
<5-4,Adams>But, out of an abundance of caution,

271
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,480
<5-4,Adams>我的同事自愿为你
<5-4,Adams>my colleague has taken it upon herself

272
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,880
<5-4,Adams>多做一项检测
<5-4,Adams>to do one more test.

273
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,380
<5-5,Benjamin>好吧
<5-5,Benjamin>All right.

274
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,340
<5-6,Adams>你让我觉得有点害怕
<5-6,Adams>You scare me a little.

275
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,130
<5-7,Benjamin>为什么
<5-7,Benjamin>Why?

276
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,880
<5-8,Adams>我打算申请做
<5-8,Adams>I've been considering

277
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,410
<5-8,Adams>无国界医生
<5-8,Adams>applying to doctors without borders.

278
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,780
<5-8,Adams>去国外待一段时间
<5-8,Adams>Going overseas a while,

279
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,150
<5-8,Adams>对我来说这是很大的牺牲
<5-8,Adams>and that seems like a huge sacrifice.

280
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,480
<5-8,Adams>但...你
<5-8,Adams>But...you--

281
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,680
<5-9,Park>你不是让她害怕
<5-9,Park>You don't scare her.

282
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,150
<5-9,Park>你让她心有愧疚
<5-9,Park>You make her feel guilty.

283
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,290
<5-10,Benjamin>你
<5-10,Benjamin>Oh, you...

284
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,190
<5-10,Benjamin>你喜欢你的生活方式罢了
<5-10,Benjamin>you like your life that way it is.

285
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,960
<5-10,Benjamin>大多数人会尽不放弃身外之物
<5-10,Benjamin>Most people give the minimum they have to give

286
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,830
<5-10,Benjamin>以便能享受到更多
<5-10,Benjamin>so they can enjoy what they have left.

287
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,160
<5-10,Benjamin>我想我的捐赠底线
<5-10,Benjamin>I guess my minimum is just...

288
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,510
<5-10,Benjamin>比大多数人高很多吧
<5-10,Benjamin>higher than most.

289
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,930
<5-11,Park>募集反应相和干扰相均正常
<5-11,Park>Complete recruitment and interference pattern.

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
<5-11,Park>他的腿部肌肉没问题
<5-11,Park>His leg muscles are fine.

291
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,100
<5-12,Benjamin>我觉得有点不舒服
<5-12,Benjamin>I feel, uh, funny.

292
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,170
<5-13,Adams>哪里
<5-13,Adams>Where?

293
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,370
<5-14,Benjamin>胸口
<5-14,Benjamin>My chest.

294
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,540
<5-15,Park>你心动过速
<5-15,Park>You're tachycardic.

295
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,260
<5-15,Park>你心跳太快了
<5-15,Park>Your heart's beating too fast.

296
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,690
<5-16,Adams>不可思议
<5-16,Adams>Unbelievable.

297
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,730
<6-1,Park>病人心动过速  185跳/分
<6-1,Park>Patient got tachycardic to 185.

298
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,400
<6-1,Park>我们给他静脉推注了18毫克腺苷
<6-1,Park>We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine.

299
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,680
<6-1,Park>他身体肯定有问题
<6-1,Park>There's definitely something wrong with him.

300
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,800
<6-2,House>太好了
<6-2,House>Which is awesome.

301
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,800
<6-2,House>有病症要医治
<6-2,House>Now there's something to cure,

302
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,270
<6-2,House>也就意味着我们能得到
<6-2,House>which means there's something to be

303
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,940
<6-2,House>不成比例的经济回报
<6-2,House>disproportionately financially grateful for.

304
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,340
<6-3,Adams>早安
<6-3,Adams>Morning.

305
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,260
<6-3,Adams>给你买咖啡了
<6-3,Adams>Got you a coffee.

306
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,340
<6-4,Park>谢谢你
<6-4,Park>Thanks.

307
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,160
<6-5,House>心律失常很可能是
<6-5,House>Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse

308
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,150
<6-5,House>造成这位"圣父"晕倒的最初原因
<6-5,House>that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.

309
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,670
<6-6,Adams>没事  我请客
<6-6,Adams>Oh, that's fine. Keep it.

310
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,940
<6-7,Adams>我们昨天检查过他的心脏
<6-7,Adams>We looked at his heart yesterday,

311
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,640
<6-7,Adams>并没有发现任何结构异常
<6-7,Adams>didn't see any structural abnormalities.

312
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,940
<6-7,Adams>我在想是不是长QT间期综合征呢
<6-7,Adams>I'm thinking Occult long QT syndrome?

313
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,140
<6-8,Park>会不会是惠普尔综合征呢
<6-8,Park>What about Whipple's?

314
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,380
<6-9,House>若是惠普尔综合征
<6-9,House>If it was Whipple's,

315
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
<6-9,House>那就应该会出现神经症状
<6-9,House>there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.

316
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,080
<6-10,Park>难道你觉得与人性相违背的行为不算吗
<6-10,Park>You don't think defying human nature is neurological?

317
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,080
<6-11,House>心动过速  医学症状
<6-11,House>Racing heart: medical condition.

318
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,880
<6-11,House>滴血的心脏  愚蠢的象征
<6-11,House>Bleeding heart: stupid condition.

319
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,620
<6-12,Park>你这么说是因为你是这么认为的
<6-12,Park>Are you saying that because you believe it,

320
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,620
<6-12,Park>还是因为认为他的慷慨并非一时兴起
<6-12,Park>or because it's in your financial best interest

321
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,960
<6-12,Park>有助于你骗取他的钱财呢
<6-12,Park>to think his generosity isn't just temporary?

322
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,860
<6-13,House>有人告诉我  有些人就是好人
<6-13,House>I'm told that some people are just nice.

323
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,430
<6-13,House>我在试着接受这一真理
<6-13,House>I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.

324
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,260
<6-14,Adams>过去的几周里
<6-14,Adams>Benjamin's been taking allergy medication

325
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,430
<6-14,Adams>本杰明在服用抗过敏药
<6-14,Adams>the last few weeks.

326
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,730
<6-14,Adams>长QT间期综合征可能是由药物导致的
<6-14,Adams>Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.

327
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,090
<6-15,House>给他用大剂量补液  以清除体内抗组胺药物
<6-15,House>Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines,

328
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,190
<6-15,House>然后做心电图
<6-15,House>then do an EKG.

329
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,290
<6-15,House>等等  我去做冲洗吧
<6-15,House>No, wait. I'll do the flushing.

330
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,430
<6-15,House>收下那两美元
<6-15,House>Take the damn $2.00.

331
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,800
<6-15,House>那杯咖啡她连一口都没有碰
<6-15,House>She hasn't even sipped the coffee.

332
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,700
<7-1,House>我非常生气  你知道吗
<7-1,House>I just got so angry. You know?

333
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,670
<7-1,House>我犯了个严重的错误
<7-1,House>So I made a terrible mistake.

334
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,470
<7-1,House>现在我试着开始新的生活
<7-1,House>Now I'm trying to start my life over.

335
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,810
<7-1,House>像我一直希望的那样  去帮助他人
<7-1,House>To help people the way I always wanted.

336
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
<7-1,House>但我的部门预算被缩减
<7-1,House>But my department got defunded, and...

337
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,990
<7-1,House>错在我
<7-1,House>it's my fault.

338
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,950
<7-1,House>因为我没有资源来发挥自己的特长
<7-1,House>Just can't stand to think of all those patients

339
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,860
<7-1,House>而使得那些病人无法获得救治
<7-1,House>going untreated because I don't have the resources

340
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,620
<7-1,House>这让我难以忍受
<7-1,House>to do my best work.

341
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,730
<7-2,Benjamin>我来帮你怎样
<7-2,Benjamin>How about I help you out?

342
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,800
<7-3,House>你什么意思
<7-3,House>How do you mean?

343
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,030
<7-4,Benjamin>我会给医院捐赠一百万美元
<7-4,Benjamin>I'll give $1 million as an endowment to the hospital,

344
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,770
<7-4,Benjamin>并注明是捐赠给诊断科的
<7-4,Benjamin>earmarked for diagnostics.

345
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,840
<7-5,House>我这个投机主义前科犯
<7-5,House>I am an opportunistic ex-con

346
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,380
<7-5,House>才给你讲了两分钟我的悲催经历
<7-5,House>who just gave you a two-minute sob story

347
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,010
<7-5,House>这才是我伟大计划的第三步
<7-5,House>as step three in my master plan,

348
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,860
<7-5,House>你就答应要给我一百万美元了
<7-5,House>and you've offered me $1 million,

349
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,690
<7-5,House>都已经是第十七步了
<7-5,House>which is step 17.

350
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,790
<7-6,Benjamin>这样不好吗
<7-6,Benjamin>Is that bad?

351
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,790
<7-7,House>我从来不是个遵循道义的人
<7-7,House>Ethics are not my strong suit.

352
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,400
<8-1,House>假设
<8-1,House>Hypothetical--

353
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,860
<8-1,House>如果一个性欲狂要为我口交
<8-1,House>If I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic,

354
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,370
<8-1,House>我要拒绝吗
<8-1,House>do I have to decline?

355
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,980
<8-1,House>先别回答
<8-1,House>Don't answer yet.

356
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,520
<8-1,House>拒绝的话  我们俩都痛苦
<8-1,House>Saying no will cause both of us pain.

357
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,620
<8-1,House>答应的话  我们俩都欲仙欲死
<8-1,House>Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.

358
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,060
<8-2,Wilson>你不能利用性欲狂获得性
<8-2,Wilson>You can't take sex from a sexaholic.

359
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,030
<8-2,Wilson>你不能给酗酒者提供酒
<8-2,Wilson>You can't give booze to an alcoholic,

360
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,890
<8-2,Wilson>你也不能接受这家伙的钱
<8-2,Wilson>and you can't take this guy's money.

361
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,160
<8-3,House>可能症状诊断错了
<8-3,House>Could be wrong about the symptom.

362
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,760
<8-3,House>我一直在犯错
<8-3,House>I'm wrong all the time.

363
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,960
<8-4,Wilson>接受病患的钱
<8-4,Wilson>Taking money from a sick person

364
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,300
<8-4,Wilson>从道义上来说是说不过去的
<8-4,Wilson>is ethically suspect at best.

365
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,640
<8-5,House>难道我们在加拿大吗
<8-5,House>What is this, Canada?

366
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,870
<8-5,House>我们的所作所为就是赚病人的钱
<8-5,House>All we do is take money from sick people.

367
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,840
<8-6,Wilson>我们为此工作
<8-6,Wilson>We work for it.

368
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,170
<8-7,House>我就是在工作啊
<8-7,House>I'm working!

369
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,470
<8-8,Wilson>多少钱
<8-8,Wilson>How much?

370
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,810
<8-9,House>二十美元
<8-9,House>$20.

371
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,050
<8-9,House>如果真的是二十呢
<8-9,House>Well, what if it was?

372
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,650
<8-9,House>原则是一样的啊
<8-9,House>It's the same principle.

373
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,780
<8-9,House>二十还是一百万有什么差别呢
<8-9,House>$20, $1 million... what's the difference?

374
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,490
<8-10,Wilson>实际上  差别就有一百万那么大
<8-10,Wilson>Actually, the difference is pretty much $1 million.

375
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,420
<8-11,House>是他开的价  不是我
<8-11,House>He came up with the figure, not me.

376
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,910
<8-12,Wilson>糟糕
<8-12,Wilson>Crap.

377
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,740
<8-12,Wilson>我有个终末期肾衰病人
<8-12,Wilson>Got a patient with end stage renal disease.

378
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,100
<8-12,Wilson>她的心脏承受不了透析
<8-12,Wilson>Her heart can't support dialysis.

379
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,260
<8-12,Wilson>她需要移植  但是
<8-12,Wilson>She needs a transplant, but...

380
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,070
<8-12,Wilson>只要谈论与你无关的事  你就神游了
<8-12,Wilson>you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you,

381
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,400
<8-12,Wilson>是吧
<8-12,Wilson>didn't you?

382
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,900
<8-14,Wilson>-什么  -我要走了
<8-14,Wilson>- What? - I gotta go.

383
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,340
<8-15,House>都是悬而未决啊
<8-15,House>It's all moot.

384
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,310
<8-15,House>病人可能患有长QT间期综合征
<8-15,House>Patient probably has long QT.

385
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,380
<8-15,House>也可能他就是个很热心肠的人
<8-15,House>Probably just a really, really decent person.

386
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
<8-15,House>这样的人是存在的吧
<8-15,House>They exist, right?

387
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,010
<8-15,House>你不能接受这钱  豪斯
<8-15,House>You can't take the money, House.

388
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,450
<9-1,Benjamin>长QT间期综合征不好吗
<9-1,Benjamin>Is long QT bad?

389
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,390
<9-2,Park>这种病很难控制
<9-2,Park>It's a tough thing to control.

390
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,520
<9-2,Park>要我帮你打电话给什么人吗
<9-2,Park>Is there someone you want me to call?

391
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,430
<9-3,Benjamin>我是有想找的人
<9-3,Benjamin>There's someone I would like to call.

392
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,930
<9-3,Benjamin>但她正好是不会理我的人
<9-3,Benjamin>She's the same person who won't take my calls.

393
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,760
<9-3,Benjamin>我妻子
<9-3,Benjamin>My wife.

394
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,350
<9-3,Benjamin>我开始捐献财产后
<9-3,Benjamin>When I started giving away the money, I--

395
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,890
<9-3,Benjamin>我曾希望她愿意跟我一起
<9-3,Benjamin>I hoped she'd want to do it with me.

396
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,090
<9-3,Benjamin>但她没有
<9-3,Benjamin>She didn't.

397
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,990
<9-3,Benjamin>我想他们
<9-3,Benjamin>I miss them.

398
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,000
<9-3,Benjamin>我有两个儿子
<9-3,Benjamin>I have two little boys.

399
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,340
<9-3,Benjamin>但即使有了家庭
<9-3,Benjamin>Having a family doesn't exempt me

400
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,770
<9-3,Benjamin>我也必须承担社会责任
<9-3,Benjamin>from social responsibility.

401
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,540
<9-4,Park>但家庭第一
<9-4,Park>But family comes first.

402
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,850
<9-5,Benjamin>没错
<9-5,Benjamin>It should.

403
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,480
<9-5,Benjamin>我知道这样说很怪  但...
<9-5,Benjamin>I know that sounds weird, but...

404
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,780
<9-5,Benjamin>你的亲人
<9-5,Benjamin>someone who's related to you,

405
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,280
<9-5,Benjamin>难道就比其他人特别吗
<9-5,Benjamin>does that empirically make them more special?

406
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,050
<9-5,Benjamin>难道就应该得到更多吗
<9-5,Benjamin>More deserving than anyone else?

407
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,690
<9-6,Park>是啊  家庭是你的责任
<9-6,Park>Yes, it gives you a responsibility.

408
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,090
<9-7,Benjamin>我儿子有地方住
<9-7,Benjamin>My boys have a roof over their heads.

409
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,660
<9-7,Benjamin>有东西吃
<9-7,Benjamin>They're not starving.

410
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,990
<9-7,Benjamin>我按法院要求  付子女抚养费
<9-7,Benjamin>I pay court-ordered child support,

411
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,900
<9-7,Benjamin>老实说这笔钱
<9-7,Benjamin>and, frankly, it's...

412
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,510
<9-7,Benjamin>远超他们生活所需
<9-7,Benjamin>more than they need.

413
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,470
<9-7,Benjamin>世上我最爱的就是他们
<9-7,Benjamin>I love them more than anything, I just...

414
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,840
<9-7,Benjamin>但供他们上私立学校  买游戏机
<9-7,Benjamin>I can't justify buying video games and private schools

415
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,620
<9-7,Benjamin>对其他挨饿的孩子来说太不公平
<9-7,Benjamin>when other people's children are starving.

416
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,700
<9-7,Benjamin>希望有一天  他们能理解
<9-7,Benjamin>I hope, one day, they'll understand that.

417
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,570
<9-8,Park>你的手在颤抖
<9-8,Park>Your hands are trembling.

418
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,830
<9-9,Benjamin>是因为电极吗
<9-9,Benjamin>Is it the electrodes?

419
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,880
<9-10,Park>你痛不痛
<9-10,Park>Are you in pain?

420
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,440
<9-10,Park>不痛
<9-10,Park>No.

421
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,120
<9-11,Benjamin>怎么回事
<9-11,Benjamin>What's happening?

422
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,010
<9-12,Park>我不确定  但显然我们之前想错了
<9-12,Park>I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was.

423
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,070
<10-1,House>心律不齐
<10-1,House>So...arrhythmia,

424
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,460
<10-1,House>昏厥  肌颤
<10-1,House>fainting, muscle tremors.

425
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,150
<10-1,House>加上  不幸的  精神改变
<10-1,House>Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.

426
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,100
<10-2,Adams>我还是认为不是神经问题
<10-2,Adams>I still don't think it's neurological.

427
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,070
<10-3,House>上帝保佑你
<10-3,House>God bless you.

428
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,570
<10-4,Park>他失去了妻子和孩子
<10-4,Park>He lost his wife and kids

429
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
<10-4,Park>因为他不肯停止捐赠
<10-4,Park>'cause he couldn't stop giving money away.

430
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,690
<10-5,Adams>他妻子离开是因为
<10-5,Adams>He lost his wife because she couldn't

431
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,900
<10-5,Adams>她无法接受不做阔太太的日子
<10-5,Adams>accept not being filthy rich.

432
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,370
<10-6,House>她也不喝那杯咖啡
<10-6,House>She's not drinking the coffee either.

433
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,240
<10-7,Park>喝  不喝
<10-7,Park>Drink it, don't drink it.

434
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,800
<10-7,Park>重点是  我已经给你了
<10-7,Park>The point is, I gave it to you,

435
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,140
<10-7,Park>所以我们扯平
<10-7,Park>So we're even.

436
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,440
<10-7,Park>扯平
<10-7,Park>Even?

437
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,710
<10-8,Adams>那只是份礼物
<10-8,Adams>It was a gift.

438
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,980
<10-8,Adams>意思意思而已
<10-8,Adams>An insignificant token.

439
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,380
<10-8,Adams>没什么欠不欠的
<10-8,Adams>There was nothing owed.

440
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,010
<10-8,Adams>这就是重点
<10-8,Adams>That was the whole point.

441
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,010
<10-9,Park>为什么
<10-9,Park>Why?

442
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,720
<10-10,Adams>为什么
<10-10,Adams>Why?

443
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,230
<10-11,House>对  为什么
<10-11,House>Yeah, why?

444
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,640
<10-12,Adams>她才是不正常的那个
<10-12,Adams>She's the crazy one.

445
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,810
<10-13,Park>把所有东西都捐出去的人  是圣人
<10-13,Park>So a guy gives everything away to strangers: sane.

446
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,140
<10-13,Park>不接受陌生人东西的女孩  是疯子
<10-13,Park>Girl who doesn't want anything from a stranger is crazy.

447
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,620
<10-14,Adams>你不是陌生人
<10-14,Adams>You're not a stranger.

448
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,320
<10-14,Adams>你这种消极的世界观
<10-14,Adams>And your perverse view of the world

449
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,090
<10-14,Adams>导致你硬要把
<10-14,Adams>is making you force a neurological component

450
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,190
<10-14,Adams>明显的心脏病症说成神经问题...
<10-14,Adams>onto an obviously cardiological--

451
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,620
<10-15,House>你父母不够爱你
<10-15,House>Your parents didn't love you enough.

452
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,290
<10-15,House>所以你想证明你高人一等
<10-15,House>So you need to prove your superiority.

453
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
<10-15,House>或者他们太溺爱你
<10-15,House>Or they love you too much,

454
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,630
<10-15,House>所以你想表现你很谦卑
<10-15,House>So you need to prove your humility.

455
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,870
<10-15,House>或只是富人的内疚感
<10-15,House>Or it's just rich guilt.

456
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,130
<10-15,House>我押最后一个
<10-15,House>I'm betting on the last one.

457
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,790
<10-16,Adams>有一大堆的药物
<10-16,Adams>There's a whole list of drugs

458
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,170
<10-16,Adams>可能引起他的症状
<10-16,Adams>that could have caused his symptoms.

459
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,940
<10-17,House>我怀疑他是否会花钱买药
<10-17,House>I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs

460
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,280
<10-17,House>还有那么多孤儿没电视看呢
<10-17,House>when there are orphans out there without cable.

461
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,780
<10-18,Park>总之  他现在已经有所好转
<10-18,Park>Anyway, he'd be getting better right now,

462
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,950
<10-18,Park>没有恶化
<10-18,Park>not worse.

463
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,080
<10-18,Park>可能是结节性多动脉炎
<10-18,Park>Could be polyarteritis nodosa.

464
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,580
<10-19,Adams>那会出皮疹
<10-19,Adams>That comes with a rash.

465
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,890
<10-19,Adams>埃可病毒
<10-19,Adams>Echovirus.

466
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,350
<10-20,House>可病毒 病毒 毒
<10-20,House>Virus, virus, virus, virus...

467
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,650
<10-21,Adams>和他身体症状相符
<10-21,Adams>Fits his physical symptoms.

468
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,250
<10-21,Adams>而且可能
<10-21,Adams>And could,

469
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,830
<10-21,Adams>但不一定会引起人格改变
<10-21,Adams>but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes.

470
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,060
<10-21,Adams>都同意吗
<10-21,Adams>Works for everyone?

471
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,660
<10-21,Adams>开始抗病毒治疗
<10-21,Adams>Start him on antivirals.

472
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,690
<10-22,House>亚当斯
<10-22,House>And, Adams...

473
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,850
<10-22,House>如果你给他治病
<10-22,House>when you treat,

474
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,320
<10-22,House>把他治好了
<10-22,House>and he gets better,

475
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,660
<10-22,House>就变身为万恶的资本家
<10-22,House>and doesn't give Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off,

476
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,890
<10-22,House>你就欠我一杯咖啡
<10-22,House>you owe me a coffee.

477
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,450
<11-1,Thirteen>点左边第三个标签
<11-1,Thirteen>Click the third tab from the left

478
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,800

<11-1,Thirteen>and find the box that says "previous entries."

479
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,700
<11-1,Thirteen>会展开按病人姓名和部门排序的
<11-1,Thirteen>You get a drop-down menu sorted by patient name

480
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,990
<11-1,Thirteen>下拉菜单
<11-1,Thirteen>and department.

481
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,500
<11-1,Thirteen>谢谢
<11-1,Thirteen>Thank you.

482
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,360
<11-2,House>感谢你的帮助
<11-2,House>Appreciate your help.

483
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,040
<11-3,Thirteen>我这么帮你  你又要想多了吧
<11-3,Thirteen>You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?

484
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,140
<11-4,House>不  完全不会
<11-4,House>No, not at all.

485
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,580
<11-5,Thirteen>我们就到底什么算"想多"
<11-5,Thirteen>We're gonna fundamentally disagree

486
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,310
<11-5,Thirteen>有着完全不同的定义
<11-5,Thirteen>about what it means to read too much into this,

487
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,280
<11-5,Thirteen>不是吗
<11-5,Thirteen>aren't we?

488
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,590
<11-6,House>完全正确
<11-6,House>Yes, absolutely.

489
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,650
<11-7,Thirteen>我想过你说的话
<11-7,Thirteen>Look, I thought about what you said,

490
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,270
<11-7,Thirteen>我觉得你是对的
<11-7,Thirteen>and I realized you were right.

491
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,320
<11-8,House>很好  明早见
<11-8,House>Great. See you tomorrow morning.

492
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,720
<11-9,Thirteen>不  不会
<11-9,Thirteen>No, you won't.

493
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,610
<11-10,House>下午见吗
<11-10,House>Afternoon?

494
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,540
<11-10,House>我想不出其它意思了
<11-10,House>I can't think of another interpretation.

495
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,440
<11-10,House>闭嘴
<11-10,House>Shut up.

496
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,730
<11-11,Thirteen>我不能确定
<11-11,Thirteen>Look, I'm not sure

497
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,900
<11-11,Thirteen>你到底想要干什么
<11-11,Thirteen>what you were trying to achieve.

498
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,030
<11-11,Thirteen>我从来没确定过
<11-11,Thirteen>I'm never quite sure.

499
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,430
<11-11,Thirteen>但在我需要帮助时
<11-11,Thirteen>But you were actually a friend to me

500
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,570
<11-11,Thirteen>你算得上是我朋友
<11-11,Thirteen>when I needed it.

501
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,500
<11-11,Thirteen>我不想回来为你工作
<11-11,Thirteen>I don't wanna come back to work for you.

502
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,160
<11-11,Thirteen>但我不应该和你断绝联系
<11-11,Thirteen>But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.

503
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,910
<11-12,House>电脑出现蓝屏了
<11-12,House>Everything has gone blue.

504
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,210
<11-12,House>这不是正常现象吧
<11-12,House>That's not supposed to happen, right?

505
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,250
<11-13,Thirteen>等着别动  我来了
<11-13,Thirteen>Stay there. I'm comin'.

506
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,970
<11-14,House>不  你不用来的
<11-14,House>No...you don't have to do that.

507
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,590
<11-14,House>不过  如果你要来
<11-14,House>Although, if you did come,

508
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,420
<11-14,House>也许你可以去下湖南天堂
<11-14,House>maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace

509
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,140
<11-14,House>给我带点捞面和四川牛肉
<11-14,House>and get some Lo Mein and a Szechuan Beef.

510
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,040
<11-15,Thirteen>那离我家有六英里
<11-15,Thirteen>That is six miles out of my way.

511
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,440
<11-16,House>那好吧
<11-16,House>Oh, okay, then.

512
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,440
<11-16,House>看来我只好从医院食堂买吃的了
<11-16,House>Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria,

513
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,080
<11-16,House>也就是我吃每顿饭的地方
<11-16,House>which is where I get all my meals

514
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,610
<11-16,House>因为我哪儿也去不了
<11-16,House>since I can't go anywhere.

515
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,860
<11-16,House>好吧
<11-16,House>Fine.

516
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,700
<11-17,Thirteen>我会帮你带食物的
<11-17,Thirteen>I'll get the food.

517
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,580
<11-18,House>你真是个小可爱
<11-18,House>You're a peach.

518
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,740
<12-1,Park>我刚开始做最后一轮普来可那立治疗
<12-1,Park>I started the last round of pleconaril.

519
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,240
<12-2,Adams>你能帮我个忙吗
<12-2,Adams>Can you do me a favor?

520
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
<12-2,Adams>一个忙吗
<12-2,Adams>A favor?

521
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,430
<12-3,Park>你想让我把它们退回去吗
<12-3,Park>You want me to return these?

522
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,770
<12-3,Park>还是捐给别人
<12-3,Park>Give them to someone?

523
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,070
<12-3,Park>还是在你自慰的时候穿着它们
<12-3,Park>Wear them while you masturbate?

524
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,580
<12-4,Adams>我想把它们送给你
<12-4,Adams>I...want you to have them.

525
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,840
<12-5,Park>这可不是帮忙
<12-5,Park>That's not a favor.

526
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,050
<12-6,Adams>是买二送一的活动  我没忍住
<12-6,Adams>It was a two-for-one sale. I couldn't resist.

527
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,580
<12-6,Adams>我就是想找个借口买下来
<12-6,Adams>I need to justify buying them.

528
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,080
<12-7,Park>它们可值一百二十美刀呢
<12-7,Park>They're $120.

529
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,520
<12-7,Park>我的车还在商店里呢
<12-7,Park>My car is in the shop.

530
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,650
<12-7,Park>我这个月缺钱
<12-7,Park>I'm short on cash this month.

531
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,460
<12-7,Park>我承受不起
<12-7,Park>I can't pay you back.

532
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,010
<12-8,Adams>第一双是一百二十美刀
<12-8,Adams>The first pair were $120.

533
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,940
<12-8,Adams>这双免费
<12-8,Adams>These...were free.

534
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,150
<12-9,Park>你应该知道我揍了
<12-9,Park>You do know I punched

535
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,960
<12-9,Park>上一个招惹我的人吧
<12-9,Park>the last person that pissed me off?

536
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,620
<12-10,Adams>不会是圣诞老人吧
<12-10,Adams>Was it Santa?

537
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,100
<13-1,Wilson>你病人的状况怎么样了
<13-1,Wilson>What's your patient's status?

538
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,780
<13-2,House>好多了
<13-2,House>Better.

539
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,220
<13-2,House>我们正准备让他出院
<13-2,House>We're discharging him.

540
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,920
<13-3,Wilson>很好
<13-3,Wilson>Good.

541
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,120
<13-4,House>为什么你会在乎
<13-4,House>Why do you care?

542
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,260
<13-4,House>具体点说
<13-4,House>Specifically.

543
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,410
<13-4,House>虽然对笼统的回答我也感兴趣
<13-4,House>Although I'm curious about a general answer too.

544
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,580
<13-5,Wilson>你的病人刚签署捐赠肾脏的协议
<13-5,Wilson>Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney

545
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,290
<13-5,Wilson>捐献给我的肾衰竭病人
<13-5,Wilson>to my patient with renal failure.

546
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
<13-6,House>他见过你肾衰竭的病人吗
<13-6,House>Did he meet your patient with renal failure?

547
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,860
<13-7,Wilson>没有  他听见护士们在讨论
<13-7,Wilson>No, he heard the nurses talking about her,

548
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,320
<13-7,Wilson>说我的病人时日不多了
<13-7,Wilson>that she was short on time.

549
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,650
<13-8,House>我错了
<13-8,House>I was wrong.

550
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,800
<13-9,Wilson>别这么说
<13-9,Wilson>Don't say that.

551
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,170
<13-9,Wilson>豪斯  她真的需要这个肾脏
<13-9,Wilson>House, she really needs this kidney.

552
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,730
<13-10,House>他没有好转
<13-10,House>He's not better.

553
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,170
<13-10,House>他的精神状况在恶化
<13-10,House>His mental status is declining.

554
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,520
<13-11,Wilson>也可能他只是在为另一个人
<13-11,Wilson>Or he's doing an amazing thing

555
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,390
<13-11,Wilson>做一件伟大的事情
<13-11,Wilson>for another human being.

556
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,860
<13-12,House>我还以为这是个伦理常识呢
<13-12,House>I thought it was an ethical no-brainer

557
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,190
<13-12,House>我们不能从病人身上拿东西
<13-12,House>that we can't take stuff from sick people.

558
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,530
<13-13,Wilson>我改变主意了
<13-13,Wilson>I changed my mind.

559
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,180
<14-1,House>他还病着呢
<14-1,House>He's still sick.

560
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,650
<14-2,Wilson>他的症状已经消失了
<14-2,Wilson>His symptoms have gone away.

561
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,020
<14-3,House>不是所有症状
<14-3,House>Not all of them.

562
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,740
<14-3,House>为陌生人捐献器官
<14-3,House>Offering an organ to a stranger

563
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,070
<14-3,House>本身就是一种病的症状
<14-3,House>is a symptom.

564
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,190
<14-4,Wilson>一年有几十个人
<14-4,Wilson>A couple dozen people a year

565
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,780
<14-4,Wilson>进行不定向肾脏捐献
<14-4,Wilson>make undirected kidney donations.

566
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,360
<14-5,House>对  但他们中有多少
<14-5,House>Yeah, how many of them are also in the process

567
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,750
<14-5,House>在不断抛弃自己的财富呢
<14-5,House>of pauperizing themselves?

568
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,280
<14-6,Wilson>如果这哥们主动在战场牺牲
<14-6,Wilson>If the guy threw himself on a grenade,

569
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,450
<14-6,Wilson>他就会是个英雄
<14-6,Wilson>he'd be a hero.

570
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,420
<14-6,Wilson>这能拯救一条生命  你干嘛斤斤计较
<14-6,Wilson>If it saves a life, who cares?

571
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,750
<14-6,Wilson>是你斤斤计较
<14-6,Wilson>You do!

572
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,860
<14-7,House>昨天  你还持完全相反的意见
<14-7,House>Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument.

573
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,090
<14-7,House>只要我有一丝胜算
<14-7,House>If there's even a chance I'm right,

574
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,180
<14-7,House>那让他捐献肾脏就是很危险的
<14-7,House>it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.

575
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,910
<14-8,Wilson>比完全肾衰竭还危险吗
<14-8,Wilson>More dangerous than complete renal failure?

576
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,260
<14-8,Wilson>我的病人需要他的肾脏
<14-8,Wilson>My patient needs this.

577
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,430
<14-7,House>就是现在
<14-7,House>Now.

578
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,440
<14-6,Wilson>你为什么要捐献肾脏
<14-6,Wilson>Why do you wanna give away your kidney?

579
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,980
<14-6,Wilson>每一年这个国家里有七万人
<14-6,Wilson>There are 70,000 people in this country

580
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,320
<14-5,House>在肾脏移植的等待名单上焦急等待
<14-5,House>on the active waiting list for a kidney,

581
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,790
<14-4,Wilson>一年只有一万身亡的人
<14-4,Wilson>and less than 10,000 dead people a year

582
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,920
<14-6,Wilson>会捐献
<14-6,Wilson>to give them one.

583
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,230
<14-7,House>如果我们每年能杀掉六万多人
<14-7,House>If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year,

584
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,690
<14-9,House>世界将变成美好的人间
<14-9,House>all would be golden.

585
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,690
<14-10,Benjamin>我会给你捐款的
<14-10,Benjamin>I'll give you your money.

586
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,800
<14-11,House>看见了吧  他疯了
<14-11,House>See? Crazy.

587
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,430
<14-12,Foreman>成为活体捐献者有风险
<14-12,Foreman>Being a live donor has risks.

588
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,670
<14-13,Benjamin>我查过了
<14-13,Benjamin>I looked it up.

589
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,000
<14-13,Benjamin>风险是四千分之一
<14-13,Benjamin>The risk is 1 in 4,000

590
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,100
<14-13,Benjamin>我可能在手术过程中死去
<14-13,Benjamin>I could die during surgery,

591
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,370
<14-13,Benjamin>也就是说  如果我不捐献肾脏
<14-13,Benjamin>which means, if I don't donate,

592
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,010
<14-13,Benjamin>我就是认为自己的命比别人珍贵四千倍
<14-13,Benjamin>I'm valuing my life at 4,000 times someone else's.

593
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,480
<14-13,Benjamin>我并不想被手术刀划开
<14-13,Benjamin>It's not like I want to be cut open and

594
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,840
<14-13,Benjamin>被取走一块
<14-13,Benjamin>have a part of me taken out.

595
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,680
<14-13,Benjamin>但我有两颗肾脏  那个女人一个也没有
<14-13,Benjamin>But I've got two, and this woman has none.

596
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,210
<14-13,Benjamin>没有肾脏  她会死的
<14-13,Benjamin>She'll die without it.

597
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,920
<14-14,Wilson>很有逻辑性
<14-14,Wilson>Perfectly logical.

598
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,350
<14-15,House>有精神问题的人也可以有逻辑
<14-15,House>People with mental deficiency can be logical.

599
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,190
<14-15,House>就像疯子可以没有逻辑
<14-15,House>Just like sane people can be illogical.

600
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,720
<14-16,Foreman>肾脏捐献事件是你唯一用来证明
<14-16,Foreman>This kidney thing is the only evidence you have

601
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,900
<14-16,Foreman>他还有病的证据
<14-16,Foreman>that he's sick.

602
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,940
<14-16,Foreman>我会同意让他捐献
<14-16,Foreman>I'm gonna let him be a donor.

603
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,780
<14-17,Benjamin>豪斯医生
<14-17,Benjamin>Dr. House,

604
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,290
<14-17,Benjamin>这不是病症
<14-17,Benjamin>It's not a symptom.

605
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,320
<14-17,Benjamin>等你确信我健康了再回来吧
<14-17,Benjamin>Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy,

606
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,220
<14-17,Benjamin>我会把钱捐献给你的
<14-17,Benjamin>and I will give you your money.

607
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,190
<14-18,House>不  你不会的
<14-18,House>No, you won't.

608
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,640
<14-19,House>在他出院之前我们还有时间做最后一项测试
<14-19,House>We have time for one more test before we move him.

609
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,780
<14-20,Park>什么测试
<14-20,Park>What test?

610
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,900
<14-21,House>随便什么测试  只要能证明
<14-21,House>Whatever test will prove

611
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,100
<14-21,House>他的表现是由埃可病毒可病毒病毒引起的
<14-21,House>there was an echovirus-irus-irus,

612
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,120
<14-21,House>现在也没有痊愈  这很明显
<14-21,House>and he's not cured, obviously.

613
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,950
<14-22,Park>我一直在说这可能是惠普尔综合症
<14-22,Park>I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's.

614
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
<14-22,Park>会引起心律失常  颤抖
<14-22,Park>Causes arrhythmia, tremor,

615
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,940
<14-22,Park>以及精神变化
<14-22,Park>and mental changes.

616
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,320
<14-22,Park>不是什么好想法
<14-22,Park>Bad idea.

617
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,610
<14-23,House>他没有关节痛
<14-23,House>There's no joint pain.

618
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,990
<14-23,House>亚当斯去哪里了
<14-23,House>Where's Adams?

619
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,440
<14-24,Park>我们以为这例病例已经结束了
<14-24,Park>We thought the case was over.

620
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,450
<14-24,Park>她有场求职面试
<14-24,Park>She has a job interview.

621
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,090
<14-25,Park>她为什么在这里呢
<14-25,Park>Why is she here?

622
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,750
<14-26,House>因为我打电话让她来的
<14-26,House>Cause I called her.

623
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,920
<14-26,House>更大的问题是  你为什么会听话
<14-26,House>Bigger question is why that worked.

624
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,390
<14-27,Thirteen>我过来是因为我太闲了
<14-27,Thirteen>I'm here because I have time

625
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,440
<14-27,Thirteen>而你又遇到棘手的危机状况
<14-27,Thirteen>and you have a crisis and I--

626
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,240
<14-28,House>没时间合理讲述故事了
<14-28,House>We're too busy for rationalizations.

627
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,880
<14-28,House>病人抛弃锦衣玉食
<14-28,House>Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life.

628
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,480
<14-28,House>他可能吃得不那么健康
<14-28,House>He's probably not eating all that healthy.

629
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,270
<14-29,Park>会是镁缺乏吗
<14-29,Park>Magnesium deficiency?

630
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,020
<14-30,House>等他们把他带回房间
<14-30,House>Wait until they take him back to his room--

631
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,760
<14-30,House>抽血  做个大范围电解质检查
<14-30,House>draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.

632
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,330
<14-31,Thirteen>不用  他没有
<14-31,Thirteen>No, he hasn't had

633
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,870
<14-31,Thirteen>焦虑或是失眠
<14-31,Thirteen>anxiety or any trouble sleeping.

634
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,100
<14-31,Thirteen>我认为是惠普尔综合症
<14-31,Thirteen>I think it's whipple's disease.

635
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,570
<14-32,Park>馊主意  他没有关节痛
<14-32,Park>Bad idea. He doesn't have joint pain.

636
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,300
<14-33,Thirteen>关节疼痛虽然是常见症状但并非决定性的
<14-33,Thirteen>Joint pain is common, but not definitive.

637
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,240
<14-33,Thirteen>惠普尔综合症能够解释其它所有症状
<14-33,Thirteen>Whipple's explains all of his symptoms,

638
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,410
<14-33,Thirteen>包括人格改变
<14-33,Thirteen>including the personality change.

639
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,910
<14-33,Thirteen>并且会对抗生素有反应
<14-33,Thirteen>And it would respond to antibiotics,

640
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,440
<14-33,Thirteen>这也是为什么他感觉好多了
<14-33,Thirteen>which is why he started to feel better.

641
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,110
<14-33,Thirteen>但这并不意味着他病好了
<14-33,Thirteen>Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.

642
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,120
<14-33,Thirteen>你刚才是对的
<14-33,Thirteen>You were right.

643
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,250
<14-34,House>如果无法为自己的理论辩护就毫无价值
<14-34,House>Counts for nothing if you can't defend it.

644
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,640
<14-34,House>订一间操作室
<14-34,House>Book a procedure room.

645
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,140
<14-34,House>做上消化道内窥镜检查并做PCR检测惠普尔综合症
<14-34,House>Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for whipple's.

646
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,980
<14-34,House>负罪感
<14-34,House>Guilt.

647
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,430
<14-35,House>你对离去有负罪感
<14-35,House>You feel guilty about leaving.

648
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,770
<14-35,House>没错  你的渺小
<14-35,House>Yes, I think that little of you

649
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,770
<14-36,Thirteen>在于我的伟大
<14-36,Thirteen>and that much of me.

650
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,040
<14-36,Thirteen>没有我你一无是处
<14-36,Thirteen>You're nothing without me.

651
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,170
<14-37,House>不是离开我
<14-37,House>Not leaving me.

652
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,640
<14-37,House>而是远离人性
<14-37,House>Leaving humanity.

653
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,460
<14-38,Thirteen>我是要跟我的女朋友一起
<14-38,Thirteen>I'm going with my girlfriend.

654
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
<14-38,Thirteen>我的爱人
<14-38,Thirteen>The woman I love.

655
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,190
<14-39,House>去享受生活
<14-39,House>To have fun.

656
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,430
<14-40,Thirteen>你想让我感到内疚
<14-40,Thirteen>You're trying to make me feel guilty

657
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,800
<14-40,Thirteen>因为你正在这拯救生命
<14-40,Thirteen>because you're saving lives here.

658
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,200
<14-40,Thirteen>而我认为这很棒
<14-40,Thirteen>And I think that's great.

659
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,670
<14-40,Thirteen>我很自豪曾是其中一员
<14-40,Thirteen>I'm proud to have been a part of it,

660
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,740
<14-40,Thirteen>但是...现在...
<14-40,Thirteen>but...now...

661
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,910
<14-40,Thirteen>我只想快乐生活
<14-40,Thirteen>I just wanna be happy.

662
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,010
<14-41,House>没人会在希腊不愉快的
<14-41,House>Oh...no one's unhappy in Greece.

663
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,820
<15-1,Woman>前几周才出现的
<15-1,Woman>It just appeared in the last few weeks.

664
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,080
<15-1,Woman>他在学校都拿不了笔了
<15-1,Woman>He's having trouble holding a pencil in school.

665
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,020
<15-2,House>痒吗
<15-2,House>Does it itch?

666
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,920
<15-2,House>最近发生什么不同的事了吗
<15-2,House>Do anything different lately?

667
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,760
<15-2,House>买了新棒球手套或是新装修了厨房吗
<15-2,House>You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?

668
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,160
<15-3,Woman>我的邻居弄了个游泳池
<15-3,Woman>Well, the neighbors put in a pool,

669
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,730
<15-3,Woman>他最近总去那
<15-3,Woman>so he's been spending a lot of time over there.

670
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,960
<15-3,Woman>不过  如果水里有什么的话
<15-3,Woman>But, well, if it was something in the water,

671
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,870
<15-3,Woman>那应该会到处都是  不是吗
<15-3,Woman>it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?

672
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,240
<15-4,House>确实是水里的东西
<15-4,House>It is in the water.

673
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,540
<15-5,Woman>他对氯过敏吗
<15-5,Woman>He's allergic to chlorine?

674
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,820
<15-5,Woman>不是...
<15-5,Woman>No...

675
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,910
<15-6,House>他对夏丁香过敏
<15-6,House>He's allergic to summer lilac.

676
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,940
<15-7,Woman>那是我的润肤露
<15-7,Woman>That's my lotion.

677
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,270
<15-7,Woman>不可能在游泳池里
<15-7,Woman>And it's not in the pool.

678
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,400
<15-8,House>没错  是在他手掌上
<15-8,House>No, it's on the palms of his hands.

679
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,230
<15-8,House>那游泳池里的应该是你邻居家的女儿
<15-8,House>In the pool is the neighbor's daughter.

680
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,940
<15-8,House>或是你邻居家的辣妻
<15-8,House>Or the neighbor's hot wife.

681
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,010
<15-8,House>这是润滑剂
<15-8,House>Here's some lube.

682
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,510
<15-8,House>不好意思  你的视力是没救了
<15-8,House>Sorry. Too late for your eyesight.

683
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,730
<16-1,Park>内窥镜并未在小肠内
<16-1,Park>Endoscopy didn't reveal any lesions

684
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,040
<16-1,Park>看到任何病灶
<16-1,Park>in the small intestine.

685
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,320
<16-1,Park>我正在做PCR测试
<16-1,Park>I'm running PCR test now.

686
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,870
<16-2,House>在我办公室找到的
<16-2,House>Found it in my office.

687
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,000
<16-2,House>看上去像个礼物
<16-2,House>Appears to be a gift.

688
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,950
<16-2,House>不会有好事的
<16-2,House>That can't be good.

689
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,640
<16-3,Park>该死
<16-3,Park>Damn it.

690
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,020
<16-4,House>是你给她找的面试机会
<16-4,House>You got her the job interview.

691
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,940
<16-5,Park>本该能结束这一切的
<16-5,Park>And that was supposed to be the end of it.

692
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,800
<16-5,Park>我...不接受施舍
<16-5,Park>I...don't take charity.

693
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,670
<16-6,House>对你挺好  你这笨蛋
<16-6,House>Good for you! You loon.

694
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,870
<16-7,Park>我不喜欢欠别人什么
<16-7,Park>I don't like owing people things.

695
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,290
<16-8,House>你要么就是没安全感
<16-8,House>So either you're so insecure

696
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,630
<16-8,House>让你觉得需要时刻掌握主导权
<16-8,House>that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand,

697
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,930
<16-8,House>要么就是你自尊心过强
<16-8,House>or you're so arrogant

698
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,260
<16-8,House>帮你个忙都会冒犯到你
<16-8,House>that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.

699
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,460
<16-8,House>或者是因为你的家庭
<16-8,House>Or it's your family,

700
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,650
<16-8,House>某种移民情结什么的
<16-8,House>some kind of immigrant pride thing.

701
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,720
<16-8,House>我打赌是最后一种
<16-8,House>I'm betting on the last one.

702
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,290
<16-9,Park>我就是不喜欢而已
<16-9,Park>I just don't like it.

703
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,890
<16-9,Park>那会让我觉得...有点恶心
<16-9,Park>It makes me feel...icky.

704
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
<16-10,House>就这原因吗  恶心
<16-10,House>That's the reason? Ickiness?

705
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,960
<16-10,House>你从没想过分析其中的原因吗
<16-10,House>You never even tried to analyze this?

706
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,430
<16-10,House>这比那到处送礼的更疯狂
<16-10,House>It's even crazier than the gift thing.

707
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
<16-10,House>豪斯...
<16-10,House>House...

708
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,200
<16-11,Park>没有发现惠普尔养障体DNA
<16-11,Park>There's no sign of tropheryma DNA.

709
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,300
<16-11,Park>不是惠普尔综合症
<16-11,Park>It's not Whipple's.

710
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,310
<16-12,House>好吧...能做的都做了
<16-12,House>Well...we did what we could.

711
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,020
<17-1,Wilson>你确定要这么做吗
<17-1,Wilson>You sure you wanna do this?

712
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,390
<17-1,Wilson>放松
<17-1,Wilson>Relax.

713
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,060
<17-2,Surgeon>对此我甘之如饴
<17-2,Surgeon>This is gonna make me very happy.

714
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,090
<17-3,Wilson>辛普森医生
<17-3,Wilson>Dr. Simpson.

715
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,720
<17-3,Wilson>心率140  血压正在下降
<17-3,Wilson>Heart rate's 140, pressure's dropping.

716
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,110
<17-3,Wilson>给他腺苷  马上
<17-3,Wilson>Get him adenosine, stat.

717
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,450
<17-3,Wilson>病人状态不稳定  手术取消
<17-3,Wilson>Patient's unstable. Surgery's off.

718
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,390
<17-3,Wilson>再次出现心律失常
<17-3,Wilson>Arrhythmia's back.

719
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,140
<18-1,Adams>他正在用肝素  目前暂时稳定
<18-1,Adams>He's on heparin and stable for now,

720
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,480
<18-1,Adams>但这样可能会有
<18-1,Adams>but this could put him at risk

721
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,550
<18-1,Adams>中风或者血栓的风险
<18-1,Adams>for stroke or embolism.

722
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,950
<18-2,Park>也许他被蜘蛛咬了
<18-2,Park>Maybe he got bit by a spider.

723
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,450
<18-2,Park>症状可能需要三天时间才能表现出来
<18-2,Park>The symptoms can take up to three days to manifest.

724
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,100
<18-3,Adams>那应该有局部疼痛的症状
<18-3,Adams>He'd have localized pain.

725
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,850
<18-4,Park>轻链沉淀病
<18-4,Park>LCDD?

726
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,740
<18-5,Adams>一般都会损伤肾脏
<18-5,Adams>Almost always hits the kidneys.

727
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
<18-6,House>福曼医生
<18-6,House>Ah, Dr. Foreman.

728
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,630
<18-6,House>也许你能帮帮我们
<18-6,House>Perhaps you can help us.

729
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,460
<18-6,House>我拿不定主意是在新英格兰医学杂志上
<18-6,House>I can't decide whether to take out an "I told you so" Ad

730
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,200
<18-6,House>做个"我早告诉你了"的广告还是老派一点
<18-6,House>in the New England Journal or stay classy

731
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,380
<18-6,House>直接把它喷涂在你的车上
<18-6,House>and just spray-paint it on your car.

732
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,770
<18-7,Foreman>你不用参与这个病例了
<18-7,Foreman>You're off the case.

733
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,300
<18-8,House>这似乎有点反应过度
<18-8,House>That seems like an overreaction.

734
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,840
<18-9,Foreman>你给他下药了
<18-9,Foreman>You dosed him.

735
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,610
<18-9,Foreman>你无法忍受失去他这个病人
<18-9,Foreman>Couldn't stand to lose him as a patient,

736
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,110
<18-9,Foreman>因此就伪造症状来证明你是对的
<18-9,Foreman>so you faked his symptom to prove you right.

737
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,320
<18-10,Park>这太白痴了
<18-10,Park>That's idiotic.

738
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,910
<18-10,Park>对不起
<18-10,Park>Sorry.

739
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,210
<18-11,House>不用道歉
<18-11,House>Don't apologize.

740
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,390
<18-11,House>我不知道你是被权力冲昏了头还是得了妄想症
<18-11,House>I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid,

741
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,710
<18-11,House>不过她是对的
<18-11,House>but I know she's right.

742
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,680
<18-11,House>这关系到两条人命呢
<18-11,House>Two lives are in the balance here.

743
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,980
<18-12,Foreman>豪斯  我为你工作了七年
<18-12,Foreman>House, I worked for you for seven years.

744
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,250
<18-12,Foreman>我知道你是怎么行事的
<18-12,Foreman>I know how you operate.

745
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,120
<18-12,Foreman>因此当我看到某种症状在你需要的时候
<18-12,Foreman>So when I see symptoms magically show up

746
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,350
<18-12,Foreman>奇迹般出现时...
<18-12,Foreman>right when you need them--

747
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,060
<18-13,House>我当了你七年的老板
<18-13,House>And I was your boss for seven years.

748
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,160
<18-13,House>我知道你是怎样一个细心多疑的人
<18-13,House>And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are.

749
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,230
<18-13,House>我为什么要这么做
<18-13,House>Why would I do this now?

750
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,760
<18-13,House>尤其是考虑到你还能把我立刻送回监狱
<18-13,House>Knowing you can send me right back to jail?

751
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,650
<18-14,Foreman>你对他做了什么
<18-14,Foreman>What'd you give him?

752
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,100
<18-14,Foreman>什么都没有
<18-14,Foreman>Nothing!

753
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,730
<18-15,House>反正你也没法证明
<18-15,House>You can't prove otherwise.

754
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,970
<18-15,House>那何不做个明智的决定呢
<18-15,House>So why don't you do the smart thing here?

755
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,270
<18-15,House>你不用参与这个病例了
<18-15,House>You're off the case.

756
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,810
<18-16,Foreman>你不能再接触这个病人
<18-16,Foreman>You no longer have access to this patient.

757
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,610
<18-17,Adams>你不能让他这么做
<18-17,Adams>You can't let him do this.

758
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,830
<18-18,House>他是老大
<18-18,House>He's the boss.

759
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,840
<18-18,House>而且他没说错
<18-18,House>And he's right.

760
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,770
<19-1,Adams>我觉得你是确定
<19-1,Adams>I assume you dosed the patient

761
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,300
<19-1,Adams>病人有神经系统问题
<19-1,Adams>because you're really certain

762
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,500
<19-1,Adams>才给他下的药吧
<19-1,Adams>he has a neurological condition?

763
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,240
<19-2,House>我觉得你把我的行为
<19-2,House>I assume you're interpreting my actions

764
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,840
<19-2,House>往善意的方面理解
<19-2,House>in the best possible light

765
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,240
<19-2,House>是因为你没得到那份工作
<19-2,House>'cause you didn't get the job?

766
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,220
<19-2,House>你和朴克之间怎么了
<19-2,House>What's with you and Park?

767
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,240
<19-3,Adams>没事
<19-3,Adams>Nothing.

768
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,310
<19-4,House>我希望我的手下说谎也要像个样子
<19-4,House>I expect my people to lie better than that.

769
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,720
<19-4,House>你送她礼物无非是出于
<19-4,House>Either you're getting her gifts because

770
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,490
<19-4,House>你想博得她的好感  这很令我厌恶
<19-4,House>you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you.

771
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,430
<19-4,House>要么就是想戏弄她
<19-4,House>Or you're getting her gifts to screw with her,

772
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,960
<19-4,House>这样  我倒是可以向你传授
<19-4,House>in which case, I will be teaching you

773
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,030
<19-4,House>我的独家秘籍
<19-4,House>my secret homey handshake.

774
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,300
<19-5,Adams>我当时就是觉得
<19-5,Adams>I just...I thought it was interesting

775
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,370
<19-5,Adams>她不肯接受那杯咖啡很有趣
<19-5,Adams>she couldn't accept that coffee.

776
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,410
<19-5,Adams>我想看看能进行到什么程度
<19-5,Adams>I wanted to see how deep it went.

777
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,580
<19-6,House>那么现在呢
<19-6,House>But now?

778
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,140
<19-7,Adams>现在我只是想赢
<19-7,Adams>Oh, now I just want to win.

779
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,250
<19-8,House>那个盒子里是什么
<19-8,House>What was in the box?

780
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,950
<19-9,Adams>礼券
<19-9,Adams>Gift certificate.

781
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,850
<19-9,Adams>水疗的票子
<19-9,Adams>The spa.

782
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,450
<19-10,House>这还达不到效果
<19-10,House>Nah, that's not gonna do it.

783
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,490
<19-10,House>她这习惯从小就有了
<19-10,House>You're up against a lifetime of training.

784
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,860
<19-10,House>如果你想赢  你得做些
<19-10,House>If you wanna win, you gotta do something

785
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,560
<19-10,House>她无法回报的事情
<19-10,House>she can't possibly reciprocate.

786
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,360
<19-10,House>你应该把她的神经官能症推向一个极限
<19-10,House>You gotta push her neuroses to the point

787
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,500
<19-10,House>让她自己觉得自己疯了
<19-10,House>where even she thinks that she's crazy.

788
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,380
<19-11,House>再帮个忙
<19-11,House>One more favor.

789
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,850
<19-11,House>我保证永远不再打扰了
<19-11,House>Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever.

790
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
<19-11,House>也可能我是骗你的
<19-11,House>Or I'm lying.

791
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,350
<19-11,House>不管怎样  这事
<19-11,House>Either way, it's more interesting

792
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,620
<19-11,House>总比你现在干的有趣
<19-11,House>than whatever you're doing now.

793
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,910
<20-1,Thirteen>有什么我能效劳吗
<20-1,Thirteen>Can I help you?

794
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,040
<20-2,Woman>我是他妻子
<20-2,Woman>I'm his wife.

795
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,530
<20-2,Woman>我们分居了
<20-2,Woman>We're separated.

796
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,870
<20-2,Woman>听说他病了
<20-2,Woman>I heard he was sick.

797
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,670
<20-2,Woman>我想来看看他
<20-2,Woman>I just... wanted to see him.

798
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,540
<20-2,Woman>他是要捐肾给个素不相识的人吗
<20-2,Woman>He's giving a kidney to someone he's never met?

799
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,710
<20-3,Thirteen>他是这么打算的
<20-3,Thirteen>He wants to, yeah.

800
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,520
<20-3,Thirteen>我听他谈起过你
<20-3,Thirteen>I know he's talked about you.

801
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,300
<20-3,Thirteen>和你分开后他一直单身
<20-3,Thirteen>He's been alone all this time.

802
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,470
<20-3,Thirteen>能见上你一面
<20-3,Thirteen>I'm sure it would mean a lot to him

803
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,470
<20-3,Thirteen>对他意义深重
<20-3,Thirteen>to see you.

804
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,080
<20-4,Woman>我想和他白头偕老
<20-4,Woman>I wanted to spend my life with him, but...

805
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,310
<20-4,Woman>但我想要他爱我胜过别人
<20-4,Woman>I need to feel like he loves me more than other people.

806
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,490
<20-4,Woman>想要他能更宠爱自己的孩子
<20-4,Woman>Like he loves our kids more.

807
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,890
<20-4,Woman>或许是我自私了
<20-4,Woman>Maybe that's selfish.

808
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,930
<20-4,Woman>我还是走吧
<20-4,Woman>I should go.

809
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,410
<20-5,Benjamin>那是我妻子吗
<20-5,Benjamin>Was that my wife?

810
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,030
<20-5,Benjamin>不知道
<20-5,Benjamin>I don't know.

811
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,000
<20-6,Thirteen>你是那个肾脏捐助者吗
<20-6,Thirteen>You the guy, the kidney donor?

812
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,470
<20-7,Benjamin>发生点状况
<20-7,Benjamin>There was a problem, but...

813
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,570
<20-7,Benjamin>不过我会再尝试下的
<20-7,Benjamin>I'm gonna try again.

814
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,540
<20-8,Thirteen>还是捐个原来那位女士吗
<20-8,Thirteen>Um...to give it to the same lady?

815
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,880
<20-9,Benjamin>她很需要
<20-9,Benjamin>She needs it.

816
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,050
<20-10,Thirteen>好吧  那算了
<20-10,Thirteen>Okay. Never mind.

817
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,930
<20-10,Thirteen>等等
<20-10,Thirteen>Wait.

818
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,500
<20-11,Benjamin>你有什么需要吗
<20-11,Benjamin>What do you-- what do you want?

819
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,670
<20-12,Thirteen>没事  只是
<20-12,Thirteen>Uh, it's nothing. It's just...

820
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,960
<20-12,Thirteen>我得了多囊性肾病
<20-12,Thirteen>I have polycystic kidney disease.

821
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,300
<20-12,Thirteen>我需要做肾移植
<20-12,Thirteen>And I need a transplant,

822
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,630
<20-12,Thirteen>而且他们说我时间不多了
<20-12,Thirteen>And they say I don't have much time,

823
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,870
<20-12,Thirteen>我听说你有捐献的意向
<20-12,Thirteen>so when I heard that you were willing,

824
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,230
<20-12,Thirteen>我只是
<20-12,Thirteen>I just...

825
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,100
<20-12,Thirteen>你给别人我也很高兴
<20-12,Thirteen>But I'm glad it's going to someone.

826
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,370
<20-13,Benjamin>我会给你的
<20-13,Benjamin>I'll give it to you.

827
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,380
<20-14,Thirteen>但你已经答应给别人了啊
<20-14,Thirteen>But you already promised it to someone else.

828
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,120
<20-15,Benjamin>我还有一个
<20-15,Benjamin>I have another one.

829
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,120
<20-15,Benjamin>救人一命胜造七级浮屠
<20-15,Benjamin>Saving one life is good.

830
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,820
<20-15,Benjamin>救两人命胜造十四级浮屠
<20-15,Benjamin>Saving two is better.

831
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,260
<20-16,Thirteen>你两个肾都捐了会死的
<20-16,Thirteen>You give away two kidneys, and you die.

832
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,860
<20-17,Benjamin>我能靠透析活上好几年呢
<20-17,Benjamin>I could live on dialyses for years.

833
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,090
<20-18,Thirteen>没错  但最后你还是得死
<20-18,Thirteen>Yes, and-- and then you die.

834
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,130
<20-19,Benjamin>那样我就能捐其它器官了
<20-19,Benjamin>And then I could donate my other organs.

835
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,170
<20-19,Benjamin>心脏  肺
<20-19,Benjamin>Heart, lungs.

836
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,670
<20-19,Benjamin>我能救四  五个甚至更多的人
<20-19,Benjamin>I could save four or five more lives.

837
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,190
<20-20,Thirteen>福曼得找个诊断医师来
<20-20,Thirteen>Foreman's gonna need a diagnostician.

838
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,160
<20-20,Thirteen>这病人疯了
<20-20,Thirteen>This guy is crazy.

839
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,190
<20-20,Thirteen>心律失常  肌肉震颤
<20-20,Thirteen>Arrhythmia, muscle tremors,

840
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,520
<21-1,Adams>对  还有精神变化
<21-1,Adams>And, yes, mental changes.

841
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,530
<21-1,Adams>如果他心脏没有破裂
<21-1,Adams>If his heart doesn't rupture,

842
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,300
<21-1,Adams>他很可能挖出来送给别人
<21-1,Adams>he's liable to rip it out and give it away.

843
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,030
<21-2,House>这噪音
<21-2,House>You know, the "Down" vibe in here

844
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,230
<21-2,House>完全毁了我《查理的天使》的幻想
<21-2,House>is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy.

846
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,980
<21-2,House>你这发型也不咋地
<21-2,House>And that haircut isn't helping, either.

847
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,510
<21-3,Thirteen>这症状看着像格雷夫斯病
<21-3,Thirteen>It seems like graves disease

849
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,540
<21-3,Thirteen>或是其它什么甲状腺疾病
<21-3,Thirteen>Or some other thyroid issue.

850
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,840
<21-4,Park>她现在算是团队的一员吗
<21-4,Park>Is she on the team now?

851
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,310
<21-4,Park>是长期的吗
<21-4,Park>Like, forever?

852
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,150
<21-4,Park>他入院时的甲状腺素水平
<21-4,Park>His thyroid levels were within normal range

853
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,420
<21-4,Park>在正常区间
<21-4,Park>when he was admitted.

854
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,620
<21-5,Adams>可能是柯萨奇B病毒
<21-5,Adams>Could be coxsackie b virus.

855
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,120
<21-6,House>或心包炎
<21-6,House>Or pericarditis.

856
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,360
<21-7,Thirteen>会是卟啉症吗
<21-7,Thirteen>What about porphyria?

858
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,790
<21-7,Thirteen>没有出现皮疹的话有些牵强
<21-7,Thirteen>It's a little weird without the rash,

859
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,020
<21-7,Thirteen>但是其它症状符合
<21-7,Thirteen>but it fits all of his other symptoms.

860
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,280
<21-8,Adams>如果是急性间歇性卟啉病
<21-8,Adams>And if it is acute intermittent porphyria,

861
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,510
<21-8,Adams>那就能解释为什么他的症状一再复发
<21-8,Adams>that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.

862
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,270
<21-9,House>虽然不太可能  但至少有可能性
<21-9,House>It's unlikely... but it's possible.

863
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,970
<21-9,House>还有什么
<21-9,House>What else?

864
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,840
<21-9,House>我说还有什么吗
<21-9,House>I said what else?

865
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,190
<21-11,House>现在好多了
<21-11,House>There. That's better.

866
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
<21-9,House>还有什么可能
<21-9,House>Now, what else?

867
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,010
<21-11,House>好吧  如果仅此而已的话
<21-11,House>Well, if there's nothing better than possible,

868
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,280
<21-11,House>就死马当活马医吧
<21-11,House>then possible gets upgraded to probable.

869
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,780
<21-12,Adams>我去给他用血红素
<21-12,Adams>I'll start him on hematin.

870
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,250
<21-13,Thirteen>不  还是我去吧
<21-13,Thirteen>No, I'll go.

871
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,040
<21-14,House>你的答案是什么
<21-14,House>So what's the answer?

872
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,930
<21-14,House>你现在算是团队的一员吗
<21-14,House>Are you now on the team?

873
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,830
<21-14,House>是长期的吗
<21-14,House>Like, forever?

874
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,880
<21-15,Thirteen>我不知道
<21-15,Thirteen>I don't know.

875
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,200
<21-16,House>我想去订做些T恤
<21-16,House>Cause I was thinking of ordering t-shirts.

876
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,500
<21-15,Thirteen>豪斯  我不知道
<21-15,Thirteen>I don't know...House.

877
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,940
<21-15,Thirteen>我该怎么做呢
<21-15,Thirteen>I mean, what am I supposed to do?

878
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,570
<21-16,House>我受训成为一名医生
<21-16,House>I trained to be a doctor.

879
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
<21-16,House>我懂得如何妙手回春
<21-16,House>I know how to take someone's pain away,

880
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,980
<21-16,House>懂得如何叫人起死回生
<21-16,House>How to make a stopped heart beat again.

881
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,350
<21-16,House>我们救活过孩子们
<21-16,House>We've brought people's kids back.

882
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,400
<21-17,House>救活过丈夫们
<21-17,House>Their husbands...

883
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,870
<21-17,House>那么  你是觉得愧疚吗
<21-17,House>So...guilt?

884
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,300
<21-17,House>没错  你说对了
<21-17,House>Yes, you were right.

885
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,570
<21-18,Thirteen>你总是对的
<21-18,Thirteen>You're always right.

886
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,010
<19-7,Adams>只是我...
<19-7,Adams>I just...

887
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,810
<21-18,Thirteen>我有救死扶伤的能力
<21-18,Thirteen>I have the skills to help people.

888
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,810
<21-18,Thirteen>我可以只为了一己之乐
<21-18,Thirteen>Is it okay for me to walk away from that

889
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,180
<21-18,Thirteen>就一走了之置身事外吗
<21-18,Thirteen>because I...want to just have fun?

890
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,380
<21-19,House>显然不能
<21-19,House>Obviously not.

891
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,680
<22-1,House>病人怎样了
<22-1,House>How's your patient?

892
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
<22-2,Wilson>她几小时前去世了
<22-2,Wilson>She died a few hours ago.

893
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,810
<22-2,Wilson>十三回来了
<22-2,Wilson>Thirteen is back.

894
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,910
<22-3,Wilson>没有部门  没有资金
<22-3,Wilson>No department. No money.

895
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,840
<22-3,Wilson>你还能骗得她帮你工作
<22-3,Wilson>And somehow, you managed to con her into hanging around.

896
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,450
<22-4,House>天生我才
<22-4,House>I have a gift.

897
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,150
<22-5,Wilson>怎么了
<22-5,Wilson>What?

898
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,990
<22-6,House>这是一个骗局
<22-6,House>It was a con.

899
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,160
<22-7,Wilson>病人是装的?
<22-7,Wilson>The patient was faking?

900
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,720
<22-7,Wilson>不  是我造成的
<22-7,Wilson>No, I was.

901
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,800
<22-8,House>我编造借口收他入院
<22-8,House>I brought him in here under false pretenses

902
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,130
<22-8,House>为了得到他的钱
<22-8,House>just to get his money.

903
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,770
<22-8,House>我随便订了几项检查
<22-8,House>I ordered a bunch of random tests

904
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,900
<22-8,House>留他住院
<22-8,House>to keep him here.

905
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,500
<22-8,House>其中一个是脑CT  会用到
<22-8,House>One of them was a head CT, which uses...

906
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,410
<22-8,House>碘造影
<22-8,House>Iodine contrast.

907
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,840
<22-9,Wilson>你认为他对碘过敏
<22-9,Wilson>You think he's allergic to iodine?

908
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,140
<22-9,Wilson>又不对
<22-9,Wilson>No, again.

909
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,410
<22-10,House>不要打断我
<22-10,House>Just don't interrupt me.

910
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,180
<22-10,House>十三说对了
<22-10,House>Thirteen was right.

911
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,880
<22-10,House>是甲状腺问题
<22-10,House>This is a thyroid issue.

912
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,920
<22-10,House>他患的是普卢默病[毒性甲状腺腺瘤]
<22-10,House>He has Plummer's disease.

913
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,100
<22-10,House>他的甲状腺有个结节
<22-10,House>He has a nodule in his thyroid.

914
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,170
<22-10,House>结节分泌额外的激素
<22-10,House>It produces excess hormone.

915
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,900
<22-10,House>其量不足以在检测中显示异常
<22-10,House>Not enough to test abnormal,

916
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,320
<22-10,House>但却超过了大脑的耐受限度
<22-10,House>just more than his brain is used to.

917
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,390
<22-10,House>使他变得不理性的慷慨
<22-10,House>Just enough to make him irrationally generous,

918
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,140
<22-10,House>使他不能耐受热
<22-10,House>make him vulnerable to overheating.

919
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,390
<22-11,Wilson>然后你又给他身体里灌进大量碘
<22-11,Wilson>Then you pumped his body full of iodine

920
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,090
<22-11,Wilson>一下将他打入甲状腺毒症状态
<22-11,Wilson>and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.

921
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,810
<22-12,House>我说了不要打断我
<22-12,House>I said don't interrupt.

922
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,450
<22-12,House>没错  你说对了
<22-12,House>But, yes, you're right.

923
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,270
<22-12,House>切掉那个结节  他就会好的
<22-12,House>Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.

924
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,620
<23-1,House>过去了两天  一次手术
<23-1,House>Two days, one surgery.

925
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,750
<23-1,House>既然你已经病愈  我可以接受赠款了
<23-1,House>I now accept, that you're all better.

926
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,690
<23-1,House>我的钱呢
<23-1,House>Where's my money?

927
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,420
<23-2,Benjamin>是你让我生病的
<23-2,Benjamin>You made me sick.

928
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,520
<23-3,House>你早就病了
<23-3,House>You were already sick.

929
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,430
<23-3,House>我只是让你病得更重而已
<23-3,House>I just made you much, much worse.

930
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,650
<23-3,House>说正事  钱
<23-3,House>Seriously...the money.

931
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,570
<23-3,House>不打算给我了  对不对
<23-3,House>You're not giving it to me, are you?

932
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,330
<23-4,Benjamin>面对死亡的时候
<23-4,Benjamin>When you're facing death...

933
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,220
<23-4,Benjamin>会想到以往忽视的事
<23-4,Benjamin>some things come into focus.

934
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,510
<23-4,Benjamin>我妻子
<23-4,Benjamin>My wife.

935
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,730
<23-5,House>你爱你的家人  想要他们回来你身边
<23-5,House>You love your family. You want them back.

936
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,030
<23-5,House>你的利他主义一直都是病征
<23-5,House>Your altruism was always a symptom.

937
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,640
<23-6,Benjamin>不  不是  我还是会坚持...
<23-6,Benjamin>No, it wasn't. I'm still gonna...

938
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,340
<23-7,House>多施予少收取  少到什么地步
<23-7,House>Keep less? How much less?

939
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,210
<23-7,House>足够宠坏你的孩子
<23-7,House>Just enough to spoil your kids?

940
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,380
<23-8,Benjamin>不是
<23-8,Benjamin>No.

941
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,350
<23-9,House>难道他们需要钱甚于结核病人
<23-9,House>But they need it more than people with TB

942
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,410
<23-9,House>甚于印尼盲眼的孩子
<23-9,House>or children in Indonesia with no eyes?

943
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,980
<23-9,House>甚于有一颗金子般的心的诊断师吗
<23-9,House>Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?

944
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,840
<23-10,Benjamin>我不想给你钱  是因为你是个混蛋
<23-10,Benjamin>I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.

945
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,550
<23-11,House>我上周也这么混呐
<23-11,House>I was an ass last week.

946
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,100
<23-12,Benjamin>我爱我的家人
<23-12,Benjamin>I love my family.

947
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,020
<23-12,Benjamin>我想和他们在一起
<23-12,Benjamin>I want to be with them.

948
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,470
<23-12,Benjamin>这不能说明我是个坏人
<23-12,Benjamin>That doesn't make me a bad person.

949
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,800
<23-12,Benjamin>对
<23-12,Benjamin>No.

950
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,450
<23-13,House>只说明你是个健康的人
<23-13,House>It makes you a healthy person.

951
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,730
<24-1,Park>修理厂来电话
<24-1,Park>My mechanic called.

952
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,700
<24-1,Park>说修车款有人付了
<24-1,Park>He said the work's been paid for.

953
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,220
<24-2,Adams>你提到车还在修理店
<24-2,Adams>You mentioned your car was in the shop.

954
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,490
<24-3,Park>那可是四千五百美金
<24-3,Park>That's $4,500.

955
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,860
<24-4,Adams>微笑  说谢谢
<24-4,Adams>Smile and say thank you.

956
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,500
<24-4,Adams>不然我给你装GPS
<24-4,Adams>Or I get you G.P.S.

957
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,000
<24-5,Park>你赢了
<24-5,Park>You win.

958
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,910
<24-5,Park>谢谢
<24-5,Park>Thank you.

959
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,030
<25-1,Park>你的车有人给修了
<25-1,Park>Your car is getting fixed.

960
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,950
<25-1,Park>你预测正确  她果然上钩了
<25-1,Park>You're right. She went for it.

961
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,220
<25-2,House>干得好
<25-2,House>Good work.

962
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,530
<25-2,House>明天要我捎你来吗
<25-2,House>Need a lift tomorrow?

963
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,630
<25-2,House>你的车不是还在修
<25-2,House>'cause your car is still in the shop.

964
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,830
<25-3,Park>我不接受施舍
<25-3,Park>I don't take charity.

965
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,030
<25-3,Park>只是很高兴这事终于结束了
<25-3,Park>I'm just glad it's over.

966
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,100
<25-4,House>所谓结束  是不存在的
<25-4,House>Nothing is ever over.

973
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,640
<25-4,House>十三
<25-4,House>Thirteen.

974
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,320
<25-4,House>等一下
<25-4,House>Wait a minute.

976
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,850
<26-1,House>你被解雇了
<26-1,House>You're fired.

977
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,900
<26-2,Thirteen>又闹什么  豪斯  我饿死了
<26-2,Thirteen>Now what? House, I'm starving.

978
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,090
<26-3,House>我没开玩笑  你被解雇了
<26-3,House>I'm not joking. You're fired.

979
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,420
<26-3,House>明天不用来了
<26-3,House>Don't come in tomorrow.

980
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,620
<26-4,Thirteen>豪斯
<26-4,Thirteen>House...

981
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,670
<26-5,House>我可以接受无处可去的人
<26-5,House>I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go.

982
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,070
<26-5,House>需要证明自己的人
<26-5,House>People who got something to prove.

983
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,780
<26-5,House>喜欢疑难病例的人为我工作
<26-5,House>People who just get off on weird cases.

984
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,410
<26-5,House>可我不能接受一个为我工作
<26-5,House>What I can't work with is someone who's here

985
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,210
<26-5,House>只为了不受良心谴责的人
<26-5,House>so she doesn't have to feel bad.

987
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,150
<26-6,Thirteen>你想拯救我
