<4-4,House>that's a bathroom you're barricading.

46
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,930
<4-4,House>要进来很容易abc特别你还自作聪明地劫了群病人当人质
<4-4,House>It might come in handy, especially since you'veabccleverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage.

47
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,070
<4-4,House>去做!

<4-5,Jason>My medical records. Iabcneed you to read them.

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,940
<4-6,House>你真以为演一次<热天午后>就能确诊了?
<4-6,House>You really think that reenacting dog dayabcafternoon is the best way to get diagnosed?

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,590
<4-6,House>我知道你坐在不舒服的椅子上abc等了几个小时
<4-6,House>I'm sure you've been waiting forabchours in an uncomfortable chair,

51
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,410
<4-6,House>但你应该看看电影的结局

<4-7,Jason>过去的两年里我看过16个医生

55
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,260
<4-8,House>只缺少暴力威胁了
<4-8,House>and all that was missingabcwas the threat of violence.

56
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,480
<4-9,Jason>缺少的是答案!

<4-10,House>That's a cool constellation of symptoms.

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,590
<4-10,House>可能不严重
<4-10,House>It could be something minor.

62
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,370
<4-10,House>至少比终身监禁好
<4-10,House>At least compared to life in prison,

63
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,610
<4-10,House>你宁愿铤而走险 而不是继续求医
<4-10,House>which is what you seem to preferabcto seeing 16 more specialists.

64
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,900
<4-11,Jason>闭嘴 做好你的事
<4-11,Jason>Shut up and do your job.

65

78
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,310
<5-8,House>所以你觉得你老婆离你而去abc是因为你不能好好喘气?
<5-8,House>So you figured your wife left youabcbecause you couldn't breathe, right?

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,540
<5-8,House>既然你还没要死
<5-8,House>Since you're not almostabcdead, it means you're armed

81
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,890
<5-8,House>说明健康影响了你的其他方面
<5-8,House>because you're blaming somethingabcother than your health on your health.

<5-12,House>Because I'd rather not stand here while you try andabcnegotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.

85

<5-22,House>如果加上最后的症状 只可能是硬皮病肺纤维化
<5-22,House>If you add on that final symptom,abcit can only be lmonary scleroderma.

<14-7,House>这当口还签啥家长同意书
<14-7,House>I think that covers theabcparental consent issue.

264
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,010
<14-8,Regina>那玩意会造成神经和肌肉损伤
<14-8,Regina>And that stuff can alsoabccause nerve and muscle damage.

<15-7,House>轮到你了 这到底是咋回事呢?
<15-7,House>Your turn. So why are we here?

278

<15-7,House>已经排除了猝死 失恋的可能
<15-7,House>We've ruled out immediateabcrisk of death, lost love.

279
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,850
<15-7,House>那就只剩下...工作?
<15-7,House>That just leaves... work?

280
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,740
<15-7,House>你为工作而活
<15-7,House>You're defined by your work.

<15-7,House>也许你犯了大错...被炒了鱿鱼
<15-7,House>Maybe you made a hugeabcmistake... got fired.

<15-8,Jason>我只想找个答案
<15-8,Jason>I just want an answer.

285
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,740
<15-9,House>我知道 我是问为什么

<16-3,Taub>我也欠别人钱 也没见我成天发疯
<16-3,Taub>I've got debt too--you don't seeabcme acting like a lunatic.

291
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,810
<16-4,Kutner>他这么做 的确是没有借口
<16-4,Kutner>There's no excuse for what he's doing,

292
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,410
<16-4,Kutner>但因为生病而负债累累的人 数不胜数
<16-4,Kutner>but you've got millions of people thousandsabcof dollars in debt because they're sick--

293
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,100
<16-4,Kutner>有一个人做点出格的事也可以理解
<16-4,Kutner>at least one of them's gonnaabcdo something inexcusable.

294
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,340
<16-4,Kutner>更何况这招还奏效了
<16-4,Kutner>Especially if it works.
