<7-12,House>他是小白鼠
<7-12,House>He's a guinea pig.

<8-8,Taub>你凭什么觉得那是个"秘密"账户呢?
<8-8,Taub>What makes you think it's a secret?

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,810
<8-9,House>因为要不是个秘密 你会说那个账户abc而不是一个账户
<8-9,House>Because if it wasn't, you'dabccall it "the" bank account.

208
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,030
<8-9,House>该死

211
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,270
<8-10,Taub>我们在更新家具
<8-10,Taub>We're refurnishing.

<8-10,Taub>开户那天我太忙了过不去
<8-10,Taub>I just couldn't make it toabcthe bank the day we opened it.

<9-2,Foreman>他本来好好的 突然癫痫发作
<9-2,Foreman>He was fine, then all of aabcsudden, he started seizing.

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,830
<9-3,Heather>他告诉我说他好多了
<9-3,Heather>He said you told him he was better.

221
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,960
<10-1,House>显然药物还未清除出体内
<10-1,House>Obviously the drugs weren'tabcout of his system.

222
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,410
<10-2,Kutner>他用的药物不可能导致癫痫发作
<10-2,Kutner>None of these drugs, nor the drugs that they'reabcderived from, are known for causing seizures.

223
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,240
<10-3,House>药物本身不会引发
<10-3,House>By themselves, no.

224
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,010
<10-3,House>但是三种未经检测核准的药物就说不好了
<10-3,House>But three unproven,untested drugs?

225
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,220
<10-3,House>就像<扫荡3人组>那样abc(70年代电视剧)
<10-3,House>This is like the mod squad.

<10-3,House>没有人能阻止他们
<10-3,House>No one could stop them.

227

<10-4,Kutner>太荒谬了 竟然用钱abc让人们服用有潜在危险的药
<10-4,Kutner>Ridiculous that they let people takeabcpotentially dangerous drugs for money.

228
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,380
<10-5,House>长话短说
<10-5,House>Just to short circuit that discussion,

229
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,930
<10-5,House>走投无路的人不应该进行临床药物试验
<10-5,House>people should not be testing drugsabcbecause they're desperate.

<13-17,Lucas>有点道理
<13-17,Lucas>Yeah, that makes sense.

<13-18,House>通常这个问题会引起争论
<13-18,House>Usually I have moreabcof a fight on that one.

341
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,840
<13-19,Lucas>那你为什么要把Taub整得很悲惨?
<13-19,Lucas>So why are you making taub miserable?

342
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,870
<13-20,House>我刚说过!
<13-20,House>I just said!

343
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,890
<13-21,Lucas>他为了拯救婚姻辞了上一个工作
<13-21,Lucas>He left his last jobabcto save his marriage.

344
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,280
<13-21,Lucas>你觉得他婚姻要是完了abc他会更努力地为你工作?
<13-21,Lucas>If his marriage falls apart, youabcthink he'll be working harder for you?

345
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,330
<13-21,Lucas>或者他再也不会为你工作了?
<13-21,Lucas>Or you think he won'tabcbe working for you at all?

346
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,780
<14-1,Foreman>他的头颈部全肿了
<14-1,Foreman>his head and neck areabccompletely swollen.

<14-1,Foreman>找不到任何体表标志
<14-1,Foreman>Can't find any landmarks.

349
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,970
<14-2,Kutner>直接切
<14-2,Kutner>Just start cutting.

350
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,890
<14-3,Foreman>气管插管?
<14-3,Foreman>An exploratory trache?

351
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,850
<14-4,Kutner>没别的办法
<14-4,Kutner>We don't have a choice.

352
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,440
<14-5,Foreman>好了
<14-5,Foreman>Got it.

353
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,340
<14-5,Foreman>他脸肿得挤闭了泪腺
<14-5,Foreman>his face is so swollen itabcsqueezed his tear ducts shut.

354
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,960
<14-5,Foreman>只能手动润滑他的眼球
<14-5,Foreman>We've been lubricating his eyes by hand.

355
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,270
<15-1,Kutner>给了类固醇激素静点和药膏来减轻水肿abc但是作用有限
<15-1,Kutner>We started him on steroids,iv and cream, toabcreduce the swelling, but it's having limited effect.

356

<15-2,Taub>血栓和查加斯寄生虫阴性
<15-2,Taub>Negative for thrombosis and chagas.

357
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,560
<15-2,Taub>可能是感染
<15-2,Taub>Could be infection.

358
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,480
<15-3,Thirteen>细胞培养还是阴性
<15-3,Thirteen>Culture's still negative.

359

<15-4,Foreman>会不会免疫系统过度激化abc导致细胞激素风暴
<15-4,Foreman>Could be his immune system's onabchyperdrive. Cytokine storm.

360
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:31,000
<15-5,House>为什么你办了三年的健身会员卡abc却只去过两次?
<15-5,House>Why would you pay for a three-yearabcgym membership and only go twice?

361
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,360
<15-5,House>不好意思 你们还在病例讨论?
<15-5,House>Sorry. You guys still diagnosing?

362
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,570
<15-5,House>我以为几小时以前就结束了
<15-5,House>Thought we'd finished hours ago.

363
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,290
<15-5,House>记不记得 我们曾认为病因是abc未经证明批准的鸡尾酒疗法
<15-5,House>You remember, when we decided it was the unproven,abcunapproved cocktail of drugs he's been downing like...

364
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,120
<15-5,House>他像喝鸡尾酒一样服下
<15-5,House>like a cocktail.

365
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,180
<15-6,Foreman>他刚刚完成了全血透析
<15-6,Foreman>He just completed a total dialysis.

366
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,640
<15-6,Foreman>要是药物的原因 他会好多了才对
<15-6,Foreman>If it was the drugs,he'd be better.

367
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,960
<15-7,House>或是更糟
<15-7,House>Or he'd be worse.

368
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,690
<15-7,House>你们肯定都没看过电影<猜火车>
<15-7,House>I take it none of you saw trainspotting.

369
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,570
<15-8,Thirteen>你觉得水肿是停药后的反应?
<15-8,Thirteen>You think swelling is aabcsymptom of withdrawal?

370
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,430
<15-9,House>你觉得停药后接连出现三个新症状是巧合?
<15-9,House>You think it's a coincidence that three newabcsymptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?

371
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
<15-10,Taub>可能其中某些症状...
<15-10,Taub>It's possible someabcof the symptoms--

372
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,540
<15-11,House>药物或者是答案 或者是巧合
<15-11,House>either the drugs are the answer,abcor the drugs are a coincidence.

373
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,630
<15-11,House>若是药物引起的 要想更好的解毒方法
<15-11,House>If it's one, we have toabcfind a better way to detox him.

374
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,110
<15-11,House>若两种可能都存在abc下诊断前 得要找出哪些是停药反应
<15-11,House>If it's two, we have to know which symptoms areabcwithdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis.

375
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,730
<15-11,House>还是得找更好的办法来解毒
<15-11,House>Which means we have to find aabcbetter way to detox him.

376
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,620
<15-12,Taub>那怎么办?
<15-12,Taub>So how do we do it?

377
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,230
<15-13,House>再给他用药
<15-13,House>Hair of the drug that bit him.

378
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,250
<15-14,Kutner>不可能 要是这些药引起的话abc这些药很危险 已经导致...
<15-14,Kutner>That's ridiculous. If it is the drugs,they'reabcdangerous, and they've already caused--

379
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,600
<15-15,House>所以要给他重新用那些药abc再慢慢断掉
<15-15,House>that's why we're gonna put him back onabcthe drugs, and then wean him off again.

380
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,790
<15-15,House>但速度要慢
<15-15,House>Just much slower.

381
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,310
<15-15,House>为什么你们都看他?
<15-15,House>Why are you looking at him?

382
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,640
<15-16,Foreman>试试吧
<15-16,Foreman>Try it out.

383
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,150
<15-17,House>老板发话啦! 行动!

<16-4,Lucas>He does look like me,doesn't he?

388
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,400
<16-5,Cuddy>你把你的帽子给了他
<16-5,Cuddy>You gave him your hat.

389
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,500
<16-6,Lucas>我需要你出去一会儿abc我就能检查你的桌子了
<16-6,Lucas>I needed you out of here,soabcI could go through your desk.

<16-7,Cuddy>当然
<16-7,Cuddy>Of course.

391
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,910
<16-8,Lucas>衬衣真好看
<16-8,Lucas>Nice blouse.

392
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,550
<16-8,Lucas>这个颜色很衬你 我喜欢
<16-8,Lucas>I really like that color on you.

393
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,680
<16-9,Cuddy>告诉House 要是他想知道我在干什么abc只需要...
<16-9,Cuddy>Tell House that if he wants to knowabcwhat I'm doing, all he has to do--

394
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,090
<16-10,Lucas>不是House 是我
<16-10,Lucas>it's not House,abcit's--it's me.

395
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,100
<16-10,Lucas>我...我不知道
<16-10,Lucas>I was--Iabcdon't know.

396
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,990
<16-10,Lucas>我想我们一起喝一杯什么
<16-10,Lucas>I was thinking maybe we could getabctogether for a drink or something.

397
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,010
<16-10,Lucas>我不太清楚你喜欢什么
<16-10,Lucas>I wasn't sure exactly whatabcyou like to do.

398
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,220
<16-11,Cuddy>- 所以我想...abc- 你监视我？
<16-11,Cuddy>- So I thought...abc- you'd spy on me.

399
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,130
<16-12,Lucas>不 不是监视 更像是研究
<16-12,Lucas>No. No. Not spying. More like research.

400
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,310
<16-12,Lucas>我觉得在约女人出去之前abc先对她稍作了解总没坏处
<16-12,Lucas>I think it's a good idea to get to know a littleabcbit more about a woman before you ask her out.

401
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,330
<16-12,Lucas>让她知道你在乎的不仅仅是她的外表
<16-12,Lucas>Show you care about more thanabcjust what she looks like.

402
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,200
<16-13,Cuddy>尽管被你说得天花乱坠abc但你所谓关心的行为...
<16-13,Cuddy>As romantic as you make that sound, I'mabcpretty sure that what you're doing is...

403
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,920
<16-13,Cuddy>根本与变态无异
<16-13,Cuddy>not so much caring as creepy.

404
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,930
<16-14,Lucas>这评价不公平
<16-14,Lucas>That's not fair.

<16-15,Cuddy>你在翻我的抽屉
<16-15,Cuddy>You were scrounging through my desk.

406
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,810
<16-15,Cuddy>我能翻出什么来?
<16-15,Cuddy>What the hell am I gonna find out?

407
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,800
<16-16,Lucas>你去了密歇根

<16-16,Lucas>从这儿翻出来abc都是能在搭电梯时和同事聊上的
<16-16,Lucas>There's not one thing I can find out in here that youabcwouldn't tell a coworker while riding in an elevator.

412
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,060
<16-16,Lucas>我不是变态abc我只是对你感兴趣
<16-16,Lucas>I'm not a creep. I justabcthought you seemed interesting.

413
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,160
<16-16,Lucas>我闪人了
<16-16,Lucas>I'll go now.

<16-18,Cuddy>- In exchange for-- -abcno, no need for a date.

417
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,650
<16-19,Lucas>只要你雇用我 我会用全部时间abc来追问你关于你的一切
<16-19,Lucas>You'd be employing me, so I'd have all theabctime in the world to ask you all about you,

418
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,160
<16-19,Lucas>这也将从变态的偷窥abc变成正常的社会交往
<16-19,Lucas>and it would fall under the category ofabcsocializing instead of creepy stalking.

419
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,150
<16-20,Cuddy>那我还得发你工钱?
<16-20,Cuddy>And I'd be paying you?

420
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:29,900
<16-21,Lucas>我知道有点怪

<16-21,Lucas>But if you pay me while I checkabcyou out, it's--it's all cool.

422
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,090
<16-21,Lucas>而你也会有回报abc你抓住House的把柄
<16-21,Lucas>And you get value,youabcget leverage against him.

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,390
<16-21,Lucas>就能让他守规矩了
<16-21,Lucas>Help you keep him in line.

424
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,070
<16-22,Cuddy>你以为我要别人帮忙abc才能让House守规矩?
<16-22,Cuddy>You think I needabchelp keeping House in line?

431
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,240
<16-27,Lucas>谁不喜欢玫瑰呢?
<16-27,Lucas>Who the hell doesn't like roses?

<17-1,Rachel>就这样了?
<17-1,Rachel>That's it?

435
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,060
<17-1,Rachel>是你想到的

438
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,410
<17-4,Taub>我找不到开信刀
<17-4,Taub>I couldn't find the letter opener.

439
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,720
<17-4,Taub>于是去你的抽屉里找
<17-4,Taub>I went through some of the drawersabcin your desk looking for it.

440

<18-1,Thirteen>我们在逐渐降低你的剂量
<18-1,Thirteen>We've gradually reduced your dosage.

454

<18-1,Thirteen>实际已经不在用药了
<18-1,Thirteen>You're actually drug-free now.

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,150
<18-2,Brandon>我感觉很好 谢谢你
<18-2,Brandon>I feel great. Thanks to you.

456

<18-3,Thirteen>这是我的职责
<18-3,Thirteen>All part of the job.

459
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,280
<18-5,Foreman>他的脸怎么了?
<18-5,Foreman>What happened to his face?

460
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,240
<18-6,Thirteen>应该问他的荷尔蒙怎么了abc拿个冰袋来
<18-6,Thirteen>Question is whatabchappened to his hormones?

461
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,970
<18-6,Thirteen>这下可以排除试验药物了
<18-6,Thirteen>we can rule out theabcclinical trial drugs at this point.

462
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,900
<19-1,Kutner>他的身体被彻底清洗了两遍
<19-1,Kutner>His system hasabcbeen completely cleaned twice.

463
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
<19-1,Kutner>除非药物在楼梯底下躲起来了
<19-1,Kutner>Unless the drugs found aabchiding place under the stairs.

464
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,570
<19-2,Taub>药物可能会引起潜伏的神经病变
<19-2,Taub>Drugs could have set off aabcdormant neurological condition.

465
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,640
<19-3,House>说得对
<19-3,House>Good point.

466
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,560
<19-3,House>坦白也会带来伤害
<19-3,House>Coming clean can cause a lot of damage.

467
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,190
<19-3,House>譬如疏远 离婚
<19-3,House>Alienation, divorce.

468
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,160
<19-4,Taub>我老婆给我买了辆车子
<19-4,Taub>My wife's buying me a car.

469
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,970
<19-5,House>我说的是病人
<19-5,House>I was talking about the patient.

470
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,340
<19-7,House>- 你错了abc- 离婚只是个比喻
<19-7,House>- You were wrong.abc- Divorce was metaphorical.

471
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,760
<19-8,Foreman>会不会是Kluver-Bucy综合症?
<19-8,Foreman>what about kluver-bucy syndrome?

472
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,670
<19-8,Foreman>双侧颞叶损伤
<19-8,Foreman>Bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes,

473
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,190
<19-8,Foreman>主要症状为视觉失认和性欲高涨
<19-8,Foreman>visual agnosia and hyper-sexualityabcare the key symptoms.

474
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,740
<19-9,House>幸好他有个女友
<19-9,House>Good thing he's got that girlfriend.

475
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,120
<19-9,House>如果是Kluver-Bucy 他的大脑会短路abc甚至会吞掉自己双手
<19-9,House>If it's kluver-bucy,his brain'll meltabcdown, he'll try to swallow his own hands,

476
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,520
<19-9,House>那她就可以照顾他形同废人的余生了
<19-9,House>and she can take care of him forabcthe rest of his talentless life.

477
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,700
<19-10,Taub>你欠我一个道歉
<19-10,Taub>You owe me an apology.

478
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,590
<19-10,Taub>你为干涉我私生活编出的理据都不成立abc因为她有正当理由--
<19-10,Taub>Any rationalization you had for meddling in myabcprivate life disappeared when she had good reason--

479
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,120
<19-11,House>你说的没错
<19-11,House>you're right.

480
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,310
<19-11,House>我那套用不上了
<19-11,House>Fact is,nothing I said applies.

481
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,950
<19-11,House>你无需原谅她
<19-11,House>You had no reason to forgive her.

482
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,940
<19-11,House>也失去了让她原谅你的理由
<19-11,House>Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness.

483
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,660
<19-11,House>失去了当傻瓜的理由
<19-11,House>No reason to be an idiot.

484
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,790
<19-12,Thirteen>Kluver-Bucy不能解释癫痫和细胞激素风暴
<19-12,Thirteen>Kluver-bucy wouldn't explain theabcseizure or the cytokine storm.

485
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,210
<19-13,Foreman>断药反应
<19-13,Foreman>Withdrawal complications.

486
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,140
<19-14,House>而且 她送给你一份abc你自觉不配拥有的大礼物
<19-14,House>Then again, she is handing you a giantabcgift that you don't think you deserve.

487
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,110
<19-15,Thirteen>核磁共振结果显示
<19-15,Thirteen>The fact that the M.R.I.Showed

488
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,780
<19-15,Thirteen>双侧颞叶没有损伤 排除了你的理论
<19-15,Thirteen>no lesions on the temporal lobe tends to ruleabcout your lesions on the temporal lobe theory.

489
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,510
<19-16,Foreman>可能是循环问题 而是不是结构性损伤
<19-16,Foreman>The damage can be a circulatoryabcissue rather than structural.

490
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,670
<19-16,Foreman>核磁共振看不出来
<19-16,Foreman>We wouldn't see that on the M.R.I.

491
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,720
<19-17,House>Foreman说得对
<19-17,House>Foreman's right.

492
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,230
<19-17,House>给你老婆打个电话abc告诉她你今晚不回去
<19-17,House>Go call your wife, tellabcher you're not coming home

493
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,210
<19-17,House>因为你要为病人做一个头部血管造影
<19-17,House>'cause you have to give theabcpatient a cranial M.R.Angiogram.

494
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,650
<19-17,House>然后道晚安 挂电话
<19-17,House>Then say good night and hang up.

495
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,800
<20-1,Lucas>怪了 一个不能跑步的人abc却有这么多双跑鞋
<20-1,Lucas>Odd that a man who can't run wouldabcown so many pairs of sneakers.

496
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,650
<20-2,House>你忙完了能不能把这个挂起来?
<20-2,House>You mind hanging thisabcup when you're done?

<20-6,House>Well, if you hand her that...

502
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,540
<20-6,House>她会觉得不需要你
<20-6,House>she's not gonna need you anymore.

503
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,070
<20-7,Lucas>要是我没东西交差abc她会觉得我很无能
<20-7,Lucas>Well, if I don't hand her anything,abcshe'll think I'm incompetent.

504
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,240
<20-8,House>我不在乎她是否觉得你无能
<20-8,House>I don't care if sheabcthinks you're incompetent.

505
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,880
<20-9,Lucas>这招不管用
<20-9,Lucas>This isn't gonna work.

506

<20-11,Lucas>I know.

509
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,480
<20-12,House>所以你的掩护是你想干她
<20-12,House>That's why your cover isabcthat you want to do her.

511
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,570
<20-14,House>那喜欢她还有什么意义?
<20-14,House>Then what's the point of liking her?

512
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,490
<20-15,Lucas>我意思是 我不仅仅想干她abc我喜欢她

<20-16,House>Anything I can use toabcscare her into saying yes.

<21-2,House>对你来说窄了 对他却是正常的
<21-2,House>Narrow for you, normal for him.

525

<21-2,House>如果是血管的问题abc他早就出现症状了
<21-2,House>If there were problems with theabcvessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago.

526

<21-7,Taub>Combine that with those narrow vessels,abcthe brain doesn't get enough blood.

533
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,500
<21-7,Taub>引发了他的全部症状
<21-7,Taub>That causes all of his symptoms.

534
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
<21-7,Taub>如果可以诱发心律失常并定位
<21-7,Taub>If we can trigger theabcarrhythmia and identify it,

535

<23-3,Taub>Until you're convinced I'm a differentabcperson, one who won't do anything stupid?

<23-4,House>Guilt fades quickly.

<23-5,Taub>And why do you want it to fade? Whyabcdo you suddenly care about my marriage?

564
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,830
<23-6,House>因为...如果你的婚姻不破灭--

565
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,640

<23-8,House>Which is weird,because you've putabcyour bread in a lot of toasters.

570

<25-14,Lucas>听我多说几句

<25-14,Lucas>你却不疑心
<25-14,Lucas>And yet you're not suspicious.

644
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,540
<25-14,Lucas>要么你不够聪明 所以不怀疑abc这样的话

645
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,280
<25-14,Lucas>我对你的兴趣就没那么大了abc或者 你不怀疑
<25-14,Lucas>I am less interested inabcyou, or you're not suspicious

646
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:10,720
<25-14,Lucas>因为你知道这是伪造的照片

647
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,920
<25-14,Lucas>那样的话 我对你的兴趣就更大了

648
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,500
<25-14,Lucas>但如此一来 我就白折腾了abc因为你知道我和House在玩你 我就没戏了

649
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,990

656
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,380
<25-16,Lucas>你也不准备回馈我什么
<25-16,Lucas>A-and you were never gonna giveabcme anything worthwhile.

657
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,590
<25-16,Lucas>那你为什么还要来见我
<25-16,Lucas>Then why did youabcbother coming out with me?

658
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,520
<25-17,Cuddy>我想和House对着干
<25-17,Cuddy>I... wanted to screw with House.

659
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,230
<25-18,Lucas>和我出来就能?
<25-18,Lucas>By wasting my time?

660
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,200
<25-18,Lucas>讲不通
<25-18,Lucas>That doesn't make sense.

661
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,620
<25-18,Lucas>不...
<25-18,Lucas>No, uh...

662
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,520
<25-18,Lucas>一定有另外的理由
<25-18,Lucas>there must be another reason.

663
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,870
<25-18,Lucas>我再坐回来行吗?
<25-18,Lucas>Is it okay if I sit back down here?

667
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,650
<26-1,Thirteen>你感受不到心绞痛
<26-1,Thirteen>You'll never be able to feel angina.

668
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,970
<27-1,Taub>所以意识不到自己心脏病发
<27-1,Taub>You may not know if youabchave a heart attack.

669
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,050
<27-1,Taub>可能得不到及时的救治
<27-1,Taub>You may not be able to get help in time.

670
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,440
<27-2,Brandon>我平时的医生呢?
<27-2,Brandon>Where are my regular doctors?

671
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,620
<27-3,Thirteen>平时的医生?
<27-3,Thirteen>Regular doctors?

672
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,570
<27-4,Brandon>Taub医生和Hadley医生
<27-4,Brandon>Dr. Taub and dr. Hadley.

673
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,770
<27-4,Brandon>为什么不是他们来告诉我?
<27-4,Brandon>Why aren't they telling me this?

674
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,910
<27-5,Thirteen>Brandon 我是Hadley医生abc这是Taub医生
<27-5,Thirteen>Brandon, I am dr. Hadley.abcAnd this is dr. Taub.

675
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,460
<27-5,Thirteen>你说什么?
<27-5,Thirteen>What are you talking about?

676
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,610
<27-6,Brandon>这辈子我都没见过你们
<27-6,Brandon>I've never seen you before in my life.

677
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,350
<28-1,Taub>不能做手术
<28-1,Taub>we can't do the surgery.

678
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,150
<28-1,Taub>又回到起点 视觉失认
<28-1,Taub>We're back to where weabcstarted. Visual agnosia.

679
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,910
<28-2,Thirteen>需要重新检查神经系统疾病
<28-2,Thirteen>We need toabcreexamine neurological disorders.

680
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,160
<28-2,Thirteen>病情在缓慢发展
<28-2,Thirteen>Something's slowly progressing.

681
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,750
<28-3,Taub>不是发展 是一会儿有abc一会没有
<28-3,Taub>This isn't progressing. It'sabcthere, then it's not,then it is.

682
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,770
<28-3,Taub>间歇性出现的新症状
<28-3,Taub>It's a new symptom,intermittence.

683
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,780
<28-4,House>不相关
<28-4,House>It's irrelevant.

684
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,690
<28-5,Taub>新症状怎么不相关?
<28-5,Taub>Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?

685
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,460
<28-6,House>因为是同一个疾病引起的
<28-6,House>Since it points towards the same disease.

686
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,250
<28-6,House>间歇性符合romano-ward综合症的特点
<28-6,House>Intermittence can fit with romano-ward.

687
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,960
<28-6,House>仍需要做交感神经切除术
<28-6,House>We still need to do a sympathectomy.

688
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,300
<28-7,Taub>也许漏掉了什么
<28-7,Taub>maybe we missed something.

689
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,830
<28-8,House>- 毒素abc- 怎么会?
<28-8,House>- Toxins.abc- When?

690
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,110
<28-8,House>你们检查了所有瓶子 管子 颜料abc还给他脱毒了两次
<28-8,House>When you checked every bottle, every can,everyabctube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?

691
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,830
<28-9,Taub>也许有毒的颜料他在几个月前用完了
<28-9,Taub>Maybe there is a batch of toxic paintabcthat he used up a few months ago.

692
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,720
<28-10,Thirteen>那他该在几个月前病倒 而不是现在
<28-10,Thirteen>Then he would have been sickabcmonths ago, not now.

693
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,330
<28-11,Taub>他住院后体重减轻了
<28-11,Taub>He's lost weight since he got here.

694
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,750
<28-12,House>这是他喉咙吸不进空气abc还硬往里塞医院食物的症状
<28-12,House>That's a symptom of trying to cram hospitalabcfood down a throat he can barely get air down.

695
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,760
<28-13,Taub>瘦不是症状abc可要是毒素一年前就储藏在脂肪细胞里
<28-13,Taub>It's not a symptom, but what if theabctoxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago,

696
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,010
<28-13,Taub>现在释放进血液中
<28-13,Taub>and now they're beingabcreleased into his bloodstream?

697
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,990
<28-14,House>你从哪里找旧颜料?
<28-14,House>So where you gonna get this old paint?

698
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,190
<28-14,House>垃圾堆?
<28-14,House>City dump?

699
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,450
<28-15,Taub>从他的画中
<28-15,Taub>On his old paintings.

700
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,270
<28-15,Taub>他几年来都没卖出过画
<28-15,Taub>We know he hasn't sold one in ages.

701
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,780
<28-15,Taub>但画室里找不到几幅abc他藏起来了
<28-15,Taub>But there weren't many in hisabcstudio. He's hid them somewhere.

702
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,210
<28-16,House>要是你错了
<28-16,House>If you're wrong...

703
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,910
<28-16,House>他随时可能因为romano-ward综合症猝死abc你清楚么?
<28-16,House>he could drop dead from romano-wardabcat any moment. You okay with that?

704
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,180
<28-17,Taub>只要给我几个小时
<28-17,Taub>Just give me a few hours.

705
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,490
<28-18,House>你有一个小时
<28-18,House>You got one.

706
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,570
<29-1,Taub>我需要和他单独谈谈
<29-1,Taub>I need to talk to him alone.

707
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,740
<29-1,Taub>关于你的工作 画
<29-1,Taub>It's about your work. Your paintings.

708
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,580
<29-1,Taub>我要看你最近卖出的所有画作
<29-1,Taub>I need to look at all theabcones you've sold recently.

709
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,920
<29-2,Brandon>亲爱的 让我们单独谈吧
<29-2,Brandon>Honey, can you give us a minute?

<29-3,Heather>Brandon 告诉我发生了什么事
<29-3,Heather>Brandon, please. Tellabcme what's going on.

712
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,540
<29-4,Brandon>我在过去三年只卖出了两幅画
<29-4,Brandon>I've only sold two paintings inabcthe last... three years.

713
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,930
<29-4,Brandon>自从我们认识
<29-4,Brandon>Since we met.

714
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,950
<29-4,Brandon>一幅还是卖给表哥
<29-4,Brandon>One was to my cousin.

715
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,940
<29-4,Brandon>我靠参加药物试验挣钱
<29-4,Brandon>I've been makingabcmoney enrolling in drug trials.

716
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,690
<29-4,Brandon>一次两种 三种药
<29-4,Brandon>Two, three at a time.

717
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
<29-5,Heather>为什么骗我?
<29-5,Heather>Why did you lie to me?

718
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,340
<29-6,Brandon>我想成为...
<29-6,Brandon>I wanna be, uh...

719
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,870
<29-6,Brandon>你眼中的我 你让我感受到的自己
<29-6,Brandon>the way you look at me.abcThe way it makes me feel.

720
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,260
<29-6,Brandon>我想成为...你看到的我
<29-6,Brandon>Uh, I wanna be... what you see...

721
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,070
<29-6,Brandon>当你注视着我
<29-6,Brandon>when you look at me.

722
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,210
<29-7,Heather>你觉得我这么肤浅?
<29-7,Heather>You think I'm that shallow?

723
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,800
<29-7,Heather>当我注视你 我看到的是你
<29-7,Heather>When I look at you... I see you.

724
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,620
<29-7,Heather>那么
<29-7,Heather>So...

725
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,540
<29-8,Taub>你没卖掉的画放在哪里?
<29-8,Taub>where are the ones you didn't sell?

726
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,420
<30-1,Taub>不是颜料 是药物
<30-1,Taub>It's not the paint,it's the drugs.

727
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,790
<30-2,House>他没有用药
<30-2,House>He's not on the drugs.

728
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,080
<30-3,Taub>是很难理解abc但我看到了他最近六个月的画
<30-3,Taub>I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm lookingabcat his paintings for the last six months.

729
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,140
<30-3,Taub>四月 六月 八月是正常的
<30-3,Taub>They're normal april, june, and august.

730
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,310
<30-3,Taub>五月 七月 九月扭曲了
<30-3,Taub>But they're distorted may,abcjuly, september.

731
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,740
<30-3,Taub>每隔一个月 他视觉失认就会发作
<30-3,Taub>Every other month,he wasabchaving visual agnosia,

732
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,940
<30-3,Taub>因为每隔一个月 他就同时用三种药物
<30-3,Taub>because every other month he wasabcon all three drugs simultaneously.

733
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,810
<30-3,Taub>症状就是一个月出现 一个月消失
<30-3,Taub>The statin was oneabcmonth on,one month off.

734
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,850
<30-3,Taub>我不知道为什么会一时有一时无abc但确实是由于药物
<30-3,Taub>I don't know why the symptoms keepabccoming and going, but it is the drugs.

735
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,910
<30-4,House>藏在楼梯下
<30-4,House>They're hiding under the stairs.

736
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,590
<30-5,Taub>在脂肪里? 不会
<30-5,Taub>In the fat? That doesn't make sense.

737
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,940
<30-5,Taub>药物是不溶于脂肪的
<30-5,Taub>These drugs aren't fat soluble.

738
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,130
<30-6,House>我说的是楼梯 不是壁橱
<30-6,House>I said stairs,not closet.

739
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,170
<30-6,House>在他症状发作时用的药之前abc他用的是什么药?
<30-6,House>What was the last drug he was on before theabcdrugs he was on when the symptoms started?

740
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,610
<30-7,Taub>不知道
<30-7,Taub>I'm not sure.I think--

741
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,380
<30-8,House>抗酸剂
<30-8,House>antacid.

742
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,860
<30-9,Taub>- 你怎么知道?abc- 这合乎逻辑么
<30-9,Taub>- How do you know?abc- It makes sense.

743
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,730
<30-10,House>何况我看着档案呢
<30-10,House>Also, I'm looking at the file.

744
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,790
<30-10,House>怎么?
<30-10,House>Yes?

745
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,790
<31-1,Nurse>House医生打来的
<31-1,Nurse>It's dr. House.

746
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,480
<31-2,Chase>叫醒他吧 准备好了
<31-2,Chase>Uh, wake him up. We're done.

747
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,660
<31-3,Nurse>不 他说需要做手术abc不是这个
<31-3,Nurse>No, no--he says he needsabcsurgery, but not this one.

748
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,010
<31-4,Chase>他有说具体的吗?
<31-4,Chase>Did he give any specifics?

749
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,270
<31-5,Nurse>腹部手术去除一块毛粪石
<31-5,Nurse>Abdominal surgery to remove A... bezoar.

750
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,560
<32-1,Taub>像是一块毛团 由未消化的食物堆积而成
<32-1,Taub>It's like a hairball, butabcit's made up of undigested food.

751
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,610
<32-1,Taub>胃酸过少的话 就可能形成abcBrandon恰因用试验性抗酸剂而胃酸不足
<32-1,Taub>You can get it if your stomach acid's low, whichabcbrandon's was because of an experimental antacid.

752
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,600
<32-1,Taub>水果 蔬菜的纤维和皮黏在一起abc形成一个球
<32-1,Taub>Fruit and vegetable fibers and skinsabcget stuck together and form a ball.

753

<32-1,Taub>黏糊糊的 发酵 不断变大
<32-1,Taub>It gets sticky,ferments, grows.

754
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,100
<32-1,Taub>他服下的药物有些也被包裹进球里
<32-1,Taub>It starts sucking up someabcof the pills he'd taken.

755
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,820
<32-1,Taub>有些药没有发挥药效
<32-1,Taub>Some are never heard from again.

756
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,350
<32-1,Taub>但有些释放了
<32-1,Taub>But some get released.

757
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:50,420
<32-1,Taub>上周 很大剂量的三种药物同时作用
<32-1,Taub>For the last week,it's basically beenabcgiving him massive doses of all three at once.

758
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,910
<32-1,Taub>瞧这个...
<32-1,Taub>And that...

759
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,960
<32-1,Taub>就是为什么我不让Cameron养猫的原因
<32-1,Taub>is why I won't let cameron buy a cat.

760
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,010
<32-1,Taub>他会好起来的
<32-1,Taub>He should be fine.

761
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,340
<34-1,Taub>他告诉你真相 你高兴吗?
<34-1,Taub>Are you glad he told you the truth?

<34-2,Heather>是的 当然
<34-2,Heather>Yes... of course.

763
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,450
<34-2,Heather>但...
<34-2,Heather>But...

00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,660
<35-6,House>那你啥也没得到
<35-6,House>So you didn't get anything.

776

<35-7,Lucas>没
<35-7,Lucas>Nothin'.

777
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,020
<35-7,Lucas>我们大概做过头了
<35-7,Lucas>We probably overstepped.

778
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,770
<35-7,Lucas>你确实不像啦啦队的
