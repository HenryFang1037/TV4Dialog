91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,530
<3-1,House >你撒谎
<3-1,House >You're lying.

92
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,720
<3-2,House >有意思  你能证明吗
<3-2,House >Interesting theory. Can you prove it?

93
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,930
<3-3,Timmy >医生不持枪
<3-3,Timmy >Doctors don't carry guns.

94
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,430
<3-3,Timmy >他们不会射杀别人
<3-3,Timmy >They don't shoot people,

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,700
<3-3,Timmy >而且他们也不会搜查病人的家
<3-3,Timmy >and they definitely don't search patients' homes.

96
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,250
<3-3,Timmy >况且  我看过《低俗小说》
<3-3,Timmy >Plus, I've seen Pulp Fiction--

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,040
<3-3,Timmy >你就是在扒电影情节
<3-3,Timmy >the movie you're totally ripping off.

98
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,940
<3-5,Zack >等等  是蒂米·摩根吗
<3-5,Zack >Wait, uh, was it Timmy Morgan?

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,670
<3-6,House >-我不知道  -肯定是他
<3-6,House >- I have no idea. - It had to be him.

100
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,160
<3-7,Zack >他就痴迷于老电影
<3-7,Zack >He's, like, totally obsessed with old movies.

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,750
<3-7,Zack >《低俗小说》可不是老电影  什么
<3-7,Zack >Pulp Fiction is not an old mov--what?

102
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,950
<3-8,Colleen >所以你来这里
<3-8,Colleen >So you're here to talk

103
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,990
<3-8,Colleen >是向校长告蒂米的状吗
<3-8,Colleen >to the principal about something Timmy did?

104
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,270
<3-9,House >我对蒂米没意见
<3-9,House >I got no problem with Timmy.

105
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,270
<3-9,House >就算有的话  我也不会打小报告
<3-9,House >And even if I did, I ain't no snitch.

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,610
<3-10,Zack >那你来这干什么
<3-10,Zack >Then why are you here?

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,050
<3-11,House >为自己解决麻烦
<3-11,House >To dig myself out of a hole.

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,000
<3-11,House >结果给自己惹了更大的麻烦
<3-11,House >Instead I dug a bigger one.

109
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,960
<3-12,Zack >你干了什么
<3-12,Zack >What'd you do?

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,520
<3-12,Zack >你干了什么
<3-12,Zack >What'd you do?

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,600
<3-12,Zack >你干了什么
<3-12,Zack >What'd you do?

112
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,110
<3-15,House >你的眼睛怎么了
<3-15,House >What happened to your eye?

113
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,500
<3-16,Zack >与你无关
<3-16,Zack >It's none of your business.

114
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,850
<3-17,House >实际上  与你才无关  我是医生
<3-17,House >Actually, it's none of yours. I'm a doctor.

115
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,420
<3-17,House >已经伤了几天了
<3-17,House >It's a few days old,

116
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,990
<3-17,House >所以不是你们在这里的原因
<3-17,House >so that's not why you're here,

117
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,870
<3-17,House >除非你俩是因为密谋报仇被抓来的
<3-17,House >unless you two got busted for some sort of revenge plot.

118
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,690
<3-17,House >但那样的话  你们应该生气而非羞愧
<3-17,House >But then you'd look angry instead of...ashamed.

119
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,070
<3-18,Colleen >我才没有羞愧
<3-18,Colleen >I'm not ashamed.

120
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
<3-18,Colleen >有意思
<3-18,Colleen >Interesting.

121
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,490
<3-19,House >你还嘴硬  声称不羞愧
<3-19,House >You defensively insist that you're not ashamed,

122
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,420
<3-19,House >当然  这更证明你很羞愧
<3-19,House >which, of course, means you are ashamed.

123
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,980
<3-19,House >但是  你却是受害者
<3-19,House >And yet, you're the victim.

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,580
<3-20,Zack >你想知道她的黑眼圈怎么来的吗
<3-20,Zack >You want to know how she got the black eye?

125
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,940
<3-20,Zack >先告诉我们你在这里的原因
<3-20,Zack >Tell us why you're here first.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
<3-21,House >有人说过你很烦人吗
<3-21,House >Anyone ever tell you you're annoying?

127
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,230
<3-21,House >没有
<3-21,House >No.

128
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,460
<3-22,Zack >有  他一直被这么说
<3-22,Zack >Yes, all the time.

129
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,620
<3-22,Zack >但他说的对
<3-22,Zack >But he's right.

130
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,000
<3-23,House >想知道吗  你先说
<3-23,House >You want to know? You first.

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,400
<3-23,House >我没有杀人
<3-23,House >I didn't kill anybody.

132
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,350
<3-23,House >我必须来这演讲  所以我假想
<3-23,House >I have to be here, so I figured

133
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,620
<3-23,House >我的开场得华丽些
<3-23,House >I'd punch up the stakes in the first act.

134
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,540
<3-23,House >但我们确实  而且总是
<3-23,House >But we did, and almost always do,

135
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,950
<3-23,House >检查病人家里
<3-23,House >search the patient's home.

136
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,820
<3-23,House >如果我们事先告诉他们的话
<3-23,House >And if we tell them first,

137
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,290
<3-23,House >他们就会把一些东西藏起来
<3-23,House >then they can hide something that we need to know

138
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,140
<3-23,House >我们就无从知晓他们生了什么病
<3-23,House >in order to figure out what's wrong with them.

139
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,750
<3-24,Sophie >他们为什么要把潜在的"杀手"藏起来呢
<3-24,Sophie >Why would they hide something that could be killing them?

140
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,660
<3-25,House >因为他们是傻子
<3-25,House >Because they are morons.

141
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,480
<3-25,House >他们都是白痴  每个人都撒谎
<3-25,House >They're all morons, and everybody lies.

142
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,930
<3-26,Gabe >等等  如果每个人都撒谎的话
<3-26,Gabe >Wait, if everybody lies,

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,590
<3-26,Gabe >那就意味着你现在也在撒谎

00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,690
<4-13,House >没问题
<4-13,House >No problem.

174
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,740

175
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,650
<4-14,Corwin >我想你每天应该会诊不止一个病人吧
<4-14,Corwin >I assume you see more than one patient?

<4-15,House >就一个

179
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,060
<4-17,Gabe >等等  如果你每天只看一个病人
<4-17,Gabe >Wait, if you only see one patient,

180
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,430
<4-17,Gabe >剩余时间你都干什么
<4-17,Gabe >what do you do the rest of the day?

181
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,490
<4-18,Corwin >豪拉尼医生
<4-18,Corwin >Dr. Hourani?

182
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,560
<5-1,House >正好是午饭时间
<5-1,House >Just in time for lunch.

183
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,920
<5-1,House >如果你说的午饭是和董事会开电话会议
<5-1,House >By lunch, you mean a conference call with the board,

184
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,660
<5-1,House >正好是指我已经迟到二十分钟了的话
<5-1,House >and by just in time, you mean, 20 minutes late.

185
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,640
<5-2,House >我说的午饭是指
<5-2,House >I meant sex...

186
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,690
<5-1,House >做爱
<5-1,House >by lunch.

187
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,540
<5-2,House >我们从上汤菊花开始怎么样
<5-2,House >How about we start with a small tossed salad?

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,980
<5-3,Cuddy >那从今早开始  我节食
<5-3,Cuddy >As of this morning, I'm on a diet.

189
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,360
<5-4,House >什么意思
<5-4,House >Meaning?

190
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,730
<5-4,House >我说了  我很忙
<5-4,House >I told you, I'm busy.

191
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,410
<5-5,House >不  你告诉我你二十分钟前
<5-5,House >No, you told me you were supposed to be busy

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
<5-5,House >应该很忙
<5-5,House >20 minutes ago.

193
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,000
<5-5,House >但很明显你能把事情往后推
<5-5,House >But you were obviously able to put them off then,

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,610
<5-5,House >那你现在也可以继续推
<5-5,House >there's no reason you can't put them off now.

195
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,770
<5-6,Cuddy >换个说法吧  我那时想延后
<5-6,Cuddy >How about, "I wanted to then,

196
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,190
<5-6,Cuddy >但现在不想了
<5-6,Cuddy >and now I don't"?

197
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,740
<5-7,Cuddy >把你的手指从我电话上拿开
<5-7,Cuddy >Get your finger off my phone.

198
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,020
<5-8,House >显然有些事我们需要讨论一下
<5-8,House >We obviously have something we need to discuss.

199
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,050
<5-9,Cuddy >时机不对
<5-9,Cuddy >Now is not a good time.

200
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,840
<5-10,House >如果你生气是因为觉得
<5-10,House >If you're mad because you don't feel

201
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,040
<5-10,House >你没有感受到我表达出的爱慕之情
<5-10,House >you're getting the necessary amount of affection,

202
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,220
<5-10,House >直说就是了
<5-10,House >all you have to do is ask.

203
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
<5-10,House >说真的  现在不行
<5-10,House >Seriously, not now.

204
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,390
<5-11,House >如果我没记错  周日的早午餐不错
<5-11,House >If memory serves, I enjoyed a healthy Sunday brunch.

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,670
<5-11,House >所以你是在暗示
<5-11,House >So your insinuation--

206
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,990
<5-12,House >-你有什么问题啊  -你
<5-12,House >- What is your problem? - You!

207
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,830
<5-12,House >你就是我的问题
<5-12,House >You are my problem.

208
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,680
<5-12,House >你是这星球上最自私
<5-12,House >You are the most selfish, self-centered son of a bitch

209
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,870
<5-12,House >最我行我素的混蛋
<5-12,House >on the face of the planet.

210
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,760
<5-13,House >我受不了了
<5-13,House >And I'm sick of it.

211
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,210
<5-13,House >我  受够了
<5-13,House >I'm just...done.

212
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,290
<5-13,House >我没办法再忍你了
<5-13,House >I can't deal with you anymore.

213
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,050
<5-13,House >这就是一位平凡的医生平常的一天
<5-13,House >So that's what a typical doctor does on a typical day.

214
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,040
<5-13,House >还有问题吗
<5-13,House >Any questions?

215
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,490
<5-14,Alex >按摩棒是什么
<5-14,Alex >What's a vibrator?

216
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,720
<6-1,Colleen >你女朋友为什么生气
<6-1,Colleen >Why was your girlfriend so mad?

217
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,270
<6-2,House >那不重要
<6-2,House >It doesn't matter.

218
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,800
<6-3,Colleen >显然那很重要
<6-3,Colleen >Well, obviously it matters.

219
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,030
<6-3,Colleen >我是说如果她是你女朋友
<6-3,Colleen >I mean, if she's your girlfriend,

220
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,420
<6-3,Colleen >你应该在乎她的感受
<6-3,Colleen >you should care how she feels.

221
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,880
<6-4,House >我是说那与故事无关
<6-4,House >I mean, it doesn't matter to the story.

222
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,960
<6-5,Colleen >这是故事里最重要的部分了
<6-5,Colleen >It's the most important part of the story.

223
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,130
<6-5,Colleen >这是唯一重要的部分
<6-5,Colleen >It's the only thing that does matter.

224
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,910
<6-5,Colleen >你没有经常吻她  这是问题所在吗
<6-5,Colleen >You don't kiss her enough -- is that the problem?

225
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,170
<6-6,House >绝对不是
<6-6,House >Absolutely not.

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,340
<6-7,Colleen >按你的逻辑  就是这原因了
<6-7,Colleen >Which, by your definition, means it is.

227
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,710
<6-8,House >我们经常接吻
<6-8,House >We kiss plenty.

228
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,580
<6-8,House >该你了
<6-8,House >Your turn.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,210
<6-9,Colleen >那是什么原因
<6-9,Colleen >Then what's the problem?

230
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,470
<6-10,House >该你了
<6-10,House >Your turn.

231
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
<6-11,Colleen >是什么原因

232
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,040
<6-11,Colleen >打扰一下
<6-11,Colleen >Excuse me.

233
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,420
<6-12,House >校长到底什么时候回来
<6-12,House >When exactly will the commandant be back?

234
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,930
<6-13,Receptionist >不会太久了  先生
<6-13,Receptionist >Shouldn't be much longer, sir.

235
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,350
<6-14,Zack >然后呢
<6-14,Zack >Well?

236
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,150
<6-15,Colleen >现在你就打算不说话了
<6-15,Colleen >Oh, so now you're not gonna talk.

237
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,650
<6-15,Colleen >你真是太成熟了
<6-15,Colleen >That's real mature.

238
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,460
<6-16,Zack >好吧
<6-16,Zack >All right, fine.

239
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,880
<6-16,Zack >我们在学校后面接吻时被抓了
<6-16,Zack >We got busted for kissing behind the school.

240
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,570
<6-16,Zack >现在你知道为什么我们在这了
<6-16,Zack >Now you know why we're here.

241
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,410
<6-16,Zack >告诉我们你在这里的原因
<6-16,Zack >So tell us why you're here.

242
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,530
<6-17,House >交易是关于她那黑眼圈的由来
<6-17,House >The deal was about the black eye.

243
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,760
<6-18,Colleen >而且我们也没亲上
<6-18,Colleen >And we didn't kiss.

244
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,370
<6-19,House >你只是想让他求你  是吗
<6-19,House >So you were just making him beg, huh?

245
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,640
<6-19,House >没看出来你喜欢欲迎还拒
<6-19,House >I didn't have you pegged as a tease.

246
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,630
<6-20,Colleen >我不是那种人
<6-20,Colleen >I'm not a tease.

247
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,850
<6-21,House >现有证据表明你就是
<6-21,House >The available evidence suggests otherwise.

248
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
<6-20,Colleen >我才不欲迎还拒
<6-20,Colleen >I'm not a tease.

249
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,150
<6-22,Colleen >证明一下
<6-22,Colleen >Prove it...

250
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,430
<6-23,House >把你们的故事告诉我
<6-23,House >By--by telling me your story.

251
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,490
<7-1,Colleen >你这可悲的失败者  混蛋
<7-1,Colleen >You're a pathetic loser, jerk!

252
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,590
<7-1,Colleen >就算我得了脑癌  而你的嘴唇是唯一的
<7-1,Colleen >And I wouldn't kiss you if I had brain cancer

253
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,800
<7-1,Colleen >治疗方法  我也不会亲你的
<7-1,Colleen >and your lips were the cure!

254
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
<7-2,House >她真这么说的吗
<7-2,House >She actually said that?

255
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,110
<7-3,Zack >没错  大概是两天前
<7-3,Zack >Well, yeah, that was, like, two days ago.

256
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,880
<7-3,Zack >那不重要
<7-3,Zack >It doesn't matter.

257
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,560
<7-4,Colleen >我显然没引诱他或怎么样
<7-4,Colleen >I clearly didn't lead him along or anything like that,

258
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,050
<7-4,Colleen >这就证明我没有欲迎还拒
<7-4,Colleen >which proves I'm not a tease.

259
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,920
<7-4,Colleen >回到正题  你女朋友为什么生你气
<7-4,Colleen >So why is your girlfriend mad at you?

260
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,870
<7-5,House >我感受到了一种御姐气场
<7-5,House >I'm getting a kind of bossy vibe.

261
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,620
<7-5,House >我猜你就好这一口
<7-5,House >I take it you're into that.

262
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,590
<7-6,Colleen >别回答他
<7-6,Colleen >Don't answer!

263
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,260
<7-6,Colleen >该你了

<15-7,House >thinking the stench would clear the place out.

410
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,000
<15-7,House >但有些白痴为了不闻恶臭
<15-7,House >But instead of breathing through his nose,

<15-7,House >屏住呼吸

<15-7,House >the place is a perfect storm of mass hysteria...

414
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,870

<15-10,Colleen >你怎么偷的根本无关紧要

<16-1,Wilson >I didn't ask how you stole it. I asked why.

422
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
<16-2,House >还不够明显吗
<16-2,House >Isn't it obvious?

423
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,140
<16-3,Wilson >你觉得你看了她的预算表
<16-3,Wilson >You think you can tell why she's mad

424
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,130
<16-3,Wilson >还有每日行程
<16-3,Wilson >by reading budget spreadsheets

425
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,130
<16-3,Wilson >就能知道她为什么生气了吗
<16-3,Wilson >and per diem schedules?

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,760
<16-3,Wilson >我知道她为什么生气
<16-3,Wilson >I know why she's mad.

429
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,680

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,170
<16-4,House >那记录着她最内心的想法
<16-4,House >where she records her innermost thoughts...

431
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,760
<16-4,House >而不只是和我一起看毛片时的想法
<16-4,House >Instead of just watching porn with me.

432
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,070
<16-4,House >行了  成年人
<16-4,House >Oh, grow up.

<16-6,House >我什么都没做

<16-8,House >她无理取闹  我得想办法解决
<16-8,House >She's being unreasonable, and I have to fix it.

<16-27,Colleen >所以她生气是因为她是个女的
<16-27,Colleen >So she's mad 'cause she's a girl.

476
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,920
<16-26,House >现在她生气了是因为她的基因决定了

00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,670
<17-2,House >你知道她咋想的理论

494
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,130
<17-3,Zack >我没有逼她做任何
<17-3,Zack >I wasn't forcing her to do anything

495
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,290
<17-3,Zack >她不愿做的事

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,590
<17-5,Zack >同时又能装作很不乐意的样子
<17-5,Zack >while still being able to act like she didn't,

500
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,120
<17-5,Zack >所以她的朋友才不会  像是
<17-5,Zack >so her friends wouldn't get all, like,

501
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,640
<17-5,Zack >叫她荡妇什么的
<17-5,Zack >calling her a slut or something.

502
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,770
<17-5,Zack >再说这也没什么荡不荡的
<17-5,Zack >Not that it's slutty or anything.

503
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,970
<17-5,Zack >就是个吻而已
<17-5,Zack >It's just a kiss.

504
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,850
<17-6,Colleen >完全是胡扯
<17-6,Colleen >Not even close to true.

505
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,540
<17-6,Colleen >我只是不相信我会输
<17-6,Colleen >I just couldn't believe I'd lose.

506
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,760
<17-7,House >现在我们有点眉目了
<17-7,House >Ah, now we're getting somewhere.

507
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,060
<17-8,Colleen >不  我们没有
<17-8,Colleen >No, we're not.

508
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,250
<17-9,House >我以为我们有点了呢
<17-9,House >Oh, I thought we were.

509
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,500
<17-9,House >不  你知道我们没有头绪
<17-9,House >No, you thought we weren't,

510
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,140
<17-10,Colleen >这就是你的目的
<17-10,Colleen >and that's exactly what you want,

511
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,190
<17-10,Colleen >因为你不愿意告诉我们她为什么生你的气
<17-10,Colleen >because you don't want to tell us why was she mad at you!

512
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,760
<17-10,Colleen >你说你连自己的工作都不想做
<17-10,Colleen >You tell us you don't want to do your job

513
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,280
<17-10,Colleen >就是因为忙着黑进
<17-10,Colleen >because you're too busy trying to break

514
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,310
<17-10,Colleen >你女朋友的电脑好找到个法子
<17-10,Colleen >into your girlfriend's laptop to figure out a way

515
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,470
<17-10,Colleen >让她不生你的气了
<17-10,Colleen >to make her not mad at you.

516
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,820
<17-10,Colleen >但你却不肯告诉我们
<17-10,Colleen >But you don't tell us

517
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,610
<17-10,Colleen >她到底为什么生你的气
<17-10,Colleen >why she was mad at you.

518
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,920
<17-11,House >那太蠢了
<17-11,House >It's stupid.

519
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,880
<17-12,Colleen >说
<17-12,Colleen >Talk.

520
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,880
<18-1,House >我走了
<18-1,House >I'm out of here.

521
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,220
<18-1,House >除非
<18-1,House >Unless...

522
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,550
<18-1,House >瑞秋马上就该醒了
<18-1,House >Rachel's gonna be up soon.

523
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,840
<18-2,House >你怎么知道呢
<18-2,House >Well, you never know.

524
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,350
<18-3,Cuddy >我就是知道
<18-3,Cuddy >Yes, I do.

525
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,480
<18-3,Cuddy >走之前把垃圾带出去好吗
<18-3,Cuddy >Can you take the garbage out before you go?

526
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,410
<18-4,House >我倒是想啊  但是
<18-4,House >Uh, I-I-I would, but...

527
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,470
<18-5,Cuddy >拜托
<18-5,Cuddy >Oh, come on.

528
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,890
<18-5,Cuddy >又不是很多
<18-5,Cuddy >It's not a lot.

529
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,380
<18-6,House >早上腿总是很疼嘛
<18-6,House >Pain's always worst first thing in the morning.

530
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,700
<18-7,Rachel >妈咪
<18-7,Rachel >Mommy!

531
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,720
<19-1,Colleen >你用了她的牙刷
<19-1,Colleen >You used her toothbrush?

532
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,470
<19-2,Zack >这也太恶心了
<19-2,Zack >That's so gross.

533
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,810
<19-3,House >有什么大不了的
<19-3,House >What's the big deal?

534
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,470
<19-3,House >前一晚互换口水的时候
<19-3,House >It's not like she had a problem

535
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,130
<19-3,House >也没见她有什么意见
<19-3,House >swapping spit the night before.

536
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,220
<19-4,Colleen >也许她在乎的不是牙刷上有你的口水
<19-4,Colleen >Well, maybe it's not the swapping spit that bothers her,

537
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,110
<19-4,Colleen >而是你根本不在意她说过的话
<19-4,Colleen >but the fact that you don't listen to her.

538
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,840
<19-4,Colleen >她跟你说过别这样做吗
<19-4,Colleen >Had she warned you not to do it?

539
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,990
<19-5,House >我在意她说的话
<19-5,House >Oh, I listen to her.

540
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,490
<19-6,Colleen >可你刚刚才说你不在意
<19-6,Colleen >But you just said before that you didn't.

541
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,080
<19-7,House >不  我说的是我不记得她说什么了
<19-7,House >No, I said I didn't remember what she said.

542
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,710
<19-8,Colleen >不对  你说的就是你不在意
<19-8,Colleen >No, you said you don't listen--

543
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,080
<19-8,Colleen >我在意她说的话
<19-8,Colleen >I listen to her.

544
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,560
<19-9,House >成不
<19-9,House >Okay?

545
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,910
<19-9,House >相信我  我在意
<19-9,House >Believe me, I listen.

546
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,660
<19-10,Cuddy >那是我的牙刷
<19-10,Cuddy >It's my toothbrush,

547
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,860
<19-10,Cuddy >而且不只一次了
<19-10,Cuddy >and it's not just once.

548
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,310
<19-10,Cuddy >并不是说我多介意你用我的牙刷
<19-10,Cuddy >And it's not like I'd even care,

549
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,870
<19-10,Cuddy >但你也不能彻底把它给糟践了呀
<19-10,Cuddy >but you totally destroy it.

550
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,380
<19-10,Cuddy >你本来是应该用它来刷牙的
<19-10,Cuddy >You're supposed to brush with it,

551
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,320
<19-10,Cuddy >不是当磨牙骨头一样咬着玩
<19-10,Cuddy >not gnaw on it like a rawhide bone.

552
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,960
<19-11,House >我认为四蛀牙小姐应该
<19-11,House >I think Miss Four Cavities' time

553
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,340
<19-11,House >多花时间学学无蛀牙先生
<19-11,House >would be better spent copying Mr. No Cavities

554
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,940
<19-11,House >而不是批评他
<19-11,House >instead of complaining about him.

555
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,430
<19-11,House >考虑到我刚才做的事
<19-11,House >And given what I'd just been doing,

556
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,480
<19-11,House >我觉得你肯定也不想我出去吃饭的时候
<19-11,House >I thought you wouldn't want me going out to dinner

557
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,690
<19-11,House >嘴里有口臭牙上有韭菜
<19-11,House >without a good brush and a floss.

558
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,240
<19-12,Cuddy >麻烦请你就用我给你买的那把牙刷行吗
<19-12,Cuddy >Would you please just use the toothbrush I bought you?

559
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,130
<19-13,House >麻烦请你闭上嘴好好看电影行吗
<19-13,House >Would you please just shut up and watch the movie?

560
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,340
<19-13,House >我说了"请"
<19-13,House >I said, "Please."

561
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,780
<19-14,Zack >你干嘛非得
<19-14,Zack >Why would you have to

562
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,420
<19-14,Zack >在晚饭之前刷牙
<19-14,Zack >brush your teeth before you go to dinner?

563
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,440
<19-15,House >你不会想知道的
<19-15,House >You don't want to know...

564
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,780
<19-15,House >至少现在不想
<19-15,House >Yet.

565
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,900
<19-16,Colleen >你真恶心  而且蠢
<19-16,Colleen >You're gross and dumb.

566
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,790
<19-16,Colleen >你听她说话
<19-16,Colleen >You listen to what she says

567
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,120
<19-16,Colleen >只是为了告诉她她错得离谱
<19-16,Colleen >just so you can tell her how wrong she is.

568
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
<19-17,House >你又傻又天真
<19-17,House >You are clueless and naive.

569
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,380
<19-17,House >我必须得告诉她她错了
<19-17,House >I have to tell her that she's wrong,

570
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,250
<19-17,House >因为我不说就没人会说了
<19-17,House >'cause no one else will.

571
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,400
<19-17,House >她是院长
<19-17,House >She's the boss,

572
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,530
<19-17,House >也就是说她周围全是白痴
<19-17,House >which means she's surrounded by morons

573
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,970
<19-17,House >那些人不是怕她的
<19-17,House >who are either afraid of her,

574
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,390
<19-17,House >就是想拍她马屁的
<19-17,House >or they want to kiss up to her,

575
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,320
<19-17,House >要不就是想
<19-17,House >or they want to...

576
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,880
<19-17,House >亲她的
<19-17,House >kiss her.

577
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,450
<19-18,Colleen >但你不是
<19-18,Colleen >But not you.

578
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,670
<19-19,House >我已经亲过她了
<19-19,House >I already kissed her.

579
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,430
<19-19,House >而且我很尊重她  所以才不会把她
<19-19,House >And I respect her enough not to treat her

580
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,910
<19-19,House >当成弱不禁风的小花朵一样供着
<19-19,House >like some tender blossom who needs to be coddled.

581
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,780
<19-20,Zack >我懂
<19-20,Zack >Makes sense to me.

582
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,040
<19-21,Colleen >你当时就是抱着这种想法吗
<19-21,Colleen >That's what you think you did?

583
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,470
<19-22,Zack >是啊  必须的
<19-22,Zack >Yeah, totally.

584
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,580
<19-17,House >你是说
<19-17,House >You mean...

585
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,260
<19-13,House >什么
<19-13,House >Wha--

586
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,170
<19-8,Colleen >是你
<19-8,Colleen >You?

587
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,800
<19-23,Zack >不是  我没有打她
<19-23,Zack >No, I didn't punch her.

588
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,390
<20-1,House >你个白痴
<20-1,House >You're a moron.

589
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,440
<20-2,Zack >我不是故意的
<20-2,Zack >I didn't mean to.

590
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,360
<20-2,Zack >我那根棍子长得很诡异
<20-2,Zack >The stick had wicked heel curve.

591
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,030
<20-3,House >我说过你是个白痴了吗
<20-3,House >Did I mention you're a moron?

592
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,470
<20-4,Zack >刚才是你说的把你
<20-4,Zack >Okay, you just said it's wrong

593
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,520
<20-4,Zack >女朋友当成弱者对待是不对的
<20-4,Zack >to treat your girlfriend like she's weaker than you.

594
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,240
<20-5,House >我说的又不是得不得分
<20-5,House >I'm not talking about trying to score.

595
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,390
<20-5,House >我是在说你打那么高干啥
<20-5,House >I'm talking about shooting high.

596
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,740
<20-5,House >就跟穿网球鞋走木地板一样傻
<20-5,House >Tennis shoes on a wooden floor?

597
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,780
<20-5,House >往她两腿中间打  不就接不住了
<20-5,House >She obviously can't butterfly and cover the low corners.

598
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,010
<20-5,House >该你了
<20-5,House >Your turn.

599
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
<20-5,House >电脑怎么样了
<20-5,House >The laptop.

600
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,420
<21-1,Hourani >我肯定是因为局部癫痫产生幻觉了
<21-1,Hourani >I must be in the midst of a complex partial seizure,

601
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,560
<21-1,Hourani >你怎么会坐在我办公桌前
<21-1,Hourani >'cause I know you are not sitting at my desk.

602
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,630
<21-2,House >不好意思  我办公室里没有润肤露了
<21-2,House >Sorry. Ran out of lotion in mine.

603
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,820
<21-3,Hourani >你给我出去
<21-3,Hourani >Get the hell out of here.

604
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,540
<21-4,House >不行  这是唯一一个
<21-4,House >Can't. This is the only place left

605
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,990
<21-4,House >我能呆着而卡迪又想不到的地方
<21-4,House >that Cuddy'll never look for me.

606
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,690
<21-4,House >我还没发现我要找的东西
<21-4,House >And I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

607
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,680
<21-5,Hourani >我这么跟你说吧  你再不走
<21-5,Hourani >Well, I can tell you, what you're about to find

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,220
<21-5,Hourani >我就用脚上你屁股了
<21-5,Hourani >is my foot in your ass.

609
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,550
<21-6,House >我觉得我们没有足够的润滑油干这事吧
<21-6,House >I don't think we've got enough lotion for that.

610
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,230
<21-7,Hourani >你怎么进来的啊  门明明锁了
<21-7,Hourani >How did you even get in here? The door was locked.

611
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,010
<21-8,House >要么我能穿墙而过  要么...
<21-8,House >Well, either I can walk through walls, or...

612
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,530
<21-8,House >有发现了
<21-8,House >We have liftoff.

<21-9,Hourani >这是卡迪的日记吗
<21-9,Hourani >Is that Cuddy's journal?

614
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,740
<21-10,House >不  是我写给少女版时尚杂志的稿子
<21-10,House >No, it's a freelance piece I'm writing for Teen Vogue.

615
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,030
<21-11,Hourani >别  别关  让我看看
<21-11,Hourani >No, no, no. Let me see that.

616
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
<21-12,House >抱歉啦  我得走了
<21-12,House >Sorry, got to go.

617
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,160
<21-13,Hourani >钥匙还我
<21-13,Hourani >Key.

618
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,370
<21-14,House >还有件事要跟你说  豪拉尼
<21-14,House >I got to give you one thing, Hourani.

619
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,440
<21-14,House >你老婆  真是漂亮
<21-14,House >Your wife, she's beautiful.

620
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,520
<21-14,House >太惊艳了
<21-14,House >I mean, wow.

621
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,610
<25-1,House >谢谢
<25-1,House >Thank you.

622
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,700
<25-2,Wells >豪斯

623
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,170
<25-3,Zack >等一下
<25-3,Zack >Wait.

624
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,660
<25-3,Zack >我以为你就是豪拉尼医生啊
<25-3,Zack >I thought you were Dr. Hourani.

625
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,140
<25-3,Zack >你到底是谁
<25-3,Zack >Who are you?

626
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,320
<23-1,Colleen >这就是你沦落至此的原因吗
<23-1,Colleen >So that's why you're here?

627
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,760
<23-1,Colleen >实在是够囧的
<23-1,Colleen >Well, that was stupid.

628
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,660
<23-1,Colleen >我知道
<23-1,Colleen >I know.

629
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,160
<23-2,House >囧囧先生听候您的吩咐
<23-2,House >Mr. Stupid-Head at your service.

630
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,540
<23-3,House >-你在哪儿呢  -校长办公室
<23-3,House >- Where are you now? - In the principal's office.

631
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,920
<23-3,House >豪斯  没时间开玩笑了
<23-3,House >House, we don't have time for games.

632
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,180
<23-4,House >-正子扫描显示不是结节病  -太好了
<23-4,House >- Pet scan was negative for sarcoidosis. - Great.

633
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,550
<23-4,House >说明治疗起作用了
<23-4,House >Means the treatment's already working.

634
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,470
<23-5,Foreman >如果确实开始治疗的话  你可以这么说
<23-5,Foreman >It would if we'd actually started the treatment,

635
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,910
<23-6,House >-但我们没有  -为什么没有呢
<23-6,House >- but we didn't. - Why the hell not?

636
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,670
<23-7,Foreman >因为不是结节病
<23-7,Foreman >Because it's not sarcoidosis.

637
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,160
<23-7,Foreman >你自己来看看就会知道了
<23-7,Foreman >If you were here, you would know that.

638
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,410
<23-7,Foreman >他快不行了
<23-7,Foreman >He's dying.

639
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,640
<23-7,Foreman >他的肺的剩余部分也在衰竭
<23-7,Foreman >What's left of his lung is collapsing.

640
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,300
<23-8,House >-纵膈穿刺活检  -我不管活检结果如何
<23-8,House >- F.N.A. of the mediastinal... - I don't care about the F.N.A.

641
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,560
<23-8,House >我只关心他对治疗的反应
<23-8,House >What I care about is how he responds to the treatment.

642
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,190
<23-10,House >-豪斯  -按我说的做
<23-10,House >- House. - Just do it.

643
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,590
<23-10,House >结节病
<23-10,House >Sarcoidosis...

644
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,330
<23-10,House >属于已被排除的诊断
<23-10,House >is a diagnosis of exclusion,

645
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,250
<23-10,House >也就是说那些蹩脚医生费时费力
<23-10,House >which means that the cowards who spend their time

646
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,660
<23-10,House >不过是把不会导致病人死亡的病
<23-10,House >excluding what it isn't usually cause their patients

647
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,930
<23-10,House >从可能的病因中排除
<23-10,House >to die from what it is.

648
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,050
<23-11,Zack >我不明白
<23-11,Zack >I don't get it.

649
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,460
<23-11,Zack >你为什么用别人的名字啊
<23-11,Zack >Why would you lie about your name?

650
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,740
<23-12,Colleen >谁在意那个  她的日记里写了什么
<23-12,Colleen >Who cares? What did she write in her journal?

651
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,030
<23-12,Colleen >谢谢
<23-12,Colleen >Thank you.

652
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,990
<23-13,House >这才是我最在乎的
<23-13,House >That is exactly my point.

653
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,250
<23-13,House >怎么就没人相信我呢
<23-13,House >Why does no one ever believe me?

654
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:01,810
<23-14,Zack >什么啊
<23-14,Zack >What?

655
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,240
<23-15,House >他快死了这点并没让这个病例变得有趣
<23-15,House >Just because he's dying doesn't make it interesting.

656
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,620
<23-16,Zack >你背着她有人了  是不是
<23-16,Zack >You cheated on her, didn't you?

657
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,090
<23-17,House >没有  我没背叛她
<23-17,House >No, I didn't cheat on her.

658
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,680
<23-18,Zack >肯定不仅仅是因为你乱用她的牙刷
<23-18,Zack >It's obviously more than just you used her toothbrush

659
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,900
<23-18,Zack >然后还不倒垃圾
<23-18,Zack >and wouldn't take the garbage out.

660
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,520
<23-19,House >不  事实上  原因正是如此
<23-19,House >No, actually, it was exactly that.

661
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,130
<24-1,Cuddy >我想要一个人静一静
<24-1,Cuddy >I just need some time alone.

662
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,280
<24-2,House >就因为我用了你的牙刷吗
<24-2,House >Because I used your toothbrush?

663
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,850
<24-3,Cuddy >而且你还不把垃圾带出去
<24-3,Cuddy >And you wouldn't take out the garbage.

664
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,080
<24-4,House >这太扯了
<24-4,House >That's insane.

665
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,110
<24-4,House >你也这么觉得  不是吗
<24-4,House >You know that, right?

666
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,190
<24-5,Cuddy >你总是任意妄为  一直这样
<24-5,Cuddy >You do whatever you want, always.

667
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,800
<24-6,House >我说了我很抱歉  我...
<24-6,House >I said I was sorry. I was...

668
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,710
<24-6,House >我当时还没睡醒  没仔细听
<24-6,House >I was still half asleep. I wasn't paying attention.

669
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,630
<24-7,Cuddy >而真理总是在你这一边
<24-7,Cuddy >And you're always right.

670
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,110
<24-7,Cuddy >不是说你自认为自己是对的
<24-7,Cuddy >And I don't mean you always think you're right.

671
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,780
<24-7,Cuddy >而是你确实总是对的
<24-7,Cuddy >But y-you are actually always right,

672
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,310
<24-7,Cuddy >因为是非对错是你唯一关心的
<24-7,Cuddy >because that's all that matters.

673
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,540
<24-8,House >你这话毫无逻辑
<24-8,House >That doesn't even make sense.

674
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,690
<24-8,House >你想让我犯错吗
<24-8,House >What, you want me to be wrong?

675
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,090
<24-9,Cuddy >我是希望  你除了自己的一亩三分地
<24-9,Cuddy >I want you to care about more than just what you want,

676
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,970
<24-9,Cuddy >还能关心点别的
<24-9,Cuddy >what you think.

677
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,380
<24-9,Cuddy >你需要我  豪斯
<24-9,Cuddy >You need me, House.

678
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,450
<24-9,Cuddy >你甚至也许是爱我的
<24-9,Cuddy >And you may even love me.

679
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,490
<24-9,Cuddy >但你并不关心我
<24-9,Cuddy >But you don't care about me.

680
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,980
<24-9,Cuddy >而我需要能真正关心我的人
<24-9,Cuddy >And I deserve someone who does.

681
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,270
<24-10,Colleen >所以我说对了
<24-10,Colleen >That's what I said.

682
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,210
<24-10,Colleen >你不在意她说的话
<24-10,Colleen >You don't listen to her.

683
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,320
<24-11,House >你没说过
<24-11,House >You didn't say that.

684
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,390
<24-12,Colleen >不  我说过
<24-12,Colleen >Yes, I did.

685
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,780
<24-13,House >那就是我没仔细听
<24-13,House >Well, I wasn't listening, then.

686
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,210
<24-14,Zack >但你找到挽回这段感情的方法了  是吗
<24-14,Zack >But you found a way to fix things, right?

687
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,790
<24-14,Zack >所以你看到她本本里的内容时  很高兴
<24-14,Zack >That's why you were happy when you read her laptop.

688
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,820
<24-15,House >我的确找到了
<24-15,House >I did.

689
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,210
<24-15,House >至少我自己这么觉得
<24-15,House >At least I thought I did.

690
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,810
<25-1,House >最近  她收到了幼儿园的录取通知
<25-1,House >She recently got the thin envelope

691
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,860
<25-1,House >是她的首选幼儿园
<25-1,House >from her first choice preschool.

692
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,350
<25-1,House >但实际上  那家并不是她真正的首选
<25-1,House >But it turns out it was her fake first choice,

693
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,740
<25-1,House >因为她觉得  如果没有一笔可观的赞助费
<25-1,House >'cause she was convinced she couldn't get her kid

694
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,990
<25-1,House >或者走后门
<25-1,House >into her actual first choice

695
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,550
<25-1,House >她的孩子是进不了最中意的学校的
<25-1,House >without a substantial donation or an inside connection.

696
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,080
<25-2,Wells >如果是指布瑞学园  恐怕她是对的
<25-2,Wells >If it's Brye Park, I'm afraid she's right.

697
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,280
<25-3,Zack >等下  那是我们的学校
<25-3,Zack >Wait, that's our school.

698
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,040
<25-4,Colleen >不然还是在说其它学校吗
<25-4,Colleen >What other school would he be talking about?

699
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,160
<25-4,Colleen >你赶紧接着讲完
<25-4,Colleen >Just finish the story.

700
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,270
<25-5,House >我这么跟你说
<25-5,House >You know, I got to tell you--

701
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,050
<25-5,House >御姐气质有时是很性感
<25-5,House >there is bossy, which can be sexy.

702
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,090
<25-5,House >但过头了就令人反感...
<25-5,House >And then there's bitchy...

703
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,790
<25-6,Colleen >少废话  接着讲完
<25-6,Colleen >Finish the story.

704
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,750
<25-7,House >你很清楚这点
<25-7,House >You obviously know this because

705
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,190
<25-7,House >因为你是学校董事会成员
<25-7,House >you're on the school board,

706
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,550
<25-7,House >也就是说你有内部关系
<25-7,House >which puts you on the inside,

707
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,670
<25-7,House >而你还是这里的首席执行官
<25-7,House >and being the CEO here

708
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,690
<25-7,House >和卡迪之间也有来往
<25-7,House >obviously connects you with Cuddy.

709
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,310
<25-8,Wells >如果我们关系密切
<25-8,Wells >Well, if we're so connected,

710
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,470
<25-8,Wells >为何不是她在跟我说这些呢
<25-8,Wells >why isn't she the one asking?

711
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,800
<25-9,House >因为她觉得这样做不好
<25-9,House >Because she thinks it's wrong

712
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,950
<25-9,House >不该通过关系来走后门
<25-9,House >to use connections to cut in line.

713
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,700
<25-9,House >我不这么认为
<25-9,House >I don't.

714
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,440
<25-10,Wells >-我也许能帮上忙  -太好了
<25-10,Wells >- I might be able to help. - Fantastic.

715
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,770
<25-12,Wells >但你也要出点力才行
<25-12,Wells >But I could use a favor as well.

716
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,180
<25-12,Wells >你在哪呢
<25-12,Wells >Where are you?

717
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,560
<26-1,House >我有点事情要处理
<26-1,House >I needed to take care of something.

718
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,820
<26-2,Foreman >没有看到异物
<26-2,Foreman >It's not a foreign body.

719
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,920
<26-3,House >你肯定是看漏了
<26-3,House >You must have missed it.

720
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,220
<26-4,Foreman >如果继续进行成像
<26-4,Foreman >If we do any more imaging,

721
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,520
<26-4,Foreman >就要将放射物中毒也考虑到鉴别诊断中
<26-4,Foreman >we're gonna have to add radiation poisoning to the DDX.

722
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,570
<26-5,House >我说了是结节病
<26-5,House >I meant the sarcoidosis.

723
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,770
<26-6,Masters >活体检查和c-ANCA检测都是阴性的
<26-6,Masters >The biopsy and c-ANCA were both negative.

724
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,150
<26-7,Foreman >我们得做个肺部...
<26-7,Foreman >We're gonna have to do a pneumon...

725
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,070
<26-8,House >没有吸毒或酗酒的迹象
<26-8,House >No sign of drug or alcohol abuse.

726
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,040
<26-8,House >他不吸烟不嫖妓不吸毒
<26-8,House >He's not a smoker, a coal miner, or a potter

727
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,560
<26-8,House >就是结节病
<26-8,House >It's sarcoidosis.

728
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,660
<26-8,House >给他用皮质类固醇和甲氨喋呤来治疗
<26-8,House >Start him on corticosteroids and methotrexate.

729
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,230
<26-9,Foreman >如果有抗药性  而我们再给他用类固醇
<26-9,Foreman >If it's a drug-resistant bug, and we give him steroids

730
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,140
<26-10,House >那他会死
<26-10,House >He'll die,

731
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,300
<26-10,House >不过听起来也不比现在的情况糟多少
<26-10,House >which from the sound of it wouldn't be much worse.

732
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,520
<26-10,House >你这个傻冒
<26-10,House >You moron.

733
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,790
<26-11,Zack >但你得给他看你的证件
<26-11,Zack >But you have to show him your I.D.

734
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,560
<26-11,Zack >还有保险单吧
<26-11,Zack >and your insurance stuff.

735
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,990
<26-11,Zack >你不能就光告诉他个假名吧
<26-11,Zack >You can't just give him a fake name.

736
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,750
<26-12,House >你什么都不用出示
<26-12,House >You don't have to do anything.

<26-12,House >当然  那是十年前了
<26-12,House >Of course, that was ten years ago.

739
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,820
<26-13,Colleen >但你会赔钱给他  对吗
<26-13,Colleen >But you're gonna pay him, right?

740
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,450
<26-13,Colleen >毕竟这事是你的错
<26-13,Colleen >I mean, it was your fault.

741
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,860
<26-14,House >黄灯不是停车信号
<26-14,House >A yellow light does not mean stop.

742
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,260
<26-14,House >我至多只有百分之二十的责任
<26-14,House >It was, at the most, 20% my fault.

743
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,060
<26-14,House >鉴于保险公司自动认定
<26-14,House >Since insurance companies automatically put

744

<26-14,House >追尾方全责
<26-14,House >100% of the fault on the rear-ender,

745
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,310
<26-14,House >我小小的谎言其实
<26-14,House >my little lie was actually an effort

746
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,430
<26-14,House >让事情更接近真相了一些
<26-14,House >to achieve an outcome closer to the truth.

747
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
<26-14,House >而且差一点儿就奏效了
<26-14,House >And it would have worked, too,

748
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,760
<26-14,House >都怪那些多事的小屁孩
<26-14,House >if it weren't for those meddling kids.

00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,600
<26-15,House >我就是豪拉尼医生

750
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,300
<26-16,Alex >那你刚刚为什么说另一个医生是豪拉尼
<26-16,Alex >Then why did you say the other doctor was Hourani?

751
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,820
<26-17,House >这姓氏很常见嘛
<26-17,House >It's, uh-- it's a common name.

<26-31,Colleen >没错  可是校长可以报警
<26-31,Colleen >No, but the principal can call the police

770
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,190

<27-3,Colleen >-你没使诈  -我有

<28-6,House >And I need to convince someone of that.

813
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,150
<28-6,House >所以你认为你可以通过找人走关系
<28-6,House >And you think you can do that by getting someone

<28-6,House >而非助人
<28-6,House >not anyone else.
