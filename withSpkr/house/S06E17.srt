00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,400
<11-1,House>这强过麻醉剂的作用  使你清醒
<11-1,House>That'd be stronger than the narcotics.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,900
<11-2,Nash>护士说我可能只剩一两天可以活了
<11-2,Nash>The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.

124
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,000
<11-3,House>她在安慰你呢
<11-3,House>She was being kind.

125
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,200
<11-4,Nash>你就是豪斯医生
<11-4,Nash>You're Dr. House,

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
<11-4,Nash>对吗
<11-4,Nash>aren't you?

127
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
<11-5,House>我的天  可别说我们曾经拍拖过
<11-5,House>Oh, god, don't tell me we used to date.

128
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
<11-6,Nash>拐棍  我看过关于你的报道
<11-6,Nash>The limp. I read about you.

129
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,900
<11-6,Nash>我给你写了一封信
<11-6,Nash>I sent you a letter

130
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
<11-6,Nash>那时他们还没找到病因
<11-6,Nash>before they knew what was wrong.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
<11-6,Nash>我希望你能接下我的病例
<11-6,Nash>I tried to get you to take my case.

132
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,300
<11-7,House>是啊  你应该把报道看完的
<11-7,House>Yeah, well, you should have kept reading.

133
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,100
<11-7,House>心脏病这种小病请不起我的
<11-7,House>Heart disease is kind of below my pay grade.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
<11-8,Nash>最开始只是牙疼
<11-8,Nash>It started as tooth pain.

135
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,600
<11-8,Nash>没有人想到会是心脏问题
<11-8,Nash>No one got it that it was a heart problem.

136
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,400
<11-8,Nash>直到后来一系列的心脏病发
<11-8,Nash>Till I had a series of massive heart attack--

137
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,100
<11-9,Nash>你不会觉得心烦吗
<11-9,Nash>this doesn't bother you?

138
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,600
<11-10,House>你是指你满嘴污秽吗
<11-10,House>You talking with your mouth full?

139
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,700
<11-11,Nash>-有一点  -我是指
<11-11,Nash>- A little. - I meant the fact

140
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,300
<11-11,Nash>你站在这里眼睁睁地看着我死
<11-11,Nash>that you're standing here watching me die

141
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
<11-11,Nash>就因为我的病例太平淡
<11-11,Nash>because my file bored you.

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,900
<11-12,House>我的录取比率是二十分之一
<11-12,House>I take maybe 1 in 20 cases.

143
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,900
<11-12,House>被我拒绝的人大多都死了
<11-12,House>A lot of the people I turn down end up dying.

144
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,500
<11-12,House>你要这么想
<11-12,House>It's really a good argument

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,300
<11-12,House>世界上不只我一个人能看病
<11-12,House>for there being more than one me

146
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,100
<11-12,House>这样你就感觉好多了
<11-12,House>when you think about it.

147
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
<12-2,Wilson>-真心话  -好的
<12-2,Wilson>- Truth. - All right.

148
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,400
<12-2,Wilson>你玩过三P没
<12-2,Wilson>Have you ever had a threesome?

149
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,600
<12-3,Thirteen>没有
<12-3,Thirteen>No.

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
<12-4,Wilson>你没玩过吗
<12-4,Wilson>You haven't?

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
<12-5,Thirteen>双性恋就一定要玩三P吗
<12-5,Thirteen>Wait, just-- just because I'm bisexual?

152
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
<12-6,Wilson>当然
<12-6,Wilson>Well, yeah.

153
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,600
<12-7,Thirteen>你懂双性恋是什么意思吗
<12-7,Thirteen>Do you understand what bisexual means?

154
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,800
<12-7,Thirteen>"双"可不是指同时和两个人做爱
<12-7,Thirteen>It doesn't mean you have sex with two people at once.

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
<12-7,Thirteen>顺便说一句  你没问我玩过四P没有
<12-7,Thirteen>And by the way, you didn't ask me if I'd had a foursome.

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
<12-7,Thirteen>真心话还是大冒险
<12-7,Thirteen>Truth or dare?

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,800
<12-8,Wilson>等等  你玩过四P吗
<12-8,Wilson>Wait. You've had a foursome?

158
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,300
<12-9,Thirteen>没有  但现在你问了我两个问题
<12-9,Thirteen>No, but now you've asked me two questions,

159
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,400
<12-9,Thirteen>所以我也要问你两个
<12-9,Thirteen>so I get to ask you two.

160
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
<12-9,Thirteen>这就是为什么我是女王
<12-9,Thirteen>You see why I was the queen.

161
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,700
<13-1,Sarah>肯定不是沃克干的
<13-1,Sarah>Walker wouldn't do anything.

162
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
<13-1,Sarah>他也是我的儿子
<13-1,Sarah>He's my son too.

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
<13-2,Cuddy>我也不想说的太残酷
<13-2,Cuddy>I don't mean to sound cold,

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,900
<13-2,Cuddy>但他毕竟只是养子
<13-2,Cuddy>but he's your stepson.

165
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,100
<13-2,Cuddy>我们要考虑所有的可能性
<13-2,Cuddy>We can't ignore any possibility.

166
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,800
<13-3,Sarah>沃克最近在学校里
<13-3,Sarah>Walker's been getting in fights a lot

167
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,700
<13-3,Sarah>经常和人打架
<13-3,Sarah>at school lately.

168
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,700
<13-3,Sarah>上周  他用书打了另一个孩子
<13-3,Sarah>Last week, he hit another kid with a book

169
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
<13-3,Sarah>打出了血
<13-3,Sarah>hard enough to draw blood.

170
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
<13-3,Sarah>要是他对我的宝宝做了什么
<13-3,Sarah>If he did something to the baby...

171
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
<14-1,Chase>我们当时正在努力解决
<14-1,Chase>We were working on it.

172
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,700
<14-2,Cameron>却没有成功
<14-2,Cameron>And we failed.

173
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,500
<14-3,Chase>不是  你和豪斯谈过以后
<14-3,Chase>No, you had a conversation with house,

174
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,700
<14-3,Chase>回到家  只是通知我
<14-3,Chase>then came back, informed me

175
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,500
<14-3,Chase>我已经被他毒害太深
<14-3,Chase>I'd been forever poisoned by him,

176
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
<14-3,Chase>然后就开始收拾行李
<14-3,Chase>and started packing.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
<14-4,Cameron>这么说可真有意思
<14-4,Cameron>It's interesting how your story leaves out the part

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,900
<14-4,Cameron>怎么不提你杀了一个人的那部分呢
<14-4,Cameron>where you murdered another human being.

179
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,000
<14-5,Chase>一个想实施种族屠杀的独裁者
<14-5,Chase>A dictator who was committing genocide.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
<14-5,Chase>你当时自己也想那么干来着
<14-5,Chase>You thought about doing it yourself.

181
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,200
<14-6,Cameron>-但我没干  -对
<14-6,Cameron>- But I didn't. - Right.

182
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
<14-7,Chase>因为你中他的毒没我深
<14-7,Chase>Because you're not toxic like I am.

183
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
<14-8,Cameron>你以为咱俩在这儿会怎么样
<14-8,Cameron>What do you think is gonna happen here?

184
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
<14-8,Cameron>你打算说服我回到你身边吗
<14-8,Cameron>You're gonna logic me into coming back?

185
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,800
<15-1,Taub>这儿记录了三十多次医疗事故
<15-1,Taub>There must be over 30 malpractice settlements in here.

186
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,100
<15-2,Foreman>他连CT都没做就去脑活检
<15-2,Foreman>He did a brain biopsy without CT mapping,

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,400
<15-2,Foreman>导致病人因脑疝死亡
<15-2,Foreman>causing brain herniation and death.

188
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,200
<15-3,Taub>看这个
<15-3,Taub>Look at this one.

189
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,900
<15-3,Taub>他拙劣的阴茎切除术
<15-3,Taub>Patient lost four liters of blood

190
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,100
<15-3,Taub>害病人失了四升血
<15-3,Taub>from a botched penisectomy.

191
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,800
<15-4,Foreman>这个病人叫丽莎·卡迪
<15-4,Foreman>On a patient named Lisa Cuddy?

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
<15-4,Foreman>该死的  这些病人都叫丽莎·卡迪
<15-4,Foreman>Damn it. They're all named Lisa Cuddy.

193
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,700
<15-5,Taub>他人都不在这  还捉弄我们
<15-5,Taub>He's not even here, and he's screwing with us.

194
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,900
<15-5,Taub>这有什么好玩的
<15-5,Taub>Where's the joy in that?

195
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,200
<15-6,Foreman>你真想知道他想些什么吗
<15-6,Foreman>You really want to get into his head?

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,500
<15-7,Taub>想  但我不打算刺伤自己的腿
<15-7,Taub>Yeah, but I decided against stabbing myself in the leg

197
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,800
<15-7,Taub>或是对止疼药上瘾
<15-7,Taub>or getting addicted to pain pills.

198
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,000
<15-8,Foreman>你可以  跳过刺腿那步
<15-8,Foreman>You can, uh... skip the stabbing.

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,700
<15-9,Taub>你从哪弄来的
<15-9,Taub>Where did you--

200
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,600
<15-10,Foreman>从门诊一个骗药的人那没收的
<15-10,Foreman>Confiscated them from a drug seeker in that clinic.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
<15-10,Foreman>还没来得及上交呢
<15-10,Foreman>Didn't get a chance to turn 'em in.

202
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,200
<15-11,Taub>反正要在这待好几个小时
<15-11,Taub>It is after hours.

203
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,900
<15-11,Taub>我吃一片好了
<15-11,Taub>I'll take one.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
<15-11,Taub>体会体会豪斯的处境
<15-11,Taub>Walk in House's shoes for a night.

205
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,300
<15-12,Foreman>一片
<15-12,Foreman>One?

206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
<15-12,Foreman>他可不只吃这么点儿
<15-12,Foreman>I believe he wears a larger size.

207
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,900
<16-1,House>没有卡片  没有鲜花
<16-1,House>No cards, no flowers,

208
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,100
<16-1,House>连个电话都没有
<16-1,House>Not even a phone call.

209
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,300
<16-1,House>我猜猜  你是灯塔管理员
<16-1,House>Let me guess. Lighthouse keeper.

210
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,800
<16-2,Nash>我在普林斯顿当了26年的古典文学教授
<16-2,Nash>I was a classics professor at princeton for 26 years.

211
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,900
<16-2,Nash>主要是做研究
<16-2,Nash>Mostly research.

212
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,600
<16-3,House>也就是说你最亲近的同事两千年前就死了
<16-3,House>So your closest colleagues died 2,000 years ago.

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
<16-3,House>肯定是这样
<16-3,House>That must be it.

214
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,700
<16-3,House>不是说你没有朋友
<16-3,House>Not that you have no friends

215
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
<16-3,House>只是因为你是个可悲的混蛋
<16-3,House>Because, say, you're a miserable bastard.

216
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,100
<16-4,Nash>关你什么事
<16-4,Nash>What do you care?

217
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,600
<16-5,House>接下来几个小时会很难熬
<16-5,House>The next few hours are gonna be grim.

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,300
<16-5,House>等我尽快离开这里后
<16-5,House>There'll be nausea, pain, no company,

219
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,800
<16-5,House>你会觉得恶性  疼痛  没人陪你
<16-5,House>As soon as I can get myself out of here.

220
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
<16-5,House>我可以把阀门松开
<16-5,House>I can unlock the regulator.

221
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,000
<16-5,House>麻醉剂会让你失去知觉
<16-5,House>You can put yourself in a narcotic haze,

222
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,000
<16-5,House>就此安息
<16-5,House>Sleep blissfully to the end.

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
<16-6,Nash>这是在帮我还是帮你
<16-6,Nash>Oh, is that a favor to me or to you?

224
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
<16-7,House>双赢
<16-7,House>Win-win.

225
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,100
<16-8,Nash>不用了  谢谢
<16-8,Nash>No, thanks.

226
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,500
<16-9,House>你想让我因为没接收你这个病例而愧疚吗
<16-9,House>Are you trying to guilt me for not taking your case?

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,700
<16-10,Nash>你以为古典主义者不相信命运吗
<16-10,Nash>You think a classicist doesn't believe in fate?

228
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,600
<16-11,House>你觉得奥德修斯[特洛伊]会像个败者一般
<16-11,House>You think Odysseus would lie whimpering

229
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,300
<16-11,House>躺在病床上啜泣不止吗
<16-11,House>like a loser in a hospital bed?

230
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
<16-11,House>按我的建议做吧
<16-11,House>Come on, take my offer.

231
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,100
<16-11,House>沉浸在药物带来的快感之中  平静离世
<16-11,House>Take the drug holiday. Numb yourself out.

232
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,300
<16-12,Nash>我觉得你才是把自己封闭得沉默的人
<16-12,Nash>I think you're the one who wants to numb himself out.

233
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,500
<17-1,Thirteen>真心话
<17-1,Thirteen>Truth.

234
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,300
<17-2,Wilson>你向你爸爸坦白双性恋时  他有什么反应
<17-2,Wilson>How did your dad react when you came out to him?

235
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,500
<17-3,Thirteen>泡了杯茶给我
<17-3,Thirteen>He made me tea.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,800
<17-3,Thirteen>真的  不管我告诉他什么
<17-3,Thirteen>Seriously. Doesn't matter what I tell him.

237
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,200
<17-3,Thirteen>他都笑着告诉我  他支持我
<17-3,Thirteen>He smiles, tells me he supports me,

238
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,700
<17-3,Thirteen>还泡薄荷茶给我喝
<17-3,Thirteen>And makes me some peppermint tea.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,900
<17-3,Thirteen>真心话还是大冒险
<17-3,Thirteen>Truth or dare?

240
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,600
<17-4,Wilson>真心话
<17-4,Wilson>Um, truth.

241
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,700
<17-5,Thirteen>你在谈恋爱吗
<17-5,Thirteen>Are you dating anyone?

242
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,500
<17-6,Wilson>现在吗  没有
<17-6,Wilson>Now? No.

243
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,000
<17-6,Wilson>有意思
<17-6,Wilson>Interesting.

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,500
<17-7,Thirteen>你加了个修饰语
<17-7,Thirteen>You added a modifier.

245
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,700
<17-7,Thirteen>真心话
<17-7,Thirteen>Truth.

246
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,000
<17-8,Wilson>你和福曼约会的时候
<17-8,Wilson>Um, when you were dating Foreman...

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
<17-9,Thirteen>-不不不  -怎么啦
<17-9,Thirteen>- No, no. No. - What?

248
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,300
<17-11,Thirteen>如果是他或者我俩的私事
<17-11,Thirteen>If it was something personal about him or us,

249
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,800
<17-11,Thirteen>我觉得不太方便回答
<17-11,Thirteen>I just don't think that's right to answer.

250
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
<17-11,Thirteen>毕竟大家是同事
<17-11,Thirteen>We all work together.

251
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,000
<17-12,Wilson>可这才是这个游戏的关键
<17-12,Wilson>That's the whole point of this game--

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,800
<17-12,Wilson>私人的  最好是窘事
<17-12,Wilson>Something personal, preferably embarrassing.

253
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,700
<17-13,Thirteen>换点别的吧
<17-13,Thirteen>Just pick something else.

254
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,300
<17-14,Wilson>这就是你的问题了
<17-14,Wilson>You see, this is your problem.

255
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,100
<17-14,Wilson>你装成一副很开明的样子
<17-14,Wilson>You act like you're so liberal and open,

256
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,900
<17-14,Wilson>其实你一点都不开明
<17-14,Wilson>But you are the least--

257
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,600
<17-15,Thirteen>我变卦了  大冒险别让 我脱衣服就行
<17-15,Thirteen>I changed my mind. Dare. Just no nudity.

258
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
<17-16,Wilson>就脱衣服吧
<17-16,Wilson>Yes, nudity.

259
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,000
<17-16,Wilson>我想让你把胸部
<17-16,Wilson>I want you to show your breasts

260
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,700
<17-16,Wilson>给陶博看
<17-16,Wilson>to Taub.

261
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
<17-17,Thirteen>这是有史以来最蠢的大冒险了
<17-17,Thirteen>That is the most idiotic dare ever.

262
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,700
<17-17,Thirteen>你玩没玩过这个游戏啊
<17-17,Thirteen>Have you ever played this game?

263
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,600
<17-18,Wilson>我觉得让你把胸部给我看
<17-18,Wilson>Well, I thought showing me your breasts

264
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,900
<17-18,Wilson>有点趁人之危
<17-18,Wilson>would be a little exploitative.

265
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,400
<17-19,Thirteen>你说的大冒险是未来的  大天才
<17-19,Thirteen>Your dare is in the future, genius.

266
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
<17-20,Wilson>嘿  你是说你会食言吗
<17-20,Wilson>Hey, if you're saying you won't do it...

267
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,400
<17-21,Thirteen>不不  我当然会把我的胸部给陶博看
<17-21,Thirteen>No, no, no, of course I'll show my breasts to Taub.

268
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
<17-21,Thirteen>可能是明天
<17-21,Thirteen>Tomorrow, perhaps,

269
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,400
<17-21,Thirteen>或者明年的什么时候
<17-21,Thirteen>or maybe some time next year, you know,

270
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
<17-21,Thirteen>因为我要捍卫我的荣誉
<17-21,Thirteen>because I'm honor-bound.

271
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,700
<17-21,Thirteen>真心话还是大冒险
<17-21,Thirteen>Truth or dare?

272
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,600
<18-1,Cuddy>你现在不开心我能理解
<18-1,Cuddy>It's understandable that you wouldn't be happy right now.

273
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,800
<18-1,Cuddy>要面对生活的变数
<18-1,Cuddy>Your world is changing.

274
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
<18-1,Cuddy>害怕吗
<18-1,Cuddy>You scared?

275
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,400
<18-1,Cuddy>你对你妹妹怎么想
<18-1,Cuddy>And how do you feel about your sister?

276
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,100
<18-2,Walker>我讨厌她
<18-2,Walker>I hate her.

277
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
<18-3,Cuddy>沃克  这很重要
<18-3,Cuddy>Walker, this is important.

278
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,000
<18-3,Cuddy>你有没有把宝宝怎么样了呢
<18-3,Cuddy>Did you do anything to the baby?

279
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
<18-3,Cuddy>是不是把她抱去哪儿了
<18-3,Cuddy>Did you move her somewhere?

280
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,600
<18-3,Cuddy>-把她藏起来了  -没有
<18-3,Cuddy>- Hide her? - No.

281
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
<18-5,Cuddy>我们不会怪你的
<18-5,Cuddy>Nobody'd be mad at you.

282
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
<18-6,Walker>我说了没有  别再问我了
<18-6,Walker>I said no, so stop asking me.

283
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,500
<19-1,Nash>一天都疼得厉害
<19-1,Nash>Bad pain day?

284
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,500
<19-2,House>整个月都疼得厉害
<19-2,House>Bad pain month.

285
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
<19-3,Nash>自从我戒毒瘾以来
<19-3,Nash>Since I'm not using it...

286
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
<19-3,Nash>如果你不想要吗啡
<19-3,Nash>Oh, if you don't want the morphine,

287
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,700
<19-3,Nash>你一定自己藏着什么秘密武器吧
<19-3,Nash>you must have something of your own, hmm?

288
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,700
<19-4,House>我那时在戒毒
<19-4,House>I was in rehab.

289
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,500
<19-4,House>我的秘密武器出了点小小的问题
<19-4,House>I had a little problem with the something of my own.

290
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,300
<19-4,House>我现在只吃布洛芬[抗炎镇痛药]
<19-4,House>Now all I take is ibuprofen,

291
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,400
<19-4,House>结果疼痛加重了两级
<19-4,House>And it's two flights up.

292
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,700
<19-5,Nash>一整个月都这样吗
<19-5,Nash>For the whole month?

293
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
<19-6,House>疼痛感转移了
<19-6,House>The pain's migrated.

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,900
<19-6,House>我估计是动脉血管壁被破坏了
<19-6,House>I think the arterial wall is damaged.

295
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,300
<19-7,Nash>什么  你没确认一下
<19-7,Nash>What, you don't know?

296
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,800
<19-8,House>我还没照过动脉X光
<19-8,House>I haven't had an arteriogram yet.

297
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
<19-9,Nash>其实你是不想去照
<19-9,Nash>And you don't want the test.

298
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,000
<19-9,Nash>你生怕动脉血管壁完好无损
<19-9,Nash>In case the arterial wall is fine.

299
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,800
<19-9,Nash>因为这就意味着
<19-9,Nash>which would mean that the pain

300
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
<19-9,Nash>疼痛有其他的来源
<19-9,Nash>is coming from something else.

301
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,400
<19-10,House>她叫什么名字
<19-10,House>What's her name?

302
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,400
<40-1,Taub>有意思
<40-1,Taub>Interesting...

303
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,100
<19-9,Nash>你的思维从病痛一下跳到离殇
<19-9,Nash>That you jump from physical pain to long-lost love.

304
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,200
<19-10,House>你这是感情投射
<19-10,House>You're projecting.

305
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,100
<19-10,House>你的那个她叫什么名字
<19-10,House>So what's her name?

306
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
<19-11,Nash>现在什么时间了
<19-11,Nash>What time is it?

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
<19-12,House>时间于你有何意义
<19-12,House>What does it matter to you?

308
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,600
<19-12,House>现在还剩四小时
<19-12,House>It's "T" Minus four hours.

309
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
<19-12,House>八点二十
<19-12,House>8:20.

310
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
<19-12,House>告诉我她是谁
<19-12,House>Now tell me who she is

311
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,200
<19-12,House>她来看你或是打电话给你
<19-12,House>And what are the pathetically long odds

312
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,700
<19-12,House>的可能性还剩下可怜的几分
<19-12,House>That she's gonna visit or call.

313
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,400
<19-12,House>还有为什么这会是你不肯吃吗啡的理由
<19-12,House>And why that's a reason not to take the morphine.

315
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
<20-3,Taub>房间还在打转吗
<20-3,Taub>Is the room still spinning?

316
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,700
<20-4,Foreman>我眼前的在转
<20-4,Foreman>Mine is.

317
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,700
<20-4,Foreman>看来我们不该吃这么多
<20-4,Foreman>Maybe we shouldn't have taken so many.

318
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,700
<20-5,Taub>我试试看能不能站起来
<20-5,Taub>I'm gonna try to stand up.

319
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,500
<20-6,Foreman>你小心了
<20-6,Foreman>You be careful.

320
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
<20-7,Taub>喔耶  成功了
<20-7,Taub>Oh, yeah. That's working.

321
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,100
<20-8,Foreman>我的脸没知觉了
<20-8,Foreman>I can't feel my face.

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
<20-9,Taub>不是吧
<20-9,Taub>No way.

323
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,400
<20-9,Taub>是
<20-9,Taub>Way.

324
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,100
<20-10,Foreman>打我
<20-10,Foreman>Hit me.

325
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,300
<20-11,Taub>什么
<20-11,Taub>What?

326
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,100
<20-12,Foreman>打我的脸
<20-12,Foreman>Hit me in the face.

327
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,900
<20-13,Taub>真的打
<20-13,Taub>Seriously?

328
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
<20-14,Foreman>你心里早就想这么干了吧
<20-14,Foreman>You know you've always wanted to.

329
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
<20-14,Foreman>-现在机会来了  -是个好主意
<20-14,Foreman>- Now's your chance. - That's a great idea.

330
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
<20-15,Taub>我们成立个搏击俱乐部
<20-15,Taub>We start a fight club.

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,600
<20-15,Taub>或许我们可以...
<20-15,Taub>Maybe we...

332
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
<20-15,Taub>天啊
<20-15,Taub>Oh, my god!

333
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,500
<20-15,Taub>你  酷毙了
<20-15,Taub>You-- that is so cool!

334
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,500
<20-16,Foreman>好吧
<20-16,Foreman>Okay.

335
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
<20-17,Taub>我的手还有感觉哦
<20-17,Taub>I can still feel my hand.

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
<20-18,Foreman>我只是没作好准备
<20-18,Foreman>I wasn't ready.

337
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,800
<20-19,Taub>你原本打算怎么着
<20-19,Taub>What were you gonna do?

338
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,500
<20-19,Taub>收缩你的山羊胡子肌
<20-19,Taub>Flex your goatee muscles?

339
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,900
<20-19,Taub>等等
<20-19,Taub>Wait a minute.

340
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
<20-19,Taub>这些是你的信誉档案吗
<20-19,Taub>This is your credentials file?

341
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,700
<20-20,Foreman>给我
<20-20,Foreman>Hey, give me that.

342
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,500
<20-21,Taub>原来你是为这个而来
<20-21,Taub>That's why you came down here.

343
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,100
<20-21,Taub>而不是病人档案
<20-21,Taub>Not for the patient file.

344
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,200
<20-21,Taub>你小子...
<20-21,Taub>You wanted...

345
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,600
<20-21,Taub>你居然想...
<20-21,Taub>You wanted...

346
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
<21-1,Cameron>这样吧  Robert
<21-1,Cameron>Okay, Robert.

347
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
<21-1,Cameron>你想问什么
<21-1,Cameron>I will answer

348
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,900
<21-1,Cameron>我都回答你
<21-1,Cameron>whatever questions you want.

349
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,800
<21-1,Cameron>但过后你必须要签了这些文件
<21-1,Cameron>But then you're gonna have to sign the papers.

350
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,900
<21-2,Chase>你爱过我吗
<21-2,Chase>Did you ever love me?

351
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,400
<21-3,Cameron>你怎么问得出来
<21-3,Cameron>How can you even ask that?

352
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
<21-4,Chase>你第一次和我上床
<21-4,Chase>The first time you slept with me

353
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
<21-4,Chase>是因为你当时吸了冰毒
<21-4,Chase>was because you were on crystal meth.

354
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
<21-5,Cameron>我嗑药是因为我情绪上来了
<21-5,Cameron>I was on the drugs because I was emotional.

355
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
<21-5,Cameron>是我的感情到了我才投入你的怀抱
<21-5,Cameron>It was the emotions that led to the sex,

356
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,400
<21-5,Cameron>-不是因为药劲儿  -你说谎
<21-5,Cameron>- Not the drugs. - Not true.

357
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,700
<21-6,Chase>之后除了性你拒绝我们之间进一步发展
<21-6,Chase>After that, you refused to let it go further than just sex.

358
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,900
<21-7,Cameron>因为我知道对你有感觉  但我并不想那样
<21-7,Cameron>Because I knew I was falling for you and I didn't want to.

359
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,200
<21-8,Chase>这一点从来没变过
<21-8,Chase>And that never changed.

360
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,600
<21-8,Chase>你中断了我们的假期只为我给你买了戒指
<21-8,Chase>You broke off our vacation Because I bought you a ring.

361
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,600
<21-9,Cameron>我当时太紧张了  我也不想的
<21-9,Cameron>I got cold feet. I'm not proud.

362
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,300
<21-10,Chase>之后你差点取消了我们的婚礼
<21-10,Chase>And then you almost called off our wedding

363
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
<21-12,Chase>因为你不能停止去想
<21-12,Chase>Because you couldn't give up the idea

364
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,900
<21-13,Cameron>有一个你去世丈夫的孩子
<21-13,Cameron>Of having your dead husband's baby.

365
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
<21-15,Cameron>不要  不要把他卷进来
<21-15,Cameron>Don't! Don't bring him up!

366
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,300
<21-16,Chase>就算那之后  你也不能确定对我的感情
<21-16,Chase>Because even then, you weren't sure about me.

367
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
<21-16,Chase>可能如果你嫁给我的时候我要死了
<21-16,Chase>Maybe if I was dying when you married me,

368
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
<21-16,Chase>-一切会有一点不同  -这不公平
<21-16,Chase>- It would have been a bit different. - That's not fair.

369
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,000
<21-18,Chase>这不仅公平  而且就是事实
<21-18,Chase>It's not only fair, it's exactly the point.

370
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,300
<21-18,Chase>你遇见他的时候他要死了
<21-18,Chase>He was dying when you met him,

371
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
<21-18,Chase>你们结婚才一年他就去世了
<21-18,Chase>And he was gone just a year into the marriage.

372
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
<21-18,Chase>你和他的婚姻只是一次蜜月
<21-18,Chase>So it was all a honeymoon with him.

373
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,300
<21-18,Chase>而我做的永远比不上那些
<21-18,Chase>And I could never match up to that.

374
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
<21-19,Cameron>-第一次现实让我无法  -不要说了
<21-19,Cameron>- The first time reality intruded-- - Stop this.

375
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
<21-20,Chase>-跟我说实话  -什么实话
<21-20,Chase>- Just tell me the truth.- About what?

376
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,300
<21-23,Cameron>-你爱过我吗  -我不知道
<21-23,Cameron>- Did you ever love me?- I don't know!

377
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,200
<21-24,Chase>谢谢你终于告诉我
<21-24,Chase>Thank you for finally telling me.

378
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
<22-1,Wilson>真心话
<22-1,Wilson>Truth

379
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,800
<22-2,Thirteen>你说你现在没有女朋友
<22-2,Thirteen>You said you weren't dating anyone now.

380
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,400
<22-2,Thirteen>意思是你之前有女朋友
<22-2,Thirteen>Does that you mean you recently were,

381
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,600
<22-2,Thirteen>还是你很快会有女朋友
<22-2,Thirteen>Or soon will be?

382
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,200
<22-2,Thirteen>哦  看看现在是谁放不开
<22-2,Thirteen>Oh. Look who's guarded now.

383
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,300
<22-2,Thirteen>你完全不在意聊你的性生活
<22-2,Thirteen>You had no problem talking about your sex life,

384
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,500
<22-2,Thirteen>但是你的爱情
<22-2,Thirteen>But your love life...

385
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,700
<22-2,Thirteen>好吧  大冒险
<22-2,Thirteen>Fine. Dare it is.

386
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,700
<22-3,Wilson>从今以后再也不能看裸体
<22-3,Wilson>No nudity now or in the future.

387
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,400
<22-4,Thirteen>你好的太过分了  威尔森
<22-4,Thirteen>You're too much of a nice boy, wilson.

388
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,800
<22-4,Thirteen>让我们释放坏孩子威尔森出来一会儿
<22-4,Thirteen>Let's let the bad boy out for a bit.

389
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,000
<22-4,Thirteen>你现在去偷一美元
<22-4,Thirteen>You have to go steal one dollar right now.

390
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
<22-5,Wilson>偷谁的
<22-5,Wilson>From who?

391
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
<22-5,Wilson>哦  不是吧
<22-5,Wilson>Oh, come on.

392
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,700
<22-5,Wilson>呃  在霍普金斯医院实习
<22-5,Wilson>Uh, interned at hopkins.

393
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
<23-1,Taub>早知道了  有了有了
<23-1,Taub>Old news. Here we go.

394
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,800
<23-1,Taub>留校察看
<23-1,Taub>Academic probation.

395
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,100
<23-2,Foreman>我拜托你别再读了
<23-2,Foreman>I am asking you to please stop reading.

396
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
<23-3,Taub>我恐怕不能那么做
<23-3,Taub>I'm afraid I can't do that.

397
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
<23-3,Taub>伪造一次实验结果  大错啊
<23-3,Taub>Faked a lab result. Very wrong!

398
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,600
<23-3,Taub>你下来打算在这些资料被数字化之前
<23-3,Taub>And you came down to destroy the record

399
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
<23-3,Taub>毁掉记录
<23-3,Taub>Before it gets digitized.

400
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,300
<23-3,Taub>永久地毁掉  错上加错啊
<23-3,Taub>Permanentized. Even wronger.

401
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,000
<23-3,Taub>我
<23-3,Taub>I...

402
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,900
<23-4,Foreman>我得打败在我周围所有那些优秀的  被宠坏的孩子
<23-4,Foreman>I needed to beat all those elite, spoiled kids around me,

403
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,600
<23-4,Foreman>我要表现得没有弱点
<23-4,Foreman>To show no weaknesses,

404
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
<23-4,Foreman>在每件事上超越他们
<23-4,Foreman>To win at everything.

405
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,200
<23-4,Foreman>我干嘛跟你说这些
<23-4,Foreman>Why'd I just tell you that?

406
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,000
<23-4,Foreman>我嗑药以后总是话太多
<23-4,Foreman>I always talk too much when I'm stoned.

407
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,000
<23-4,Foreman>我干嘛要说这个
<23-4,Foreman>Why'd I just tell you that?

408
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
<23-5,Taub>太傻了  你的成绩很优秀
<23-5,Taub>It was stupid. You had great grades.

409
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,500
<23-5,Taub>一次实验结果不应该影响到你
<23-5,Taub>One lab result shouldn't have mattered.

410
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,400
<23-6,Foreman>可是一开始我就不认为自己配得上
<23-6,Foreman>Except I didn't think I deserved to be

411
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
<23-6,Foreman>去顶级的医科大学读书
<23-6,Foreman>At a top med school in the first place.

412
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,900
<23-6,Foreman>又来了
<23-6,Foreman>Again.

413
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,700
<23-7,Taub>伪造实验结果是一回事
<23-7,Taub>Faking lab results is one thing.

414
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,000
<23-7,Taub>可你要到这儿毁掉记录
<23-7,Taub>But you needing to come down here to destroy the records

415
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,100
<23-7,Taub>而且在事发12年以后
<23-7,Taub>12 years after the fact...

416
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,600
<23-7,Taub>这不关大学的事
<23-7,Taub>This isn't about med school.

417
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,500
<23-7,Taub>是你不认为自己属于这儿
<23-7,Taub>You don't think you belong here.

418
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,900
<23-7,Taub>这家医院
<23-7,Taub>At the hospital.

419
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,000
<23-8,Foreman>陶  逗号  克里斯托弗·迈克尔医生
<23-8,Foreman>Dr. Taub, Comma, Christopher Michael.

420
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,500
<24-1,House>总之现在到了
<24-1,House>So this is what it comes down to

421
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,900
<24-1,House>最后的时光了
<24-1,House>In the final hours.

422
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,000
<24-1,House>人们美化失去的爱人
<24-1,House>Deifying some lost love.

423
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,500
<24-1,House>祈祷她接电话然后和她重归于好
<24-1,House>Hoping to get her on the phone and make everything perfect.

424
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
<24-1,House>可悲
<24-1,House>It's pathetic.

425
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,600
<24-1,House>不管是你为了什么离开了她
<24-1,House>Either you left her for a reason

426
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,900
<24-1,House>还是她为了什么离开了你
<24-1,House>Or she left you for a reason.

427
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,500
<24-2,Nash>-一个电话不会...  -是我的女儿
<24-2,Nash>- A phone call is not... - It's my daughter.

428
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,000
<24-3,House>那么为什么她不在这儿
<24-3,House>So why isn't she here?

429
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,300
<24-4,Nash>我离开了我的家人
<24-4,Nash>I left my family...

430
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
<24-4,Nash>而且是在格雷西六岁的时候
<24-4,Nash>When Gracie was six.

431
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,400
<24-4,Nash>实际上  是在我和一个学生发生了关系之后
<24-4,Nash>I was sort of forced out, actually,

432
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,300
<24-4,Nash>我就被驱逐了家门
<24-4,Nash>After I'd had an affair with a student.

433
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
<24-5,House>为了性还是爱呢
<24-5,House>For sex or love?

434
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
<24-6,Nash>都不是
<24-6,Nash>Neither.

435
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,900
<24-6,Nash>我会和格雷西的母亲结婚只是因为孩子
<24-6,Nash>I'd only married Gracie's mother because of the baby.

436
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,700
<24-6,Nash>但我觉得我无法承担誓约
<24-6,Nash>But I didn't think I could handle commitment,

437
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,700
<24-6,Nash>然后  和其它学术理论一样 我证明了自己是对的
<24-6,Nash>And, like any decent academic, I proved myself right.

438
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
<24-7,House>那你在乎现在几点是因为
<24-7,House>And what time it is matters because?

439
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,400
<24-8,Nash>她在亚特兰大做个舞蹈老师
<24-8,Nash>She's a dance teacher in Atlanta.

440
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,700
<24-8,Nash>她下班后九点回家
<24-8,Nash>She gets home from work at 9:00,

441
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,400
<24-8,Nash>我只想再和她说一次话
<24-8,Nash>And I just wanted to speak to her one more time.

442
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,200
<24-8,Nash>我只想再和她说一次话
<24-8,Nash>And I just wanted to speak to her one more time.

443
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,200
<24-8,Nash>你的呢
<24-8,Nash>What's yours?

444
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,900
<24-9,House>挺像的  差不多
<24-9,House>Same thing. Pretty much.

445
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
<24-10,Nash>我几小时后就要死了
<24-10,Nash>I'm gonna be dead in a few hours.

446
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,000
<24-10,Nash>我不会泄露你的秘密的
<24-10,Nash>Your secrets couldn't be safer.

447
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,500
<24-10,Nash>除非你自己说出去
<24-10,Nash>Unless you're keeping them from yourself.

448
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
<24-11,House>我喜欢孤独
<24-11,House>I like being alone.

449
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,700
<24-11,House>至少我自认为这样最好
<24-11,House>At least I convince myself that I'm better off that way.

450
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,300
<24-11,House>直到我在一个精神病院
<24-11,House>And then I met someone

451
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,800
<24-11,House>遇到一个人
<24-11,House>At a psychiatric hospital, of all places.

452
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,100
<24-11,House>她改变了我
<24-11,House>She changed me.

453
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,400
<24-11,House>但她还是走了
<24-11,House>And then she left.

454
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,500
<24-11,House>我们还是孤独着好
<24-11,House>We're better off alone.

455
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,700
<24-11,House>独自痛苦着  孤身地死去
<24-11,House>We suffer alone, we die alone.

456
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,100
<24-11,House>不要在意你是否能当选
<24-11,House>Doesn't matter if you're a model husband

457
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,500
<24-11,House>年度模范丈夫或模范爸爸
<24-11,House>Or father of the year.

458
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
<24-11,House>明天对你来讲还是一样的
<24-11,House>Tomorrow will be the same for you.

459
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,900
<24-12,Nash>但昨天可能会有着不同的一面
<24-12,Nash>But yesterday would have been different.

460
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,500
<25-1,Wilson>你好  达  达莉娅
<25-1,Wilson>Hey, dar--daria.

<25-3,Wilson>Could you cook me up a chicken sandwich?

463
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,000
<25-4,Daria>烤箱已经关了
<25-4,Daria>Grill's closed.

464
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,700
<25-5,Wilson>是治病急需的
<25-5,Wilson>It's important medically.

465
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,200
<25-5,Wilson>哈德利医生正急需一份高蛋白肉食
<25-5,Wilson>Dr. Hadley needs a high-protein meal right now.

466
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,700
<25-5,Wilson>她不想谈起自己有这病
<25-5,Wilson>She doesn't like to talk about it,

467
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,200
<25-5,Wilson>但她有低蛋白血症
<25-5,Wilson>But she has hypoproteinemia.

00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,100
<25-6,Daria>我们有鸡肉沙拉
<25-6,Daria>We got chicken salad.

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
<25-7,Wilson>是吗  但沙拉是凉的
<25-7,Wilson>Yeah. That's cold.

470
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,800
<25-8,Daria>这种病必须要吃热蛋白质吗
<25-8,Daria>She needs to eat warm protein for this disease?

471
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,200
<25-9,Wilson>我们可以给她吃凉蛋白质
<25-9,Wilson>Well, we could give her cold protein

472
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
<25-9,Wilson>只是其中的蛋白酶没有被激活
<25-9,Wilson>Whose uptake enzymes haven't been activated,

473
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,900
<25-9,Wilson>当然只要你不介意引起她肝脏和肾脏衰竭
<25-9,Wilson>As long as you don't mind her risking liver and kidney failure

474
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,200
<25-9,Wilson>最终导致死亡
<25-9,Wilson>And eventual death.

475
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,200
<25-9,Wilson>但  挺值得的
<25-9,Wilson>But, hey, it's worth it

476
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,500
<25-9,Wilson>这样你就不必再开烤箱了
<25-9,Wilson>So you don't have to flip on the grill.

477
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,200
<25-10,Daria>你不必对此不爽
<25-10,Daria>You don't have to be obnoxious about it.

478
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,600
<26-1,Cameron>你怎么看起来一点事都没有
<26-1,Cameron>How do you look so okay?

479
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,400
<26-2,Chase>我已经花好几个月思考
<26-2,Chase>I spent months wondering

480
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,500
<26-2,Chase>我做错了什么以致如此
<26-2,Chase>How I made it go bad.

481
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,100
<26-2,Chase>如果你从没爱过我  那么...
<26-2,Chase>If you never loved me, then--

482
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,600
<26-2,Chase>那么就不是我的错了
<26-2,Chase>Then I didn't do anything wrong.

483
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,500
<26-2,Chase>艾莉森
<26-2,Chase>Allison, come on.

484
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,000
<26-3,Cameron>没关系的
<26-3,Cameron>It's all right.

485
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,000
<26-3,Cameron>我也不知道我为什么那样说
<26-3,Cameron>I still don't know why I said that.

486
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,500
<26-3,Cameron>不是真的
<26-3,Cameron>It's not even true.

487
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,600
<26-3,Cameron>我真的爱你
<26-3,Cameron>I did love you.

488
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
<26-3,Cameron>只是...
<26-3,Cameron>Just...

489
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,600
<26-3,Cameron>可能方式决定了不会有结果
<26-3,Cameron>Not in a way that would have ever worked.

490
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
<26-4,Chase>为什么不对
<26-4,Chase>Why not?

491
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,400
<26-5,Cameron>因为你说的都是实话
<26-5,Cameron>Because everything you said is true.

492
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,400
<26-5,Cameron>我是个烂人
<26-5,Cameron>I'm a mess.

493
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,500
<26-5,Cameron>我嫁给了一个快要死去的男人
<26-5,Cameron>I married a man I knew was dying.

494
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,100
<26-5,Cameron>只有上帝知道我多么糟糕
<26-5,Cameron>So god knows how screwed up I already was.

495
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,200
<26-5,Cameron>他的死亡让我更混乱
<26-5,Cameron>Him dying messed me up even more.

496
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,200
<26-5,Cameron>我把你推出了我的生活
<26-5,Cameron>I pushed you out of my life.

497
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,200
<26-5,Cameron>是我太不确定
<26-5,Cameron>And I-I'm unfixable.

498
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,400
<26-5,Cameron>不是你
<26-5,Cameron>Not you.

499
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,100
<26-6,Chase>对不起
<26-6,Chase>I'm sorry.

500
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,600
<26-7,Cameron>我也对不起你
<26-7,Cameron>I'm sorry too.

501
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,900
<27-1,Thirteen>真心话
<27-1,Thirteen>Truth.

502
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
<27-2,Wilson>闭嘴
<27-2,Wilson>Shut up.

503
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,900
<26-6,Chase>对不起
<26-6,Chase>I'm sorry.

504
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
<27-4,Wilson>不是你的错
<27-4,Wilson>It's not your fault.

505
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,800
<27-5,Thirteen>不  是我不公平
<27-5,Thirteen>No, I didn't even play fair.

506
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
<27-5,Thirteen>你问我  当我告诉父亲
<27-5,Thirteen>You asked me how my dad reacted

507
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,400
<27-5,Thirteen>我是双性恋时他有什么反应
<27-5,Thirteen>When I told him I was bisexual.

508
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,900
<27-5,Thirteen>还有亨廷顿病
<27-5,Thirteen>And the huntington's.

509
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
<27-6,Wilson>-没有吗  -我没告诉他
<27-6,Wilson>- No tea party? - I never told him.

510
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
<27-7,Thirteen>他已经经历过够多的磨难了
<27-7,Thirteen>He's been through enough.

511
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,900
<27-8,Wilson>所以他来看的是个异性恋健康的女儿
<27-8,Wilson>So he just visits his heterosexual, healthy daughter,

512
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,200
<27-8,Wilson>然后你们一起出去吃饭  看电影
<27-8,Wilson>And you go out to dinner and a movie

513
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,000
<27-8,Wilson>-谈论你家的花园  -我很晚才下班
<27-8,Wilson>- And talk about your garden? - I work late.

514
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,800
<27-9,Thirteen>他住在我家里
<27-9,Thirteen>He's staying at my house.

515
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,700
<27-9,Thirteen>其实我尽量不回家
<27-9,Thirteen>It's easier if I stay elsewhere

516
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,800
<27-9,Thirteen>倒方便些
<27-9,Thirteen>As much as I can.

517
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
<27-10,Wilson>你不能因为他的感觉影响自己的生活
<27-10,Wilson>You can't suppress your life for his convenience.

518
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,400
<27-11,Thirteen>你不觉得有点讽刺吗
<27-11,Thirteen>You don't see a little irony in that?

519
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,800
<27-11,Thirteen>你就是为豪斯这么做的
<27-11,Thirteen>That's exactly what you do for house.

520
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,100
<27-11,Thirteen>他搬去和你一起住
<27-11,Thirteen>When he moved in with you,

521
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,800
<27-11,Thirteen>你为他买了一处更大的房子
<27-11,Thirteen>You bought a bigger place for him.

522
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
<27-11,Thirteen>怪不得你不去约会
<27-11,Thirteen>No wonder you're not dating anyone.

523
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,200
<27-12,Wilson>没错
<27-12,Wilson>You're right.

524
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,300
<27-12,Wilson>那个女人  那个没和我在一起的女人
<27-12,Wilson>That woman, the woman I'm not involved with,

525
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,100
<27-12,Wilson>她叫萨姆·卡尔
<27-12,Wilson>Her name is sam carr.

526
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,300
<27-12,Wilson>但在1990到1991年间  她叫萨姆·威尔森
<27-12,Wilson>But in 1990 and 1991, it was sam wilson.

527
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,300
<27-13,Thirteen>你前妻吗
<27-13,Thirteen>Your ex-wife?

528
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
<27-14,Wilson>不  是我妈妈
<27-14,Wilson>No, my mother.

529
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,800
<27-14,Wilson>没错  就是我的前妻  首席前妻
<27-14,Wilson>Yes, my ex-wife. Ex number one.

530
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,300
<27-14,Wilson>几个星期前  她突然对我友好起来
<27-14,Wilson>She friended me a few weeks ago.

531
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,100
<27-14,Wilson>我们开始互发电邮
<27-14,Wilson>We started emailing.

532
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,800
<27-14,Wilson>原来她最近离婚了
<27-14,Wilson>It turns out she's recently divorced,

533
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,900
<27-14,Wilson>我想约她出来
<27-14,Wilson>And I wanted to ask her out.

534
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,900
<27-15,Thirteen>你不能带女人出去吃饭
<27-15,Thirteen>You can't take a woman to dinner,

535
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,500
<27-15,Thirteen>不然的话豪斯又要
<27-15,Thirteen>Or else house will go running

536
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,200
<27-15,Thirteen>变得疯疯癫癫了
<27-15,Thirteen>Straight back to the loony bin?

537
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,500
<27-15,Thirteen>你根本不是在担心豪斯  而是在担心自己
<27-15,Thirteen>You're not worried about house. You're worried about yourself.

538
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
<27-15,Thirteen>因为她是你的前妻
<27-15,Thirteen>Because she's an ex.

539
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,800
<27-15,Thirteen>所以即便是吃顿饭也可能立刻就当真起来
<27-15,Thirteen>So even dinner will mean it's immediately serious.

540
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,200
<28-1,Cameron>你还记得你当时最喜欢做的事吗
<28-1,Cameron>What are your favorite parts that you remember?

541
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,200
<28-2,Chase>我最喜欢的就是半夜醒来
<28-2,Chase>I liked how I would wake up in the middle of the night,

542
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,000
<28-2,Chase>会发现你在睡梦中都会紧紧抱着我
<28-2,Chase>You'd put your arm around me, and you wouldn't even wake up.

543
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,600
<28-2,Chase>我还喜欢当你爸在圣诞节
<28-2,Chase>I liked watching you stand up to your dad at christmas

544
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,500
<28-2,Chase>对你妈大吼时  你站出来为你妈撑腰
<28-2,Chase>When he yelled at your mom.

545
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,800
<28-2,Chase>你都没意识到自己有多坚强
<28-2,Chase>How you didn't even know you were strong.

546
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,900
<28-2,Chase>但你真的很坚强
<28-2,Chase>But you were.

547
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,300
<28-3,Cameron>你怀念什么
<28-3,Cameron>What do you miss?

548
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,000
<28-3,Cameron>我怀念很多东西
<28-3,Cameron>I miss a lot.

549
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,200
<28-3,Cameron>但每当我开始想念你时
<28-3,Cameron>But when I think about missing you,

550
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,400
<28-3,Cameron>我就会想到我们为婚礼
<28-3,Cameron>I think about that dance class

551
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
<28-3,Cameron>去参加的舞蹈班
<28-3,Cameron>That we took for the wedding.

552
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,700
<28-3,Cameron>很奇怪
<28-3,Cameron>It's weird.

553
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,700
<28-3,Cameron>我会想  他再也不会这样握着我的手了
<28-3,Cameron>I think, he's never gonna hold me like that again.

554
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,200
<28-4,Cameron>哦  天哪
<28-4,Cameron>Oh, god.

555
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,300
<28-5,Chase>这一刻我会永远怀念的
<28-5,Chase>I'm gonna miss this too.

556
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
<29-1,Foreman>你26岁就在新英格兰学刊上发表了文章
<29-1,Foreman>Published in the new england journal  at 26?

557
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,600
<29-2,Taub>提前一年完成了实验室任务
<29-2,Taub>Finished all the lab work a year earlier.

558
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,800
<29-3,Foreman>还带着一批医生
<29-3,Foreman>Led a group of surgeons

559
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,800
<29-3,Foreman>到孟加拉国去治疗裂唇
<29-3,Foreman>To fix cleft palates in bangladesh?

560
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,100
<29-4,Taub>我能说什么呢  那台慈善晚会太感人了
<29-4,Taub>What can I say? That concert was very moving to me.

561
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,700
<29-4,Taub>-我不得不折服  -我不明白
<29-4,Taub>- I have to take a knee. - I don't get it.

562
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,500
<29-5,Foreman>这应该是这里最优秀的档案了
<29-5,Foreman>This has got to be the most spectacular file down here.

563
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,600
<29-5,Foreman>为什么你还装出很羞愧的样子
<29-5,Foreman>Why are you pretending to be ashamed?

564
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,000
<29-6,Taub>要是可以的话我会马上把你的档案换过来
<29-6,Taub>I would trade mine for yours in a second.

565
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,000
<29-6,Taub>当我在医学院的时候
<29-6,Taub>When I was in med school,

566
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
<29-6,Taub>我以为某天我像豪斯医生一样
<29-6,Taub>I thought I'd be house some day.

567
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
<29-6,Taub>可实际上
<29-6,Taub>Instead, I am

568
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,300
<29-6,Taub>我只能与这样的人共同工作
<29-6,Taub>A fellow working with--

569
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,700
<29-6,Taub>为比我年轻好几年的人工作
<29-6,Taub>Working for people years younger than me.

570
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,800
<29-7,Foreman>所以我们都有后悔的事
<29-7,Foreman>So we both have a few regrets.

571
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,600
<29-8,Taub>你应该为自己感到自豪
<29-8,Taub>You should be proud of yours.

572
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,200
<29-8,Taub>你的生活走的是上坡路
<29-8,Taub>Your life's been trending up.

573
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
<30-1,Cuddy>还是没有消息
<30-1,Cuddy>No news.

574
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,100
<30-1,Cuddy>你还支持得住吗
<30-1,Cuddy>How you holding up?

575
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,200
<30-1,Cuddy>你让他们给你打了针镇静剂
<30-1,Cuddy>You let them sedate you?

576
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,700
<30-1,Cuddy>没错
<30-1,Cuddy>Yeah.

577
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,400
<30-2,Sarah>你有孩子么
<30-2,Sarah>Do you have kids?

578
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,200
<30-3,Cuddy>一个小女孩
<30-3,Cuddy>A little girl.

579
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,600
<30-3,Cuddy>我去年领养了她
<30-3,Cuddy>I adopted her last year.

580
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,500
<30-4,Sarah>我和唐纳德结婚后就领养了沃克
<30-4,Sarah>I adopted walker right after donald and I got married.

581
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,700
<30-4,Sarah>如果我不能像爱我女儿一样
<30-4,Sarah>What if I can never love walker

582
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,600
<30-4,Sarah>爱沃克的话呢
<30-4,Sarah>the way I love my daughter?

583
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,300
<30-4,Sarah>这会让我变成一个可憎的人吗
<30-4,Sarah>Does that make me a horrible person?

584
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,900
<30-5,Cuddy>我去帮你拿点纸巾
<30-5,Cuddy>Let me get you some tissues.

585
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,800
<30-5,Cuddy>你叫人拿来了额外的浴巾吗
<30-5,Cuddy>Did you request some extra towels?

586
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
<30-5,Cuddy>没有
<30-5,Cuddy>No.

587
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,700
<30-6,Sarah>什么  为什么这么问
<30-6,Sarah>What--why?

588
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,100
<31-1,Cuddy>在萨拉的房间里有八条浴巾
<31-1,Cuddy>There are eight towels in sarah's room.

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,700
<31-2,Maldonado>哦
<31-2,Maldonado>Okay.

590
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,600
<31-3,Cuddy>应该只有四条的

<31-5,Cuddy>I need you to track down their logs,

593
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,400
<31-5,Cuddy>查一下谁去过她房间  什么时候去的
<31-5,Cuddy>Figure out who was up there and when.

594
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
<31-6,Smits>就因为他们多给了浴巾
<31-6,Smits>Because they got extra towels?

595
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,700
<31-7,Cuddy>把记录找出来就是了  现在就去
<31-7,Cuddy>Just find the logs. Now.

596
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,400
<31-7,Cuddy>-阿德里安娜  你还好吗  -当然
<31-7,Cuddy>- Adrienne, You okay? - Sure.

<31-10,Cuddy>阿德里安娜  把你的手臂伸出来

<31-10,Cuddy>她左臂上的汗毛竖起来了
<31-10,Cuddy>The hair on her left arm is standing up.

<31-10,Cuddy>她动毛神经癫痫正在发作
<31-10,Cuddy>She's having a pilomotor seizure.

602

<31-11,Smits>可她一分钟前还好好的
<31-11,Smits>She seemed fine a minute ago.

603
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,100
<31-11,Smits>她刚才是没事
<31-11,Smits>She was.

604
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,300
<31-12,Cuddy>可能这一整天她都
<31-12,Cuddy>She's probably been having

00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,900
<31-12,Cuddy>在经历复杂性癫痫
<31-12,Cuddy>Complex seizures all day.

606
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,600
<31-12,Cuddy>她基本像正常人一样活动
<31-12,Cuddy>She would be basically functional,

607
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,500
<31-12,Cuddy>可是却是不受控制的活动
<31-12,Cuddy>But more or less acting on autopilot.

608
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,400
<31-12,Cuddy>她可能到房间放了两次浴巾
<31-12,Cuddy>She probably dropped the towels off twice.

609
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,500
<31-12,Cuddy>有可能是她带走了孩子
<31-12,Cuddy>She could have taken the baby.

<32-1,Cameron>我们一直都没有好好说声再见

<33-3,House>You don't seem that surprised.

616
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,400
<33-3,House>好像这是在意料之中
<33-3,House>that's what you expected to get.

617
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,000
<33-3,House>你故意等到她出门
