82
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,590

<5-5,House>I assume this unwanted interruption

102
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,830
<5-5,House>是希望我和你们一起讨论
<5-5,House>means you're looking for me to discuss the latest development

<6-4,Adams>Why would he have a picture of a little boy?

126
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,130
<6-5,Taub>可能是他侄子或什么亲戚吧
<6-5,Taub>Maybe it's his nephew or something?

<7-11,Adams>Is that the voice you hear in your head?

141
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,090
<8-2,House>终于  他醒了
<8-2,House>And Lo, he is risen.

142
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,040
<8-3,Wilson>下周我就要开始掉头发了吗
<8-3,Wilson>So now my hair's gonna fall out next week?

143
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,060
<8-4,House>不会  我只是暂时杀死了你一下
<8-4,House>No. All I did was temporarily kill you.

144
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,200
<8-4,House>感觉怎么样
<8-4,House>How was it?

145
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,650
<8-5,Wilson>什么  我又没死
<8-5,Wilson>What--I don't-- I wasn't dead.

146
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,610
<8-5,Wilson>我只是失去意识了
<8-5,Wilson>I was unconscious.

147
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,690
<8-6,House>没有做梦  没有思想
<8-6,House>No dreams, no thoughts.

148
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,820
<8-6,House>什么都感觉不到
<8-6,House>You experienced nothing.

149
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,580
<8-6,House>想象下这感觉  但是是一睡不醒的情况
<8-6,House>Now, imagine that without the waking up on the couch part.

150
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,550
<8-6,House>永恒的虚无
<8-6,House>Just nothing times infinity.

151
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,570
<8-7,Wilson>你证明不了死亡就是虚无
<8-7,Wilson>You didn't just prove death is nothing.

152
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,980
<8-7,Wilson>你只能证明异丙酚有这作用
<8-7,Wilson>You proved propofol is.

153
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,830
<8-8,House>你的意思是死亡并不是一切的结束吗
<8-8,House>You're saying the end is not the end?

154
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,880
<8-8,House>我还以为你会说"虚无总比煎熬强"
<8-8,House>I was expecting "Nothing is better than something lousy,"

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,350
<8-8,House>而不是"天使在等我"
<8-8,House>but not "The angels are waiting for me."

156
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,310
<8-9,Wilson>我不跟你说了
<8-9,Wilson>I'm not having this conversation.

157
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,850
<8-10,House>为什么  因为你的说法站不住脚吗
<8-10,House>Why? 'Cause it doesn't make sense?

158
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,090
<8-11,Wilson>因为我无法改变你的想法
<8-11,Wilson>Because I'm not gonna change your mind,

159
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,110
<8-11,Wilson>而且我不在乎
<8-11,Wilson>and I don't care.

160
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,080
<8-11,Wilson>更重要的是  你也不会改变我的想法
<8-11,Wilson>More importantly, you're not gonna change mine.

161
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,790
<8-12,House>这世上没有天堂  也没有地狱
<8-12,House>There is no heaven. There is no hell.

162
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,780
<8-12,House>你的灵魂不会飘离躯体
<8-12,House>Your soul is not gonna float out of your body

163
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,910
<8-12,House>变成什么宇宙永恒的能量
<8-12,House>and join some great unifying energy force.

164
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,880
<8-12,House>你马上就会死的事实不会改变这一点
<8-12,House>The fact that you're dying is not gonna change that.

165
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,260
<8-13,Wilson>求你了  快走吧
<8-13,Wilson>Please...just go.

166
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,150
<8-13,Wilson>豪斯
<8-13,Wilson>House.

167
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,930
<8-14,Wilson>在过去的二十年里
<8-14,Wilson>I have spent the last 20 years

168
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,130
<8-14,Wilson>我经常得握着将死之人的手
<8-14,Wilson>holding the hands of people as they die.

169
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,580
<8-14,Wilson>当我看着一个人慢慢死去时
<8-14,Wilson>When I watch that transformation...

170
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,220
<8-14,Wilson>很抱歉  我...
<8-14,Wilson>I'm sorry, I...

171
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,320
<8-14,Wilson>认为人不只是一堆化学物质
<8-14,Wilson>don't believe that we're just a bag of chemicals.

172
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,290
<9-1,Park>我们是讨论一下病人
<9-1,Park>So are we gonna talk about the patient

173
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,420
<9-1,Park>还是等等豪斯
<9-1,Park>or wait for House?

174
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,820
<9-2,Taub>病毒性脑炎
<9-2,Taub>Viral encephalitis.

175
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,860
<9-3,Park>他幻听已经有十年了
<9-3,Park>It's been going on for ten years.

176
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,060
<9-3,Park>我要过去  请他过来一起讨论
<9-3,Park>I'm gonna go in there and invite him to participate.

177
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,660
<9-3,Park>我想  分散他注意力一下也挺好
<9-3,Park>I think he'd welcome the distraction.

178
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,270
<9-3,Park>和我一起去吗
<9-3,Park>Come with me?

179
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,540
<9-4,Taub>为什么啊
<9-4,Taub>Why?

180
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,660
<9-4,Taub>对于豪斯的私事
<9-4,Taub>When was the last time

181
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,730
<9-4,Taub>我们若是有建议  他什么时候听过了
<9-4,Taub>House listened to anything we said about anything personal?

182
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,610
<9-4,Taub>这可能会让你好受些
<9-4,Taub>Maybe you'll feel better,

183
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,850
<9-4,Taub>但其实有的时候
<9-4,Taub>but sometimes the truth is

184
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,720
<9-4,Taub>我们真的什么也做不了
<9-4,Taub>there's nothing anyone can do.

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,870
<9-5,Taub>颞叶癫痫
<9-5,Taub>Temporal lobe epilepsy.

186
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,570
<9-5,Taub>引起幻听  眩晕  抽搐所致的损伤
<9-5,Taub>Causes voices, dizziness. Trauma from seizure

187
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,080
<9-5,Taub>会引起鼻出血
<9-5,Taub>would explain the nose bleed.

188
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,300
<10-1,Courtney>你认识我所有的兄弟姐妹
<10-1,Courtney>You know about all of my siblings

189
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,560
<10-1,Courtney>表兄妹  叔叔阿姨  还有...
<10-1,Courtney>and cousins and aunts and uncles and--

190
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,610
<10-2,Derrick>你反应过度了
<10-2,Derrick>You're overreacting.

191
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,190
<10-3,Courtney>因为你不够信任我  告诉我...
<10-3,Courtney>Because you don't trust me enough to tell me--

192
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,670
<10-3,Courtney>打扰了
<10-3,Courtney>Sorry.

193
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,480
<10-4,Taub>该去做检查了
<10-4,Taub>It's time to go down for your test.

194
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,630
<10-5,Adams>如果你想在这等的话
<10-5,Adams>If you wanna wait here,

195
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,350
<10-5,Adams>大约只要一小时
<10-5,Adams>it'll only take about an hour.

196
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,950
<10-6,Derrick>不了  她要走了
<10-6,Derrick>No. She's leaving.

197
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,580
<10-7,Courtney>德里克  别这样
<10-7,Courtney>Derrick, come on.

198
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,700
<10-7,Courtney>我们应该谈谈
<10-7,Courtney>I mean, we should at least talk.

199
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,010
<10-8,Derrick>我还是希望你先走吧
<10-8,Derrick>I'd rather you just leave.

200
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,690
<10-8,Derrick>而且你不用再回来了
<10-8,Derrick>And you don't need to come back.

201
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,900
<10-8,Derrick>暂停一下
<10-8,Derrick>Time.

202
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,930
<11-1,Adams>有没有什么奇怪的味道或是气味
<11-1,Adams>Any odd tastes or smells?

203
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,700
<11-2,Derrick>没有  感觉良好
<11-2,Derrick>Nope. Feel fine.

204
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,490
<11-3,Adams>我从那边看来也不错
<11-3,Adams>Things look fine on my end too.

205
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,870
<11-3,Adams>那么...
<11-3,Adams>So...

206
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,110
<11-3,Adams>你不肯向医生承认
<11-3,Adams>you won't admit to your doctors

207
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,790
<11-3,Adams>你幻听到你弟弟的声音
<11-3,Adams>that you're hearing your brother's voice,

208
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,530
<11-3,Adams>这是很危险的
<11-3,Adams>which is dangerous.

209
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,980
<11-3,Adams>现在你因为这个失去了女友
<11-3,Adams>And now you lost your girlfriend over it,

210
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,260
<11-3,Adams>这就有点蠢了
<11-3,Adams>which is stupid.

211
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,980
<11-3,Adams>我猜事情不是这么简单吧
<11-3,Adams>I assume there's more to the story?

212
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,990
<11-4,Derrick>我就是这么长大的
<11-4,Derrick>That's how I was raised.

213
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,900
<11-5,Adams>真简洁啊
<11-5,Adams>Short story.

214
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
<11-6,Derrick>对
<11-6,Derrick>Yeah.

215
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,720
<11-7,Adams>我上司要失去患了癌症的挚友
<11-7,Adams>My boss is losing his best friend to cancer.

216
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,400
<11-7,Adams>他却不愿面对事实
<11-7,Adams>And instead of talking about the pain,

217
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,810
<11-7,Adams>只是装作自己没事
<11-7,Adams>he's pretending there is no pain

218
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,750
<11-7,Adams>因为他认为凡事都有解决之道
<11-7,Adams>because everything can be fixed.

219
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,710
<11-8,Derrick>我父亲试图正面现实
<11-8,Derrick>My father tried to deal with it.

220
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,660
<11-8,Derrick>我弟弟是被醉酒的司机撞死的
<11-8,Derrick>Ironic that he'd drink himself into oblivion

221
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,860
<11-8,Derrick>他自己却也成了酒鬼  真是讽刺
<11-8,Derrick>after my brother was killed by a drunk driver.

222
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,500
<11-9,Adams>需要纸巾吗
<11-9,Adams>Do you need a tissue?

223
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,440
<11-10,Derrick>爸爸离开之后
<11-10,Derrick>After dad left,

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,030
<11-10,Derrick>妈妈带我搬走了
<11-10,Derrick>my mom moved us away.

225
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,500
<11-10,Derrick>她丢掉了所有克里斯多夫的相片
<11-10,Derrick>She got rid of all the pictures of Christopher

226
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,280
<11-10,Derrick>之后就再也没提起过他
<11-10,Derrick>and never mentioned him again.

227
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,450
<11-10,Derrick>就好像他从未存在过
<11-10,Derrick>It was like he never existed.

228
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,970
<11-10,Derrick>这法子还挺有效的
<11-10,Derrick>And that worked for us.

229
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,000
<11-11,Adams>但是  你还是留了一张
<11-11,Adams>And yet, you kept one.

230
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,140
<11-12,Derrick>我的右眼...
<11-12,Derrick>Uh, my right eye...

231
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,560
<11-12,Derrick>刚刚只是出现黑点
<11-12,Derrick>I was seeing spots,

232
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
<11-12,Derrick>但现在什么也看不见了
<11-12,Derrick>but now I can't see at all.

233
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,140
<11-12,Derrick>是测试的原因吗
<11-12,Derrick>Is that from the test?

234
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,880
<11-13,Adams>不  是其他东西引起的
<11-13,Adams>No. This is something else.

235
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,490
<11-14,Derrick>好疼
<11-14,Derrick>That hurts.

236
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,530
<11-15,Adams>抱歉
<11-15,Adams>Sorry.

237
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,530
<11-16,Adams>几个手指
<11-16,Adams>How many fingers?

238
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,560
<11-17,Derrick>两个  有点模糊  但还看得出
<11-17,Derrick>Two. Fuzzy ones, but two.

239
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,770
<11-18,Adams>你眼球后面的血管里有血栓
<11-18,Adams>There's a clot in the artery behind your eye.

240
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,930
<11-18,Adams>我刚刚把它清散了
<11-18,Adams>I just broke it up.

241
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
<11-19,Derrick>很糟糕吗
<11-19,Derrick>Is that bad?

242
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,230
<11-20,Adams>不清楚
<11-20,Adams>Don't know,

243
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,510
<11-20,Adams>因为我不知道为何会出现这种症状
<11-20,Adams>because I don't know why it happened.

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,910
<12-1,House>我给咱俩占了张桌子
<12-1,House>Hey. Saved us a table.

245
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,080
<12-2,Wilson>显然这儿没有空桌
<12-2,Wilson>There are no tables.

246
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,730
<12-3,House>最近我偷看了你那些旧档案
<12-3,House>I recently hacked into your old files.

247
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,500
<12-3,House>发现一个六岁男孩
<12-3,House>Found a six-year-old boy

248
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,420
<12-3,House>患有双侧视网膜母细胞瘤
<12-3,House>with bilateral retinoblastoma.

249
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,960
<12-3,House>其他医生准备在肿瘤
<12-3,House>Doctors wanted to take his eyes out

250
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,560
<12-3,House>扩散至大脑前  将眼球摘除
<12-3,House>before the cancer spread to his brain,

251
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,630
<12-3,House>但你强烈反对
<12-3,House>And you fought them.

252
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,670
<12-3,House>主张采用质子束放疗的新方法
<12-3,House>Advocated for a new photon beam radiation.

253
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,090
<12-3,House>挽救了孩子的视力  还有他的生命
<12-3,House>Saved the kid's vision. Probably saved his life.

254
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,610
<12-4,Wilson>那是我在这里的第一位患者
<12-4,Wilson>That was my first case at PPTH.

255
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,750
<12-4,Wilson>迈奇·金布尔
<12-4,Wilson>Mikey Kimble.

256
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,170
<12-5,Michael>现在大家都叫我迈克尔
<12-5,Michael>It's Michael now.

257
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,820
<12-6,House>对了  这就是我们的座位
<12-6,House>Oh, yeah. This is our table.

258
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,410
<12-7,Wilson>我...
<12-7,Wilson>I...

259
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
<12-7,Wilson>我说...
<12-7,Wilson>I mean...

260
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,920
<12-8,Wilson>你还好吗
<12-8,Wilson>How are you?

261
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,280
<12-9,Michael>我过得很好
<12-9,Michael>I'm doing great.

262
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,650
<12-9,Michael>下个月就毕业了
<12-9,Michael>I'm graduating next month.

263
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,650
<12-10,Wilson>这么快
<12-10,Wilson>Already?

264
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,840
<12-10,Wilson>当年的小迈奇
<12-10,Wilson>Little Mikey?

265
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,870
<12-11,Michael>我被普林斯顿录取了
<12-11,Michael>And I got accepted to Princeton.

266
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,560
<12-11,Michael>我准备上医学院
<12-11,Michael>And I'm planning on going to med school.

267
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,510
<12-13,House>他将成为一名医生
<12-13,House>He's going to be a doctor,

268
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,330
<12-13,House>而不是早早升天
<12-13,House>instead of being dead.

269
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,710
<12-14,Michael>豪斯医生
<12-14,Michael>Dr. House

270
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,250
<12-14,Michael>跟我说了你的情况
<12-14,Michael>told me all about your situation.

271
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,710
<12-14,Michael>所以我就来了
<12-14,Michael>That's why I came.

272
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,690
<12-14,Michael>就算时间短暂
<12-14,Michael>There's just so much good that you can do,

273
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,920
<12-14,Michael>你还是能造福很多人
<12-14,Michael>even in a small amount of time.

274
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,960
<12-15,House>真想知道...
<12-15,House>I wonder...

275
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,960
<12-15,House>各位
<12-15,House>Hey!

276
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,260
<12-15,House>还有没有谁
<12-15,House>Is there anybody else here

277
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,690
<12-15,House>是因为詹姆斯·威尔森医生才活到了今日
<12-15,House>who's alive today because of Dr. James Wilson?

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,110
<12-16,Elderly Woman>胃腺癌
<12-16,Elderly Woman>Gastric adenocarcinoma.

<12-16,Elderly Woman>15 years in remission.

280
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,130
<12-16,Elderly Woman>没有你  我就见不到那六个孙儿孙女
<12-16,Elderly Woman>Six grandchildren that I never would have met.

281
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,130
<12-16,Elderly Woman>谢谢你  威尔森医生
<12-16,Elderly Woman>Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

283
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,240
<12-17,Middle Aged Man>缓解期12年
<12-17,Middle Aged Man>12 years in remission.

284
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,120
<12-17,Middle Aged Man>去年5月  我陪着女儿步入婚姻的殿堂
<12-17,Middle Aged Man>I was able to walk my daughter down the aisle last May.

285
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,500
<12-17,Middle Aged Man>谢谢你  威尔森医生
<12-17,Middle Aged Man>Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

286
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,650
<12-18,House>我算了算
<12-18,House>I did the math.

287
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,580
<12-18,House>因为你
<12-18,House>74 children are alive today

288
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,610
<12-18,House>有74个孩子活在今天
<12-18,House>because of you.

289
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,240
<12-18,House>14个孙子孙女
<12-18,House>14 grandchildren.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,070
<12-19,Wilson>迈奇·金布尔在规定入学年龄前
<12-19,Wilson>Mikey Kimble started kindergarten

291
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,940
<12-19,Wilson>就上了幼儿园
<12-19,Wilson>before the age cutoff.

292
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,160
<12-19,Wilson>应该去年就从高中毕业了
<12-19,Wilson>He would have graduated high school last year.

293
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,070
<12-20,Michael>我留级了一年
<12-20,Michael>I flunked a year.

294
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,450
<12-21,Wilson>你们这些人里
<12-21,Wilson>Was anybody in this room

295
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,000
<12-21,Wilson>有谁真的是我的病人吗
<12-21,Wilson>really a patient of mine?

296
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,340
<12-22,House>不在这也活在别处
<12-22,House>They're somewhere.

297
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,710
<12-22,House>在世界的某个角落向你致敬
<12-22,House>They're giving you a standing "O" somewhere.

298
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,950
<12-22,House>他们的确存在  你救了他们的命
<12-22,House>They exist. You saved their lives.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,500
<12-23,House>其实这样说来  更有意义
<12-23,House>That's the more impressive --

300
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,330
<12-23,House>他们生活太充实  所以没能来
<12-23,House>that they're too busy to be here.

301
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,960
<13-1,Foreman>这是什么
<13-1,Foreman>What's this?

302
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,660
<13-2,Taub>你刚在我的电脑上
<13-2,Taub>A glowing letter of recommendation

303
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,680
<13-2,Taub>为我写的一封充满赞言的推荐信
<13-2,Taub>you just wrote for me on my laptop.

304
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,000
<13-2,Taub>我注意到上面缺少了你的签名
<13-2,Taub>I notice it's lacking your signature at the bottom.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
<13-3,Foreman>你不觉得就现在认为豪斯会堕落
<13-3,Foreman>Don't you think you're being a bit premature

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,180
<13-3,Foreman>有点太早了吗
<13-3,Foreman>predicting House's demise?

307
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,600
<13-4,Taub>不是堕落  是自取灭亡
<13-4,Taub>Not demise. Just implosion.

308
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,240
<13-5,Foreman>他正经历一个艰难时期
<13-5,Foreman>He's going through a rough time,

309
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,890
<13-5,Foreman>到目前为止  他算是在面对此事
<13-5,Foreman>but so far, he's been handling it.

310
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,940
<14-1,Foreman>豪斯
<14-1,Foreman>House.

311
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,010
<14-2,House>你的鞋湿了
<14-2,House>Your shoes are wet!

312
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,570
<14-3,Foreman>真高兴看到你的情感问题
<14-3,Foreman>Glad to see your emotional turmoil

313
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,020
<14-3,Foreman>还没抹杀你的观察力
<14-3,Foreman>hasn't dulled your powers of observation.

314
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,350
<14-3,Foreman>我知道是你干的
<14-3,Foreman>I know you're responsible.

315
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,230
<14-4,House>不  你不知道  因为我什么也没做
<14-4,House>No, you don't. 'Cause I didn't do it.

316
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,720
<14-4,House>不管是什么事
<14-4,House>Whatever it is.

317
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,150
<14-4,House>如果我把你给的那些季票
<14-4,House>But if I had shoved those season tickets

318
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,960
<14-4,House>扔进马桶
<14-4,House>down some toilets,

319
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,080
<14-4,House>那也是因为你让我这么干的
<14-4,House>I would have done it because you asked me to.

320
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,200
<14-4,House>你想要替代威尔森
<14-4,House>You wanted to replace Wilson.

321
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,970
<14-4,House>我一直捉弄他的
<14-4,House>I prank Wilson all the time.

322
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,290
<14-4,House>好好享受
<14-4,House>Enjoy.

323
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,340
<15-1,Wilson>我给你点了三瓶  不过都被我喝光了
<15-1,Wilson>I got you three, but I drank them.

324
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,590
<15-2,Thirteen>你不必给我打电话
<15-2,Thirteen>You didn't have to call me,

325
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,730
<15-2,Thirteen>但我很高兴你还能想到我
<15-2,Thirteen>but I appreciate I made the list.

326
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,880
<15-3,Wilson>我是有私心的
<15-3,Wilson>It wasn't entirely unselfish.

327
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,460
<15-3,Wilson>我觉得和我的那些
<15-3,Wilson>I didn't feel right

328
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,870
<15-3,Wilson>晚期病人接触  不太好
<15-3,Wilson>approaching any of my terminal patients.

329
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,090
<15-3,Wilson>但是
<15-3,Wilson>But...

330
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,150
<15-3,Wilson>我想知道那是什么感觉
<15-3,Wilson>What is it like?

331
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,970
<15-5,Wilson>会一直感觉如此现实吗
<15-5,Wilson>Does it ever stop being surreal?

332
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,300
<15-6,Thirteen>针对你的病情
<15-6,Thirteen>It'll stop in about...

333
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,180
<15-6,Thirteen>五至六个月的时候  就超脱了
<15-6,Thirteen>five or six months, give or take, in your case.

334
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,390
<15-7,Wilson>你知道今天发生什么事了吗
<15-7,Wilson>You know what happened to me today?

335
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,180
<15-7,Wilson>我的一个病人突然哭了起来
<15-7,Wilson>One of my patients suddenly started crying.

336
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,080
<15-8,Thirteen>不会是第一次遇到这情况吧
<15-8,Thirteen>It can't be your first.

337
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,660
<15-9,Wilson>是第一个为我哭泣的
<15-9,Wilson>The first one who was crying for me.

338
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,180
<15-10,Thirteen>这是人之常情
<15-10,Thirteen>It's the human response.

339
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,260
<15-10,Thirteen>要么过分谄媚
<15-10,Thirteen>It's either overly saccharine,

340
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,710
<15-10,Thirteen>因为对你同情让他们感觉很好
<15-10,Thirteen>because giving sympathy makes them feel better,

341
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,130
<15-10,Thirteen>要么就忽略你
<15-10,Thirteen>or they ignore you,

342
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,350
<15-10,Thirteen>因为逃避生老病死  让他们安心
<15-10,Thirteen>because hiding from mortality makes them feel better.

343
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,290
<15-11,Wilson>他们为什么就不能说些
<15-11,Wilson>Why can't they just say something

344
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,820
<15-11,Wilson>让我感觉好点的话呢
<15-11,Wilson>that makes me feel better?

345
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,960
<15-12,Thirteen>比如说
<15-12,Thirteen>Like what, exactly?

346
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,720
<15-12,Thirteen>不知道
<15-12,Thirteen>I don't know.

347
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,680
<15-13,Thirteen>你现在是两周化疗  两周休息吗
<15-13,Thirteen>You'd be doing what, two weeks on, two weeks off?

348
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,570
<15-13,Thirteen>先做一轮看看
<15-13,Thirteen>So maybe do your first round, see how it goes.

349
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,960
<15-13,Thirteen>可能没你想的那么糟
<15-13,Thirteen>Maybe not as horrible as you fear.

350
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,570
<15-13,Thirteen>然后再做第二轮  好好休息两周
<15-13,Thirteen>Then do the second round, enjoy your two weeks off,

351
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,450
<15-13,Thirteen>再看看如何
<15-13,Thirteen>And revisit the decision.

352
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,580
<15-13,Thirteen>如此反复
<15-13,Thirteen>Rinse, repeat.

353
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,340
<15-14,Wilson>我就是无法想象自己
<15-14,Wilson>I just can't envision spending my remaining time

354
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,070
<15-14,Wilson>在化疗病房中度过余生
<15-14,Wilson>in a chemo suite in Princeton.

355
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,670
<15-14,Wilson>我想要
<15-14,Wilson>I want to

356
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,250
<15-14,Wilson>和我的家人朋友们在一起
<15-14,Wilson>enjoy myself with family and friends.

357
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,270
<15-15,Thirteen>是朋友们还是朋友
<15-15,Thirteen>Friends or friend?

358
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,720
<16-1,House>你好  我是格雷戈·豪斯
<16-1,House>Hi, this is Greg House. Again.

359
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,430
<16-1,House>这是第三条留言了  希望
<16-1,House>Third message, hopefully indicating

360
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,340
<16-1,House>你能知道我多期盼你回电
<16-1,House>how much I want you to call me back.

361
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,690
<16-1,House>我还想说你儿子快挂了  来加加急
<16-1,House>I'd say that your son is dying to increase the urgency,

362
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,680
<16-1,House>不过你可能早知道了
<16-1,House>but you probably already know that.

363
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,580
<16-1,House>让人假装
<16-1,House>The fake people who care

364
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,320
<16-1,House>关心威尔森健康那招  没有用
<16-1,House>that Wilson stays alive didn't work,

365
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,150
<16-1,House>所以我要找些真心关心他的人
<16-1,House>so I need the real people who care about him

366
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,140
<16-1,House>告诉他  他这么做太傻了
<16-1,House>to tell him what an idiot he's being.

367
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,620
<16-2,Adams>我们去哪儿
<16-2,Adams>Where are we going?

368
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,380
<16-3,House>我收到传呼要去厕所
<16-3,House>I just got paged to go to the bathroom.

369
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,060
<16-3,House>你们去哪儿我不知道
<16-3,House>I don't know where the rest of you are going.

370
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,100
<16-4,Adams>病人的一些症状可能是生理性的
<16-4,Adams>Some of our patient's symptoms might be physiological,

371
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,730
<16-4,Adams>有些可能是心理性的
<16-4,Adams>and some might be psychological.

372
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,800
<16-5,Taub>你认为被迫忘记那些痛苦回忆
<16-5,Taub>You think being forced to bury painful memories

373
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,770
<16-5,Taub>会让症状恶化
<16-5,Taub>is making symptoms worse?

374
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,740
<16-6,Park>刻意回避悲伤可能导致各种焦虑症
<16-6,Park>Grief avoidance can lead to all sorts of anxiety disorders,

375
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,350
<16-6,Park>并可能通过生理疾病的形式出现
<16-6,Park>which can manifest into physical illness.

376
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,970
<16-7,House>假设  这些症状都是实打实的
<16-7,House>Let's assume...that all his symptoms are real symptoms.

377
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,060
<16-8,Adams>我们就不考虑痛苦回避论了
<16-8,Adams>So we're going to avoid grief avoidance?

378
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,280
<16-9,Taub>911之后有研究表明
<16-9,Taub>Studies after september 11th showed

379
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,820
<16-9,Taub>比起沉浸在痛苦中
<16-9,Taub>that repression was actually better for coping

380
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,350
<16-9,Taub>强忍痛苦更有帮助
<16-9,Taub>than dwelling in misery.

381
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,610
<16-9,Taub>真性红细胞增多症呢
<16-9,Taub>What about polycythemia vera?

382
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,960
<16-10,Adams>红细胞轻微升高  但不严重
<16-10,Adams>RBCs are slightly elevated, but not that much.

383
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,190
<16-11,Taub>霍奇金淋巴瘤
<16-11,Taub>Hodgkin's lymphoma?

384
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,020
<16-12,Park>PET扫描能显示出来
<16-12,Park>Would have showed up in the PET scan.

385
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,510
<16-13,Adams>病人如果是在训练时受伤的呢
<16-13,Adams>What if your guy got hurt at practice?

386
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,360
<16-13,Adams>就像其他事情一样  他对此也守口如瓶
<16-13,Adams>And, like everything else, just didn't tell anyone.

387
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,830
<16-13,Adams>可能引发弥漫性血管内凝血  可解释一切
<16-13,Adams>Could have set off DIC, would explain everything.

388
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,250
<16-14,Taub>你不是要去厕所吗
<16-14,Taub>I thought you had to go to the bathroom.

389
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,950
<16-15,House>又没说要进去
<16-15,House>I didn't say I had to go in.

390
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,820
<16-16,Janitor>这里还需要拖把
<16-16,Janitor>Need some more mops in here!

391
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,830
<17-1,Derrick>你到底在找什么
<17-1,Derrick>What exactly are you looking for?

392
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,840
<17-2,Park>血液  若你的脊髓液是黄色而非透明的
<17-2,Park>Blood. If your spinal fluid is yellow instead of clear,

393
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,050
<17-2,Park>意味着你蛛网膜下腔出血
<17-2,Park>it means you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

394
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,930
<17-2,Park>你弟弟都对你说些什么
<17-2,Park>What does your brother say to you?

395
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,590
<17-2,Park>他和你说你会没事吗
<17-2,Park>Does he tell you you're gonna be okay?

396
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,320
<17-3,Derrick>不是你想的那样
<17-3,Derrick>Doesn't really work like that.

397
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,010
<17-4,Park>我觉得你能听见你弟弟的声音是有原因的
<17-4,Park>I think you hear your brother's voice for a reason.

398
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,460
<17-5,Derrick>你们不是说因为我病了
<17-5,Derrick>Thought you guys said that I hear things

399
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,260
<17-5,Derrick>-才会幻听的  -是的
<17-5,Derrick>- because I'm sick. - Yes.

400
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,210
<17-6,Park>但是这并不能解释
<17-6,Park>But that doesn't explain

401
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,750
<17-6,Park>为什么你只听到你弟弟的声音
<17-6,Park>why you don't hear a different voice.

402
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,990
<17-6,Park>我认为  你妈妈没有
<17-6,Park>I think your mom didn't let you

403
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,730
<17-6,Park>好好地引导你走出失去弟弟的痛苦
<17-6,Park>deal with the grief of losing your brother properly.

404
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,320
<17-6,Park>医院里面
<17-6,Park>There are people here

405
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,260
<17-6,Park>有人能帮你
<17-6,Park>who could help you with that.

406
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,410
<17-7,Park>好吧
<17-7,Park>Okay.

407
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,610
<17-8,Park>你的脊髓液压很高
<17-8,Park>The opening pressure's way too high.

408
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,050
<18-1,Thirteen>浪女回归咯
<18-1,Thirteen>The prodigal daughter returns.

409
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,550
<18-2,House>你还是决定让我来送你一程吗
<18-2,House>You taking me up on my offer to off you?

410
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,870
<18-2,House>我想我还有留了些异丙酚
<18-2,House>Think I've still got some leftover propofol.

411
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,990
<18-3,Thirteen>我和威尔森聊过了
<18-3,Thirteen>Spoke to Wilson.

412
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,700
<18-4,House>他很生气  因为我想让他活得久些
<18-4,House>He's angry because I want him to live longer.

413
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,640
<18-4,House>换成谁都会生气的吧
<18-4,House>Who wouldn't be?

414
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,740
<18-5,Thirteen>朋友就是要尊重彼此的决定
<18-5,Thirteen>Friends respect each other's decisions,

415
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,320
<18-5,Thirteen>哪怕这决定他们并不赞同
<18-5,Thirteen>even if they don't agree with them.

416
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,340
<18-5,Thirteen>这就叫忠诚
<18-5,Thirteen>It's called loyalty.

417
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,830
<18-6,House>忠诚只是一个工具
<18-6,House>Loyalty is a tool

418
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,240
<18-6,House>让人们去做自己不乐意做的事
<18-6,House>to get people to do things they don't wanna do.

419
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,180
<18-7,Thirteen>可这是你想做的
<18-7,Thirteen>But you do want to.

420
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,900
<18-7,Thirteen>你可能有自己不同的解释
<18-7,Thirteen>You may have rationalized it a hundred different ways.

421
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,930
<18-7,Thirteen>但事实是  你开除我就是为给我个机会
<18-7,Thirteen>But the fact is, you fired me so that I'd be forced

422
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,140
<18-7,Thirteen>让我在剩下的生命里
<18-7,Thirteen>to spend the rest of my life

423
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,180
<18-7,Thirteen>能随心所欲地生活
<18-7,Thirteen>doing exactly what I wanted to do.

424
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,900
<18-7,Thirteen>这大概是
<18-7,Thirteen>It was probably the most...

425
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,570
<18-7,Thirteen>我经历过的最无私的行为了
<18-7,Thirteen>selfless thing anyone has ever done for me.

426
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,020
<18-7,Thirteen>说起来你都算不上很喜欢我
<18-7,Thirteen>And you don't even like me that much.

427
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,790
<19-1,House>我投降
<19-1,House>I surrender.

428
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,350
<19-1,House>我一直是个不忠的
<19-1,House>I have been a disloyal...

429
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,770
<19-1,House>无礼的混蛋
<19-1,House>disrespectful jerk.

430
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,080
<19-1,House>我应该听从你的想法
<19-1,House>I should have listened to what you wanted.

431
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,550
<19-2,Wilson>我还是没让我父母回你电话
<19-2,Wilson>I'm still not letting my parents return your call.

432
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,170
<19-3,House>我在卡迈恩餐厅订了位
<19-3,House>I made a reservation for two at Carmine's.

433
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,060
<19-3,House>今晚  八点
<19-3,House>Tonight. 8:00.

434
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,350
<19-3,House>我不会再给你下药再摆布你了
<19-3,House>No more tricks. No more manipulations.

435
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,090
<19-4,Wilson>马基雅弗利如是说
<19-4,Wilson>Said Machiavelli.

437
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,200
<19-4,Wilson>就只是
<19-4,Wilson>Just...

438
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,090
<19-5,House>两个好朋友欢度他们所剩不多的时光
<19-5,House>two friends enjoying the time they have left.

439
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,150
<19-6,Wilson>请不要
<19-6,Wilson>Please, don't--

440
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,130
<19-7,House>我保证不会了
<19-7,House>I'm not. I promise.

441
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
<19-8,Wilson>只是吃顿晚饭吗
<19-8,Wilson>Just dinner?

442
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,150
<19-9,House>那得看你到时候得喝多少
<19-9,House>That depends on how much you have to drink.

443
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,450
<19-10,Wilson>听起来不错
<19-10,Wilson>That sounds nice.

444
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,400
<20-1,Derrick>妈妈
<20-1,Derrick>Mom.

445
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,710
<20-2,Molly>我一收到你们的留言就赶来了
<20-2,Molly>I came as soon as I got your message.

446
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,420
<20-2,Molly>-他还好吗  -我们希望
<20-2,Molly>- Is he gonna be okay? - We're hoping it's just

447
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,400
<20-3,Adams>只是严重偏头疼导致的脑脊液过多
<20-3,Adams>excess fluid on his brain from an extreme migraine,

448
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,990
<20-3,Adams>虽然严重  但可以治愈
<20-3,Adams>which isn't good, but it's treatable.

449
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,510
<20-3,Adams>等这些药物一起作用
<20-3,Adams>He's scheduled to get an MRI

450
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,600
<20-3,Adams>我们就安排他去做磁共振
<20-3,Adams>as soon as these meds start taking effect.

451
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,730
<20-3,Adams>我们在他的宿舍里找到的那张照片
<20-3,Adams>We found that picture in his dorm room.

452
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,440
<20-4,Adams>我不知道德里克怎么跟你说的
<20-4,Adams>I'm not sure what Derrick's told you, but...

453
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,710
<20-4,Adams>但他过去十年一直能听到克里斯多夫的声音
<20-4,Adams>he's been hearing Christopher's voice for the last ten years.

454
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,450
<20-4,Adams>事实上  有可能是因为
<20-4,Adams>And it's possible that repressing

455
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,780
<20-4,Adams>德里克想要压抑心里的悲痛
<20-4,Adams>all that grief he's felt

456
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,170
<20-4,Adams>才引发了这一系列症状
<20-4,Adams>is actually causing some of Derrick's symptoms.

457
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,370
<20-5,Derrick>我甚至不知道我听到的声音
<20-5,Derrick>I don't even know if this voice in my head

458
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,650
<20-5,Derrick>是我自己编的
<20-5,Derrick>is something I invented

459
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,110
<20-5,Derrick>还是真的是克里斯多夫的声音
<20-5,Derrick>or if it's what Christopher was really like.

460
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,720
<20-5,Derrick>没有照片和视频
<20-5,Derrick>With no photos, no video...

461
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,480
<20-5,Derrick>我的记忆...
<20-5,Derrick>My memories...

462
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,600
<20-5,Derrick>我真的都记不得了
<20-5,Derrick>I really don't have any anymore.

463
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,050
<20-5,Derrick>你能不能
<20-5,Derrick>Maybe you could just...

464
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,420
<20-5,Derrick>跟我讲讲他的故事
<20-5,Derrick>tell me a little bit about him?

465
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,210
<20-6,Molly>对不起  我开了很久的车赶来
<20-6,Molly>I'm sorry. It was a long drive in.

466
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,940
<20-6,Molly>我要去喝杯咖啡
<20-6,Molly>I'm gonna go get a coffee.

467
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,300
<20-6,Molly>好的
<20-6,Molly>Okay.

468
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,140
<21-1,Wilson>97岁了
<21-1,Wilson>97 years old,

469
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,480
<21-1,Wilson>你竟然告诉她她怀孕了
<21-1,Wilson>and you told her she was pregnant.

470
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,530
<21-2,House>可这确实治好了她的打嗝
<21-2,House>Well, it cured her hiccups.

471
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,990
<21-3,House>我没想到她会哭那么久
<21-3,House>I didn't expect her to cry for quite so long.

472
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,270
<21-4,House>我知道这里的提拉米苏很棒
<21-4,House>Now, I know that the tiramisu is great here,

473
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,090
<21-4,House>但我点了些菜单上没有的
<21-4,House>but I actually ordered off-menu.

474
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,580
<21-4,House>太棒了
<21-4,House>Great.

475
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,460
<21-5,Wilson>我说了你应该把食品袋挂得再高点
<21-5,Wilson>I told you you didn't hang the bear bag high enough.

476
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,050
<21-6,House>是那熊太聪明了
<21-6,House>It was a smart bear.

477
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,010
<21-6,House>我几乎敢肯定它解开了那扣
<21-6,House>I'm almost certain he untied my knots.

478
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,300
<21-7,Wilson>它才没那么聪明  奥利奥它一包都没拿走
<21-7,Wilson>Well, he wasn't that smart. He left the Oreos behind.

479
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,170
<21-8,House>后来五十多公里徒步
<21-8,House>You hiked for 32 miles

480
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,700
<21-8,House>你只吃奶油夹心
<21-8,House>eating nothing but creamy filling.

481
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,020
<21-9,Wilson>那黑饼干其实没什么好的
<21-9,Wilson>The black stuff is overrated.

482
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,970
<21-10,House>敬那次登山
<21-10,House>To climbing the hill.

483
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,300
<21-10,House>好吧
<21-10,House>Okay.

484
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,760
<21-11,Wilson>如果我决定
<21-11,Wilson>If I did decide to...

485
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,280
<21-11,Wilson>要再逗留会儿
<21-11,Wilson>stick around a little longer--

486
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,030
<21-12,House>别这么对我  威尔森
<21-12,House>Don't do that to me, Wilson.

487
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,540
<21-13,Wilson>不  我只是
<21-13,Wilson>No, I'm not, I'm just--

488
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,930
<21-13,Wilson>我确实感觉不错
<21-13,Wilson>I do feel pretty good and I...

489
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,900
<21-13,Wilson>或许我应该试试化疗
<21-13,Wilson>maybe I should try it

490
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,010
<21-13,Wilson>再坚持一会儿
<21-13,Wilson>for a little while.

491
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,370
<21-13,Wilson>好吧
<21-13,Wilson>Well, I...

492
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,530
<21-14,House>这决定很合理
<21-14,House>I think that's reasonable.

493
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,210
<21-15,Wilson>你是在哄骗我吗
<21-15,Wilson>Are you c-conning me?

494
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,700
<21-15,Wilson>你就是在哄骗我
<21-15,Wilson>You're conning me.

495
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,500
<21-16,House>什么
<21-16,House>Wha--

496
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,640
<21-16,House>你改变主意
<21-16,House>Just because you folded,

497
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,340
<21-16,House>就一定意味着我搞了鬼把戏吗
<21-16,House>that means it must be some evil plan?

498
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,740
<21-17,Wilson>你通常都是这么干的
<21-17,Wilson>Well, that's usually how it works with you.

499
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,470
<21-17,Wilson>你让我沉浸在过去的回忆里
<21-17,Wilson>You drown me in nostalgia

500
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,700
<21-17,Wilson>这样我就会考虑我们的友谊
<21-17,Wilson>So I'll think about our friendship

501
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,440
<21-17,Wilson>想要对你负责  然后就会继续做化疗
<21-17,Wilson>and feel some kind of loyalty and agree to more chemo!

502
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,510
<21-18,House>那些回忆都是真的
<21-18,House>That was real nostalgia.

503
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,490
<21-18,House>你的情感是真的  决定也是真的
<21-18,House>It was real emotions, a real decision.

504
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,580
<21-19,Wilson>这决定是为你做的
<21-19,Wilson>A decision that I just made for you!

505
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,850
<21-20,House>我需要你
<21-20,House>I need you, okay?

506
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,600
<21-20,House>我希望你能一直在我身边  越久越好
<21-20,House>I want you to be around as long as possible.

507
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,020
<21-20,House>因为我不知道没有你要怎么办
<21-20,House>'cause I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.

508
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,570
<21-21,Wilson>不不
<21-21,Wilson>No. No.

509
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,820
<21-21,Wilson>别这样
<21-21,Wilson>Don't do that.

510
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,010
<21-21,Wilson>我什么都不欠你
<21-21,Wilson>I don't owe you anything.

511
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,600
<21-21,Wilson>我们的交情一直都是围绕着你转
<21-21,Wilson>Our entire relationship has been about you.

512
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,690
<21-21,Wilson>我是死是活与你无关
<21-21,Wilson>My dying is about me.

513
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,880
<22-1,House>看看你  你不想死
<22-1,House>Look at you. You don't wanna die.

514
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,900
<22-2,Wilson>我当然不想死
<22-2,Wilson>Of course, I don't wanna die!

515
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,140
<22-3,House>那就抗争啊
<22-3,House>Well, then fight.

516
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,130
<22-4,Wilson>我做了  我试过了
<22-4,Wilson>I did! I tried.

517
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,990
<22-5,House>一次而已
<22-5,House>One time.

518
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,370
<22-6,Wilson>豪斯  你给我下车去
<22-6,Wilson>House, get out of my car.

519
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,120
<22-7,House>你不一定要接受这个事实
<22-7,House>You don't have to just accept this.

520
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,290
<22-7,House>不  我确实需要接受这个事实
<22-7,House>Yes, I do have to accept this.

521
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,750
<22-8,Wilson>我只有五个月可活
<22-8,Wilson>I have five months to live,

522
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,030
<22-8,Wilson>而你要让我独自度过
<22-8,Wilson>and you're making me go through this alone!

523
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,950
<22-8,Wilson>我生气是因为我要死了  这不公平
<22-8,Wilson>I'm pissed because I'm dying, and it's not fair.

524
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,740
<22-8,Wilson>而我需要...
<22-8,Wilson>And I need...

<22-8,Wilson>我需要
<22-8,Wilson>I need--

528
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,700
<22-8,Wilson>我需要你告诉我我的人生...
<22-8,Wilson>I need you to tell me that my life...

529
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,350
<22-8,Wilson>是有价值的  我...
<22-8,Wilson>was worthwhile, and I...

530
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,800
<22-8,Wilson>需要你告诉我你爱我
<22-8,Wilson>I need you to tell me that you love me.

<22-8,Wilson>不
<22-8,Wilson>No.

532
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,140
<22-9,House>我不会说的  除非你抗争下去
<22-9,House>I'm not gonna tell you that unless you fight.

533
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,870
<23-1,Park>血管没有一点反应
<23-1,Park>Blood vessels are nonreactive.

534
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,040
<23-1,Park>这不是偏头痛
<23-1,Park>It's not a migraine.

535
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,120
<23-2,Derrick>我感觉不舒服
<23-2,Derrick>I'm not feeling so great.

536
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,670
<23-2,Derrick>还要多久
<23-2,Derrick>How much longer?

537
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,220
<23-3,Park>这就完
<23-3,Park>Finishing up.

538
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,500
<23-4,Derrick>谢谢  亚当斯医生
<23-4,Derrick>Thank you, Dr. Adams.

539
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,360
<23-5,Park>看上去天花板要...
<23-5,Park>It looks like the ceiling might...

540
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,570
<24-1,Taub>你回来干什么
<24-1,Taub>What are you doing back here?

541
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,750
<24-2,House>我们有个病例
<24-2,House>We got a case.

542
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,650
<24-2,House>看样子病人病情加重
<24-2,House>Assume the status is: patient's getting worse.

543
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,120
<24-2,House>而你们困惑不解
<24-2,House>You guys are confused.

544
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,670
<24-3,Adams>你真的认为跑来工作
<24-3,Adams>You think actually showing up for work

545
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,500
<24-3,Adams>就能弥补你毁坏磁共振机
<24-3,Adams>is enough to make up for ruining an MRI,

546
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,820
<24-3,Adams>把病人至于危险境地
<24-3,Adams>endangering the patient,

547
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,020
<24-3,Adams>害我们受伤的后果吗
<24-3,Adams>injuring us?

548
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,140
<24-4,House>我有确凿的证人证明我在继续工作
<24-4,House>I got an airtight alibi that I'm working on.

549
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,190
<24-5,Taub>这和破坏没有关系
<24-5,Taub>This isn't about the damage.

550
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,370
<24-5,Taub>你回来是因为威尔森那边发生了什么事
<24-5,Taub>You're back because something's going on with Wilson.

551
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,750
<24-6,House>我和威尔森结束了
<24-6,House>I'm done with Wilson.

552
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,430
<24-7,Taub>什么意思  什么叫你和威尔森结束了
<24-7,Taub>What does that mean, you're done with Wilson?

553
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,570
<24-7,Taub>只要他没有死  你们就不会结束
<24-7,Taub>If he's not dead, you're not done with Wilson.

554
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,540
<24-8,Adams>你突然觉得能改变他的想法了吗
<24-8,Adams>You suddenly think you're gonna make a difference?

555
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,080
<24-9,Taub>你不能就这么抛弃他
<24-9,Taub>You can't just abandon him.

556
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,530
<24-10,House>现在一切由他自己决定
<24-10,House>It's in his hands now.

557
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,350
<24-10,House>机器被淹前获得清晰的图片了吗
<24-10,House>Get any good pictures before the MRI drowned?

558
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,460
<24-11,Park>至少可以确定不是偏头痛了
<24-11,Park>Enough to know it wasn't a migraine.

559
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,610
<24-11,Park>病人错把我认成亚当斯了
<24-11,Park>And the patient mistook me for Adams.

560
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,440
<24-12,House>跟我来
<24-12,House>Come with me.

561
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,430
<25-2,House>你觉得如果
<25-2,House>So what do you think's gonna happen

562
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,480
<25-2,House>我往他的鼓膜里扎一针会发生什么
<25-2,House>when I stick a needle into his eardrum?

563
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,730
<25-3,Taub>你在考我们吗
<25-3,Taub>You quizzing us?

564
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,310
<25-4,House>这是个好题目
<25-4,House>Oh, this is a good quiz.

565
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,700
<25-5,Adams>-他会疼的大叫的  -别听她的
<25-5,Adams>- He'll scream in pain. - Don't listen to her.

566
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,930
<25-6,House>针头很小  我的手也很稳
<25-6,House>Very small needle, very steady hand.

567
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,180
<25-7,Derrick>现在  我往外拔气塞时
<25-7,Derrick>Now, when I pull back on the plunger,

568
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,320
<25-8,House>你们觉得会抽出什么
<25-8,House>what do you think's gonna come out?

569
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,170
<25-9,Park>空气
<25-9,Park>Air.

570
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,780
<25-10,House>伙计  那空气肯定是红色的
<25-10,House>Boy, that air sure is red.

571
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,180
<25-10,House>永存镫骨动脉
<25-10,House>Persistent stapedial artery.

572
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,680
<25-10,House>应该在胚胎时期就消失了的
<25-10,House>It should disappear in the embryonic stage,

573
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,200
<25-10,House>就像他那死去的弟弟一样
<25-10,House>but just like his dead brother,

574
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,880
<25-10,House>他就是放不下
<25-10,House>he really can't let go.

575
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,230
<25-10,House>一条动脉压迫了
<25-10,House>An artery's been pressing against

576
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,700
<25-10,House>他的大脑颞叶  就在耳道上面
<25-10,House>the temporal lobe of his brain, right above the ear canal.

577
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,060
<25-10,House>解释了幻听  晕眩  一切症状
<25-10,House>It explains the voices, the dizziness, everything.

578
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,290
<25-10,House>现在你们知道怎么治好他了
<25-10,House>Now you guys can explain how we're gonna make him better.

579
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,490
<25-11,Derrick>我弟弟的声音也会消失吗
<25-11,Derrick>Will my brother's voice go away?

580
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,780
<26-1,Taub>你这么做太浑了
<26-1,Taub>You're being an ass.

581
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,840
<26-2,House>我刚治好了个病人  你干什么了
<26-2,House>I just cured a patient. How 'bout you?

582
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,230
<26-3,Taub>你不能就这么放弃威尔森
<26-3,Taub>You can't just give up on Wilson.

583
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,190
<26-3,Taub>你知道他需要你
<26-3,Taub>You know he needs you.

584
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,250
<26-3,Taub>你知道他在做两难的选择
<26-3,Taub>You know he's making an impossible choice.

585
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,660
<26-3,Taub>他只是不想生活在痛苦里
<26-3,Taub>He just doesn't want to live in pain.

586
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,340
<26-4,House>人生就是痛苦
<26-4,House>Life is pain!

587
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,930
<26-4,House>每天早上醒来  我就在痛苦之中
<26-4,House>I wake up every morning, I'm in pain.

588
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,200
<26-4,House>我带着痛苦去工作
<26-4,House>I go to work in pain.

589
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,980
<26-4,House>你知道有多少次我想就这么放弃
<26-4,House>You know how many times I wanted to just give up?

590
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,990
<26-4,House>多少次我想过就这么结束
<26-4,House>How many times I thought about ending it?

591
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,220
<27-1,House>你在这是想冲我大喊大叫还是要送我冰球票
<27-1,House>You here to yell at me or give me hockey tickets?

592
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,330
<27-2,Park>我们不得不推迟手术
<27-2,Park>Had to delay the surgery

593
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,740
<27-2,Park>因为病人喝了看护车中的氨水
<27-2,Park>because our patient drank ammonia from the janitor's cart.

594
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,330
<27-2,Park>我猜...
<27-2,Park>I guess...

595
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,540
<27-2,Park>他不想在没有弟弟声音的情况下活下去
<27-2,Park>he didn't want to live without his brother's voice.

596
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,570
<27-3,Park>你去哪
<27-3,Park>Where are you going?

00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,220
<27-11,Jen>他只是做了傻事
<27-11,Jen>He did something stupid.

603
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,220
<27-11,Jen>他不会再这么做了
<27-11,Jen>He's not gonna do it again.

604
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,240
<27-12,House>你反抗我是因为存活下去
<27-12,House>You're resisting me because it's our human responsibility

605
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,380
<27-12,House>是我们人类的责任
<27-12,House>to stay alive!

606
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,600
<27-13,Park>你表明了你的观点  豪斯
<27-13,Park>You made your point, House!

607
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,420
<27-13,Park>住手
<27-13,Park>Stop!

608
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,150
<27-14,Park>你的一生都在寻找真相
<27-14,Park>You've spent your whole life looking for the truth.

609
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,310
<27-14,Park>但有时真相就是如此悲剧
<27-14,Park>But sometimes the truth just sucks.

610
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,800
<28-1,Wilson>我...
<28-1,Wilson>I'm, uh...

611

<28-1,Wilson>我要比之前说好的
<28-1,Wilson>I'm gonna be leaving, uh,

612
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,090
<28-1,Wilson>提前一些离开
<28-1,Wilson>quite a bit earlier than we had talked about.

613
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,820
<28-1,Wilson>大概...明后天
<28-1,Wilson>The... next day or two.

614
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,570
<28-2,Foreman>发生什么事了
<28-2,Foreman>What happened?

615
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,770
<28-2,Foreman>你和豪斯闹矛盾了吗
<28-2,Foreman>Something between you and House?

616
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,870
<28-3,Wilson>他不是我的孩子
<28-3,Wilson>He's not my child.

617
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:34,200
<28-3,Wilson>我不可能为格里高里·豪斯的幸福负责
<28-3,Wilson>I cannot be responsible for the happiness of Gregory House.

618
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,350
<28-4,Foreman>我会把这些给弗兰克尔
<28-4,Foreman>Well, uh... I'll get these to Frankel.

619
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,740
<28-5,Wilson>好的  谢谢
<28-5,Wilson>Okay. Thank you.

620
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,080
<28-6,Foreman>你得为他负责
<28-6,Foreman>You are responsible.

621
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,810
<28-6,Foreman>过去20年中  你有过三任妻子
<28-6,Foreman>The past 20 years you've had three wives,

622
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,880
<28-6,Foreman>数百位同事  几千名病人
<28-6,Foreman>hundreds of colleagues, thousands of patients.

623
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,970
<28-6,Foreman>却只有一个至交好友
<28-6,Foreman>But you've kept that one best friend.

<28-7,Wilson>他要我经历我不愿承受的痛苦
<28-7,Wilson>He wants me to suffer a misery that I don't want to go through.

625
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,220
<28-8,Foreman>化疗不能让你的生活好起来
<28-8,Foreman>Chemo won't make your life any better.

626
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,430
<28-8,Foreman>但是关怀能够
<28-8,Foreman>But caring will.

627
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,510
<28-8,Foreman>为关心的人忍受痛苦
<28-8,Foreman>Enduring pain to do some good for someone you care about...

628
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,990
<28-8,Foreman>不正是生命的意义吗
<28-8,Foreman>Isn't that what life is?

629
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,270
<29-1,Derrick>妈
<29-1,Derrick>Mom?

<29-3,Derrick>我放在柜子上的克里斯多夫的照片
<29-3,Derrick>That picture of Christopher that I had on the stand.

632
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,120
<29-3,Derrick>是你拿走了吗
<29-3,Derrick>Did you take it?

633
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,880
<29-4,Jen>是的
<29-4,Jen>Yes.

634
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,980
<29-5,Derrick>你丢掉了吗
<29-5,Derrick>Did you throw it out?

635
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,070
<29-5,Derrick>如果我同意做手术
<29-5,Derrick>If I agree to get the surgery,

636
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,390
<29-5,Derrick>你能把照片拿回来吗
<29-5,Derrick>can you bring that picture back?

637
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,530
<29-6,House>-不在  -豪斯
<29-6,House>- Not home. - House.

638
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,370
<29-8,Wilson>我准备好接受下一轮化疗了
<29-8,Wilson>I'm ready to start the next round of chemo.

639
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,530
<29-9,House>为什么
<29-9,House>Why?

640
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,420
<29-10,Wilson>因为你需要我
<29-10,Wilson>Because you need me

641
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,840
<29-10,Wilson>而且
<29-10,Wilson>and...

642
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,270
<29-10,Wilson>我觉得化疗没那么糟糕了
<29-10,Wilson>I don't think that's a bad thing anymore.

643
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,680
<29-10,Wilson>不
<29-10,Wilson>No.

644
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,740
<29-11,House>我只听你一个人的话
<29-11,House>You're the only one I listen to.

645
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,770
<29-11,House>最近两天我没听你的
<29-11,House>The last couple of days, I didn't,

646
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,360
<29-11,House>结果差点杀了自己的病人
<29-11,House>and I almost killed my patient.

647
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,570
<29-11,House>所以我想我应该接受这个事实
<29-11,House>So I think it's time for me to accept that...

648
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,490
<29-11,House>你比我要聪明
<29-11,House>you're just smarter than I am.

649
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,700
<29-12,Wilson>你能接受我只有5个月时间吗
<29-12,Wilson>Are you really okay that there's only five months left?

650
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,080
<29-12,Wilson>不能
<29-12,Wilson>No.

651
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,370
<29-13,House>可是总比没有要好
<29-13,House>But it's better than nothing.

652
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,920
<29-14,Wilson>从哪里开始
<29-14,Wilson>How do we start?

653
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,970
<29-15,House>我是不会说"我爱你"的
<29-15,House>I'm not gonna say "I love you."

654
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,880
<29-16,Wilson>感谢上帝  有奥利奥吗
<29-16,Wilson>Thank God. You got any Oreos?

658
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,600
<30-1,Jen>感觉如何
<30-1,Jen>How are you feeling?

659
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,700
<30-2,Derrick>手术起作用了
<30-2,Derrick>The surgery worked.

660
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,210
<30-3,Jen>你怎么知道
<30-3,Jen>How can you tell?

661
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,140
<30-4,Derrick>因为克里斯多夫走了

<31-1,Wilson>这是主峰  将近8000英尺
<31-1,Wilson>And this is the peak. Almost 8,000 feet.

673
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,490
<31-2,House>我的腿可比上次徒步旅行时差了
<31-2,House>You do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little

674
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,810
<31-2,House>你是知道的吧
<31-2,House>since the last time we went hiking.
