<3-2,Chase>-他做什么梦了  -这没关系吧
<3-2,Chase>- What was he dreaming about? - It doesn't matter.

73
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,330
<3-3,Park>只是一个梦
<3-3,Park>It's a dream.

74
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,570
<3-3,Park>没什么特殊意义
<3-3,Park>It doesn't mean anything.

75
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,970
<3-4,Chase>如果噩梦足够吓人
<3-4,Chase>If the nightmare's scary enough,

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,240
<3-4,Chase>不管有没有意义  都可能引起儿茶酚胺激增
<3-4,Chase>meaningful or not, it could cause a catecholamine surge

80
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,110
<3-4,Chase>这够吓人的
<3-4,Chase>I think that qualifies.

81
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,450
<3-5,Taub>但根据其它检查结果
<3-5,Taub>Except in the rational part of the file,

82
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,950
<3-5,Taub>他的心电图正常
<3-5,Taub>where it says his EKG's within normal limits.

83
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,930
<3-5,Taub>不是心脏问题
<3-5,Taub>It's not his heart.

84
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,820
<3-6,Adams>会不会是阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停
<3-6,Adams>What about obstructive sleep apnea?

85
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,590
<3-7,House>阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停不会导致在他醒后
<3-7,House>Sleep apnea wouldn't have caused breathing problems

86
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,560
<3-7,House>还无法呼吸
<3-7,House>after he woke up.

87
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,260
<3-7,House>你梦见了什么
<3-7,House>What did you dream of?

<3-8,Park>我从来都记不住我做过什么梦
<3-8,Park>I never remember my dreams.

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
<3-9,House>但你很肯定它们都没什么意义
<3-9,House>But you're certain that they're insignificant,

90
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,630
<3-9,House>带着辩护的语气
<3-9,House>defensively so.

91
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,170
<3-10,Park>我是在为科学辩护
<3-10,Park>I was defending science.

92
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,170
<3-11,House>你用辩护的语气辩护科学
<3-11,House>You were defensively defending science.

93
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,740
<3-12,Park>吸入有毒物质所致的肺损伤
<3-12,Park>Lung damage from inhaled toxins

94
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,640
<3-12,Park>可能引起他在醒后还无法呼吸
<3-12,Park>could keep causing problems after he woke up.

95
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,670
<3-13,Adams>或者是上呼吸道感染
<3-13,Adams>Or an upper respiratory infection.

96
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,110
<3-14,House>好吧  奇斯和朴克
<3-14,House>Okay, Chase and Park,

97
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,350
<3-14,House>给他挂上抗生素治疗肺炎
<3-14,House>start IV antibiotics for pneumonia.

98
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,050
<3-14,House>陶博和亚当斯去他家看看有什么有毒物质
<3-14,House>Taub and Adams, go check the home for toxins.

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,380
<3-15,Park>我能和陶博一起么
<3-15,Park>Could I go with Taub?

100
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,290
<3-15,Park>那是我的主意
<3-15,Park>It was my idea.

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,120
<3-16,House>这样...  因为就那么一刹那
<3-16,House>Right... 'cause for a moment there,

102
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,790
<3-16,House>我还以为你是不想和奇斯在一块
<3-16,House>I thought you were uncomfortable around Chase

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,000
<3-16,House>因为你梦见个澳大利亚帅哥
<3-16,House>because you'd had a nocturnal Australian.

104
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,100
<3-16,House>你想和谁搭档都行
<3-16,House>You can go with whoever you want.

105
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,500
<3-16,House>但你们所有人  都得把这些病例看完
<3-16,House>But all of you, read all of these files.

106
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,650
<4-1,Chase>你认为是恶灵在伤害你儿子吗
<4-1,Chase>Do you believe a spirit could be hurting your son?

107
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,310
<4-2,Lida>当然不
<4-2,Lida>No, of course not.

108
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,420
<4-3,Chase>因为如果他从小就被灌输这类信仰
<4-3,Chase>Because if he's been taught to believe that,

109
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
<4-3,Chase>就有可能是巨大的恐惧
<4-3,Chase>it is possible for the fear alone

110
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,190
<4-3,Chase>影响到他的心脏功能
<4-3,Chase>to affect heart function.

111
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,650
<4-4,Lida>我是名工程师
<4-4,Lida>I'm an engineer.

112
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,320
<4-4,Lida>我知道恶灵是无法带来疾病的
<4-4,Lida>I know illnesses aren't caused by evil spirits.

113
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,760
<4-5,Chase>抱歉  我不是有意的
<4-5,Chase>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to,

114
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,160
<4-5,Chase>我只是得  问一下
<4-5,Chase>I just... had to check.

115
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,600
<4-6,Lida>你还有别的事要问吗
<4-6,Lida>Anything else you need to check?

116
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,720
<4-7,Chase>没了
<4-7,Chase>No.

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,480
<5-1,House>我做了个梦
<5-1,House>I had a dream.

118
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,980
<5-1,House>豪斯
<5-1,House>House...

119
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,450
<5-2,Wilson>我们稍后再谈
<5-2,Wilson>We can talk later.

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,650
<5-3,House>别紧张  我是医生
<5-3,House>Relax, I'm a doctor.

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,920
<5-3,House>你完美的胸部对我来说不算什么
<5-3,House>Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me.

122
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,050
<5-4,Wilson>豪斯
<5-4,Wilson>House...

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,620
<5-4,Wilson>豪斯
<5-4,Wilson>House!

124
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,930
<6-1,Wilson>等会再说
<6-1,Wilson>Later.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,460
<6-2,House>我和多米尼卡上床了
<6-2,House>I had sex with Dominika.

126
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,370
<6-3,Wilson>在梦里吗
<6-3,Wilson>In a dream?

127
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,140
<6-4,House>不是真正的做爱
<6-4,House>It wasn't literally sex.

128
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,440
<6-4,House>严格点说  算是口交
<6-4,House>Technically, it was flossing.

129
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,170
<6-4,House>你懂的  牙齿碰蛋蛋
<6-4,House>You know, teeth, testicles.

130
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,380
<6-4,House>我说的够明白了吧
<6-4,House>I think the symbolism is pretty clear.

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,350
<6-5,Wilson>"等会再说"升级为"永不提起"
<6-5,Wilson>"Later" just changed to "Never."

132
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,750
<6-5,Wilson>我告诉你什么更奇怪吧
<6-5,Wilson>I'll tell you what would be weirder,

133
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,390
<7-1,Taub>那就是你没梦见过和奇斯上床
<7-1,Taub>if you didn't dream about having sex with Chase.

134
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,720
<7-2,Park>你梦见过吗
<7-2,Park>Have you?

135
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,560
<7-2,Park>没有
<7-2,Park>No.

136
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,030
<7-3,Taub>但是我梦见过
<7-3,Taub>But I've dreamed about having sex

137
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,430
<7-3,Taub>和很多同事上床
<7-3,Taub>with a lot of people I work with,

138
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,630
<7-3,Taub>并不觉得有啥奇怪
<7-3,Taub>and it didn't freak me out.

139
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,130
<7-4,Park>那不一样
<7-4,Park>That's different.

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,470
<7-5,Taub>怎么不一样
<7-5,Taub>How?

141
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,070
<7-6,Park>因为你本身就和
<7-6,Park>'Cause you've actually had sex

142
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,170
<7-6,Park>很多同事上过床
<7-6,Park>with a lot of people at work,

143
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,640
<7-6,Park>那都不足为奇了  春梦算什么
<7-6,Park>and that hasn't freaked you out.

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,340
<7-7,Taub>有道理
<7-7,Taub>Good point.

145
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,810
<7-7,Taub>那你是在担心这个梦的意义吗
<7-7,Taub>So you're worried about what it means?

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,950
<7-8,Park>我没担心  这梦没啥意义
<7-8,Park>I'm not worried. It means nothing.

147
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,520
<7-8,Park>还是有些意义的  对吗
<7-8,Park>It means something, doesn't it?

148
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,920
<7-8,Park>他是我同事
<7-8,Park>I work with him.

149
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,420
<7-8,Park>我不能想和他滚床单
<7-8,Park>I can't want to sleep with him.

150
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,320
<7-9,Taub>也许奇斯只代表了工作
<7-9,Taub>Maybe Chase just represents work.

151
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,510
<7-9,Taub>你只是爱上你的工作罢了
<7-9,Taub>You're just falling in love with your job.

152
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,330
<7-10,Park>最近倒是确实挺开心的
<7-10,Park>It has been very satisfying lately.

153
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,060
<7-11,Taub>你闻到了吗
<7-11,Taub>You smell that?

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,970
<7-12,Park>闻到了  像是湿了的狗
<7-12,Park>Yeah. Smells like wet dog.

155
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,740
<7-13,Taub>是霉
<7-13,Taub>It's mold.

156
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,770
<7-14,Park>-不是霉  -肯定是霉
<7-14,Park>- It's not mold. - It's definitely mold.

157
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,840
<7-15,Taub>看不出有任何漏水迹象
<7-15,Taub>I don't see any sign of water damage.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,800
<7-16,Taub>天呐
<7-16,Taub>Holy crap.

159
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,550
<8-1,Taub>那感觉就像进了屠宰场
<8-1,Taub>It looked like a slaughterhouse.

160
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,540
<8-2,Lida>我不明白你在说什么
<8-2,Lida>I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,180
<8-2,Lida>我们走的时候还好好的
<8-2,Lida>It was clean when we left.

162
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,840
<8-3,Taub>这么说有人闯入你们家
<8-3,Taub>You're telling us some random person broke into your house

163
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,700
<8-3,Taub>就为在你儿子的房间里肢解一头猪吗
<8-3,Taub>to dismember a pig in your son's bedroom?

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,620
<8-4,Lida>一头猪
<8-4,Lida>A pig?

165
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,530
<8-4,Lida>是我公公
<8-4,Lida>My father-in-law.

166
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,260
<8-5,Lida>你到底干了什么
<8-5,Lida>What did you do?

167
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,810
<8-6,Xang>早在几周前  噩梦开始时
<8-6,Xang>What you should have done weeks ago,

168
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,110
<8-6,Xang>你就该做的事
<8-6,Xang>when the dreams started.

169
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,600
<8-6,Xang>我在救卢
<8-6,Xang>I'm saving Lue.

170
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,050
<8-7,Nurse>他的心搏停止了
<8-7,Nurse>He's coding!

171
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,530
<8-7,Nurse>这里需要一位医生
<8-7,Nurse>Need a doctor in here!

172
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,000
<8-8,Nurse>室速  无脉搏
<8-8,Nurse>V-tach. No pulse.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,630
<8-10,Park>-天哪  -静推1毫克肾上腺素
<8-10,Park>- Oh, my god! - Push 1 milligram epi!

174
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,490
<8-11,Taub>-准备电极  充电50焦耳  -充电
<8-11,Taub>- Paddles. Charge to 50. - Charging!

175
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,700
<8-13,Taub>离手
<8-13,Taub>Clear!

176
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,020
<8-14,Lida>宝贝
<8-14,Lida>Baby...

177
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,480
<8-15,Park>仍为室速
<8-15,Park>Still v-tach!

178
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,880
<8-16,Taub>充电100焦耳
<8-16,Taub>Charge to 100!

179
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
<8-17,Nurse>100焦耳
<8-17,Nurse>100!

180
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,960
<8-18,Taub>远离病床
<8-18,Taub>Clear!

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,610
<8-19,Park>-充电...  -等等
<8-19,Park>- Charge-- - wait!

182
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,790
<8-19,Park>正常窦性心律
<8-19,Park>Normal sinus rhythm.

183
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
<8-20,Lida>我的天
<8-20,Lida>Oh, god!

184
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:36,900
<9-1,Taub>目前他还稳定
<9-1,Taub>He's stable,

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,480
<9-1,Taub>但显然又增加了一个症状
<9-1,Taub>but we've obviously got a second symptom.

186
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,320
<9-2,House>嗯嗯嗯  小孩室速
<9-2,House>Yeah, yeah, yeah, kid in v-tach.

187
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,010
<9-2,House>说说他屋里的那个夏威夷野猪宴
<9-2,House>Tell me about the luau in his bedroom.

188
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,750
<9-3,Park>是苗族的一种传统仪式
<9-3,Park>It's a traditional Hmong ceremony

189
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,510
<9-3,Park>说是能召回那孩子的灵魂
<9-3,Park>that's supposed to call back the kid's soul.

190
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,600
<9-4,House>-他没听说过呼叫返回吗  -不只这样
<9-4,House>- Hasn't he heard of star-6-9? - There's more.

191
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,570
<9-5,Taub>爷爷之所以会认为小孩的灵魂被偷了
<9-5,Taub>The reason grandpa thinks the kid's soul is stolen

192
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,130
<9-5,Taub>是因为他确信自己的儿子
<9-5,Taub>is because he's convinced his son,

193
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,340
<9-5,Taub>那孩子父亲的灵魂也被偷走过
<9-5,Taub>the kid's father, had his stolen as well.

194
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,930
<9-5,Taub>他把他的老板活活打死了
<9-5,Taub>He beat his boss to death.

195
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,280
<9-5,Taub>爸爸并不是搬了家
<9-5,Taub>The dad didn't move away.

196
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
<9-5,Taub>是进了监狱
<9-5,Taub>He's in prison.

197
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,210
<9-6,Adams>创伤后应激障碍很有可能
<9-6,Adams>PTSD could definitely cause

198
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,980
<9-6,Adams>导致呼吸问题
<9-6,Adams>breathing problems--

199
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,700
<9-7,Park>这不是创伤后应激障碍
<9-7,Park>It's not PTSD.

200
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,380
<9-8,Adams>就算当时那孩子不在场
<9-8,Adams>Even if the kid wasn't there,

201
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,950
<9-8,Adams>仅仅是听说了他爸爸的事
<9-8,Adams>just hearing what the dad did...

202
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,880
<9-9,Park>他并不知道
<9-9,Park>But he hasn't.

203
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,130
<9-9,Park>当时他才两岁
<9-9,Park>It happened when he was two,

204
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,030
<9-9,Park>他一直以为
<9-9,Park>and all he's ever been told is that

205
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,080
<9-9,Park>父母离了婚
<9-9,Park>his parents divorced

206
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,620
<9-9,Park>而爸爸搬走了
<9-9,Park>and his dad moved away.

207
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,630
<9-10,Chase>心脏骤停表示恶性心律失常
<9-10,Chase>The heart thing indicates a malignant arrhythmia.

208
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,660
<9-10,Chase>需要为他行心脏电生理学检查
<9-10,Chase>He needs an E.P. Study.

209
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,820
<9-10,Chase>其他病例里有多少人
<9-10,Chase>How many of the other files

210
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,610
<9-11,House>出现过恶性心律失常的症状
<9-11,House>showed malignant arrhythmias?

211
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,540
<9-12,Chase>都没有  不过
<9-12,Chase>None, but--

212
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,660
<9-13,House>不做电生理学
<9-13,House>Forget the E.P.

213
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,210
<9-14,Taub>有急性心包炎的可能吗
<9-14,Taub>What about acute pericarditis?

214
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,360
<9-14,Taub>可以解释他的呼吸困难
<9-14,Taub>Explains the dyspnea.

215
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,280
<9-15,House>病例里有多少...
<9-15,House>How many of the other files...

216
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,240
<9-16,Taub>仰卧位时症状加重
<9-16,Taub>It's exacerbated by lying supine,

217
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
<9-16,Taub>在他睡觉的时候
<9-16,Taub>so the symptoms would get worse

218
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,910
<9-16,Taub>症状就会恶化
<9-16,Taub>when he goes to sleep.

219
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,780
<9-16,Taub>就和其他100多个病例一样
<9-16,Taub>Just like all 100 of the others.

220
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,630
<9-17,House>做超声检查心包
<9-17,House>Do an echo to check the pericardium.

221
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,570
<9-17,House>看看你能否在样本里
<9-17,House>See if you can find any cardioactive toxins

222
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,780
<9-17,House>找出任何刺激心脏的毒素
<9-17,House>in the home samples.

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,310
<9-18,Park>我想说  我真的非常喜欢我的工作
<9-18,Park>Can I just say that I very much enjoy my job?

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,390
<10-1,House>不  不  别这样
<10-1,House>No, no, please.

225
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,270
<10-1,House>没必要为你之前的态度道歉
<10-1,House>No need to apologize for your earlier behavior.

226
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,930
<10-1,House>那个梦还是薄荷味的
<10-1,House>Floss was mint.

227
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,550
<10-1,House>大概是因为她在浴室里
<10-1,House>Probably because of this green g-string

228
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,650
<10-1,House>晾了条绿色丁字裤的关系
<10-1,House>she hangs up to dry in the bathroom.

229
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,080
<10-2,Wilson>我的手表一定是停了
<10-2,Wilson>My watch must have stopped.

230
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,610
<10-2,Wilson>显然"永不"已经到了
<10-2,Wilson>Apparently it's already "never."

231
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,370
<10-3,House>你最好暂时把电话设为呼叫转移
<10-3,House>You might want to forward your calls.

232
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,390
<10-3,House>你是绝不会想听
<10-3,House>You do not want

233
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,170
<10-3,House>我绘声绘色的描述
<10-3,House>the Reader's Digest version on this.

234
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,450
<10-3,House>她穿着非常紧身的牙医制服
<10-3,House>There was a very tight hygienist's uniform,

235
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,510
<10-3,House>略带挑逗性地用着喷壶
<10-3,House>suggestive use of the water sprayer.

236
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,040
<10-4,Wilson>你的春梦并不代表性  是内疚
<10-4,Wilson>The floss isn't sex. It's guilt.

237
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,440
<10-4,Wilson>你把多米尼卡
<10-4,Wilson>It's tying you up for

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,280
<10-4,Wilson>获得身份的通知扔了
<10-4,Wilson>throwing away the I.N.S. notification

239
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,410
<10-4,Wilson>所以感到内疚
<10-4,Wilson>granting Dominika her citizenship.

240
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,430
<10-4,Wilson>她能搬走了  自己却还不知道
<10-4,Wilson>She can move out, but she still doesn't know it,

241
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,770
<10-4,Wilson>基本上就等于你把她给关了起来
<10-4,Wilson>which means you're basically holding her prisoner.

242
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,050
<10-4,Wilson>把实话告诉她
<10-4,Wilson>Tell her the truth,

243
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,620
<10-4,Wilson>别再来烦我
<10-4,Wilson>and leave me alone.

244
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,490
<11-1,Chase>-真的吗  -怎么啦
<11-1,Chase>- Really? - What?

245
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,500
<11-2,Park>你吓了我一跳
<11-2,Park>You startled me.

246
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,960
<11-3,Chase>我们每天都在一起工作
<11-3,Chase>We work together every day,

247
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,850
<11-3,Chase>常常处于压力之下
<11-3,Chase>usually under a fair amount of stress.

248
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,100
<11-3,Chase>我偶尔出现在
<11-3,Chase>It's only natural I'd pop into

249
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,150
<11-3,Chase>你的潜意识里是很自然的事
<11-3,Chase>a subconscious thought every once in a while.

250
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,200
<11-4,Park>你梦见过和我上床吗
<11-4,Park>Have you ever dreamt about having sex with me?

251
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,400
<11-5,Chase>没有
<11-5,Chase>No.

252
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,230
<11-6,Park>你犹豫了
<11-6,Park>You paused.

253
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,730
<11-7,Chase>不  我没有  你觉得我是在说谎吗
<11-7,Chase>No, I didn't. You think I'm lying?

254
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,820
<11-8,Park>不  我认为你是怕自己回答得太快
<11-8,Park>No, I think you're fighting the urge to snap

255
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,900
<11-8,Park>因为你的潜意识
<11-8,Park>the word "no" because

256
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,740
<11-8,Park>其实觉得这想法很荒唐
<11-8,Park>your subconscious finds the idea abhorrent.

257
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,020
<12-1,Chase>若我立刻回答  会冒犯你
<12-1,Chase>So if I snap, it's offensive,

258
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,590
<12-1,Chase>如果我稍有停顿  也会因为
<12-1,Chase>and if I don't snap, it's offensive

259
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,660
<12-1,Chase>同样的原因冒犯你
<12-1,Chase>for the exact same reason?

260
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,290
<12-2,Park>和你的潜意识谈谈吧
<12-2,Park>Talk to your subconscious.

261
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,210
<12-3,Chase>现在变得尴尬  也是因为你弄尴尬的
<12-3,Chase>This is becoming weird because you're making it weird.

262
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,090
<12-4,Park>你想说你没觉得这想法很荒唐吗
<12-4,Park>So you don't find the idea abhorrent?

263
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,920
<12-5,Chase>我和你一起共事
<12-5,Chase>I work with you.

264
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,010
<12-5,Chase>没必要回答这个问题
<12-5,Chase>I don't have to answer that question.

265
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,130
<12-6,Park>你刚刚就算是回答了
<12-6,Park>You just did.

266
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,260
<12-6,Park>发生什么事了
<12-6,Park>What happened?

267
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,680
<12-7,Taub>超声无异常
<12-7,Taub>Echo was negative,

268
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,720
<12-7,Taub>但是他有剧烈的腹痛
<12-7,Taub>but he has severe abdominal pain.

269
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,490
<12-8,Adams>超声检查未见肠梗阻征象
<12-8,Adams>Ultrasound didn't suggest any intestinal blockages,

270
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,130
<12-8,Adams>不过便秘很严重
<12-8,Adams>but he's severely constipated.

271
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,350
<12-9,Park>从厨房取的样本中没查出芽孢杆菌属
<12-9,Park>No spores, clostridium, or organic toxins

272
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,510
<12-9,Park>梭菌属及有机毒素  卧室里也没有
<12-9,Park>in the kitchen samples. Nothing in the bedroom either.

273
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,610
<12-10,Adams>应行肠镜检查
<12-10,Adams>We need to scope him,

274
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,470
<12-10,Adams>需要先为他灌肠
<12-10,Adams>and we're gonna need to clear his bowel first.

275
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,270
<12-11,Chase>应该行甲状腺活检
<12-11,Chase>We should biopsy his thyroid.

276
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,840
<12-12,Adams>他可是便秘
<12-12,Adams>For an impacted bowel?

277
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,800
<12-13,Chase>桥本甲状腺炎可以解释其
<12-13,Chase>Hashimoto's thyroiditis would explain

278
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,320
<12-13,Chase>肺  心及肠道受累
<12-13,Chase>his lung, heart, and intestinal involvement.

279
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,590
<12-13,Chase>如果你认为这还不够得到豪斯的批准
<12-13,Chase>And if you think we still need House's approval,

280
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,650
<12-13,Chase>这也能解释在睡眠中死亡
<12-13,Chase>it also explains dying in your sleep.

281
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,620
<12-14,Park>好主意
<12-14,Park>Nice call.

282
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,070
<13-1,Dominika>你说请我吃饭
<13-1,Dominika>When you invite me for dinner,

283
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,180
<13-1,Dominika>我还以为你会带我去餐馆
<13-1,Dominika>I thought maybe you take me to a restaurant.

284
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
<13-1,Dominika>至少会有盘子
<13-1,Dominika>Or have plates.

285
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,460
<13-2,House>对不起
<13-2,House>Yeah, sorry.

286
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,570
<13-2,House>那个送外卖的笨蛋忘记带来了
<13-2,House>Idiot delivery guy forgot them.

287
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,310
<13-3,Dominika>是送外卖的笨蛋
<13-3,Dominika>The idiot delivery guy,

288
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,460
<13-3,Dominika>还是那个把饭放在休息室冰箱里
<13-3,Dominika>or the idiot guy whose food you stole

289
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,110
<13-3,Dominika>却被你偷了的笨蛋
<13-3,Dominika>from lounge refrigerator?

290
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,130
<13-4,House>你还真了解我
<13-4,House>You've gotten to know me pretty well.

291
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,760
<13-5,Dominika>我的绿卡全指望这个了  是吧
<13-5,Dominika>My citizenship depends on it, right?

292
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,410
<13-5,Dominika>是的
<13-5,Dominika>Yeah.

293
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,360
<13-6,House>其实我想和你谈谈这事
<13-6,House>That's actually why I wanted to talk to you.

294
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,510
<13-7,Dominika>有消息了吗
<13-7,Dominika>You heard news?

295
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,440
<13-8,House>是的
<13-8,House>Yeah.

296
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,170
<13-9,Dominika>怎么说
<13-9,Dominika>So what news?

297
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,810
<13-9,Dominika>还要我们去做个面试吗
<13-9,Dominika>They want us to come in for another interview?

298
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,940
<13-9,Dominika>不用
<13-9,Dominika>No.

299
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,070
<13-10,House>因为一直没动静
<13-10,House>Since we hadn't heard anything,

300
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,710
<13-10,House>我就打电话去问了
<13-10,House>I--I called, and they said

301
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,220
<13-10,House>他们说还要几个星期
<13-10,House>it's gonna be a couple weeks,

302
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,100
<13-10,House>也可能要一个月才能出最终结果
<13-10,House>maybe a month till they finalize their decision.

303
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,590
<13-11,Dominika>要一个月
<13-11,Dominika>A month?

304
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,270
<13-12,House>是啊  太糟了
<13-12,House>Yeah, I know. It sucks.

305
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,390
<13-13,Dominika>没有  和你生活一点也不糟
<13-13,Dominika>No, it's--it's not suck to live with you.

306
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,100
<13-13,Dominika>我过得很开心  只是...
<13-13,Dominika>It's been fun, but...

307
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,030
<13-13,Dominika>我希望能成为合法公民
<13-13,Dominika>you know, I just want to be legal.

308
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,130
<13-14,House>你会的
<13-14,House>And you will be.

309
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,850
<13-14,House>没问题的
<13-14,House>Absolutely.

310
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,880
<13-14,House>话说回来
<13-14,House>In the meantime,

311
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,780
<13-16,House>你玩过射击吗
<13-16,House>you ever shot anyone?

312
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,870
<14-1,Lue>别过来
<14-1,Lue>No, get away.

313
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,620
<14-2,Adams>你瞧  这针头还没你
<14-2,Adams>Look, this needle isn't nearly

314
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,320
<14-2,Adams>手臂上插着的那根粗呢
<14-2,Adams>as big as the one in your arm.

315
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,490
<14-2,Adams>插那根的时候都不疼  是吧
<14-2,Adams>And that didn't hurt, did it?

316
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,340
<14-3,Lue>我就是不要
<14-3,Lue>I don't want it.

317
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,710
<14-4,Lida>他们必须这么做  卢
<14-4,Lida>They need to do it, Lue.

318
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,050
<14-5,Taub>就是打麻药的时候会有些疼
<14-5,Taub>You'll only feel a little pinch as we give you the numbing medicine,

319
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,820
<14-5,Taub>之后  就不觉得疼了
<14-5,Taub>and after that, you won't feel a thing.

320
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,170
<14-6,Lue>不要
<14-6,Lue>No!

321
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,970
<14-7,Lida>卢  冷静下  没事的
<14-7,Lida>Lue, calm down. It's gonna be okay.

322
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,510
<14-9,Adams>他在说什么
<14-9,Adams>What's he saying?

323
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,180
<14-9,Adams>-怎么了  -我不知道
<14-9,Adams>- What's the problem? - I don't know.

324
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,180
<14-11,Xang>他是说  太晚了
<14-11,Xang>He's saying it's too late.

325
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,550
<14-11,Xang>一切无法挽回了
<14-11,Xang>There's nothing we can do.

326
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,840
<14-11,Xang>是苗语
<14-11,Xang>It's Hmong.

327
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,410
<14-12,Lida>他不会说苗语
<14-12,Lida>He doesn't speak Hmong.

328
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,720
<14-12,Lida>连听也没听过
<14-12,Lida>He's never even heard it.

329
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,370
<14-13,Xang>不是他在说
<14-13,Xang>It isn't him speaking.

330
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,430
<14-13,Xang>是恶魔在说
<14-13,Xang>It's the Dab.

331
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,370
<14-14,Taub>他抽搐了
<14-14,Taub>He's seizing!

332
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,160
<14-15,Lida>我的天啊
<14-15,Lida>Oh--! Oh, my god!

333
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,010
<14-16,Taub>这里需要劳拉西泮
<14-16,Taub>Need some Lorazepam in here!

334
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,520
<15-1,Chase>抽搐可排除桥本甲状腺炎
<15-1,Chase>Seizure rules out Hashimoto's.

335
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,820
<15-2,Taub>对  这才是重点
<15-2,Taub>Yeah, that's the issue.

336
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,780
<15-2,Taub>而不是我们没有一个合理的解释能说通
<15-2,Taub>Not that we have no rational explanation

337
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,170
<15-2,Taub>为什么病人会说一种他从未听过的语言
<15-2,Taub>for how the patient spoke a language he's never even heard.

338
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,130
<15-3,House>我有个想法
<15-3,House>I've got one.

339
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,670
<15-3,House>这是苗语  意思是  你们是群白痴
<15-3,House>It means "You're a bunch of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.

340
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,480
<15-3,House>也可能不是这意思
<15-3,House>Or it doesn't.

341
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,410
<15-3,House>但你们无从得知  因为你们不懂苗语
<15-3,House>But you wouldn't know because none of you speak Hmong.

342
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,910
<15-3,House>从另一方面看
<15-3,House>Kid, on the other hand,

343
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,790
<15-3,House>小孩子很会胡言乱语
<15-3,House>is presumably fluent in gibberish.

344
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,440
<15-4,Adams>他爷爷会苗语
<15-4,Adams>The grandfather speaks Hmong.

345
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,340
<15-4,Adams>他给我们翻译的
<15-4,Adams>He translated.

346
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,350
<15-5,House>他听到的是他想听到的话
<15-5,House>He heard what he wanted to hear,

347
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,010
<15-5,House>因为如果他孙子被附体了
<15-5,House>'cause if his grandson really is possessed,

348
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,450
<15-5,House>意味着他儿子也是
<15-5,House>that means his son really is possessed,

349
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,740
<15-5,House>这要远远好过
<15-5,House>which is a giant step up

350
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,820
<15-5,House>被人认定为凶残的精神病杀手
<15-5,House>from being a sledgehammering psychopath.

351
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,550
<15-6,Chase>不管是什么病  都导致了抽搐
<15-6,Chase>Whatever it was preceded a seizure.

352
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,100
<15-6,Chase>很显然是神经系统症状
<15-6,Chase>It's obviously a neurological symptom.

353
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,890
<15-7,Park>是不是恶化到大脑的硬皮病呢
<15-7,Park>Scleroderma, advanced to the point that it's affecting his brain?

354
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,730
<15-8,House>有趣
<15-8,House>Interesting.

355
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,900
<15-9,Chase>那么说我们应该着手...
<15-9,Chase>So we should start treating...

356
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,860
<15-10,House>有趣的是
<15-10,House>Interesting that you keep

357
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,780
<15-10,House>每次我说"有趣"你们总会上当
<15-10,House>falling for it when I say "Interesting."

358
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,090
<15-10,House>硬皮病的诊断太白痴了
<15-10,House>The scleroderma part was idiotic.

359
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,190
<15-10,House>如果是的话  会有皮肤症状
<15-10,House>We'd have seen skin involvement.

360
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,060
<15-10,House>我说有趣是因为
<15-10,House>The interesting part is

361
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,790
<15-10,House>你和朴克相互认同一个观点
<15-10,House>that you and Park agree,

362
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,990
<15-10,House>但是你们却没有眼神交流
<15-10,House>but you're not able to look at each other.

363
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,940
<15-11,Chase>我这不是在看她吗
<15-11,Chase>I'm looking at her.

364
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,410
<15-12,Park>我也在看他
<15-12,Park>I'm looking at him.

365
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,890
<15-13,House>很好  现在舔舔嘴唇
<15-13,House>Good, now lick your lips.

366
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,980
<16-1,Lida>拉斯马森脑炎
<16-1,Lida>Rasmussen's encephalitis.

367
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,280
<15-14,Adams>弥漫性灶性炎症
<15-14,Adams>Diffuse spotty inflammation

368
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,360
<15-14,Adams>会让脑自主神经中枢受损
<15-14,Adams>could hit the autonomic centers of the brain.

369
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,140
<15-15,House>这在苗语中的意思是  做核磁共振确诊
<15-15,House>It's Hmong for "Get an MRI to confirm."

370
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,580
<16-1,Lida>拉斯马森脑炎
<16-1,Lida>Rasmussen's encephalitis.

371
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,670
<16-1,Lida>他会没事的吧
<16-1,Lida>But he'll be okay?

372
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,000
<16-2,Chase>进行治疗的话  病情是可以控制的
<16-2,Chase>With treatment, it's manageable.

373
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,260
<16-2,Chase>这病能解释
<16-2,Chase>And it explains all the things

374
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,240
<16-2,Chase>他所有的症状吗
<16-2,Chase>that have happened to him?

375
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,520
<16-3,Chase>我们是这么认为的
<16-3,Chase>We think so.

376
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,620
<16-4,Xang>你们错了
<16-4,Xang>You are wrong.

377
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,720
<16-4,Xang>你们在浪费我孙子的时间
<16-4,Xang>And you are wasting my grandson's time.

378
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,740
<16-5,Chase>神经系统问题能导致病人
<16-5,Chase>Neurological issues can cause a person

379
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,650
<16-5,Chase>说别国的语言  或是说话带口音
<16-5,Chase>to speak in tongues, speak with an accent.

380
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,510
<16-6,Xang>他说的不是别国的语言
<16-6,Xang>He wasn't speaking in tongues!

381
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,920
<16-7,Chase>遇到压力的时候
<16-7,Chase>In times of stress,

382
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,340
<16-7,Chase>我们的感官会欺骗我们  让我们相信...
<16-7,Chase>our senses can fool us into believing...

383
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,370
<16-8,Xang>我深知科学和信仰的不同之处
<16-8,Xang>I know the difference between science and faith,

384
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,000
<16-8,Xang>当我儿子开始做那些
<16-8,Xang>and when my son started having the same dreams

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,380
<16-8,Xang>同我孙子一样的梦时  科学没能帮助他
<16-8,Xang>my grandson is having, science couldn't help him.

386
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,160
<16-9,Chase>对于你儿子遭受的精神疾病我很抱歉
<16-9,Chase>I'm sorry if your son suffered from mental illness.

387
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,750
<16-10,Xang>卡没有疯
<16-10,Xang>Kao was not crazy.

388
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,140
<16-10,Xang>他以前是个聪明  和善  快乐的人
<16-10,Xang>He was bright, caring, happy,

389
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,090
<16-10,Xang>直到噩梦降临
<16-10,Xang>until the bad dreams came.

390
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,980
<16-10,Xang>我不想眼看悲剧重演
<16-10,Xang>I don't want to watch it happen again.

391
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,790
<16-11,Chase>拜托别吓到小孩子
<16-11,Chase>Please don't scare the boy.

392
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,280
<16-11,Chase>那样是不会让病情好转的
<16-11,Chase>It won't help him get better.

393
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,630
<16-12,Taub>轴位中脑层面未见异常
<16-12,Taub>Axial view of mid-brain level looks good.

394
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,350
<16-12,Taub>开始观察丘脑
<16-12,Taub>Moving on to thalamic.

395
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,440
<16-13,Park>昨晚我又做了个梦
<16-13,Park>I had another dream last night.

396
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,670
<16-13,Park>这次是关于你的
<16-13,Park>This time it was about you.

397
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,160
<16-14,Taub>真的
<16-14,Taub>Really?

398
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,500
<16-15,Park>瞧见没  是个人都应该是你这个反应
<16-15,Park>See, that's how you're supposed to react.

399
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,250
<16-15,Park>当一个女人告诉你  她梦见了你
<16-15,Park>When a woman tells you she's dreamt about you,

400
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,430
<16-15,Park>你应该会感到激动
<16-15,Park>you should be thrilled,

401
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,260
<16-15,Park>就算你对她没有感觉
<16-15,Park>even if you're not interested in her whatsoever.

402
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,920
<16-16,Taub>知道吗  你真傻
<16-16,Taub>You're an idiot, you know that?

403
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,080
<16-17,Park>我今晚绝对不会梦见你
<16-17,Park>Well, I definitely won't be dreaming about you tonight.

404
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,490
<16-18,Taub>我很羡慕你们俩
<16-18,Taub>I'm jealous of you two.

405
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,010
<16-18,Taub>你们俩一个天一个地
<16-18,Taub>You couldn't be more different,

406
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,740
<16-18,Taub>但是你们心心相惜
<16-18,Taub>and yet you have this good thing happening.

407
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,650
<16-18,Taub>你们彼此有好感  支持对方
<16-18,Taub>You support each other. You like each other.

408
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,260
<16-18,Taub>别让豪斯毁了这份感觉
<16-18,Taub>Don't let House screw it up.

409
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,340
<16-19,Park>我和他没这么大差别吧
<16-19,Park>We're not that different.

410
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,260
<16-20,Taub>有的
<16-20,Taub>Yeah, you are.

411
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,520
<17-1,House>显然  你的很多本事
<17-1,House>Apparently, there are some things about you

412
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,580
<17-1,House>我都不知道
<17-1,House>I don't know.

413
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,790
<17-2,Dominika>我在警察局服役过一年
<17-2,Dominika>I served one year in police unit.

414
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,920
<17-3,House>这事儿你现在才和我这个当老公的说
<17-3,House>And you're just telling your husband now?

415
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,740
<17-4,Dominika>移民局都不知道
<17-4,Dominika>Immigration doesn't know.

416
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,410
<17-4,Dominika>老公就更不需要知道了
<17-4,Dominika>No need for husband to know.

417
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,650
<17-4,Dominika>那个被恶魔附身的男孩怎么样了
<17-4,Dominika>What is happening to boy with demons?

418
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,090
<17-5,House>磁共振检查显示正常
<17-5,House>Absence of evidence on an MRI,

419
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,190
<17-5,House>我的小组却以此认为是一切正常
<17-5,House>which my team has mistaken for evidence of absence.

420
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,910
<17-6,Dominika>这我就不理解了
<17-6,Dominika>This is what I am not understanding:

421
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,350
<17-6,Dominika>为什么你可以相信暗物质的存在
<17-6,Dominika>How can you believe in dark matters

422
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,150
<17-6,Dominika>但却不信有恶灵存在
<17-6,Dominika>but not in dark spirits?

423
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,060
<17-6,Dominika>难道恶魔
<17-6,Dominika>Is--is the idea of demons

424
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,110
<17-6,Dominika>就跟希格斯玻色子有本质区别吗
<17-6,Dominika>so different than the Higgs boson?

425
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,660
<17-6,Dominika>我们看不见它本身
<17-6,Dominika>We can't see it, but we can see

426
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,090
<17-6,Dominika>但能看到它带来的影响
<17-6,Dominika>the impact of its presence.

427
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,400
<17-6,Dominika>我拿了你的物理学书籍
<17-6,Dominika>I borrowed your physics book.

428
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,530
<17-8,Dominika>在浴室里面看的
<17-8,Dominika>I read while in bathroom.

429
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,930
<17-7,House>你是个神枪手
<17-7,House>You're a dead-eye shot

430
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,640
<17-7,House>而且还喜欢在蹲马桶时
<17-7,House>and enjoy reading quantum physics

431
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,740
<17-7,House>看量子力学
<17-7,House>on the crapper?

432
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,160
<17-8,Dominika>我是洗澡时看的
<17-8,Dominika>I read in bathtub.

433
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,840
<17-9,House>让人浮想联翩啊
<17-9,House>Better image.

434
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,150
<17-9,House>谢谢
<17-9,House>Thank you.

435
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,330
<18-1,Lue>医生说我的脑子有问题
<18-1,Lue>The doctors say my brain is sick.

436
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,170
<18-2,Xang>医生们尽了最大努力
<18-2,Xang>Your doctors are trying their best,

437
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,360
<18-2,Xang>但他们的方向错了
<18-2,Xang>but they're not looking in the right place.

438
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,390
<18-2,Xang>我知道  对于八岁的你
<18-2,Xang>You know, I know this is a lot

439
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,150
<18-2,Xang>很难承受这些
<18-2,Xang>to put on an eight-year-old.

440
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
<18-2,Xang>但你对于我们祖先的无视
<18-2,Xang>But you have angered our ancestors

441
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,170
<18-2,Xang>惹恼了他们
<18-2,Xang>by ignoring them.

442
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,980
<18-2,Xang>你记得怎样与他们交流吗
<18-2,Xang>Now do you remember how to talk to them?

443
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,060
<18-2,Xang>是的  就是这样
<18-2,Xang>Yeah, that's right.

444
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,480
<18-2,Xang>很好
<18-2,Xang>Good.

445
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,530
<18-2,Xang>现在闭上眼睛
<18-2,Xang>Now close your eyes,

446
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,230
<18-2,Xang>我们一起请求宽恕
<18-2,Xang>and we will ask for forgiveness together.

447
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,260
<18-2,Xang>你做得很好
<18-2,Xang>You're doing good.

448
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,110
<18-2,Xang>但还要付出更多
<18-2,Xang>But we have to do more.

449
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,700
<18-2,Xang>恶灵仍在空气中猖狂
<18-2,Xang>The evil spirits are in the air,

450
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,160
<18-2,Xang>而阻止它们的唯一方法
<18-2,Xang>and the only way to stop them

451
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,030
<18-2,Xang>就是停止呼吸
<18-2,Xang>is by stopping the air.

452
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,930
<18-2,Xang>你要勇敢
<18-2,Xang>You have to be brave.

453
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,960
<18-2,Xang>我并不想伤害你
<18-2,Xang>I'm not trying to hurt you.

454
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,740
<18-2,Xang>这是为了帮你
<18-2,Xang>This will help you.

455
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,520
<18-2,Xang>我坚信这一点
<18-2,Xang>I know it will.

456
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,690
<18-3,Taub>卢
<18-3,Taub>Lue?

457
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,490
<18-3,Taub>你还好吗
<18-3,Taub>You okay?

458
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,470
<18-4,Lida>我叫不醒他
<18-4,Lida>I can't wake him up!

459
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,710
<18-4,Lida>卢
<18-4,Lida>Lue!

460
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,480
<18-5,Taub>卢  你很安全
<18-5,Taub>Lue, you're safe.

461
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,640
<18-5,Taub>你在医院里
<18-5,Taub>You're in the hospital.

462
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,980
<18-6,Lue>别让爷爷靠近
<18-6,Lue>Get Grandpa away!

463
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,010
<18-7,Lida>他不在这  宝贝  那只是个梦
<18-7,Lida>He's not here, honey. It was just a dream.

464
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,290
<18-8,Lue>他想掐死我
<18-8,Lue>He was choking me!

465
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,890
<18-9,Taub>不  卢  那不是真的
<18-9,Taub>No, Lue, it wasn't real.

466
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,850
<18-10,Lue>是真的  他掐住了我的脖子
<18-10,Lue>It was! He grabbed my neck!

467
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,920
<18-11,Taub>之前没有这些淤青
<18-11,Taub>Those bruises weren't there before.

468
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,790
<19-1,Taub>他做了恶梦  而后出现了淤青
<19-1,Taub>He had the dream, and then he had the bruising.

469
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,810
<19-2,House>更有可能的解释是
<19-2,House>More likely--

470
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,610
<19-2,House>我说"有可能"  其实是指"理性"
<19-2,House>And by "likely," I mean "rationally"--

471
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,970
<19-2,House>前因后果搞反了
<19-2,House>it's the other way around.

472
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,810
<19-2,House>大脑感受到颈部疼痛
<19-2,House>His brain felt the pain in his neck

473
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,920
<19-2,House>就编了一场梦来解释它
<19-2,House>and created the dream to explain it.

474
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,370
<19-3,Adams>凝血障碍
<19-3,Adams>Coagulopathy.

475
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,620
<19-3,Adams>肺部问题造成凝血功能紊乱
<19-3,Adams>Lung problems cause a clotting disturbance.

476
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,170
<19-4,Park>那他全身都会出现淤青
<19-4,Park>He would have bruises everywhere.

477
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,820
<19-5,Taub>梦境会影响现实
<19-5,Taub>Is it really preposterous

478
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,250
<19-5,Taub>这个想法有那么荒谬吗
<19-5,Taub>that dreams can have physical manifestations?

479
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,710
<19-6,House>我真想拍你
<19-6,House>Well, short answer is--

480
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,110
<19-7,Taub>睡眠时的想法确实会造成生理变化
<19-7,Taub>Thoughts during sleep can and do cause physical changes.

481
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,060
<19-8,House>他说的对吗  朴克医生
<19-8,House>Is that right, Dr. Park?

482
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,160
<19-8,House>你今早醒来
<19-8,House>Did you wake up this morning

483
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,920
<19-8,House>是否感觉到生理变化
<19-8,House>experiencing physical changes?

484
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,320
<19-8,House>这跟医学有关
<19-8,House>It's medically relevant.

485
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,370
<19-9,Chase>她的梦没有任何意义
<19-9,Chase>Her dream doesn't mean anything.

486
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,840
<19-9,Chase>我们就不能用行动来承认这一点吗
<19-9,Chase>Can we start acting like it doesn't mean anything?

487
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,200
<19-9,Chase>行啊
<19-9,Chase>Sure.

488
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,570
<19-9,Chase>我们也可以不把墙当回事
<19-9,Chase>We could also start acting like walls don't mean anything,

489
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,410
<19-10,House>但这会让我们撞个鼻青脸肿
<19-10,House>but then we'd hurt our noses.

490
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,700
<19-10,House>你表现得如君子般坦荡
<19-10,House>You've been taking the high road.

491
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,570
<19-10,House>而不是利用这个明显的机会  取笑她
<19-10,House>You haven't been teasing in an obviously teasable situation

492
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,200
<19-10,House>因为你知道她的梦是有意义的
<19-10,House>because you know it does mean something.

493
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,770
<19-10,House>她讨厌这个梦因为这让她处于劣势
<19-10,House>She hates the dream because it makes her feel vulnerable.

494
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,640
<19-10,House>而你喜欢  是因为这让你有优越感
<19-10,House>You love the dream because it makes you feel superior.

495
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,560
<19-10,House>可怜的小姑娘
<19-10,House>The poor lass who can't help

496
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,320
<19-10,House>抵抗不了你的魅力
<19-10,House>but fall sway to your charms.

497
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,690
<19-10,House>而你正假装慷慨
<19-10,House>And you're bestowing upon her

498
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,530
<19-10,House>不与她计较这细枝末节
<19-10,House>the gift of illusory irrelevance.

499
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,560
<19-11,Taub>你能否悄悄告诉豪斯
<19-11,Taub>Can you please hint to House

500
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,980
<19-11,Taub>说你也做春梦了
<19-11,Taub>that you had a sex dream?

501
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,590
<19-11,Taub>我今天真心想治好病人
<19-11,Taub>I'd really prefer not to get distracted

502
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,350
<19-11,Taub>而不是被其他事分神
<19-11,Taub>with trying to cure the patient today.

503
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,850
<19-12,Adams>我拒绝透露我那些
<19-12,Adams>I refuse to divulge my dreams

504
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,610
<19-12,Adams>香艳的拉拉合体梦
<19-12,Adams>about girl-on-girl loofa action.

505
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,950
<19-12,Adams>淤青说明可能是贫血
<19-12,Adams>The bruising could indicate anemia,

506
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,300
<19-12,Adams>维生素C缺乏  甚至白血病
<19-12,Adams>a Vitamin C deficiency, or even leukemia.

507
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,790
<19-13,House>太奇怪了  你我做了相同的梦
<19-13,House>That is so weird that you and I had the same dream.

508
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,670
<19-13,House>我猜你的结尾也是
<19-13,House>I assume yours also ends

509
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,010
<19-13,House>我一边飘飘欲仙
<19-13,House>with me achieving ecstasy while simultaneously

510
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,530
<19-13,House>一边获得纽约马拉松季军
<19-13,House>placing third in the New York City marathon.

511
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,350
<19-14,Park>季军
<19-14,Park>Third?

512
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,310
<19-15,House>我有自知之明
<19-15,House>I'm a realist.

513
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,780
<19-15,House>肝衰竭可导致由肝性脑病引起的胡言乱语
<19-15,House>Liver failure can cause gibberish from encephalopathy,

514
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,590
<19-15,House>便秘  淤青和呼吸问题
<19-15,House>constipation, bruising, and breathing problems.

515
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,260
<19-16,Adams>肝纤维化变性会发生在此年龄的人身上
<19-16,Adams>Hepatic fibrosis could hit someone at his age.

516
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,580
<19-17,House>那就对肝下手
<19-17,House>So let's hit his liver.

517
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,100
<19-17,House>做活检
<19-17,House>Get a biopsy.

518
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,410
<20-1,Adams>角度向上倾斜一点
<20-1,Adams>Angle a bit more superiorly.

519
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,710
<20-2,Lida>他不断做这些噩梦
<20-2,Lida>He keeps having these nightmares.

520
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,730
<20-2,Lida>都成真了  真的伤害了他
<20-2,Lida>That become real. They really hurt him.

521
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,440
<20-2,Lida>我也不想相信
<20-2,Lida>I don't want to believe that a nightmare

522
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,810
<20-2,Lida>噩梦会成真  但...
<20-2,Lida>can do that, but I--

523
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,350
<20-3,Taub>我也不想相信
<20-3,Taub>I'm struggling with it too,

524
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,660
<20-3,Taub>不过这是可以用医学解释的
<20-3,Taub>but these things can be explained medically.

525
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,490
<20-4,Lida>但你们没有给出解释
<20-4,Lida>But you haven't.

526
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,530
<20-4,Lida>每个医生
<20-4,Lida>Every doctor,

527
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,250
<20-4,Lida>他们的每个想法
<20-4,Lida>every idea they've had,

528
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,160
<20-4,Lida>都是错的
<20-4,Lida>it's been wrong.

529
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,000
<21-1,Park>肝活检结果出来了  准备开会
<21-1,Park>Liver biopsy's back. Team's about to meet.

530
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,160
<21-2,Chase>又开始避免和我有眼神接触吗
<21-2,Chase>Back to avoiding eye contact with me?

531
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,950
<21-2,Chase>你又被豪斯影响了
<21-2,Chase>House got to you again?

532
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,840
<21-3,Park>难道你想让我告诉你结果时
<21-3,Park>Want me to gaze longingly into your eyes

533
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,630
<21-3,Park>含情脉脉地看着你吗
<21-3,Park>as I tell you the test results?

534
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,120
<21-4,Chase>我希望你把我当朋友来对待
<21-4,Chase>I want you to treat me like a friend,

535
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,920
<21-4,Chase>希望你不要在意
<21-4,Chase>which means getting over the fact

536
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,910
<21-4,Chase>你喜欢我多过我喜欢你
<21-4,Chase>that you like me more than I like you.

537
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,380
<21-5,Park>你自负自夸的行为让我欲火焚身
<21-5,Park>Yeah, egotism and preening really turn me on.

538
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,090
<21-6,Chase>可惜我对中性而自卑的人不感兴趣
<21-6,Chase>Too bad I'm not attracted to androgyny and self-pity,

539
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,350
<21-6,Chase>不然你就能如愿了
<21-6,Chase>or you'd have it made.

540
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,210
<21-7,Park>因为任何还未被你
<21-7,Park>Because anyone who hasn't gotten wet

541
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,090
<21-7,Park>辣手摧花的女人
<21-7,Park>from your Petri dish of STDs,

542
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,410
<21-7,Park>就肯定是没自尊的
<21-7,Park>clearly has low self-esteem!

543
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,560
<21-8,Chase>泼妇
<21-8,Chase>Bitch.

544
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,190
<21-9,Park>混蛋
<21-9,Park>Dick!

545
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,490
<21-9,Park>你来吗
<21-9,Park>You coming?

546
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,810
<21-10,Chase>你说话时为何嘴唇不动
<21-10,Chase>Why didn't your lips move when you said that?

547
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,670
<21-11,Park>奇斯
<21-11,Park>Chase!

548
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,750
<21-11,Park>你来吗
<21-11,Park>You coming?

549
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,300
<21-11,Park>肝活检结果出来了
<21-11,Park>Liver biopsy's back.

550
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,350
<21-12,Chase>我马上就来
<21-12,Chase>I'll be right there.

551
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,940
<22-1,Adams>肝纤维化变性活检结果呈阴性
<22-1,Adams>Biopsy was negative for fibrosis.

552
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,100
<22-2,Lida>就是说又一次
<22-2,Lida>So once again,

553
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,060
<22-2,Lida>你们还没找到病因
<22-2,Lida>you don't know what's wrong?

554
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,520
<22-3,Taub>能排除那些恶性病总是好的
<22-3,Taub>It's always good to rule out the bad things.

555
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,040
<22-4,Nurse>医生
<22-4,Nurse>Doctors!

556
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,660
<22-5,Park>天哪
<22-5,Park>God!

557
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,560
<22-6,Taub>他是不是
<22-6,Taub>Was he?

558
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,890
<22-7,Adams>是的
<22-7,Adams>Yes.

559
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,900
<23-1,Taub>-他悬空飘浮  -真酷
<23-1,Taub>- He was levitating. - Cool.

560
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,610
<23-2,House>我们能肯定的一件事就是
<23-2,House>So the one thing we know for sure

561
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,570
<23-2,House>他并没悬浮在空中
<23-2,House>is he was not levitating.

562
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,780
<23-3,Adams>他飘起来了
<23-3,Adams>He was floating

563
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,880
<23-3,Adams>离床六英寸高
<23-3,Adams>6 inches off the bed.

564
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,160
<23-4,Chase>他可能只是把背部拱起来而已
<23-4,Chase>He could've just been arching his back off the bed.

565
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,600
<23-5,Taub>没错  不过那样的话我就会到这里
<23-5,Taub>Yes, but then I would have come into the room

566
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,500
<23-5,Taub>报告说病人奇怪地
<23-5,Taub>and reported that the patient

567
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,990
<23-4,Chase>把背拱起来了
<23-4,Chase>was weirdly arching his back off the bed.

568
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,710
<23-5,Taub>但是那是他整个身体
<23-5,Taub>It was his whole body.

569
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,230
<23-5,Taub>他悬浮在空中
<23-5,Taub>He was levitating.

570
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,820
<23-6,House>太多疑问了...
<23-6,House>So many questions...

571
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,620
<23-6,House>第一个就是为什么奇斯要跟一个
<23-6,House>Starting with why did Chase address his comment

572
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,400
<23-6,House>当时没在屋里的人发表意见
<23-6,House>to someone who wasn't even in the room?

573
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,250
<23-6,House>骗术展示
<23-6,House>Hocus pocus,

574
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,890
<23-6,House>你们这些白痴注意我的脚
<23-6,House>on my feet you idiots must focus.

575
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,220
<23-8,Taub>那孩子不是魔术师
<23-8,Taub>The kid's not a magician.

576
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,540
<23-9,House>当然不是  他是可爱的助手
<23-9,House>Of course not. He's the lovely assistant.

577
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,330
<23-9,House>因为他那杀千刀的祖父在幕后操纵
<23-9,House>'cause grandpa pig sticker is waving the wand.

578
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,190
<23-9,House>第二个问题是...
<23-9,House>Middling with...

579
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,650
<23-9,House>奇斯是在回避陶博呢
<23-9,House>is Chase trying to avoid Taub,

580
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,930
<23-9,House>还是想以此证明
<23-9,House>or is he trying to prove

581
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,360
<23-9,House>他没有在回避朴克呢
<23-9,House>that he's not avoiding Park?

582
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
<23-10,Adams>我们检查了那床
<23-10,Adams>We checked the bed.

583
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,490
<23-10,Adams>没有什么板子或钢丝
<23-10,Adams>There were no platforms or wires.

584
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,540
<23-10,Adams>这并非戏法
<23-10,Adams>This wasn't a trick.

585
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,580
<23-11,Park>破伤风可能导致肌肉强直
<23-11,Park>Tetanus could cause muscle rigidity.

586
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,620
<23-11,Park>也许他是被自己的脚跟和胳膊肘顶起来的
<23-11,Park>Maybe he was propped up by his heel and elbow.

587
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,920
<23-12,Taub>但事实并非如此
<23-12,Taub>Except he wasn't!

588
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,970
<23-13,House>破伤风不会导致
<23-13,House>Tetanus wouldn't cause

589
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,570
<23-13,House>那种程度的呼吸困难
<23-13,House>that kind of breathing difficulty.

590
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,280
<23-13,House>最后的问题是...
<23-13,House>And ending with...

591
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,720
<23-13,House>如果奇斯不是在回避朴克
<23-13,House>if Chase is trying not to avoid Park,

592
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,070
<23-13,House>那为什么是今天而不是昨天
<23-13,House>why is he doing this today and not yesterday?

593
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,790
<23-14,Chase>但是低钙血症会导致呼吸困难
<23-14,Chase>But hypocalcemia could,

594
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,750
<23-14,Chase>而且在我们治疗便秘用的灌肠剂中
<23-14,Chase>and the enema we administered to cure his constipation

595
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,220
<23-14,Chase>含有大量的磷
<23-14,Chase>had a high phosphorous load,

596
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,020
<23-14,Chase>可能导致暂时性低钙血症
<23-14,Chase>which could make him transiently hypocalcemic.

597
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,810
<23-15,House>这个说法有点勉强
<23-15,House>It's a long shot, but at least

598
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,400
<23-15,House>但至少还是理智的判断
<23-15,House>it has the benefit of being rational.

599
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,830
<23-15,House>给他补充电解质  开始用β受体阻滞剂
<23-15,House>Go pump up his electrolytes and start beta-blockers.

600
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,530
<23-15,House>对朴克来说是好消息
<23-15,House>And good news for Park:

601
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,350
<23-15,House>我想奇斯做了个和你有关的春梦
<23-15,House>I think Chase had a sex dream about you.

602
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,240
<23-16,Chase>就是场梦而已
<23-16,Chase>Dreams don't mean anything.

603
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,640
<24-1,Lida>我不明白  你们做的一切都没用
<24-1,Lida>I don't know. Nothing you've done has helped.

604
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,650
<24-2,Chase>如果我们不治疗  他再次癫痫发作
<24-2,Chase>If we don't start and he has another seizure,

605
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,790
<24-2,Chase>就可能造成永久性的神经损伤
<24-2,Chase>the neurological damage could be permanent.

606
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,780
<24-2,Chase>我的公公
<24-2,Chase>My father-in-law.

607
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,130
<24-3,Lida>他认为召唤仪式
<24-3,Lida>He thinks the calling ceremony

608
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,930
<24-3,Lida>没有成功是因为卢不在场
<24-3,Lida>didn't work because Lue wasn't there.

609
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,180
<24-4,Taub>你觉得他是对的吗
<24-4,Taub>And you think he's right?

610
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,430
<24-5,Lida>我不知道
<24-5,Lida>I don't know.

611
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,420
<24-6,Taub>不好意思  但我们不可能同意
<24-6,Taub>I'm sorry, but there's no way

612
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,510
<24-6,Taub>他在你儿子的病房内
<24-6,Taub>we can allow him to perform an exorcism

613
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,180
<24-6,Taub>进行驱邪仪式
<24-6,Taub>in your son's hospital room.

614
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,980
<24-7,Lida>那我就带他回家
<24-7,Lida>Then I will have to take him home.

615
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,630
<24-8,Chase>一天前你还因为
<24-8,Chase>A day ago, you were insulted

616
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,600
<24-8,Chase>我误解你相信迷信而感到受辱
<24-8,Chase>I'd even think you might believe that stuff,

617
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,520
<24-8,Chase>而现在你宁可停止一切治疗
<24-8,Chase>and now you're willing to stop all treatment,

618
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,600
<24-8,Chase>只为了尝试驱邪吗
<24-8,Chase>so you can try it?

619
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,720
<24-9,Lida>也许翔对卡的看法是对的
<24-9,Lida>Maybe Xang was right about Kao.

620
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,830
<24-9,Lida>我爱的那个人并非恶魔
<24-9,Lida>The man I loved wasn't evil

621
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,900
<24-9,Lida>他本人从未行过凶
<24-9,Lida>and would never do what he did.

622
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,780
<24-9,Lida>他只是...被附身了
<24-9,Lida>He was...possessed.

623
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,310
<24-9,Lida>现在得把我儿子的灵魂找回来
<24-9,Lida>And my son needs his soul back.

624
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,340
<25-1,Foreman>为什么不行呢
<25-1,Foreman>Why not?

625
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,240
<25-1,Foreman>只要他不给孩子喂什么东西
<25-1,Foreman>As long as he doesn't feed the kid anything

626
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,010
<25-1,Foreman>或是在他皮肤上涂一些我们无法
<25-1,Foreman>or put anything on his skin that we haven't

627
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,730
<25-1,Foreman>证明是否有害的东西  应该就没问题了
<25-1,Foreman>verified is harmless, what's the problem?

628
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,590
<25-2,House>我同意
<25-2,House>I agree.

629
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,770
<25-2,House>既然我们要制定这个
<25-2,House>And since we're establishing a new policy

630
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,030
<25-2,House>病急乱投医的新政策
<25-2,House>of "What the hell, we'll try anything,"

631
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,200
<25-2,House>我想雇夏奇拉来边跳肚皮舞
<25-2,House>I'd like to hire Shakira to belly dance

632
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,730
<25-2,House>边演唱《Waka Waka》[南非世界杯主题曲]
<25-2,House>while singing Waka Waka.

633
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,740
<25-3,Foreman>只要你能获得他母亲和夏奇拉的同意就行
<25-3,Foreman>As long as you get the mom and Shakira to consent.

634
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,920
<25-3,Foreman>这和请牧师或是
<25-3,Foreman>It's no different than having a priest

635
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,650
<25-3,Foreman>拉比[犹太法师]来进行守夜祷告没什么区别
<25-3,Foreman>or rabbi lead a prayer vigil.

636
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,720
<25-3,Foreman>他母亲只是吓坏了迷茫了
<25-3,Foreman>The mom is scared and confused

637
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,110
<25-3,Foreman>竭尽全力的寻求能带给她希望的办法
<25-3,Foreman>and desperate for anything that'll give her hope.

638
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,250
<25-3,Foreman>没错
<25-3,Foreman>True.

639
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,070
<25-4,House>不过从长远看  我认为让我们的律师
<25-4,House>But in the long run, I think you'll be happier

640
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,660
<25-4,House>声称她举止失当会让你感觉好些
<25-4,House>having our lawyer declare her unfit.

641
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,890
<25-4,House>那你就不会批准凌驾于科学之上的迷信行为了
<25-4,House>That way you won't be ratifying superstition over science,

642
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,790
<25-4,House>我也会继续在这工作
<25-4,House>and I'll still be working here.

643
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,900
<25-5,Foreman>那为什么会让我感觉好些
<25-5,Foreman>And why would that make me happier?

644
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,940
<25-5,Foreman>你哪也不会去
<25-5,Foreman>You're not going anywhere,

645
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,870
<25-5,Foreman>我们也不是在批准别人的信仰
<25-5,Foreman>and we're not "ratifying" their beliefs,

646
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,180
<25-5,Foreman>我们这是尊重他们
<25-5,Foreman>we're respecting them.

647
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,410
<25-6,House>你知道这也许会涉及到动物祭祀吧
<25-6,House>You do realize it may involve animal sacrifice.

648
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,940
<25-6,House>住在这种遍布玻璃墙的医院里的人
<25-6,House>People who live in glass hospitals

649
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,750
<25-6,House>不该进行驱邪活动
<25-6,House>should not throw exorcisms.

650
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,180
<25-7,Foreman>我会跟他母亲谈的
<25-7,Foreman>I'll talk to the mother.

651
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,640
<26-1,Lida>我并不是不给他医学治疗
<26-1,Lida>I don't want to deny him the medicine,

652
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,310
<26-1,Lida>我只是...
<26-1,Lida>I just...

653
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,850
<26-1,Lida>想确保我尝试了一切可能的方法
<26-1,Lida>want to make sure I try everything I can.

654
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,720
<26-2,Foreman>我理解
<26-2,Foreman>I understand that,

655
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,660
<26-2,Foreman>但你也要理解我们这里是医院
<26-2,Foreman>but you have to understand that we're a hospital,

656
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,070
<26-2,Foreman>并非寺庙
<26-2,Foreman>not a temple.

657
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,750
<26-3,Lida>那我就带他去别的地方
<26-3,Lida>Then I'll take him elsewhere.

658
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,630
<26-4,Foreman>不  你不能
<26-4,Foreman>No, you won't.

659
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,390
<26-4,Foreman>他病了  我们不能让他离开这里
<26-4,Foreman>He's sick. We can't let him leave here.

660
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,820
<26-4,Foreman>不好意思  你确实别无选择
<26-4,Foreman>I'm sorry, you really have no choice.

661
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,090
<26-5,Lida>我跟律师聊过了
<26-5,Lida>I spoke to a lawyer.

662
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,690
<26-5,Lida>他告诉我只要我没有对你们的治疗方案说不
<26-5,Lida>He told me as long as I wasn't saying no to your treatment,

663
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,810
<26-5,Lida>你们也不能否定我的信仰
<26-5,Lida>you couldn't say no to my religion.

664
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,820
<26-6,Foreman>给我24小时
<26-6,Foreman>Give me 24 hours.

665
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,450
<27-2,And it means>我今天收到这封信
<27-2,And it means>This came in the mail today!

666
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,170
<27-3,Dominika>不好意思
<27-3,Dominika>I'm sorry.

667
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,670
<27-4,House>我早该告诉你
<27-4,House>I should've told you.

668
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,100
<27-5,Dominika>告诉我什么
<27-5,Dominika>Told me what?

669
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,350
<27-5,Dominika>我不明白
<27-5,Dominika>I don't understand.

670
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,960
<27-6,House>那信写的什么
<27-6,House>What's the letter?

671
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,440
<27-7,Dominika>是我波兰的叔叔寄来的
<27-7,Dominika>It's from my uncle in Poland.

672
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,370
<27-7,Dominika>我阿姨卢巴  两个月前被送到疗养院去了
<27-7,Dominika>My aunt Luba, they put her in nursing home two months ago!

673
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,700
<27-8,House>太糟了
<27-8,House>That's too bad.

674
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,510
<27-9,Dominika>我母亲  我每周和她打两次电话
<27-9,Dominika>My mother, I talk to her twice a week

675
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,100
<27-9,Dominika>她从没跟我说过这事儿
<27-9,Dominika>and she never even mentioned it.

676
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,240
<27-9,Dominika>她怎么想的  觉得我承受不了吗
<27-9,Dominika>Wh--what does she think? That I can't handle?

677
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,210
<27-9,Dominika>我已经29岁了  不是个孩子了
<27-9,Dominika>I am 29 years old! I am not a child!

678
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,810
<27-9,Dominika>你今晚要出去吗
<27-9,Dominika>Were you going out tonight?

679
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,450
<27-10,House>我可以留下
<27-10,House>I could stay.

680
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,670
<28-1,Lida>他还是呼吸困难
<28-1,Lida>He's still barely breathing.

681
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,530
<28-1,Lida>卢
<28-1,Lida>Lue?

682
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,050
<28-2,Adams>你感觉如何
<28-2,Adams>How you feeling?

683
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,040
<28-2,Adams>感觉好些吗
<28-2,Adams>Any stronger?

684
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,840
<28-2,Adams>卢  听得到我说话吗
<28-2,Adams>Lue, can you hear me?

685
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,970
<28-3,Lida>-怎么了  -我不确定
<28-3,Lida>- What's wrong? - I'm not sure.

686
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,640
<28-4,Adams>卢  我要你握住我的手
<28-4,Adams>Lue, I need you to squeeze my hand.

687
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,090
<28-4,Adams>他没反应  给我50毫升50%D-葡萄糖
<28-4,Adams>He's not responding. Get me an amp of d50!

688
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,300
<28-5,Lida>你们又错了吗
<28-5,Lida>You were wrong again?

689
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,740
<28-5,Lida>我要叫他爷爷来
<28-5,Lida>I'm calling his grandfather.

690
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,590
<28-5,Lida>布鲁格达综合征和长Q-T综合征
<28-5,Lida>Genetic tests for brugada and long QT variants

691
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,600
<29-1,Chase>的遗传学检测都呈阴性
<29-1,Chase>came back negative.

692
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,030
<29-2,Taub>会不会是颈动脉瘤
<29-2,Taub>What about a carotid aneurysm?

693
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,170
<29-2,Taub>我们应该做个血管造影
<29-2,Taub>We should do an angiogram.

694
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,990
<29-3,Adams>他的颈动脉搏动正常
<29-3,Adams>He's got normal carotid pulses.

695
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,230
<29-4,House>管他呢
<29-4,House>Who cares?

696
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,380
<29-4,House>他母亲都放弃了  我为什么要在乎
<29-4,House>Mom's given up, why shouldn't I?

697
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,960
<29-4,House>不好意思
<29-4,House>I'm sorry,

698
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,650
<29-5,Chase>我们不是连白痴都治吗  因为我认为...
<29-5,Chase>do we not treat idiots? Because I thought--

699
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,780
<29-6,Taub>她的孩子漂浮了
<29-6,Taub>Her kid levitated.

700
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,970
<29-6,Taub>如果我女儿也这样
<29-6,Taub>That happens to my girl,

701
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,330
<29-6,Taub>我会扩大我的诊断范围
<29-6,Taub>I'm expanding my diagnostic horizons.

702
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,400
<29-7,House>所以我们更该关门大吉
<29-7,House>All the more reason why we should shut down.

703
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,160
<29-7,House>现在治好这孩子
<29-7,House>We cure this kid now,

704
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,430
<29-7,House>功劳会被疯癫祖父和他那套鬼把戏抢走的
<29-7,House>crazy grandpa and his magic beads get all the credit.

705
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,080
<29-8,Adams>你几时开始关心功劳归谁了
<29-8,Adams>And since when do you care about credit?

706
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,390
<29-9,House>我几时开始关心这孩子了
<29-9,House>Since when do I care about this kid?

707
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,350
<29-9,House>我关心的不过是
<29-9,House>All I care about is sending mommy

708
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,930
<29-9,House>培养出相信真理的妈妈
<29-9,House>out into the world having faith in faith.

709
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,980
<29-9,House>孩子不如死了算了
<29-9,House>Kid's better off dead.

710
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,360
<29-9,House>等她认识到求神无用  我们再谈
<29-9,House>As soon as she's done appeasing the Gods, let's talk.

711
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,780
<29-10,Chase>会不会是川崎病
<29-10,Chase>What about Kawasaki?

712
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,220
<29-10,Chase>可以解释不规则心音
<29-10,Chase>It explains the irregular heartbeat,

713
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,930
<29-10,Chase>呼吸窘迫和癫痫发作
<29-10,Chase>respiratory distress, and seizures.

714
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,100
<29-11,Park>症状吻合
<29-11,Park>It fits.

715
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,060
<29-12,Adams>那么他需要冠状动脉搭桥手术
<29-12,Adams>Which means he needs a coronary bypass.

716
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,760
<29-13,House>不可能是川崎病
<29-13,House>It can't be Kawasaki.

717
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,710
<29-13,House>心脏超声检查应该能看到
<29-13,House>Echo would have shown it.

718
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,160
<29-13,House>但是动脉导管未闭
<29-13,House>But a patent ductus arteriosis...

719
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,320
<29-14,Taub>不可能是小儿先天性心脏病
<29-14,Taub>It can't be a PDA.

720
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,090
<29-14,Taub>他又不是婴儿
<29-14,Taub>He's not an infant,

721
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,340
<29-14,Taub>而且八岁了还没有过任何症状
<29-14,Taub>nor has he had any symptoms for eight years.

722
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,290
<29-15,House>说不定有过
<29-15,House>Maybe he has.

723
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,020
<29-15,House>说不定他得过动脉导管感染
<29-15,House>Maybe he had an infected ductus,

724
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,190
<29-15,House>而被我们无意中使用的抗生素治疗了
<29-15,House>which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics.

725
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,410
<29-16,Taub>所以无证据倒成了证据存在的证明
<29-16,Taub>So no evidence is evidence of evidence?

726
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,040
<29-17,House>我只是说  可以这样推理
<29-17,House>I'm just saying, it's consistent.

727
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,510
<29-18,Adams>只有十亿分之一的几率
<29-18,Adams>It's a billion-to-one.

728
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,260
<29-19,House>也就是说  世界上有七个人
<29-19,House>Which means there's seven people in the world

729
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,360
<29-19,House>符合此诊断
<29-19,House>who fit the diagnosis.

730
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,750
<29-20,Taub>不是要找一百个嘛
<29-20,Taub>I thought we were looking for 100.

731
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,480
<29-21,House>或许小儿心脏病发病率比我们所知要高
<29-21,House>Well, maybe PDA is more common than we thought.

732
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,970
<29-21,House>像你这种白痴医生
<29-21,House>With idiot doctors like you...

733
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,950
<29-22,Adams>你错了
<29-22,Adams>You're wrong.

734
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,860
<29-22,Adams>治疗方法是布洛芬
<29-22,Adams>But the treatment's just ibuprofen.

735
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,650
<29-22,Adams>闭合畸形的动脉导管
<29-22,Adams>Closes the malformed duct.

736
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,460
<29-22,Adams>最坏的可能不过是他不见好转而已
<29-22,Adams>Worst-case scenario, he just doesn't get better.

737
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,420
<29-23,House>不  最坏的可能不过是你惹急了我
<29-23,House>No, worst-case scenario is you piss me off...

738
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,010
<29-24,Chase>你不让我们救一个八岁孩子
<29-24,Chase>You're not gonna let us save an eight-year-old

739
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,530
<29-24,Chase>就因为不想多一个人皈依宗教吗
<29-24,Chase>because one more person might embrace religion?

740
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,930
<29-25,House>这里有人认为我的诊断正确吗
<29-25,House>Does anyone here think my diagnosis is right?

741
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,120
<29-25,House>那么我决定
<29-25,House>Well, then I have decided,

742
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,970
<29-25,House>仅此一天  尊重你们的意见
<29-25,House>for today only, to respect your opinions.

743
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,590
<29-25,House>我们完全依照你们的诊断进行治疗
<29-25,House>We will proceed according to your diagnosis and nothing else.

744
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,810
<29-25,House>这是命令
<29-25,House>That's an order.

745
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,340
<29-25,House>好运
<29-25,House>Good luck.

746
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,380
<30-1,Taub>得把他排上手术日程
<30-1,Taub>We need to put him on the O.R. Schedule.

747
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,230
<30-2,Adams>血压正在下降
<30-2,Adams>His B.P.'s dropping.

748
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,980
<30-3,Taub>他不行了  叫急救
<30-3,Taub>He's crashing. Call a code!

749
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,720
<30-4,Adams>你必须停下
<30-4,Adams>You need to stop this!

750
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,370
<30-4,Adams>我给他用布洛芬
<30-4,Adams>I'm giving him the ibuprofen.

751
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,440
<31-1,Dominika>晚饭马上就好
<31-1,Dominika>Dinner's almost ready.

752
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,720
<31-2,House>我今晚就喝酒吧  谢谢
<31-2,House>I think I'll stick with the fluids tonight, thanks.

753
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,910
<31-3,Dominika>你怎么闷闷不乐的
<31-3,Dominika>Why are you sulking?

754
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,170
<31-4,House>我没有
<31-4,House>I'm not sulking.

755
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,990
<31-5,Dominika>那是我搞错了
<31-5,Dominika>Oh, my mistake.

756
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,170
<31-6,House>孩子濒临死亡  要么是信仰害的
<31-6,House>Either religion is killing a kid,

757
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,410
<31-6,House>要么是我害的
<31-6,House>or I am.

758
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,490
<31-6,House>你在做什么
<31-6,House>What are you doing?

759

<31-7,Dominika>丈夫辛劳一天  我来帮他放松
<31-7,Dominika>Comforting my husband after a bad day.

00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,600
<32-4,Adams>陈夫人  我使用的药物
<32-4,Adams>Mrs. Cheng, the medicine I administered

781

<32-4,Adams>是对卢的心脏进行长效治疗

782
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,200
<32-4,Adams>帮助他的是药物
<32-4,Adams>but that's what's helping him.

783
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,250
<32-5,Lida>布洛芬
<32-5,Lida>Ibuprofen?

784

785
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,550
<32-6,Adams>我知道听起来难以置信

786
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
<32-6,Adams>但是确有其事

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,950
<32-7,Lida>他救了你
<32-7,Lida>He saved you.

00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,500
<32-8,Taub>我们之前以为两件事都不可能
<32-8,Taub>There were two things we thought were impossible.

792
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,310
<32-8,Taub>其中之一是可能的
<32-8,Taub>One of them wasn't.

793
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,650
<32-8,Taub>就这样了
<32-8,Taub>That's all we know.

802
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,470
<33-1,Park>我厉害吗
<33-1,Park>Was I good?

803
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,030
<33-1,Park>说明不了什么
<33-1,Park>Doesn't mean anything.

804
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,830
<33-2,Chase>我被心理暗示了  会做那种梦是必然的
<33-2,Chase>Idea got planted. It was probably inevitable.

805
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,480
<33-3,Park>能说明一些事情
<33-3,Park>It means something.

806
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,830
<33-4,Chase>什么
<33-4,Chase>What?

807
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,580
<33-5,Park>这不明摆着嘛
<33-5,Park>Well, it could mean the obvious,

808
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,320
<33-5,Park>你想要我
<33-5,Park>that you want some of this.

809
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,250
<33-6,Park>你几时能明白那种眼神很伤人的
<33-6,Park>When will you learn that that look is insulting?

810
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,070
<33-6,Park>或者能说明  我们彼此有好感
<33-6,Park>Or it could just mean that we like each other.

811
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,830
<33-6,Park>我古怪  你帅气
<33-6,Park>I'm weird, and you're pretty,

812
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,360
<33-6,Park>可是我们心心相印  有安全感
<33-6,Park>but we connect. We feel safe.

813
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,180
<33-6,Park>相互信任
<33-6,Park>We trust each other.

814
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,300
<33-7,Chase>可能吧
<33-7,Chase>Maybe.

815
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,540
<33-8,Park>只是验证下我的理论
<33-8,Park>Just testing my theory.

816
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,830
<34-1,House>亚当斯违抗了我
<34-1,House>Adams defied me.

817
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,450
<34-1,House>这世界又多了一个偏执狂
<34-1,House>There's one more zealot in the world.

818
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,180
<34-1,House>多米尼卡搬走了
<34-1,House>And Dominika moved out.

819
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,860
<34-1,House>她风趣  艳丽
<34-1,House>She was fun. She was hot.

820
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,490
<34-1,House>修好了我的搅拌器
<34-1,House>She fixed my blender.

821
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,040
<34-1,House>不是比喻
<34-1,House>That is not a metaphor.

822
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,200
<34-1,House>你认不认识好点的冒牌离婚律师
<34-1,House>You know any good fake divorce lawyers?

823
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,420
<34-1,House>我竟然如此难过  还真是奇怪
<34-1,House>I am surprisingly depressed by this.

824
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,260
<34-2,Wilson>我得了癌症
<34-2,Wilson>I have cancer.

825
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,260
<34-3,House>你那天对我是有些过分
<34-3,House>You were a little short with me the other day.

826
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,290
<34-3,House>确实需要借口
<34-3,House>You do need an excuse.

827
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,990
<34-3,House>但癌症有点儿过了
<34-3,House>Cancer may be overplaying it.

828
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,160
<34-4,Wilson>胸腺瘤二期
<34-4,Wilson>Stage II Thymoma.

829
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,580
<34-4,Wilson>我想等确诊之后再告诉你
<34-4,Wilson>I didn't want to tell you until I had it confirmed.

830
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,250
<34-4,Wilson>今天上午刚收到化验结果
<34-4,Wilson>I got the tests back this morning.

831
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,290
<34-4,Wilson>我得了癌症  豪斯
<34-4,Wilson>I have cancer, House.
