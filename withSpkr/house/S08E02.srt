1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,890
<1-2,Guard>起来  豪斯
<1-2,Guard>Get up, House.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,080
<1-3,House>一定有什么误会
<1-3,House>Must be some mistake.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,180
<1-3,House>我特别要求过
<1-3,House>I specifically requested my wakeup startle

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,510
<1-3,House>三小时后再吓醒我
<1-3,House>three hours from now.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,870
<1-4,Guard>有大人物来看你
<1-4,Guard>Some VIP visitor.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,520
<1-4,Guard>是你原来医院的院长
<1-4,Guard>Dean of Medicine from your old hospital.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,680
<1-5,House>我梦见过这一幕啊
<1-5,House>I've had dreams about this.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,930
<1-5,House>我就当现在又在做梦了
<1-5,House>I'm going to assume this is another one.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,380
<1-6,Guard>快起来
<1-6,Guard>Get up.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,280
<1-7,House>谁来看我  我都可以拒绝接见
<1-7,House>I can refuse to see any visitor I want.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,330
<1-7,House>告诉院长  我不想见她
<1-7,House>Tell the dean that I don't want to see her.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,830
<1-8,Guard>他说你会这么说的
<1-8,Guard>He said you'd say that.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,130
<1-9,House>男的他吗
<1-9,House>He?

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,570
<1-10,House>医院那边是怎么雇人的啊
<1-10,House>What's the hiring policy over there?

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,250
<1-10,House>全雇混蛋吗
<1-10,House>All ass based?

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,330
<1-11,Foreman>我能把你弄出去
<1-11,Foreman>I can get you out of here.

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,580
<1-12,House>除非太阳打西边出来
<1-12,House>Not unless that file has a file in it.

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,280
<1-13,Foreman>这是法官的判决  可以立即释放你
<1-13,Foreman>Judge's order for your immediate release.

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,470
<1-14,House>两个月前我被判增加八个月的服刑期
<1-14,House>I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago.

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,100
<1-14,House>挺好算的吧
<1-14,House>The math is pretty basic.

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,100
<1-14,House>我们遇到麻烦了
<1-14,House>We have a crisis,

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,220
<1-15,Foreman>对你来说倒是个好消息
<1-15,Foreman>which is good news for you.

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,130
<1-15,Foreman>你今晚就可以被有条件释放
<1-15,Foreman>You're out tonight on conditional parole.

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,090
<1-15,Foreman>条件就是你受我雇佣
<1-15,Foreman>The condition being that you're employed by me

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,850
<1-15,Foreman>继续留在医院
<1-15,Foreman>at PPTH.

26
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,600
<1-16,House>不用了  谢谢
<1-16,House>No, thanks.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,380
<1-16,House>你认为对我们俩来说
<1-16,House>You think it's a good idea for me to go right back

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,970
<1-16,House>让我回到过去的生活是个好主意吗
<1-16,House>to my old life for either of us?

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,330
<1-17,Foreman>你的病人是一对恒温保存箱里的肺
<1-17,Foreman>Your patient is two lungs in a box,

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,000
<1-18,Foreman>而且只能存活12小时
<1-18,Foreman>and it only has 12 hours left.

31
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,900
<1-18,Foreman>没有脉搏  没有身体
<1-18,Foreman>No pulse, no body,

32
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,270
<1-18,Foreman>无法回答问题
<1-18,Foreman>no ability to answer questions.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,010
<1-18,Foreman>这位病人非你莫属
<1-18,Foreman>It's your perfect patient.

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,220
<1-19,House>我确实为那间房掏了一整周的钱  但
<1-19,House>I did pay for the room for the whole week, but...

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,890
<1-19,House>器官捐献者是名十八岁的学生
<1-19,House>Donor's an 18-year-old college kid

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,880
<1-19,House>从霍夫斯特拉大学回来
<1-19,House>back from Hosftra

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,500
<2-1,Foreman>和他的朋友一起参加返校节派对
<2-1,Foreman>goes to a homecoming party with his buddies,

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,090
<2-1,Foreman>骑上摩托  结果成了名捐献器官者
<2-1,Foreman>hops on his motorcycle, ends up an organ donor.

47
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,450
<1-17,Foreman>在急诊室里心脏停止跳动
<1-17,Foreman>Asystole in the E.R.

50
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,110
<1-18,Foreman>没有脉搏
<1-18,Foreman>No pulse.

51
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,890
<1-18,Foreman>血液循环停止
<1-18,Foreman>No blood circulating.

52
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,820
<2-1,Foreman>他的心脏  肝  肾全坏了
<2-1,Foreman>His heart, liver, kidneys were all toast.

53
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,670
<2-1,Foreman>外科医生都把接受者送上手术台了
<2-1,Foreman>Surgeons had the recipient on the table

54
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,220
<2-1,Foreman>才发现这对肺出现呼吸道阻力上升现象
<2-1,Foreman>when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance.

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,370
<2-1,Foreman>他们只能先把她缝合
<2-1,Foreman>The team closed her up,

56
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,850
<2-1,Foreman>让肺进入"休眠状态"
<2-1,Foreman>put the lungs in suspended animation.

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,910
<2-1,Foreman>这样争取到24小时来解决问题
<2-1,Foreman>Buys 24 hours to fix it,

61
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,130
<2-1,Foreman>现在时间已经过了一半
<2-1,Foreman>12 of which have passed.

62
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,970
<2-1,Foreman>我们还是不清楚问题出在哪里
<2-1,Foreman>We still have no clue what's wrong.

66
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,200
<2-1,Foreman>画挺漂亮
<2-1,Foreman>Nice painting.

67
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,710
<3-1,House>蓝色和绿色
<3-1,House>Blues and greens.

68
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,630
<3-1,House>能安抚情绪  又带点治愈色彩
<3-1,House>Calming, but with a hint of nurturing.

69
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,410
<3-1,House>和遭罪与死亡真是天差地别
<3-1,House>Totally opposite of the stance of suffering and death.

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,810
<3-1,House>我的病人在哪里
<3-1,House>Where's my patient?

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,410
<3-1,House>我们需要不说话
<3-1,House>We need to not talk.

72
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,040
<3-2,Foreman>在重症监护室的隔离房间
<3-2,Foreman>ICU isolation room.

73
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,660
<3-2,Foreman>移植手术人员会在那里等你
<3-2,Foreman>The transplant team will meet you there

74
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,410
<3-2,Foreman>给你说明过去两个小时的情况
<3-2,Foreman>with updates from the past two hours.

75
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,640
<3-3,House>太好了  拿着这个
<3-3,House>Great. Take this.

76
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,760
<3-4,Foreman>不如放到你的办公室吧
<3-4,Foreman>How about you drop it in your office?

77
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,100
<3-5,House>看到你院长的头衔
<3-5,House>I completely understand

78
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,860
<3-5,House>我完全能理解你
<3-5,House>and almost respect your desire

79
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
<3-5,House>想当院长的心
<3-5,House>to appear to be Dean of Medicine,

80
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,950
<3-5,House>都快到要敬佩你的地步了
<3-5,House>given that your title is Dean of Medicine.

81
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,150
<3-5,House>另外...
<3-5,House>On the other hand...

82
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,980
<3-5,House>真的假的啊
<3-5,House>seriously?

83
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,370
<3-6,Foreman>丑话说在前
<3-6,Foreman>Get this straight.

84
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,320
<3-6,Foreman>你再犯法  就回监狱去
<3-6,Foreman>You break the law, you go back to jail.

85
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,500
<3-6,Foreman>再多骗维柯丁  也回监狱去
<3-6,Foreman>Scam extra Vicodin, back to jail.

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,800
<3-6,Foreman>藐视我的权威  让医院难堪
<3-6,Foreman>Flout my authority, make the hospital look bad,

87
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,830
<3-6,Foreman>还是回监狱去
<3-6,Foreman>back to jail.

88
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,640
<3-6,Foreman>你是我的了
<3-6,Foreman>I own you.

89
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,330
<3-7,House>好的  主人
<3-7,House>Yes, massa.

90
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,820
<3-8,Foreman>看  这就对了
<3-8,Foreman>See, that would be an example.

91
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,160
<3-9,House>卡迪什么时候走的
<3-9,House>When did Cuddy leave?

92
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,820
<3-10,Foreman>你闯祸第二天  她就辞职了
<3-10,Foreman>She gave her notice the day after your incident.

93
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,330
<3-10,Foreman>接受了...
<3-10,Foreman>Took a job--

94
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,430
<3-11,House>不需要这么详细
<3-11,House>Don't need the details.

95
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,270
<3-12,Foreman>整形外科需要更大的空间
<3-12,Foreman>Ortho needed more space.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,880
<3-12,Foreman>你办公室在这边
<3-12,Foreman>You're this way.

97
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,520
<3-13,House>我的东西呢
<3-13,House>Where's my stuff?

98
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,800
<3-14,Foreman>不知道
<3-14,Foreman>No idea.

99
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,670
<3-15,House>那我的团队呢
<3-15,House>What about my team?

100
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,900
<3-16,Foreman>可悲
<3-16,Foreman>Pathetic.

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,500
<3-16,Foreman>你一见我就说
<3-16,Foreman>The first thing you said to me

102
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,620
<3-16,Foreman>你不想回到过去的生活
<3-16,Foreman>was you don't want your old environment.

103
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,840
<3-16,Foreman>三句话过后就问"我的旧家伙哪里去了"
<3-16,Foreman>The fourth thing you said was, "Where's my old environment?"

104
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,910
<3-16,Foreman>一年了
<3-16,Foreman>It's been a year.

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,440
<3-16,Foreman>陶博  奇斯  十三都有新的事业了
<3-16,Foreman>Taub, Chase, Thirteen all moved on.

106
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,440
<3-16,Foreman>就是这样
<3-16,Foreman>The world does that sometimes.

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
<3-17,House>才不是呢
<3-17,House>No, it doesn't.

108
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,080
<3-18,Foreman>这是你的新办公室
<3-18,Foreman>Here's your new office,

109
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,870
<3-18,Foreman>那是你新的团队
<3-18,Foreman>and there's your new team.

110
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,050
<3-19,Park>你好
<3-19,Park>Hi.

111
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,150
<4-1,House>我对别科挑剩下的人没兴趣
<4-1,House>I'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.

112
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,480
<4-2,Park>我不是挑剩下的
<4-2,Park>I'm not sloppy seconds.

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,250
<4-3,House>凌晨三点
<4-3,House>It's 3:00 a.m.,

114
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,010
<4-3,House>如果是福曼打电话把你从家里叫来的
<4-3,House>if Foreman had called you in from home,

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,590
<4-3,House>你就不会穿着熨好的衣服
<4-3,House>you wouldn't have pressed clothes,

116
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,850
<4-4,Park>头发整齐  还化好了妆
<4-4,Park>coiffed hair, and makeup,

117
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,620
<4-5,House>说明你本来就在医院
<4-5,House>which means you were already here in the hospital.

118
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,560
<4-4,Park>对  我今天本该在神经科值班
<4-4,Park>Yes, I was on call for Neurology.

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,340
<4-5,House>如果那是真话  你现在就该在工作
<4-5,House>Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now

120
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,750
<4-5,House>就没时间帮我的忙了
<4-5,House>and unavailable to help,

121
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,870
<4-5,House>也就是说你是在医院瞎转
<4-5,House>which means that you're hanging out in the hospital

122
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,180
<4-5,House>假装在工作
<4-5,House>pretending to work,

123
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,750
<4-5,House>说明你不仅仅是被拒了
<4-5,House>which means you're not just a reject.

124
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,720
<4-5,House>还是个胆小的被拒者
<4-5,House>You're a cowardly reject

125
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,080
<4-5,House>更不想让别人知道这事
<4-5,House>who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.

126
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,980
<4-6,Park>我没有被拒
<4-6,Park>I am not a reject.

127
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,150
<4-7,House>那就回神经科去
<4-7,House>Then go back to Neurology.

128
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,570
<4-8,Park>不行
<4-8,Park>I can't.

129
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,390
<4-8,Park>我打了我的主治医生
<4-8,Park>I punched my attending.

130
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,300
<4-8,Park>我们最合理的猜想是
<4-8,Park>ARDS secondary to trauma

131
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,180
<4-8,Park>由外伤引起的急性呼吸窘迫综合征
<4-8,Park>is our leading hypothesis.

132
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,850
<4-8,Park>吸入氧浓度是93%
<4-8,Park>FiO2 is 93%--

133
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,590
<4-9,House>进监狱喽
<4-9,House>Prison!

134
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,290
<4-9,House>抱歉
<4-9,House>Sorry.

135
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,890
<4-9,House>我猜我听到了大家的"心声"
<4-9,House>I thought I heard everyone else think that.

136
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,650
<4-9,House>你们都知道  我进了监狱
<4-9,House>I was in prison, you see.

137
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,260
<4-9,House>那是很久以前的事了  但显然你们都很好奇
<4-9,House>It was a long time ago, but still you're curious.

138
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,990
<4-9,House>从没被暴过
<4-9,House>Never was raped.

139
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,470
<4-9,House>没被强暴过
<4-9,House>Not raped-raped.

140
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,950
<4-9,House>好吧  被强抢过  但没在被强抢后被暴过
<4-9,House>Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped.

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,010
<4-9,House>好了  我把你们想知道的都告诉你们了
<4-9,House>Well, now that we've got that completely behind us.

142
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,550
<4-9,House>抱歉  豪斯医生  欢迎回来
<4-9,House>Sorry, Dr. House, welcome back.

143
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,800
<4-10,House>有蛋糕吗
<4-10,House>Is there cake?

144
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,080
<4-10,House>肺泡内有粒细胞渗出吗
<4-10,House>Any alveolar exudate?

145
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,940
<4-10,House>没有
<4-10,House>No.

146
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,770
<4-11,House>肺部没有水肿
<4-11,House>Lungs are dry.

147
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,120
<4-11,House>那这就不是急性呼吸窘迫综合征
<4-11,House>Well, then it's not ARDS.

148
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,800
<4-11,House>现在是秋天  蜱传播疾病的高发期
<4-11,House>It's the autumn. It's tick-borne disease season.

149
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,060
<4-11,House>这是嗜吞噬细胞无形体所致的支气管炎
<4-11,House>Ehrlichiosis causing bronchiolitis.

150
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,680
<4-11,House>你们应该感谢我没把"白痴"说出口
<4-11,House>You'll appreciate that I left the "Idiots" subtextual.

151
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,470
<4-12,Wilson>血液涂片显示正常  我们这群"白痴"
<4-12,Wilson>Blood smear was clear, and we "Idiots" treated

152
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,160
<4-12,Wilson>使用了广谱抗生素进行治疗
<4-12,Wilson>with broad spectrum antibiotics.

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,970
<4-14,House>-那是吸食了可卡因  -但毒理检验没有异常
<4-14,House>- Cocaine. - Tox screen was clean.

154
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,070
<4-14,House>死人不用小便
<4-14,House>Dead men don't pee.

155
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,490
<4-14,House>毒理检验是检测小便里的代谢物
<4-14,House>Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine.

156
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,130
<4-14,House>可卡因不会流经肺部
<4-14,House>Coke never got past the lungs.

157
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,980
<4-14,House>这也能解释摩托车事故的发生原因
<4-14,House>Also explains the motorcycle crash.

158
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,770
<4-14,House>一群白痴
<4-14,House>Idiots.

159
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,950
<4-14,House>准备开始治疗吧
<4-14,House>Let's get the lungs on treatment.

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,830
<4-15,House>真是好主意
<4-15,House>Great idea.

161
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,890
<4-15,House>除非你想错了
<4-15,House>Unless you're wrong.

162
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,600
<4-15,House>我说的"你"是指我自己
<4-15,House>And by you, I mean me.

163
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,020
<4-15,House>这项治疗会让肺部烧出窟窿来
<4-15,House>Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.

164
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,930
<4-15,House>我又要说你们是"白痴"了  但这一次
<4-15,House>I'd call you idiots again, but at this point

165
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,400
<4-15,House>我开始怀疑你们压根不知道
<4-15,House>I'm starting to doubt whether you understand

166
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,250
<4-15,House>我为什么用这个词
<4-15,House>what I mean by the word.

167
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,030
<4-15,House>加藤
<4-15,House>Kato.

168
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,710
<4-15,House>去备车  在门口等我
<4-15,House>Get Black Beauty and meet me out front.

170
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,410
<4-15,House>我们要去找找这倒霉孩子藏匿的毒品
<4-15,House>We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.

171
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,110
<4-16,House>既然这名18岁的捐赠人
<4-16,House>Since an 18-year-old with organ donor

172
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,030
<4-16,House>在卡上显示为非癌症病人
<4-16,House>on his license is not a cancer patient,

173
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,450
<4-16,House>我猜测这位受赠者
<4-16,House>I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member

174
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,130
<4-16,House>会是威尔森关怀太多俱乐部的终身会员吧
<4-16,House>of the Wilson cares too much club.

175
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,190
<4-17,Wilson>推理真是精彩
<4-17,Wilson>Excellent deduction.

176
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,610
<4-18,House>你才是帮我出狱的人
<4-18,House>You're the reason I'm out of the big house.

177
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,470
<4-18,House>但这还不够弥补你从不来探...
<4-18,House>Doesn't quite make up for never visiting--

178
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,310
<4-19,Wilson>把你弄回来是福曼的主意
<4-19,Wilson>Springing you was Foreman's idea.

179
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,930
<4-19,Wilson>我一直没同意  直到辛普森失败了三次
<4-19,Wilson>I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.

180
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,030
<4-20,House>这只能说明同一件事
<4-20,House>It amounts to the same thing.

181
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,760
<4-20,House>你想让我回来
<4-20,House>You wanted me back.

182
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
<4-21,Wilson>看见没  我就知道你会曲解我的话
<4-21,Wilson>See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.

183
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,150
<4-22,House>反应过分强烈激动
<4-22,House>Strong, emotional reaction.

184
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,800
<4-22,House>我猜这就是终身会员对你的影响
<4-22,House>I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you.

185
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,080
<4-22,House>-你的膝盖怎样了  -痊愈了
<4-22,House>- How's your wrist?  - Healed.

186
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,650
<4-23,Wilson>谢谢关心
<4-23,Wilson>Thank you.

187
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,590
<4-24,House>我错了
<4-24,House>I was wrong.

188
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,640
<4-24,House>我坐了牢  为自己的行为付出了代价
<4-24,House>I went to prison. I paid the price.

189
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,950
<4-25,Wilson>你都接受改造了
<4-25,Wilson>You're a changed man.

190
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,530
<4-26,House>我是说我错了  没说我变了
<4-26,House>I said I was wrong. I didn't say I changed.

191
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,390
<4-26,House>我没变
<4-26,House>I haven't.

192
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,750
<4-27,Wilson>-你也没变...  -随便你怎么说
<4-27,Wilson>- Neither have you--  - Analyze it however you like.

193
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,970
<4-27,Wilson>我们不再是朋友了
<4-27,Wilson>We're not friends anymore.

194
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,070
<5-1,Wilson>哪里不舒服吗
<5-1,Wilson>What can I do?

195
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,120
<5-2,Vanessa>我的胸口
<5-2,Vanessa>My chest.

196
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,780
<5-2,Vanessa>绞痛又发作了
<5-2,Vanessa>Angina's back.

197
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,910
<5-3,Wilson>加点硝化甘油能缓解疼痛
<5-3,Wilson>Upping the nitro should knock it back down.

198
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,240
<5-4,Theresa>刚才我和姐姐在讨论
<5-4,Theresa>Sis and I were talking,

199
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,630
<5-4,Theresa>我们一共在医院住过几夜
<5-4,Theresa>trying to figure out how many hospital sleepovers we've had.

200
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,660
<5-5,Vanessa>就是从2001年
<5-5,Vanessa>It definitely started with the

201
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,730
<5-5,Vanessa>我接受乳房切除术开始的
<5-5,Vanessa>great mastectomy of 2001.

202
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,790
<5-5,Vanessa>老天  我真想念我的乳房
<5-5,Vanessa>God, I miss my boobs.

203
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,710
<5-5,Vanessa>绝对的"峰"满动人
<5-5,Vanessa>They were spectacular.

204
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,190
<5-6,Theresa>还有希望另找一位捐赠者吗
<5-6,Theresa>Is there a chance of locating another donor?

205
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,910
<5-7,Wilson>不太可能
<5-7,Wilson>It's unlikely.

206
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,630
<5-7,Wilson>尤其是
<5-7,Wilson>Especially since,

207
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,360
<5-7,Wilson>她的肺气肿恶化  需要一对肺
<5-7,Wilson>with the extent of the emphysema, she needs a double lung.

208
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,720
<5-8,Wilson>还在疼吗
<5-8,Wilson>How are you doing?

209
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,960
<5-9,Vanessa>已经好些了
<5-9,Vanessa>Better already.

210
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,820
<5-9,Vanessa>很高兴那药起作用了  我想让你给我带一整瓶来
<5-9,Vanessa>It's a good thing that worked. I was gonna make you bring me a bottle.

211
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,880
<5-9,Vanessa>老妹  打起精神来
<5-9,Vanessa>Oh, lighten up, Sis.

212
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,850
<5-9,Vanessa>至少你可以在听这位即将死去的女士
<5-9,Vanessa>You know, the least you could do

213
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,170
<5-9,Vanessa>讲笑话的时候笑一笑
<5-9,Vanessa>is laugh at a dying lady's jokes.

214
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,870
<5-10,Theresa>你那会喝酒一点意思都没有
<5-10,Theresa>Your drinking wasn't funny then,

215
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,210
<5-10,Theresa>现在的笑话也一点不好笑
<5-10,Theresa>and it's not funny now.

216
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,280
<5-10,Theresa>因为你不会死
<5-10,Theresa>Because you're not dying.

217
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,850
<5-11,Wilson>医院请来了一位顾问医师
<5-11,Wilson>The hospital brought in a consultant

218
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,820
<5-11,Wilson>来解决捐赠者肺部出现的问题
<5-11,Wilson>to work on the lungs.

219
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,950
<5-12,Theresa>你认识他吗  他的水平怎么样
<5-12,Theresa>Do you know him? Is he--is he good?

220
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,790
<5-13,Wilson>他是位很出色的医生
<5-13,Wilson>He is an excellent doctor.

221
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,400
<6-1,Park>我们或许不该像这样冒然拜访
<6-1,Park>We probably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this.

222
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,110
<6-1,Park>他们的儿子刚刚过世
<6-1,Park>Their son just died.

223
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,960
<6-2,House>乐观点...他们或许刚从哭泣中醒来
<6-2,House>Bright side--they're probably up weeping.

224
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,400
<6-2,House>我们都袭击过自己的上司
<6-2,House>Hey, we both assaulted our bosses.

225
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,570
<6-2,House>这点上咱俩可真是志同道合
<6-2,House>It's like we're twins.

226
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,020
<6-4,House>-我真的...  -好吧我先说  我的上司抛弃了我
<6-4,House>- I really-- - OK, I'll go first. My boss dumped me.

227
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,620
<6-4,House>你呢  被叫做他的瓷娃娃吗
<6-4,House>And yours what? Called you his China doll?

228
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,110
<6-4,House>嘲笑你在曼哈顿买的便宜货吗
<6-4,House>Joked about what a crappy deal you got for Manhattan?

229
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,390
<6-4,House>以为你是男人吗
<6-4,House>Assumed you have a huge penis?

230
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,980
<6-4,House>我还不知道你是什么类型的人
<6-4,House>I have no idea what flavor you are,

231
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,320
<6-4,House>所以我做了各种猜测
<6-4,House>so I thought I'd just cover the spread.

232
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,710
<6-5,Park>我妈妈是菲律宾人  爸爸是韩国人
<6-5,Park>My mom's Filipino, dad's Korean,

233
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,100
<6-5,Park>我的上司从背后抓住了我
<6-5,Park>and my boss grabbed my behind.

234
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,150
<6-6,House>抓住后面的什么
<6-6,House>Behind what?

235
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,180
<6-6,House>哦...抓住了你的臀部
<6-6,House>Oh, yeah, your--grabbed your tushy.

236
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,360
<6-6,House>所以你现在假装在值班
<6-6,House>So now you're pretending to be on call

237
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,700
<6-6,House>这样你那位过度敏感的男友
<6-6,House>so that your overly protective boyfriend

238
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,490
<6-6,House>就不会发现你被人调戏了
<6-6,House>won't find out that you got groped.

239
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,970
<6-7,Park>我没有男朋友
<6-7,Park>I don't have a boyfriend.

240
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,970
<6-7,Park>我这么做是因为我的父母
<6-7,Park>It's my parents.

241
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,550
<6-7,Park>如果他们发现我打了上司  会觉得受到了羞辱
<6-7,Park>If they found out what I've done, they'd be mortified.

242
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,130
<6-8,House>你的父母知道你的值班时间吗
<6-8,House>Your parents know your call schedule?

243
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,780
<6-9,Park>我和他们住在一起
<6-9,Park>I live with them.

244
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,900
<6-10,House>好吧
<6-10,House>Right.

245
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,830
<6-10,House>我没有问题了
<6-10,House>No issues there.

246
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,360
<6-10,House>我都已经说了  我的儿子没有吸食过可卡因
<6-10,House>I told you my son didn't do cocaine.

247
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,290
<7-1,House>瘾君子可不会说实话
<7-1,House>Druggies are not known for their honesty.

248
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,780
<7-1,House>相信我这句话
<7-1,House>Trust me on this one.

249
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,980
<7-2,Park>怀勒斯先生  我相信您说的话
<7-2,Park>Mr.Weathers, I am sure you're right,

250
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,420
<7-2,Park>但我们不能有半点疏忽
<7-2,Park>but we need to be thorough.

251
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,130
<7-2,Park>你儿子吸食过大麻吗
<7-2,Park>Did your son ever smoke marijuana?

252
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,190
<7-2,Park>他是个运动员
<7-2,Park>He was an athlete.

253
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,400
<7-2,Park>很注意保持健康
<7-2,Park>Took real good care of himself.

254
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
<7-3,House>你别毛手毛脚的
<7-3,House>Hey, take it easy.

255
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,740
<7-3,House>-那些都是史蒂夫的宝贝  -对不起
<7-3,House>- Steve loved all that. - Sorry.

256
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,770
<7-3,House>我们赶时间
<7-3,House>But we're on a clock.

257
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,870
<7-4,Park>我觉得他要赶我们走了
<7-4,Park>I think he's about to throw us out.

258
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,330
<7-5,House>不会的
<7-5,House>Nope.

259
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,510
<7-5,House>他儿子死了
<7-5,House>His son is dead.

260
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,150
<7-5,House>他死得是否有意义
<7-5,House>The only way that has any meaning

261
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,790
<7-5,House>就看我们能否救活那两页肺并完成移植
<7-5,House>is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.

262
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,420
<7-5,House>我们怎么惹他都没关系
<7-5,House>It doesn't matter how much we piss him off

263
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,730
<7-5,House>只要我们能找到证据
<7-5,House>as long as we find something.

264
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,010
<7-5,House>所以你过去
<7-5,House>So go back there,

265
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,720
<7-5,House>惹毛他
<7-5,House>piss him off

266
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,680
<7-5,House>问点线索出来
<7-5,House>and find something.

267
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,730
<7-6,Park>你认识那些和你儿子
<7-6,Park>Do you know any of the kids

268
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,210
<7-6,Park>一起参加聚会的孩子吗
<7-6,Park>at the party with your son?

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,750
<7-6,Park>就是些他高中的朋友
<7-6,Park>Bunch of his high school buddies.

270
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,210
<7-6,Park>他们开始打牌
<7-6,Park>They got ready a poker.

271
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,080
<7-7,Park>最后决定在布兰登·布鲁姆家
<7-7,Park>Decided to have an all-night game

272
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,550
<7-7,Park>的地下室玩通宵
<7-7,Park>in Brandon Broome's basement.

273
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,950
<7-7,Park>我知道我们赶时间
<7-7,Park>I understand that we're in a hurry.

274
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,940
<7-4,Park>他可能不会赶我们走
<7-4,Park>He's probably not gonna throw us out.

275
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,120
<7-7,Park>但他真应该那么做
<7-7,Park>But maybe he should.

276
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,890
<7-8,House>相片里你儿子都不戴眼镜
<7-8,House>Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.

277
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,680
<7-8,House>他几周前才配的
<7-8,House>He just got them a couple of weeks ago.

278
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,170
<7-9,House>是因为他头疼吗
<7-9,House>Because he was having headaches?

279
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,550
<7-10,House>先回答问题再去开门
<7-10,House>Answer the question before answering the door.

280
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,820
<7-9,House>是的  他是头疼
<7-9,House>Yeah, he was.

281
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,950
<7-10,House>你是对的
<7-10,House>You were right.

282
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,590
<7-11,House>你儿子没吸毒
<7-11,House>He was not doing cocaine.

283
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,630
<7-11,House>他生了脑瘤
<7-11,House>He had a brain tumor.

284
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,200
<7-12,House>别去开了  是找我的
<7-12,House>Don't bother. It's for me.

285
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,850
<7-12,House>看来
<7-12,House>Turns out

286
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,010
<7-12,House>他们还是会监视这些监视器的
<7-12,House>they monitor these monitors.

287
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,240
<8-1,Foreman>谢谢你  警官
<8-1,Foreman>Thank you officer.

288
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,500
<8-2,House>我以为戴脚链是为了好看
<8-2,House>I thought the bracelet was decorative.

289
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,160
<8-2,House>我婶婶也有个一样的
<8-2,House>My aunt has one just like it.

290
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,590
<8-3,Foreman>-等一下  -允许你待医院
<8-3,Foreman>- Wait a minute. - You're allowed to be at the hospital.

291
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,770
<8-3,Foreman>允许你回家
<8-3,Foreman>You're allowed to go home.

292
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,760
<8-3,Foreman>之前和你说清楚的
<8-3,Foreman>That was made clear.

293
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,440
<8-4,House>那男孩的家就在我回家的路上
<8-4,House>Dead kid's house was on the way to my apartment.

294
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,740
<8-4,House>我可能迷了两次路
<8-4,House>Assuming I got lost, twice.

295
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,750
<8-5,Foreman>我办公室里的那些顾问多等一分钟
<8-5,Foreman>Those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital

296
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,960
<8-5,Foreman>就要多花我们一百美元
<8-5,Foreman>100 bucks every minute I keep them waiting.

297
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,840
<8-5,Foreman>你就不能告诉我你在干什么吗
<8-5,Foreman>Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?

298
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,460
<8-6,House>我知道你忙着装你的大人物呢
<8-6,House>I knew you were very busy being vaguely important.

299
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,870
<8-7,Foreman>我就应该向警方澄清的
<8-7,Foreman>I might have cleared it with the cops.

300
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,590
<8-8,House>就是"应该"这词害惨得我
<8-8,House>Yeah, it's the word "might" that bumps me.

301
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,260
<8-8,House>下次我会先和你说的
<8-8,House>I'll run it by you next time.

302
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
<8-9,Foreman>豪斯
<8-9,Foreman>House.

303
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,830
<8-10,Foreman>董事会不太赞成
<8-10,Foreman>Getting you out of jail

304
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,500
<8-10,Foreman>把你保释出狱
<8-10,Foreman>was not a popular decision with the board.

305
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,420
<8-10,Foreman>我需要你解决这病例
<8-10,Foreman>I need you to solve this,

306
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,820
<8-10,Foreman>也需要你在完成任务的同时
<8-10,Foreman>and I need you to do it without making me

307
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,150
<8-10,Foreman>别让我太难堪
<8-10,Foreman>look like I can't control you.

308
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,340
<8-10,Foreman>这对你我都有好处
<8-10,Foreman>For both our sakes.

309
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,270
<9-1,House>纪律监察听证会乐趣无穷啊
<9-1,House>Disciplinarian hearing should be fun.

310
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,030
<9-1,House>之后就会在你档案里留下永远的污点
<9-1,House>And the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.

311
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
<9-2,Park>我不担心
<9-2,Park>I'm not worried.

312
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,970
<9-3,Park>我们得把尸体送去做磁共振
<9-3,Park>We have to wheel this out to the MRI.

313
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,870
<9-3,Park>还是不要打开袋子为妙
<9-3,Park>We should probably leave the body in the bag.

314
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,160
<9-4,House>他手臂上有个肿块
<9-4,House>There's a mass in the arm.

315
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,720
<9-4,House>分析下这块肿瘤要比全身检查快
<9-4,House>Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.

316
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,790
<9-5,House>那么你准备去哪里工作
<9-5,House>So where's the next job?

317
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,900
<9-5,House>你很看重人们对你的看法
<9-5,House>You worry about what people think of you,

318
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,750
<7-10,House>所以你衣着整齐  发型清爽
<7-10,House>thus the carefully maintained hair, clothes

319
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,510
<9-5,House>而且还对父母有所隐瞒
<9-5,House>and parental secrets.

320
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,230
<9-5,House>你之所以不担心听证会
<9-5,House>The only way that you don't worry about this hearing

321
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,070
<9-5,House>只有可能是你认为根本就不会有听证
<9-5,House>is if you don't think there's gonna be one.

322
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,740
<9-5,House>这样的话  唯一的可能
<9-5,House>The only way that happens

323
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,320
<9-5,House>就是你离开普林斯顿普雷斯波罗教学医院
<9-5,House>is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.

324
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,080
<9-6,Park>我昨天和芝加哥医院进行了一次视频面试
<9-6,Park>I had a video interview with Chicago yesterday.

325
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,680
<9-6,Park>还不错
<9-6,Park>It went well.

326
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,200
<9-7,House>我押他得的是横纹肌瘤
<9-7,House>My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.

327
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,870
<9-7,House>芝加哥可是个好地方
<9-7,House>Chicago has a great program.

328
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,880
<9-7,House>不过你太蠢了
<9-7,House>And you're a dumbass.

329
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,450
<9-8,House>背井离乡算是悠久的传统了
<9-8,House>Running away from home is a time-honored tradition,

330
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,610
<9-8,House>不过你这么做不是为了逃离父母
<9-8,House>but you're not doing it to flee your parents.

331
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,820
<9-8,House>却是为了保护他们
<9-8,House>You're doing it to protect them.

332
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,020
<9-8,House>你这么做
<9-8,House>That's an insult

333
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,940
<9-8,House>让那些尚未成年的站街女情何以堪啊
<9-8,House>to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.

334
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,170
<9-8,House>你也该长大了  和他们说清楚
<9-8,House>Time to grow up and come clean.

335
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,540
<9-8,House>你说得对
<9-8,House>You're right.

336
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,760
<9-9,Park>我就该开车
<9-9,Park>I should just drive my car

337
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,360
<9-9,Park>撞进客厅去告诉他们
<9-9,Park>into a living room to tell them.

339
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,090
<10-1,Theresa>最后是不是他偷了那个热狗摊
<10-1,Theresa>Didn't it turn out that he'd stolen the hot dog cart?

340
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,890
<10-2,Vanessa>不对  他那是借用
<10-2,Vanessa>No, borrowed.

341
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,780
<10-2,Vanessa>鲍比对于这点很坚持的
<10-2,Vanessa>Bobby was very insistent on that point.

342
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,300
<10-3,Wilson>看来你感觉好点了
<10-3,Wilson>Seems like someone's feeling better.

343
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,960
<10-4,Vanessa>胸口不痛了
<10-4,Vanessa>No more chest pain.

344
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,180
<10-5,Wilson>鲍比这个名字好久不听见了
<10-5,Wilson>I haven't heard the name Bobby in a long time.

345
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,050
<10-5,Wilson>他最近如何啊
<10-5,Wilson>How's he doing these days?

346
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,720
<10-6,Vanessa>我不清楚  我们没联系过
<10-6,Vanessa>I don't know. We're not in touch.

347
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,730
<10-6,Vanessa>你就别装了  你算舒了口气吧
<10-6,Vanessa>And don't even pretend like you're not relieved.

348
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,770
<10-6,Vanessa>你压根儿就看他不爽
<10-6,Vanessa>You never liked him.

349
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,640
<10-7,Wilson>鲍比是个很有趣的家伙
<10-7,Wilson>Bobby is an incredibly fun, great guy.

350
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,010
<10-7,Wilson>就是影响不太好
<10-7,Wilson>Just not a great influence.

351
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,030
<10-8,Theresa>要我说  他就是个酒鬼
<10-8,Theresa>I would have gone with "Colossal drunk."

352
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,500
<10-9,Wilson>我还想着要暗示呢  没错  就是个酒鬼
<10-9,Wilson>I was gonna leave that implied, but, yes, colossal drunk.

353
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,140
<10-10,Vanessa>酒鬼怎么了  小夫妻俩就不能有点共同爱好吗
<10-10,Vanessa>What? It's good for a couple to share a hobby.

354
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,830
<10-11,Wilson>你的导尿袋是空的
<10-11,Wilson>Your catheter bag is empty,

355
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,460
<10-11,Wilson>你已经输了两百毫升的液了
<10-11,Wilson>Despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.

356
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,080
<10-11,Wilson>我得把硝化甘油关了
<10-11,Wilson>I'm gonna have to dial back the nitro.

357
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,420
<10-12,Theresa>她胸口是不是又要疼了
<10-12,Theresa>Won't her chest pain come back?

358
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,600
<10-13,Wilson>没办法
<10-13,Wilson>We don't have any choice.

359
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,850
<10-13,Wilson>硝化甘油阻断了向肾脏的供血
<10-13,Wilson>The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.

360
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,100
<10-13,Wilson>现在肾脏开始衰竭了
<10-13,Wilson>They're shutting down.

361
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,050
<10-13,Wilson>*咫尺  或是天涯*
<10-13,Wilson>*Near, far*

363
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,060
<10-13,Wilson>*无论你在哪里*
<10-13,Wilson>*Wherever you are*

364
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,080
<10-13,Wilson>*我相信*
<10-13,Wilson>*I believe*

365
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,090
<11-1,House>这歌唱得就是我们俩啊
<11-1,House>This is so our song.

366
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,630
<11-2,Wilson>我的病人时日不多了
<11-2,Wilson>My patient is running out of time.

367
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,560
<11-2,Wilson>爷不担心
<11-2,Wilson>Not worried.

368
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,770
<11-3,House>咱说话这会儿  我的"团队"正在确诊
<11-3,House>My team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.

369
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,860
<11-3,House>*你打开了门*
<11-3,House>*You open the door*

370
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,940
<11-4,Wilson>我想通情达理一些
<11-4,Wilson>I want to be understanding.

371
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,860
<11-4,Wilson>这是你回来第一天
<11-4,Wilson>It's your first day back--

372
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,760
<11-5,House>看  想要移情于我
<11-5,House>See? I smell empathy.

373
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,650
<11-6,House>想想那些美好的回忆吧
<11-6,House>Just remember all the good times.

374
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,760
<11-6,House>比如上次我给你一根项链
<11-6,House>Like when I gave you that necklace

375
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,210
<11-6,House>结果你扔海里了
<11-6,House>that you just dumped in the ocean.

376
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,970
<11-6,House>当时你想什么呢
<11-6,House>What were you thinking?

377
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,870
<11-7,Wilson>豪斯  我没有忘记我们的友情
<11-7,Wilson>House, I haven't forgotten our friendship.

378
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,940
<11-7,Wilson>但所有好的回忆  总伴着一堆坏的
<11-7,Wilson>For every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.

379
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,270
<11-8,House>-进来  -进来
<11-8,House>- Come in. - Come in.

380
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,410
<11-9,Wilson>不是副癌综合征
<11-9,Wilson>Paraneoplastic syndrome's out.

381
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,160
<11-10,Park>肺捐献者没有癌症
<11-10,Park>The lung donor didn't have cancer.

382
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,190
<11-11,House>这话怎么不跟我在他手臂里找到的肿瘤说去
<11-11,House>Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.

383
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,870
<11-12,Park>那不是肿瘤
<11-12,Park>That mass wasn't a tumor.

384
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,320
<11-12,Park>是凝固的血浆
<11-12,Park>It was coagulated plasma.

385
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,760
<11-12,Park>急救时输了很多血浆
<11-12,Park>E.R. pumped him full of it.

386
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,240
<11-12,Park>静脉注射渗进了他的手臂肌肉
<11-12,Park>I.V. leaked into his arm.

387
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,160
<11-12,Park>我还做了全身核磁共振
<11-12,Park>I even did a complete MRI.

388
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,820
<11-12,Park>没有癌细胞
<11-12,Park>No cancer anywhere.

389
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,360
<11-12,Park>什么都没有发现
<11-12,Park>We've got nothing.

390
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,400
<11-13,House>就算它不是肿瘤
<11-13,House>Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor

391
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,370
<11-13,House>不表示这和肺无关
<11-13,House>doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.

392
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,390
<11-13,House>血浆内某种物质引起了肺部的问题
<11-13,House>They're reacting to something in the plasma.

393
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,000
<11-14,Park>但每一单位的血浆
<11-14,Park>But every unit of plasma

394
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,000
<11-14,Park>可能来自25个捐献者
<11-14,Park>can have up to 25 contributing donors.

395
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,260
<11-14,Park>必须追查他们所有人
<11-14,Park>We need to track down all of them.

396
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,380
<11-14,Park>总之
<11-14,Park>Still.

397
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,790
<11-15,House>这比一千多号人
<11-15,House>It's not as bad as a thousand people

398
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,800
<11-15,House>跟着巨轮一起葬身海底要好
<11-15,House>going down in a gigantic boat, right?

399
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,220
<11-15,House>我心依旧
<11-15,House>My heart will go on.

400
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,010
<12-1,Foreman>不  你不能离开医院
<12-1,Foreman>No, you can't leave the hospital.

401
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,070
<12-2,House>我们的肺捐献者体内
<12-2,House>25 donors contributed to the plasma

402
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,260
<12-2,House>有25个人的血浆
<12-2,House>that the lung donor got.

403
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,970
<12-2,House>我的"团队"没法在六小时内
<12-2,House>My team cannot track down and interview them all

404
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,250
<12-2,House>走访调查所有人
<12-2,House>in six hours.

405
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,710
<12-3,Foreman>我对你向警察作出担保
<12-3,Foreman>I vouch for you to the cops.

406
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,970
<12-3,Foreman>你就爱在是否违反假释上绕弯
<12-3,Foreman>You take some parole-violating detour

407
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,220
<12-3,Foreman>想着法子出去庆祝你重获自由  当然
<12-3,Foreman>celebrating your freedom, justified, of course,

408
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,680
<12-3,Foreman>你总能找到和病例有着诡异联系的正当理由
<12-3,Foreman>by some absurd theory connecting it to the case.

409
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,930
<12-4,House>你叫我问你的
<12-4,House>You asked me to ask you.

410
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,240
<12-4,House>是为了享受拒绝的快感吗
<12-4,House>Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?

411
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,070
<12-5,Foreman>我不相信你  豪斯  我不能
<12-5,Foreman>I don't trust you, House. I can't.

412
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,270
<12-6,House>实际上你必须相信
<12-6,House>Actually you have to.

413
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,980
<12-7,Foreman>出了医院的门  我就完全不能相信你了
<12-7,Foreman>Not absolutely. Not outside the walls of this hospital.

414
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,960
<12-8,House>行  那就给我一个
<12-8,House>Fine, then give me a team I don't have

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
<12-8,House>实实在在的团队
<12-8,House>to put in quotation marks.

416
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,550
<12-9,Foreman>调用已经参与这件病例的人
<12-9,Foreman>Use the people already on the case.

417
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,070
<12-10,House>给我奇斯  陶博  十三
<12-10,House>Give me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.

418
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,740
<12-11,Foreman>我们请不起他们
<12-11,Foreman>We don't have the money to pay them.

419
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,200
<12-12,House>对
<12-12,House>Oh, yeah.

420
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,340
<12-12,House>钱都用在装修上了  我理解
<12-12,House>It went to interior designers, I understand.

421
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,500
<12-13,Foreman>朴克能帮你  是因为神经科会付她工资
<12-13,Foreman>You only have Park because she's on neurology's tab.

422
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,380
<12-13,Foreman>你赚的是最低工资
<12-13,Foreman>You are making minimum wage.

423
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,840
<12-14,House>是吗
<12-14,House>I am?

424
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,070
<12-15,Foreman>出去吧  谢谢
<12-15,Foreman>Get out of my office, please.

425
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,590
<13-1,House>有什么发现
<13-1,House>What do you got?

426
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,880
<13-2,Wilson>三号在献血之前
<13-2,Wilson>Number three went to a baseball game

427
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,910
<13-2,Wilson>去看过棒球比赛
<13-2,Wilson>the day before he donated.

428
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,560
<13-3,House>无聊又不能传染
<13-3,House>Boredom is not transmissible.

429
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,780
<13-4,Wilson>他吃了一袋花生
<13-4,Wilson>He ate a bag of peanuts,

430
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
<13-4,Wilson>可能是花生所含的蛋白质
<13-4,Wilson>and peanut proteins would be.

431
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,750
<13-4,Wilson>如果我们的捐献者过敏
<13-4,Wilson>If our donor had an allergy,

432
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,890
<13-4,Wilson>就可以解释肺部的症状
<13-4,Wilson>it could explain the lungs.

433
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,570
<13-5,House>很好
<13-5,House>Nice.

434
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,310
<13-7,House>-什么  -没什么
<13-7,House>- What? - Nothing.

435
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,270
<13-8,Wilson>别这样
<13-8,Wilson>Don't start that.

436
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,230
<13-9,House>怎么样
<13-9,House>Start what?

437
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,880
<13-9,House>我很享受我们的对话
<13-9,House>I'm enjoying our conversation.

438
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,140
<13-9,House>唱双簧
<13-9,House>The repartee.

439
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,380
<13-10,Wilson>我没跟你唱双簧
<13-10,Wilson>There was no repartee.

440
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,460
<13-11,House>这就叫唱双簧
<13-11,House>That was repartee.

441
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,990
<13-12,Wilson>我做这些不是为了你
<13-12,Wilson>I'm not doing this for you.

442
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,550
<13-12,Wilson>而是为了我的病人
<13-12,Wilson>I'm doing it to help my patient.

443
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,460
<13-13,House>-只是很高兴听到你的声音  -挂了
<13-13,House>- It's just good to hear your voice.  - Goodbye.

444
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,550
<13-14,Wilson>那是我的白板
<13-14,Wilson>That's my whiteboard.

445
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,870
<13-14,Wilson>我要用
<13-14,Wilson>I need it.

446
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,330
<13-15,House>反正他对怎么拆石膏
<13-15,House>And he really doesn't care

447
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,460
<13-15,House>不怎么感兴趣
<13-15,House>how the cast comes off.

448
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,470
<13-16,Betty>福曼医生警告过我们
<13-16,Betty>Dr. Foreman warned us

449
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,710
<13-16,Betty>说你会来捣乱
<13-16,Betty>that you'd try something.

450
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,360
<13-16,Betty>如果你真来了  让我给他打电话
<13-16,Betty>Told me to call him if you did.

451
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,890
<13-16,Betty>我很乐意这么做
<13-16,Betty>I'd like to do that.

452
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,170
<13-17,House>我出去接
<13-17,House>I'll take this outside.

453
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,000
<13-18,House>说吧
<13-18,House>Yeah.

454
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,530
<13-19,Park>六号献血者去过泰国
<13-19,Park>Donor six traveled to Thailand

455
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,940
<13-19,Park>呵叻附近
<13-19,Park>around Khorat.

456
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,440
<13-19,Park>那里流行过登革热
<13-19,Park>Region was endemic with Dengue Fever.

457
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,190
<13-20,House>好
<13-20,House>Good.

459
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,550
<14-2,Park>-说  -酒精
<14-2,Park>- Yeah. - Alcohol.

460
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,390
<14-3,House>要影响到血浆
<14-3,House>He had to be pretty drunk

461
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,260
<14-3,House>可得酩酊大醉才行
<14-3,House>for it to affect a pool of plasma.

462
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,780
<14-4,Park>他们总有办法喝成这样
<14-4,Park>These guys have got that covered.

463
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,170
<14-4,Park>急性酒精摄入可能引起
<14-4,Park>Acute ETOH ingestion could have--

464
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,740
<14-4,Park>看着点  他们又没伤害谁
<14-4,Park>Hey, paint around them! They're not hurting anyone.

465
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,060
<14-5,House>谁在刷油漆
<14-5,House>Who's painting?

466
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,390
<14-6,Park>工作人员刚开始刷
<14-6,Park>The crew's just starting.

467
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,910
<14-6,Park>油漆气体不会导致污染
<14-6,Park>Paint fumes didn't cause contamination.

468
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,100
<14-6,Park>但也许旧油漆会
<14-6,Park>But maybe the old paint did.

469
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,070
<14-6,Park>他们把旧漆刮掉
<14-6,Park>They scraped off the underpass,

470
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,810
<14-6,Park>可能是因为它含有
<14-6,Park>probably because it contains...

471
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,330
<14-7,House>铅
<14-7,House>Lead.

472
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,360
<15-1,Wilson>胸口又痛了吗
<15-1,Wilson>Chest pain back?

473
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,430
<15-2,Vanessa>这次更痛了
<15-2,Vanessa>It's worse this time.

474
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,440
<15-2,Vanessa>有没有办法缓解
<15-2,Vanessa>Is there any way to take the edge off?

475
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,220
<15-3,Wilson>我们还在对肺做检查
<15-3,Wilson>We're still working on the lungs.

476
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,170
<15-3,Wilson>应该很快有结果了
<15-3,Wilson>We should know soon.

477
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,100
<15-4,Vanessa>很快就好
<15-4,Vanessa>Soon is good.

478
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,680
<15-5,Wilson>螯合物疗怎么样了
<15-5,Wilson>How's the chelation going?

479
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,250
<15-6,House>20分钟前月亮神父刚开始做
<15-6,House>Reverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago.

480
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,560
<15-6,House>你在查血浆捐献者的时候
<15-6,House>You missed lunch tracking down

481
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,690
<15-6,House>没吃午餐
<15-6,House>the plasma donors.

482
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,850
<15-6,House>帮你买了千层肉三明治
<15-6,House>Got you a reuben from the cafeteria.

483
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,690
<15-7,Wilson>谢了
<15-7,Wilson>Thanks.

484
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,480
<15-7,Wilson>铅接触是个不错的诊断
<15-7,Wilson>Lead exposure's a nice diagnosis.

485
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,600
<15-7,Wilson>希望能成功
<15-7,Wilson>I hope it pays off.

486
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,960
<15-8,House>肯定没问题
<15-8,House>It will.

487
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,980
<15-9,Wilson>我很欣赏你的自信  不过她恐怕...
<15-9,Wilson>I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really--

488
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,150
<15-10,House>我不是那意思  她可能会死
<15-10,House>Oh, no, she could die.

489
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,990
<15-10,House>但理论上说  我的诊断依旧会成功
<15-10,House>But technically it will still pay off.

490
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,260
<15-10,House>即使你的病人死了  还有别人会得到那对肺
<15-10,House>Even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.

491
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,620
<15-11,Wilson>你还真是一点没变
<15-11,Wilson>You really haven't changed.

492
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,270
<15-11,Wilson>不过我已经不吃牛羊肉了
<15-11,Wilson>But I've given up red meat.

493
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,250
<16-1,Foreman>螯合治疗进行到第几轮了
<16-1,Foreman>What round of chelation is this?

494
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,180
<16-2,Park>第四轮
<16-2,Park>Fourth.

495
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,760
<16-2,Park>你是来检查我还是检查豪斯的
<16-2,Park>Are you checking up on me or on House?

496
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,860
<16-3,Foreman>检查这个病例
<16-3,Foreman>This case.

497
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,940
<16-3,Foreman>特殊情况
<16-3,Foreman>Unique situation.

498
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,410
<16-3,Foreman>输氧浓度
<16-3,Foreman>Oxygenating?

499
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,050
<16-4,Park>98%  气道梗阻解除
<16-4,Park>98%. Airway resistance down.

500
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,750
<16-5,Foreman>很好  豪斯还好吗
<16-5,Foreman>Great! Is House okay?

501
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,840
<16-6,Park>我不知道
<16-6,Park>I have no idea.

502
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,930
<16-7,Park>爸  你在这干什么
<16-7,Park>Dad, what are you doing here?

503
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,180
<16-8,Park>我收到你的消息了
<16-8,Park>Got your text.

504
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,800
<16-8,Park>给你带了你母亲做的好菜
<16-8,Park>I brought you some of your mother's goom cook.

505
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,140
<16-8,Park>什么消息
<16-8,Park>What text?

506
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,560
<16-8,Park>让我给你送晚饭的消息啊
<16-8,Park>The one asking me to bring you some dinner.

507
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,540
<16-8,Park>我去过神经科了
<16-8,Park>I went by neurology.

508
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,110
<16-9,Park>助理告诉我你休假了
<16-9,Park>The secretary said you were on leave.

509
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,030
<16-9,Park>我在为这个病例做会诊
<16-9,Park>I'm consulting on this case.

510
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,260
<16-3,Foreman>特殊情况
<16-3,Foreman>Unique situation.

511
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,280
<16-5,Foreman>看上去很复杂啊
<16-5,Foreman>It looks very complicated.

512
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,840
<16-8,Park>你能帮上忙吗
<16-8,Park>You can help with that?

513
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,210
<16-10,Park>肺不行了  我得进去了
<16-10,Park>Lungs are crashing. I have to go.

514
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,390
<16-10,Park>拜拜
<16-10,Park>Bye.

515
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,340
<16-11,Foreman>将吸入氧浓度调到100%
<16-11,Foreman>Increasing to 100% FiO2.

516
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,840
<16-12,Park>生理盐水流速下降到10毫升每秒
<16-12,Park>Saline flow is down to 10 ccs.

517
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,030
<16-13,Foreman>堵塞吗  线路中有凝块吗
<16-13,Foreman>Blockage? Clot in the line?

518
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,160
<16-14,Park>螯合治疗使它恶化了
<16-14,Park>Chelation is making it worse.

519
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,570
<16-14,Park>这意味着铅接触的想法是错的
<16-14,Park>It means we were wrong about lead.

520
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,430
<16-15,Foreman>别管那些了  先抢救这肺吧
<16-15,Foreman>Hold the analysis and help me save this thing.

521
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,910
<16-16,Park>生理盐水只有流入
<16-16,Park>Saline's flushing it forward

522
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,160
<16-16,Park>没有流出
<16-16,Park>but getting no return.

523
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,830
<16-16,Park>单向阀  出现血管痉挛
<16-16,Park>One-way valve. Vasospasm.

524
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,670
<16-17,Foreman>如果你是对的  钙通道阻滞剂应该能缓解这症状
<16-17,Foreman>If you're right, calcium channel blocker should relex the artery.

525
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,020
<16-18,Park>肺没有神经系统
<16-18,Park>The lungs have no nervous system.

526
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,340
<16-18,Park>那还会管用吗
<16-18,Park>Will that still work?

527
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,580
<16-19,Foreman>很快就能知道了
<16-19,Foreman>We'll know soon.

528
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,000
<16-20,Foreman>生理盐水流速上升
<16-20,Foreman>Saline flows rising.

529
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,320
<16-20,Foreman>血管痉挛得以缓解
<16-20,Foreman>Vasospasm is relexing.

530
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,490
<16-20,Foreman>左肺恢复正常
<16-20,Foreman>Left lung is pinking up.

531
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,010
<16-20,Foreman>干的好
<16-20,Foreman>Good job.

532
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,160
<16-21,Park>右肺中叶没有恢复正常
<16-21,Park>Right middle lobe isn't.

533
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,080
<16-22,Foreman>没反应
<16-22,Foreman>Nothing.

534
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,650
<16-23,Park>我们破坏了部分肺叶
<16-23,Park>We killed part of the lung.

535
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,600
<17-1,House>请呼平托医生去介入导管室
<17-1,House>Page Dr. Pinto stat to the cath lab.

536
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,960
<17-2,Park>我们要去介入导管室吗
<17-2,Park>We're going to the cath lab?

537
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,050
<17-2,Park>你认为有可能是
<17-2,Park>Are you thinking that maybe--

538
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,120
<17-3,House>什么  谁
<17-3,House>What? Who?

539
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,180
<17-3,House>一片肺叶坏死意味着还有四片活着
<17-3,House>One dead lobe means four alive ones.

540
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,890
<17-3,House>不仅足够进行移植
<17-3,House>It means enough to transplant

541
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,890
<17-3,House>还意味着我们有部分坏死组织可以进行测试
<17-3,House>with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.

542
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,200
<17-4,Park>这还说得通  不像你偷了我的手机的行为
<17-4,Park>It makes sense. Unlike you stealing my phone.

543
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,260
<17-5,House>反正你发消息不花钱
<17-5,House>You have unlimited texting.

544
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,910
<17-5,House>在你父母知道之前  你永远不会明白
<17-5,House>Until your parents know, you will never see that punch

545
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,150
<17-5,House>那拳究竟意味着什么
<17-5,House>for what it really was.

546
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,230
<17-5,House>那是属于你的二月四日
<17-5,House>Your February 4th.

547
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,170
<17-5,House>斯里兰卡独立日
<17-5,House>Sri Lankan Independence Day.

548
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,170
<17-6,Park>我告诉过你我是韩国和菲利宾混血
<17-6,Park>I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.

549
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,550
<17-7,House>我也告诉过你我没在听
<17-7,House>And I told you I wasn't listening.

550
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
<17-7,House>通过肢体说明了这点
<17-7,House>By my actions.

551
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,520
<17-8,Park>暴力并不是解决冲突的适当方法
<17-8,Park>Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict.

552
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,190
<17-8,Park>那只是一时的软弱
<17-8,Park>It was a moment of weakness.

553
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,490
<17-9,House>你冲我大喊  向一群
<17-9,House>You barked at me, picked a fight

554
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,550
<17-9,House>油漆工挑衅
<17-9,House>with a painting crew.

555
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,610
<17-9,House>也许是时候认清
<17-9,House>Maybe it's time to recognize

556
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,220
<17-9,House>这并非性格缺陷
<17-9,House>it's not a character flaw.

557
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,810
<17-9,House>而是你的本性使然
<17-9,House>Maybe it's your character.

558
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,570
<17-10,House>-平托  -豪斯
<17-10,House>- Pinto! - House.

559
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
<17-11,House>拥抱你心中那个小贱人吧
<17-11,House>Embrace your inner bitch.

560
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,930
<17-12,House>为什么螯合治疗使肺恶化了呢
<17-12,House>So why did chelation make the lungs worse?

561
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,680
<17-13,House>在平托回来前我们有五分钟时间
<17-13,House>We got about five minutes till Pinto gets back.

562
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,030
<17-13,House>-帮我一把  -不
<17-13,House>- Give me a hand with this. - No.

563
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,680
<17-14,Park>我又从捐献者使用过的
<17-14,Park>I tracked down another bag of plasma

564
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,290
<17-15,Park>那批血浆中抽检了一袋
<17-15,Park>from the batch they used on the donor.

565
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,710
<17-15,Park>没有检测到其它接触物
<17-15,Park>Negative for all our other exposures.

566
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,070
<17-16,House>如果是结节病
<17-16,House>Sarcoidosis could be inflamed

567
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,090
<17-16,House>应该会造成红肿发炎
<17-16,House>by the treatment.

568
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,980
<17-16,House>我是个瘸子
<17-16,House>I am a cripple

569
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,470
<17-16,House>需要帮助
<17-16,House>in need of assistance.

570
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,910
<17-17,Park>移植小组查了血管紧张素转换酶
<17-17,Park>Transplant team ran an A.C.E.

571
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,180
<17-18,House>-结果是阴性的  -这是我的
<17-18,House>- Negative. - It's mine.

572
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,150
<17-18,House>这也是你的工作
<17-18,House>And it's your job.

573
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,610
<17-19,Park>我的工作是协助你治好这对肺
<17-19,Park>My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.

574
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,910
<17-20,House>这把椅子会帮我完成这工作
<17-20,House>This chair will help me do that.

575
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,880
<17-21,Park>桥上掉下来的碎屑有没有可能
<17-21,Park>What if the scrapings from the bridge

576
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,570
<17-21,Park>含有其它重金属  比如铍或石棉
<17-21,Park>contained other heavy metals like beryllium or asbestos.

577
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,990
<17-22,House>那样针对铅进行的螯合治疗不会使肺情况恶化
<17-22,House>Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.

578
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,090
<17-22,House>不过...
<17-22,House>But...

579
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,130
<17-23,House>也许重金属并非来自外部
<17-23,House>Maybe the problem isn't a heavy metal from outside.

580
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,340
<17-23,House>而是来自内部
<17-23,House>It's inside.

581
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,470
<17-23,House>它们未能按正常情况离开身体
<17-23,House>But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to.

582
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,940
<17-23,House>而是困住了
<17-23,House>It's stuck.

583
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,720
<17-23,House>是铁
<17-23,House>Iron.

584
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,260
<17-23,House>捐赠者患有铁血黄素沉着症
<17-23,House>The donor had hemosiderosis.

585
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,180
<17-24,Park>他的身体不能代谢铁元素
<17-24,Park>His body wasn't disposing of iron.

586
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,220
<17-24,Park>大量的铁元素停留在了肺里
<17-24,Park>Massive amounts choke up the lungs.

587
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,690
<17-24,Park>那我们的螯合治疗会造成严重后果
<17-24,Park>Then our chelation would wreak havoc

588
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,120
<17-24,Park>因为那会带去更多的金属元素
<17-24,Park>because it picks up too much stuff.

589
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,560
<17-25,House>去对坏死的肺叶细胞进行铁元素染色
<17-25,House>Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.

590
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,260
<17-26,House>实在抱歉  年轻的小姐  我明显不会帮你
<17-26,House>I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you

591
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,300
<17-26,House>一起偷这把椅子
<17-26,House>steal this chair.

592
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,710
<17-26,House>-平托  -豪斯
<17-26,House>- Pinto. - House.

593
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,060
<17-26,House>你好
<17-26,House>Hi.

594
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,830
<18-1,Theresa>她几乎没办法喘气了
<18-1,Theresa>She can barely catch her breath.

595
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,710
<18-2,Vanessa>肺准备好了吗
<18-2,Vanessa>Lungs ready yet?

596
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,620
<18-2,Vanessa>有点耽搁
<18-2,Vanessa>We have small set back.

597
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,270
<18-3,Wilson>我们在进行铁质过量检查
<18-3,Wilson>We're testing for iron overload.

598
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,490
<18-4,Theresa>我以为是铅
<18-4,Theresa>I thought it was lead.

599
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,720
<18-5,Wilson>这是个不确切的推断
<18-5,Wilson>This is not an exact process.

600
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,600
<18-5,Wilson>你的小气道系统正在崩溃
<18-5,Wilson>Your small airways are collapsing.

601
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,780
<18-5,Wilson>使你得不到充足的氧气
<18-5,Wilson>You're not getting enough oxygen.

602
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,340
<18-5,Wilson>我想试着加压
<18-5,Wilson>I'd like to try forcing

603
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,510
<18-5,Wilson>将富氧悬浮液打入你的肺部
<18-5,Wilson>an oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.

604
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,970
<18-5,Wilson>这样会打开气道  多给你些时间
<18-5,Wilson>It should open up the airways and buy you some time

605
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,990
<18-5,Wilson>直到移植肺准备好
<18-5,Wilson>until the lungs are ready.

606
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,290
<18-6,Vanessa>液体  进入我的肺部
<18-6,Vanessa>Fluid? In my lungs?

607
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,050
<18-6,Vanessa>听起来就跟溺水一样
<18-6,Vanessa>Sounds like drowning.

608
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,070
<18-7,Wilson>没错
<18-7,Wilson>It is.

609
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,410
<18-8,Vanessa>会疼的  不是吗
<18-8,Vanessa>Gonna hurt, isn't it?

610
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,400
<18-9,Wilson>是的  和溺水的痛苦差不多
<18-9,Wilson>Yes. A fair amount.

611
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,950
<18-9,Wilson>不要
<18-9,Wilson>No.

612
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,780
<18-10,Vanessa>我受够了
<18-10,Vanessa>I'm done.

613
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,030
<19-1,Wilson>豪斯  护士看见你进来了
<19-1,Wilson>House, the nurses saw you come in.

614
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,270
<19-2,House>请进
<19-2,House>Enter.

615
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,610
<19-3,Wilson>这是厕所啊
<19-3,Wilson>It's a bathroom.

616
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,320
<19-4,House>怪不得座位上有个洞
<19-4,House>Ah, explains the hole in this chair.

617
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,310
<19-5,House>上帝  我想死办公室的门了
<19-5,House>God, I missed doors.

618
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,470
<19-5,House>还有空气清新剂
<19-5,House>And air freshener.

619
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,220
<19-6,House>现在走吧
<19-6,House>Now go away.

620
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,100
<19-6,House>我在等化验结果
<19-6,House>I'm waiting for some test results.

621
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,200
<19-7,Wilson>我的病人签了放弃抢救同意书  她放弃了
<19-7,Wilson>My patient signed a DNR. She's giving up.

622
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,970
<19-7,Wilson>看来会有其他人得到那对肺了
<19-7,Wilson>Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs.

623
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,490
<19-7,Wilson>好像你又说对了
<19-7,Wilson>Making this yet another interaction with you in which I get nothing.

624
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,860
<19-8,House>你不能掌控你的病人又不是我的错
<19-8,House>It's not my fault you can't handle your patient.

625
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,100
<19-9,Wilson>她说她受够了
<19-9,Wilson>She said she's done.

626
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,550
<19-9,Wilson>我花了半小时想让她回心转意
<19-9,Wilson>I spent half an hour trying to change her mind,

627
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,840
<19-9,Wilson>但她很坚决
<19-9,Wilson>but she'd made her decision.

628
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,530
<19-9,Wilson>我接受了  这叫做尊重
<19-9,Wilson>I accepted that. It's called respect.

629
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,020
<19-10,House>那么尊重之后呢
<19-10,House>Well, what's after respect?

630
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,350
<19-10,House>你就换个方式
<19-10,House>You find another angle.

631
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,680
<19-10,House>握着她的手
<19-10,House>You hold her hand,

632
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,040
<19-10,House>让她妹妹祈求
<19-10,House>get the sister to beg,

633
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,290
<19-10,House>捂住你的耳朵
<19-10,House>stick your fingers in your ears,

634
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,640
<19-10,House>假装什么都没听到
<19-10,House>pretend you can't hear.

635
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,460
<19-10,House>你全力以赴就行
<19-10,House>You do whatever it takes.

636
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,100
<19-11,Wilson>全力以赴
<19-11,Wilson>Oh, whatever it takes.

637
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,280
<19-11,Wilson>谢谢你  豪斯
<19-11,Wilson>Thanks, house.

638
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,320
<19-11,Wilson>我还真是没想到啊
<19-11,Wilson>I hadn't thought of that.

639
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,610
<20-1,Foreman>你在检测什么
<20-1,Foreman>What are you testing for?

640
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,850
<20-2,Park>血铁质
<20-2,Park>Hemosiderosis.

641
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,600
<20-2,Park>我在为过量的铁质染色
<20-2,Park>I'm staining for excess iron.

642
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,650
<20-3,Foreman>老实回答我
<20-3,Foreman>Promising.

643
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,990
<20-3,Foreman>你父亲的意外出现
<20-3,Foreman>When your dad showed up unexpectedly,

644
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,580
<20-3,Foreman>豪斯插手了吗
<20-3,Foreman>House have a hand in that?

645
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,430
<20-4,Park>我猜他肯定经常多管闲事
<20-4,Park>I'm guessing he does things like that a lot.

646
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,000
<20-5,Foreman>他喜欢别人就这样
<20-5,Foreman>His version of a compliment.

647
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,130
<20-5,Foreman>我跟芝加哥神经学权威谈过
<20-5,Foreman>I spoke to the head of neurology in Chicago.

648
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,890
<20-5,Foreman>给你做了个很好的推荐
<20-5,Foreman>I gave you a good recommendation.

649
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,450
<20-6,Park>你提到发生过什么了吗
<20-6,Park>Did you mention what happened?

650
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,310
<20-7,Foreman>律师不允许我说
<20-7,Foreman>Lawyers say I'm not allowed to.

651
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,560
<20-7,Foreman>这结果对大家都好
<20-7,Foreman>It works out well for everyone.

652
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,970
<20-8,Park>这样对你有什么好处
<20-8,Park>Why exactly is that good for you?

653
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,090
<20-9,Foreman>你说什么
<20-9,Foreman>Excuse me?

654
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,950
<20-10,Park>我是个天才内科医生  在我们班名列前茅
<20-10,Park>I'm a talented physician, top 2% of my class.

655
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,550
<20-10,Park>是这家医院的有利资产
<20-10,Park>I'm an asset to this hospital,

656
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,080
<20-10,Park>而你却想放弃我  让我去芝加哥
<20-10,Park>an asset you're about to lose to Chicago.

657
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,620
<20-11,Foreman>是你申请了那份工作
<20-11,Foreman>You applied for the job.

658
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,540
<20-11,Foreman>你请我打电话去推荐的你
<20-11,Foreman>You asked me to call and recommend you.

659
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,910
<20-12,Park>应该是安德鲁斯离开医院才对
<20-12,Park>Andrews is the one that should leave.

660
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,160
<20-12,Park>他是导师
<20-12,Park>He's the supervisor.

661
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,660
<20-12,Park>是他摸我在先
<20-12,Park>He touched me first.

662
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,880
<20-13,Foreman>在听证会前
<20-13,Foreman>I can't discuss any of that,

663
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,010
<20-13,Foreman>我无法参与讨论
<20-13,Foreman>not before the hearing.

664
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,870
<20-13,Foreman>但如果你对芝加哥有疑问
<20-13,Foreman>But if you're having doubts about Chicago,

665
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,230
<20-13,Foreman>我可以再给他们打电话
<20-13,Foreman>I can call them back.

666
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,860
<20-14,Park>不用了  谢谢你
<20-14,Park>No. Thank you.

667
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,430
<20-15,Park>福曼医生
<20-15,Park>Dr. Foreman?

668
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,320
<20-15,Park>能来看看这个吗
<20-15,Park>Would you look at this?

669
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,690
<20-16,Foreman>铁质
<20-16,Foreman>Iron?

670
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,550
<20-16,Foreman>不是
<20-16,Foreman>No.

671
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,930
<20-17,Park>白细胞
<20-17,Park>White blood cells.

672
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,010
<20-18,Foreman>是感染的典型症状
<20-18,Foreman>Classic presentation of infection.

673
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,940
<20-19,Park>我们怎么会遗漏了这个
<20-19,Park>How the hell did we miss that?

674
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,740
<21-1,Park>活检显示白细胞被浸润
<21-1,Park>Biopsy revealed white blood cell infiltrates.

675
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,690
<21-2,House>原来是感染
<21-2,House>Infection was right after all.

676
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,950
<21-3,House>在监狱里  新鲜水果简直是珍馐
<21-3,House>Fresh fruit in prison is usually chicken.

677
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,240
<21-4,Park>你怎么一点儿也不担心
<21-4,Park>Why aren't you more alarmed?

678
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,540
<21-4,Park>我们没时间了
<21-4,Park>We're running out of time.

679
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,260
<21-5,House>她要死了
<21-5,House>Aahh, she's dying!

680
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,830
<21-5,House>我大叫那会你有没有想明白
<21-5,House>Were you able to figure out what was wrong

681
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,900
<21-5,House>是哪里出了问题
<21-5,House>while I was screaming?

682
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,210
<21-6,Park>感染通常是移植手术
<21-6,Park>Infection was the first thing

683
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,920
<21-6,Park>首要处理的问题
<21-6,Park>that the transplant team treated for.

684
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,900
<21-7,House>如果细菌在脏器外露时显现
<21-7,House>Which would have worked

685
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,610
<21-7,House>治疗就会起作用
<21-7,House>if the bacteria had been out in the open.

686
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,660
<21-7,House>如果他们藏在肺细胞里面呢
<21-7,House>If they're hiding inside the lung cells...

687
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,700
<21-7,House>我在想布鲁氏菌
<21-7,House>I'm thinking brucella.

688
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,220
<21-7,House>而要排除它的话  你需要特别操作
<21-7,House>And to wipe that out, you need special ops.

689
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,400
<21-7,House>一套完好的免疫系统
<21-7,House>An intact immune system.

690
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,720
<21-8,Park>但白细胞不就是吗
<21-8,Park>But that's what white blood cells are.

691
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,940
<21-9,House>它们是免疫系统的一部分
<21-9,House>They're part of the immune defense force,

692
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,230
<21-9,House>就像步兵团
<21-9,House>like the infantry.

693
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,550
<21-9,House>但那对肺需要空军和海军陆战队
<21-9,House>But those lungs need the air force and the marines,

694
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,220
<21-9,House>需要抗体如注
<21-9,House>antibodies raining down from above.

695
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,590
<21-10,House>抗生素和免疫球蛋白
<21-10,House>Antibiotics and IVIG.

696
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,510
<21-11,Park>你对你以前的团队也用隐喻吗
<21-11,Park>Did you use metaphors for your old team?

697
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,220
<21-11,Park>还是你觉得我尤其白痴
<21-11,Park>Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?

698
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,820
<21-12,House>不  他们也都很白痴
<21-12,House>No, they were stupid too.

699
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,710
<22-1,Theresa>你在这干什么
<22-1,Theresa>What are you doing here?

700
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,450
<22-2,Bobby>我来找温妮莎
<22-2,Bobby>I'm here for Vanessa.

701
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,410
<22-3,Theresa>现在不是时候  鲍比
<22-3,Theresa>Now is not the time, Bobby.

702
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,180
<22-4,Bobby>是她让我来的
<22-4,Bobby>She asked me to come.

703
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,390
<22-4,Bobby>不是吗  医生
<22-4,Bobby>Right, Doc?

704
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,600
<22-5,Wilson>实际上  是我的主意
<22-5,Wilson>Actually, it was my idea.

705
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,800
<22-6,Theresa>什么  你在想什么啊
<22-6,Theresa>What? What were you thinking?

706
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,090
<22-6,Theresa>她不想见他
<22-6,Theresa>She doesn't want to see him.

707
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,910
<22-7,Wilson>温妮莎准备放弃化疗时
<22-7,Wilson>When Vanessa was ready to quit chemo,

708
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,720
<22-7,Wilson>鲍比是唯一能让她
<22-7,Wilson>Bobby's the one

709
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,960
<22-7,Wilson>再坚持下去的人
<22-7,Wilson>who got her to do one more round.

710
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,570
<22-8,Theresa>没错  然后再让她酗酒
<22-8,Theresa>Yeah, and then he got her drunk.

711
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,490
<22-8,Theresa>至少告诉我你今天没喝酒
<22-8,Theresa>At least tell me you haven't been drinking today.

712
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,490
<22-9,Bobby>我该走了
<22-9,Bobby>I should go.

713
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,080
<22-10,Vanessa>真好真好  大伙都聚齐了呀
<22-10,Vanessa>Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

714
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,550
<22-11,Bobby>美人
<22-11,Bobby>Hey, beautiful.

715
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,310
<23-1,House>病例尽在掌控
<23-1,House>Case is under control.

716
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,210
<23-1,House>现在是我的个人时间
<23-1,House>It's me time.

717
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,030
<23-2,Wilson>温妮莎同意做肺灌浆了
<23-2,Wilson>Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.

718
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,370
<23-2,Wilson>你推我一把是对的
<23-2,Wilson>You were right to push me.

719
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,630
<23-2,Wilson>我需要有人推一把  谢谢你
<23-2,Wilson>I needed that. Thank you.

720
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,270
<23-3,House>那你不生我气了
<23-3,House>So we're good?

721
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,100
<23-4,Wilson>你的建议很好
<23-4,Wilson>It was good advice.

722
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,320
<23-4,Wilson>我只是过来谢你
<23-4,Wilson>Just came here to say thank you.

723
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,290
<23-4,Wilson>我喜欢你这个人
<23-4,Wilson>I like you.

724
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,190
<23-5,House>跟你做朋友很开心
<23-5,House>I have fun with you.

725
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,500
<23-5,House>如果你能诚实地说
<23-5,House>And, if you can honestly say

726
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,680
<23-5,House>你不喜欢我这个人
<23-5,House>that you don't like me,

727
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,910
<23-5,House>跟我做朋友不开心
<23-5,House>you don't have fun with me,

728
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,470
<23-5,House>我可以接受
<23-5,House>I can accept that.

729
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,280
<23-5,House>我们快把这页揭过去
<23-5,House>But just do whatever you have to do

730
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,190
<23-5,House>怎么样随你
<23-5,House>to get over this.

731
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,730
<23-5,House>照我脸上来一拳
<23-5,House>You can punch me in the face,

732
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,850
<23-5,House>裆下踢一脚都行

<23-5,House>二选一
<23-5,House>Either/or.

<23-6,Wilson>我不喜欢你这个人
<23-6,Wilson>I don't like you.

737
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,870
<24-1,House>什么时候开始变色的
<24-1,House>When did the discoloration start?

738
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,690
<24-2,Park>静脉注射免疫球蛋白后几分钟
<24-2,Park>A few minutes after I started the IVIG.

739
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,630
<24-3,House>说明我们关于感染的判断是错误的
<24-3,House>Means we're wrong about infection.

740
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,830
<24-3,House>没有我们  只有你
<24-3,House>And by we, you mean you.

741
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,330
<24-4,House>这对肺被你毁了
<24-4,House>You screwed up the lungs.

742
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,650
<24-4,House>不是自身免疫  不是癌症
<24-4,House>Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer,

743
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,130
<24-4,House>不是重金属
<24-4,House>heavy metals,

744
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,150
<24-4,House>不是遗传问题
<24-4,House>genetic issues...

745
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,610
<24-4,House>-升高呼气末正压值  -已经是最大值了
<24-4,House>- Increase peep.  - Already maxed out.

746
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,310
<24-4,House>我们已经走到了悬崖边缘
<24-4,House>We're close to the point of no return.

747
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,410
<24-5,House>这对肺不可能用于移植了
<24-5,House>The lungs will never be viable for transplant.

748
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,720
<24-5,House>我需要
<24-5,House>I need...

749

<24-5,House>我需要想法

<24-6,Park>IgA肾病
<24-6,Park>IgA nephropathy.

751
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,460
<24-7,House>已经排除了
<24-7,House>That's already ruled out.

752
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,320
<24-8,House>-狼疮  -不是
<24-8,House>- Lupus. - No.

753
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
<24-9,Park>我们可能已经来不及了
<24-9,Park>Maybe we're just out of time.

754
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,740
<24-10,House>不到最后永远不会来不及
<24-10,House>We're out of time when we're out of time.

755
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,730
<24-10,House>除非肺死或者病人死
<24-10,House>When they die or she dies.

756
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,930
<24-10,House>尽量维持稳定
<24-10,House>Keep them stable as long as you can.

757
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,910
<24-10,House>我需要思考
<24-10,House>I need to think.

758

<25-1,Wilson>一  二
<25-1,Wilson>One, two...

759
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,080
<25-1,Wilson>三
<25-1,Wilson>Three...

760
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,710
<25-2,Everyone>许个愿  许个愿
<25-2,Everyone>Make a wish. Make a wish.

761
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,890
<25-2,Everyone>这对肺吸烟
<25-2,Everyone>The lungs are a smoker.

762
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,410
<26-1,House>别人不知道你总该清楚
<26-1,House>You of all people should know better.

763
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,000
<26-2,Park>那孩子从不吸烟
<26-2,Park>But the kid never smoked.

764
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,260
<26-3,House>他玩牌
<26-3,House>He played poker.

765
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,120
<26-3,House>哪有牌桌上没人抽雪茄的
<26-3,House>Who plays poker without cigars?

766
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,570
<26-3,House>他不抽别人总会抽
<26-3,House>Even if he didn't light up himself...

767
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,920
<26-3,House>那是个雨天
<26-3,House>It was a rainy night.

768
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,600
<26-3,House>窗户都关着
<26-3,House>The windows were closed.

769
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,420
<26-4,House>天下父母都觉得自己的孩子与众不同
<26-4,House>All parents think their kids are special.

770
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,880
<26-4,House>他的父母倒想对了
<26-4,House>And these ones were right.

771
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,800
<26-4,House>至少他的白细胞很特殊
<26-4,House>At least his white blood cells were special.

772
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
<26-4,House>遇烟发生反应  并且无法停止
<26-4,House>They had on on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off.

773
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,410
<26-4,House>他吸入少量烟  会出现小毛病
<26-4,House>When he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small problems.

774
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,440
<26-4,House>没人注意到过
<26-4,House>No one even noticed.

775
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,630
<26-4,House>吸入大量的烟
<26-4,House>Big amounts of smoke,

776
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,390
<26-4,House>就足以毁掉一页肺
<26-4,House>that's enough to trash a lung.

777
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,290
<26-4,House>他吸入那些雪茄烟气之后
<26-4,House>As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke,

778
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,600
<26-4,House>就已经必死无疑
<26-4,House>he was a dead man.

779
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,050
<26-4,House>摩托车祸不过是无意义的戏剧化花边
<26-4,House>The motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.

780
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,990
<26-5,Park>嗜酸细胞性肺炎
<26-5,Park>Eosiniphilic pneumonitis.

781
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,600
<26-5,Park>可是之前用的类固醇该能治好才对
<26-5,Park>But the steroids would have treated for that.

782
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,610
<26-5,Park>我之前的判断是对的
<26-5,Park>I was right.

783
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,360
<26-6,House>不是医学方面
<26-6,House>Not about anything medical,

784
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,990
<26-6,House>但我的比喻是完美的
<26-6,House>but my metaphors were perfect.

785
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,260
<26-6,House>我们需要更猛烈的打击
<26-6,House>We need to hit it harder.

786
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,200
<26-6,House>我们要地毯式轰炸  闪电战
<26-6,House>We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg.

787
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,820
<26-6,House>动用核武器
<26-6,House>We need the nuclear option.

788
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,180
<26-7,Park>你下面就要说必须用放疗了  是不是
<26-7,Park>At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?

789
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,950
<26-8,House>看吧  比喻还是有用的
<26-8,House>See, the metaphors work.

790
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,570
<26-9,Park>可那会损伤健康的肺组织
<26-9,Park>But that'll destroy the good lung too.

791
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,470
<26-9,Park>用强效混合免疫抑制剂会更好
<26-9,Park>Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.

792
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,390
<26-10,House>时间来不及
<26-10,House>Won't be fast enough.

<26-10,House>威尔森需要这对肺
<26-10,House>Wilson needs these lungs.

794

<27-1,Park>见效了
<27-1,Park>It's working.

795
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,540
<27-2,Park>他成功了
<27-2,Park>He did it.

796
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,870
<27-3,Park>我不去芝加哥了
<27-3,Park>I'm not going to Chicago.

797

<27-4,Foreman>你要留下来  就得举行听证会
<27-4,Foreman>If you stay, we have to have a hearing.

798
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,740
<27-5,Park>我知道
<27-5,Park>I know.

799

<29-1,Theresa>感谢上帝你找了他来
<29-1,Theresa>Thank God you called him.

804
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,940
<29-2,Theresa>不知今后会怎么样
<29-2,Theresa>I wonder what happens now.

805
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,750
<29-3,Wilson>她可以的
<29-3,Wilson>She can handle it.

806
