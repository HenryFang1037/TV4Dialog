1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,860
<12-5,Masters>有些事情*
<12-5,Masters>*There are things

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,880
<3-19,House>我曾做过*
<3-19,House>*I have done

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,560
<3-20,Carnell>有个地方*
<3-20,Carnell>*There's a place

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,000
<3-21,House>我曾到过*
<3-21,House>*I have gone

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,760
<23-4,House>有只猛兽*
<23-4,House>*There's a beast

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,610
<14-4,Taub>我曾放过*
<14-4,Taub>*And I let it run

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:31,240
<14-5,Chase>而今它正自由驰骋*
<14-5,Chase>*Now it's running my way

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,650
<12-5,Masters>有些事情*
<12-5,Masters>*There are things

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,120
<12-5,Masters>叫我追悔莫及*
<12-5,Masters>*I regret

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,680
<12-5,Masters>可你无法宽恕*
<12-5,Masters>*But you can't forgive

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,190
<12-5,Masters>无法忘怀*
<12-5,Masters>*You can't forget

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,810
<12-5,Masters>就让这黑夜*
<12-5,Masters>*So take this night

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
<12-5,Masters>缠绕我身旁*
<12-5,Masters>*Wrap it around me like a sheet

14
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,910
<12-5,Masters>我深知自己不可饶恕*
<12-5,Masters>*I know I'm not forgiven

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,840
<12-5,Masters>但我仍期许得到*
<12-5,Masters>*But I hope that I'll be given

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,910
<12-5,Masters>些许的安宁*
<12-5,Masters>*Some peace

17
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,450
<12-5,Masters>一秒  别现在就紧张
<12-5,Masters>One. Don't tense up now.

18
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,520
<12-5,Masters>随牛而动
<12-5,Masters>Go with him.

19
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,420
<12-5,Masters>两秒  就这样  保持节奏
<12-5,Masters>Two. That's it. Stay in rhythm.

20
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,520
<1-1,Lane>三秒  你在想什么  莱恩
<1-1,Lane>Three. What are you doing, Lane?

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
<1-2,Lane>这可是在骑牛啊
<1-2,Lane>You're tipping in.

22
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,340
<1-3,Lane>四秒  你在搞什么
<1-3,Lane>Four. What's your problem?

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,460
<1-4,Lane>坐好  坐回中间去
<1-4,Lane>Get your ass down. Get back in the middle.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,300
<2-1,Lane>五秒  你太弱了
<2-1,Lane>Five. You're weak.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,460
<2-1,Lane>一点太阳都没晒过吧
<2-1,Lane>You got all kinds of daylight under you.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,670
<2-2,Lane>六秒  该死  莱恩应该是你领着牛才对
<2-2,Lane>Six. Damn, Lane, you should be schooling this bull.

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,260
<2-3,Lane>七秒  起身  蹄子放下之前坐稳了
<2-3,Lane>Seven. Get up, set your hips before the kick comes down.

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,320
<2-4,Lane>漂亮的回转
<2-4,Lane>Nice recovery.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,740
<2-4,Lane>现在就等着直到他再回转躲开你的手
<2-4,Lane>Now just wait till he turns back away from your hand.

30
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,080
<2-6,Cowboy>莱恩
<2-6,Cowboy>Lane.

31
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,360
<2-7,Lane>刚刚究竟怎么了
<2-7,Lane>What the hell just happened?

32
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,150
<2-8,Cowboy>我还正要问你呢
<2-8,Cowboy>I was about to ask you the same thing.

50
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,800
<3-1,House>我没事
<3-1,House>I'm fine.

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,750
<3-2,Wilson>好的
<3-2,Wilson>Okay.

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,040
<3-3,House>我猜卡迪已经告诉你她把我蹬了
<3-3,House>I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me.

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,840
<3-4,Wilson>没错
<3-4,Wilson>She did.

54
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,460
<3-5,House>还有我又开始嗑维科丁了
<3-5,House>And that I'm back on Vicodin.

55
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,680
<3-6,Wilson>她告诉我你嗑了一片
<3-6,Wilson>She told me you had taken a Vicodin.

56
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,650
<3-7,House>接着我嗑了一堆
<3-7,House>And then I took a lot more.

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,130
<3-7,House>又一堆
<3-7,House>And so on.

58
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,870
<3-8,Wilson>但你却好得很
<3-8,Wilson>But you're fine?

59
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,700
<3-9,House>又不是"我很好"的那种好
<3-9,House>Well, I'm not fine as in "Fine,"

60
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,220
<3-9,House>而是"不用你操心我"的那种
<3-9,House>but I'm fine as in "You don't have to worry about me."

61
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,640
<3-10,Wilson>因为你把银行帐户取空
<3-10,Wilson>Because you cleared out your bank account,

62
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,210
<3-10,Wilson>跑来住酒店  还再次嗑药吗
<3-10,Wilson>checked into a hotel, and started back on Vicodin?

63
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,160
<3-11,House>是因为我很快就会好得不能再好了
<3-11,House>Because I'm going to be fine as in "Fine" very soon.

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,540
<3-12,Wilson>在那之前
<3-12,Wilson>Until that happens,

65
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,680
<3-12,Wilson>你确信维科丁是
<3-12,Wilson>are you sure Vicodin is the...

66
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,980
<3-13,House>我腿很疼
<3-13,House>My leg hurts.

67
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,100
<3-14,Wilson>你已经能应对腿疼了
<3-14,Wilson>You've been able to handle the pain.

68
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,380
<3-15,House>现在加重了
<3-15,House>It's gotten worse.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,510
<3-16,Wilson>是心理作用吧
<3-16,Wilson>Not physically worse.

70
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,990
<3-17,House>加重了就是加重了
<3-17,House>Worse is worse.

71
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,030
<3-17,House>疼又不能造假
<3-17,House>Pain doesn't discriminate.

72
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,490
<3-17,House>药也不是做假的
<3-17,House>Neither do the pills.

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,790
<3-17,House>接下来几天份量的维科丁
<3-17,House>The Vicodin and the five-star pampering

74
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,780
<3-17,House>加上五星级酒店的美食
<3-17,House>that I'm gonna get over the next few days

75
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,040
<3-17,House>应该足够我熬过这次疼痛
<3-17,House>should be enough to get me through it.

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,630
<3-18,Wilson>所以你并不是想逃避问题
<3-18,Wilson>So you don't want to just avoid the issue.

77
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,830
<3-18,Wilson>而是不敢面对你正在逃避问题  抱歉是我弄错
<3-18,Wilson>You want to avoid avoiding the issue. Sorry.

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,220
<3-19,House>事情总不如我们假设得那么糟
<3-19,House>Nothing is either as bad or as good

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,460
<3-19,House>也不及我们设想得那么好
<3-19,House>as we think it is at the time.

80
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,840
<3-19,House>这就是为什么T.O.总是在得分后立马
<3-19,House>That's why T.O. mocks his opponents immediately

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,910
<3-19,House>嘲笑他的对手
<3-19,House>after scoring.

83
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,940
<3-19,House>他是不会等到第二天他的朋友
<3-19,House>He doesn't wait till his friend shows up the next day

84
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,340
<3-19,House>给他示范该怎么做
<3-19,House>to tell him to deal with it.

85
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,520
<3-19,House>再过两周
<3-19,House>Two weeks from now,

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,280
<3-19,House>或许更久  或许短些
<3-19,House>maybe a little more, maybe a little less,

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,210
<3-19,House>我的生活就会像从前一样让人讨厌
<3-19,House>my life will be back to its usual level of crappiness.

88
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,560
<3-19,House>在那以前  唯一实际的问题就在于
<3-19,House>Till then, the only real issue

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
<3-19,House>我要在宾馆费用上花多少钱
<3-19,House>is how much I'm gonna spend on hotel charges.

90
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,690
<3-20,Carnell>早上好  先生
<3-20,Carnell>Good morning, sir.

91
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,010
<3-20,Carnell>为您奉上双人豪华早餐
<3-20,Carnell>I've got your deluxe breakfast for two.

92
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,050
<3-21,House>要不要我数数草莓少了没
<3-21,House>Do I have to count the strawberries?

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,300
<3-22,Carnell>别担心
<3-22,Carnell>Don't worry.

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,930
<3-22,Carnell>您大可完全相信我
<3-22,Carnell>You can trust me with anything.

95
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,480
<3-22,Carnell>包括您的饮食
<3-22,Carnell>Including your food.

96
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,170
<3-23,House>在我和他云雨之后
<3-23,House>After he and I have sex,

97
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,140
<3-23,House>我要撕开他的喉咙
<3-23,House>I'm gonna slit his throat

98
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,880
<3-23,House>然后在浴缸里给他开膛
<3-23,House>and then disembowel him in the bathtub.

99
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,570
<3-24,Carnell>没问题  我会取消晨间客房服务
<3-24,Carnell>Oh, no problem. I'll cancel the morning maid service.

100
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,680
<3-24,Carnell>需要我让她们稍后为您
<3-24,Carnell>Would you like me to have them clean up later

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,350
<3-24,Carnell>掀开床罩时[便于就寝]再做打扫吗
<3-24,Carnell>when they come to turn down your bed?

102
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,070
<3-25,House>为什么我六个月前没遇上你呢
<3-25,House>Why didn't I meet you six months ago?

103
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,800
<3-26,Carnell>非常感谢
<3-26,Carnell>Thank you very much.

104
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,180
<3-26,Carnell>您的舒心就是我们的目标
<3-26,Carnell>And if there's anything else I can do

105
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,590
<3-26,Carnell>如果您有任何需要
<3-26,Carnell>to make your stay here more enjoyable,

106
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,010
<3-26,Carnell>请致电总台找卡内尔
<3-26,Carnell>just ring the concierge and ask for Carnell.

107
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
<3-27,House>快点吃
<3-27,House>Eat fast.

108
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,970
<3-27,House>一会儿有服务哦
<3-27,House>We're expecting company.

109
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,660
<3-27,House>其实
<3-27,House>Okay.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,700
<4-1,Wilson>这主意也不算太糟
<4-1,Wilson>This might not be such a bad idea.

111
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,550
<4-2,House>你是怎么理解他说的  "任何需要"
<4-2,House>What do you think he meant by "Anything"?

112
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,750
<4-3,Wilson>给自己留点时间  放松放松
<4-3,Wilson>Take some time for yourself. Relax.

113
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,180
<4-4,House>我知道那只是个比喻
<4-4,House>I know it's a figure of speech,

114
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,140
<4-4,House>但他好像真的有在强调  "任何"
<4-4,House>but he really did seem to underline the "Anything."

115
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,540
<4-5,Wilson>找人聊聊吗
<4-5,Wilson>Maybe talk to someone?

116
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,300
<4-6,House>已经安排好了
<4-6,House>Already scheduled.

117
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,660
<4-7,Wilson>真的吗
<4-7,Wilson>Really?

118
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,170
<4-8,House>我又不傻
<4-8,House>I'm not an idiot.

119
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,720
<4-8,House>我知道我需要帮助
<4-8,House>I know I need help.

120
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,250
<4-8,House>好吧
<4-8,House>Okay.

121
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,760
<4-9,Wilson>那也  挺好
<4-9,Wilson>That's...great.

122
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,520
<4-9,Wilson>我指的是心理咨询师什么的
<4-9,Wilson>I meant, like, a counselor.

123
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,450
<4-10,House>我知道
<4-10,House>I know.

124
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,580
<4-11,Wilson>但你指的是小姐
<4-11,Wilson>But you meant a hooker.

125
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,640
<4-11,Wilson>没错
<4-11,Wilson>Yeah.

126
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,690
<4-12,House>慢慢来嘛
<4-12,House>Baby steps.

127
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,100
<5-1,Taub>豪斯抛弃我们了
<5-1,Taub>House screwed us.

128
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,220
<5-2,Chase>医生们花了十年时间
<5-2,Chase>Ten years of doctors

129
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,800
<5-2,Chase>把他重新拼接了一遍
<5-2,Chase>cobbling him back together.

130
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,890
<5-2,Chase>四肢里全是金属棒
<5-2,Chase>Metal rods in every limb.

131
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,700
<5-2,Chase>脊柱靠钢针固定
<5-2,Chase>Pins stabilizing his spine.

132
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,500
<5-2,Chase>颅骨里
<5-2,Chase>Five screws

133
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,860
<5-2,Chase>还有五颗钛钉和一块钛板
<5-2,Chase>and a titanium plate in his skull.

134
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,940
<5-3,Foreman>没法做核磁共振
<5-3,Foreman>Can't do MRIs.

135
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,320
<5-3,Foreman>X光可能也没什么用处
<5-3,Foreman>X-rays are probably gonna be useless as well.

136
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,360
<5-3,Foreman>每块金属都会阻挡射线显影
<5-3,Foreman>Every piece of metal is gonna obscure something.

137
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,090
<5-4,Taub>豪斯根本没病
<5-4,Taub>And House isn't sick.

138
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,010
<5-5,Masters>你为什么这么说
<5-5,Masters>Why would you say that?

139
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,010
<5-5,Masters>卡迪把豪斯甩了
<5-5,Masters>Cuddy dumped House.

140
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,560
<5-6,Taub>他丢下工作躲起来自己舔伤去了
<5-6,Taub>He's out somewhere expecting us to indulge him

141
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,800
<5-6,Taub>就盼着我们会惯着他
<5-6,Taub>while he ignores his job and licks his wounds.

142
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,010
<5-7,Masters>卡迪把他甩了吗
<5-7,Masters>Cuddy dumped him?

143
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,140
<5-8,Taub>别这样  你别搅进来
<5-8,Taub>Don't do that. Don't get sucked in.

144
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,470
<5-9,Masters>他爱她  怎么会
<5-9,Masters>He loves her. What?

145
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,420
<5-9,Masters>你都不会为他难过一小会儿吗
<5-9,Masters>You can't feel bad for him for five minutes?

146
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,630
<5-10,Taub>我为他感到难过  同时我也希望
<5-10,Taub>I can feel bad for him while still expecting him

147
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,380
<5-10,Taub>他能像个成年人  回来工作
<5-10,Taub>to act like an adult, show up for work,

148
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,610
<5-10,Taub>而不是跑去酗酒
<5-10,Taub>and not go on a booze-,

149
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,710
<5-10,Taub>嗑药  寻欢作乐
<5-10,Taub>Vicodin-, and hooker-filled bender.

150
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,560
<5-11,Foreman>以致我们现在
<5-11,Foreman>Which is why for now

151
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
<5-11,Foreman>要独立处理这件案子
<5-11,Foreman>we're gonna handle the case without him.

152
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,870
<5-12,Chase>原来是这么回事啊
<5-12,Chase>Oh, is that the reason?

153
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,320
<5-12,Chase>我还以为这都源于你不肯错过
<5-12,Chase>I thought it was because you can't pass up

154
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,400
<5-12,Chase>任何能掌控大局的机会呢
<5-12,Chase>any chance to seize control.

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,960
<5-13,Foreman>我说了"我们"  还想我"拜托了"吗
<5-13,Foreman>I said "We". You want "Pretty please" too?

156
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,250
<5-14,Masters>等等  酗酒招妓什么的我都能理解
<5-14,Masters>Wait. I understand the booze

157
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,040
<5-14,Masters>但维科丁怎么回事
<5-14,Masters>and the hookers, but why Vicodin?

158
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,320
<5-15,Chase>你在这里还真是什么朋友都没有啊
<5-15,Chase>Wow, you really don't have any friends in here, do you?

159
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,200
<5-16,Foreman>豪斯嗜维科丁成瘾
<5-16,Foreman>House is a Vicodin addict.

160
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,780
<5-16,Foreman>已经戒了两年了
<5-16,Foreman>He's been clean for two years.

161
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,880
<5-17,Masters>他工作的时候也吃吗
<5-17,Masters>He's used here at work?

162
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,640
<5-18,Foreman>没错  这事很麻烦
<5-18,Foreman>Yes, that is very troubling.

163
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,690
<5-18,Foreman>正如我们的病人
<5-18,Foreman>Almost as much as the fact

164
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,630
<5-18,Foreman>患有隔肌破裂
<5-18,Foreman>that our patient has a ruptured diaphragm,

165
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,840
<5-18,Foreman>胸骨骨折  鼻骨断裂
<5-18,Foreman>cracked sternum, broken nose,

166
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,130
<5-18,Foreman>以及部分听力丧失一样麻烦
<5-18,Foreman>and partial hearing loss,

167
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,850
<5-19,Masters>这些可能是由公牛在他身上踩踏所致
<5-19,Masters>which can be explained by a bull jumping on him.

168
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,440
<5-19,Masters>但脑神经功能障碍  低烧
<5-19,Masters>And a neurological disorder, low-grade fever,

169
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,610
<5-19,Masters>恶心  外周肌无力这些症状都无法解释
<5-19,Masters>nausea, and peripheral muscle weakness that can't.

170
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,820
<5-19,Masters>如果听力丧失不是公牛导致的呢
<5-19,Masters>What if the hearing loss wasn't caused by the bull?

171
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,240
<5-19,Masters>他只是刚好在那时发现这点
<5-19,Masters>That's just when he noticed it?

172
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,580
<5-19,Masters>内耳病变会影响平衡
<5-19,Masters>Inner-ear pathology can affect the equilibrium

173
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,100
<5-19,Masters>并引起定向障碍
<5-19,Masters>and cause disorientation,

174
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,510
<5-19,Masters>从而表现为脑神经功能障碍
<5-19,Masters>making it appear to be a neurological disorder.

175
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,990
<5-20,Taub>我们怎么确诊呢
<5-20,Taub>So how do we confirm?

176
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,280
<5-20,Taub>CT只会显示出板子和螺钉
<5-20,Taub>CT is just gonna show us the plate and screws

177
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,160
<5-20,Taub>支撑着的颅骨
<5-20,Taub>holding his skull together.

178
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,380
<5-21,Masters>我们可以做前庭眼反射和眼球震颤电流描记测试
<5-21,Masters>We can do calorics and an ENG.

179
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,400
<5-21,Masters>如果有内耳损伤
<5-21,Masters>If he has inner-ear damage,

180
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,880
<5-21,Masters>就会影响他的平衡
<5-21,Masters>it'll affect his balance.

181
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,900
<5-22,Foreman>听上去不错  去吧
<5-22,Foreman>Sounds good. Go ahead.

182
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,770
<5-23,Chase>去吧  不是吧
<5-23,Chase>Go ahead? Really?

183
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,690
<5-23,Chase>如果我们中有人不同意呢
<5-23,Chase>What if one of us disagrees?

184
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,160
<5-23,Chase>我恰巧同意福曼
<5-23,Chase>I happen to agree with Foreman.

185
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,440
<5-23,Chase>去做吧
<5-23,Chase>Go do it.

186
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,330
<6-1,Wilson>在确立关系之前你就知道他是个瘾君子
<6-1,Wilson>You knew he was an addict before you got involved.

187
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,160
<6-2,Cuddy>我们的关系并非因为
<6-2,Cuddy>Didn't end the relationship...

188
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,260
<6-3,Wilson>你也知道他是个混蛋
<6-3,Wilson>You knew he was an ass...

189
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,230
<6-4,Cuddy>我并非
<6-4,Cuddy>I didn't end it...

190
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,770
<6-5,Wilson>你告诉他你不想他有所改变
<6-5,Wilson>You told him you did not want him to change.

191
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,920
<6-6,Cuddy>我错了
<6-6,Cuddy>And I was wrong.

192
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,350
<6-7,Wilson>你怎么能确定
<6-7,Wilson>You don't know that.

193
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,570
<6-7,Wilson>你以为你要死了
<6-7,Wilson>You thought you were gonna die.

194
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,990
<6-7,Wilson>你真觉得那种时候
<6-7,Wilson>Do you really think that was the right time

195
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,590
<6-7,Wilson>适合作出这种决定吗
<6-7,Wilson>to make this kind of decision?

196
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,520
<6-7,Wilson>不
<6-7,Wilson>No.

197
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,430
<6-8,Cuddy>但我想过了
<6-8,Cuddy>But I've thought about it.

198
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,800
<6-8,Cuddy>想了很多
<6-8,Cuddy>A lot.

199
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,180
<6-8,Cuddy>我也没要改变主意
<6-8,Cuddy>And I haven't changed my mind.

200
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,470
<6-9,Wilson>他以为你要死了
<6-9,Wilson>He thought you were gonna die.

201
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,810
<6-9,Wilson>那种情况下是人都会无所适从
<6-9,Wilson>Nobody knows the right way to react in that situation.

202
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
<6-9,Wilson>再给他一次机会吧
<6-9,Wilson>Just give him another chance.

203
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,160
<6-9,Wilson>他应得的
<6-9,Wilson>He deserves it.

204
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,510
<6-9,Wilson>我明白
<6-9,Wilson>I know.

205
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,990
<6-10,Cuddy>但这不是他应不应得的问题
<6-10,Cuddy>But this isn't about what he deserves.

206
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,230
<6-10,Cuddy>当不好的事情发生时
<6-10,Cuddy>When things go wrong,

207
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,420
<6-10,Cuddy>我不想只是希望我不是独自一人
<6-10,Cuddy>I don't want to hope that I'm not alone.

208
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,760
<6-10,Cuddy>我需要知道我并不孤单
<6-10,Cuddy>I want to know it.

209
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,710
<6-10,Cuddy>和豪斯在一起
<6-10,Cuddy>With House...

210
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,010
<6-10,Cuddy>每当我需要他站出来时
<6-10,Cuddy>Every time I needed him to step up...

211
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,250
<6-10,Cuddy>他就是做不到
<6-10,Cuddy>He's just never gonna be that.

212
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,380
<6-10,Cuddy>这不是他的错  他就是这样的人
<6-10,Cuddy>It's not his fault. It's who he is.

213
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,580
<6-10,Cuddy>我早该知道的
<6-10,Cuddy>I should have known it.

214
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,940
<6-10,Cuddy>这是我的错
<6-10,Cuddy>This is my fault.

215
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,130
<6-11,Wilson>他又开始吃维科丁了
<6-11,Wilson>Well, he's back on Vicodin.

216
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,360
<6-11,Wilson>你也许会想要
<6-11,Wilson>So you might want to...

217
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,990
<6-11,Wilson>注意下他的新病人
<6-11,Wilson>keep an eye on his new patient.

218
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,060
<7-1,Foreman>眼球震颤电流描记测试正常
<7-1,Foreman>ENG was normal.

219
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,050
<7-1,Foreman>就是说他的内耳没有...
<7-1,Foreman>Means his inner ear isn't...

220
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,330
<7-2,House>白痴们
<7-2,House>Morons.

221
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,140
<7-3,Masters>-不是...  -等等
<7-3,Masters>- It wasn't... - Whoa. Wait a second.

222
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,950
<7-1,Foreman>这里的音效太美妙了
<7-1,Foreman>The acoustics in here are beautiful.

223
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,640
<7-2,House>白痴们
<7-2,House>Morons!

224
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,480
<7-2,House>你说一次
<7-2,House>You say it.

225
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,720
<7-2,House>白痴们
<7-2,House>Morons.

226
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,540
<8-2,Taub>那是谁
<8-2,Taub>Who was that?

227
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,030
<8-3,House>卡内尔给我找的
<8-3,House>Something Carnell got me.

228
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,480
<8-4,Masters>那理论并非无稽之谈
<8-4,Masters>It wasn't that ridiculous of a theory.

229
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,270
<8-5,House>理论很棒
<8-5,House>Great theory.

230
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,780
<8-5,House>但测试方法太荒谬了
<8-5,House>It's a ridiculous test.

231
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,090
<8-5,House>你怎么能给骑牛冠军
<8-5,House>You can't give a standard balance test

232
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,790
<8-5,House>进行标准的平衡测试
<8-5,House>to a champion bull rider.

233
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,800
<8-5,House>如果你想测试超人的力量
<8-5,House>If you're gonna test Superman's strength,

234
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,050
<8-5,House>你就需要一个更大的杠铃
<8-5,House>you need a bigger barbell.

235
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,520
<8-5,House>找个方法  给他测下
<8-5,House>Find one, make him lift it,

236
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,410
<8-5,House>然后打电话告诉我结果如何
<8-5,House>then call me and tell me how high it got.

237
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,410
<8-5,House>告诉卡迪偷听是懦夫的表现
<8-5,House>And tell Cuddy that spying is for cowards.

238
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,400
<9-1,Cuddy>随时报告我进展
<9-1,Cuddy>Just keep me posted.

239
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,490
<9-1,Cuddy>-会的  -会的
<9-1,Cuddy>- I will. - I will.

240
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,460
<9-1,Cuddy>你说过我的内耳没问题
<9-1,Cuddy>You said my inner ear was fine.

241
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,370
<10-1,Lane>先前的测试是为普通人准备的
<10-1,Lane>Previous test was for regular people.

242
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,110
<10-2,Taub>上次意外中你受伤严重
<10-2,Taub>You were banged up pretty bad in the accident.

243
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,620
<10-2,Taub>但考虑到你的运动能力
<10-2,Taub>But given your athletic ability...

244
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,610
<10-3,Lane>不是意外
<10-3,Lane>Wasn't no accident.

245
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,610
<10-3,Lane>那头牛是故意的  有阴谋的
<10-3,Lane>That bull had malice and forethought.

246
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,640
<10-4,Masters>你的意思是有预谋的
<10-4,Masters>Uh, you mean aforethought.

247
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,470
<10-5,Lane>随便吧  他被惹毛了
<10-5,Lane>Whatever. He was pissed.

248
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,540
<10-6,Taub>你怪他吗
<10-6,Taub>Can you blame him?

249
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,630
<10-7,Lane>当然不
<10-7,Lane>Not at all.

250
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,210
<10-7,Lane>如果他吃粮不干活
<10-7,Lane>If he don't do what he gets paid for,

251
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,820
<10-7,Lane>我就没活干拿不了钱
<10-7,Lane>I don't get to do what I get paid for.

252
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,680
<10-8,Taub>你就没想过
<10-8,Taub>You ever think of getting paid

253
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,900
<10-8,Taub>要干点别的吗
<10-8,Taub>for doing something else?

254
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,420
<10-8,Taub>你已经快没骨头可断了
<10-8,Taub>You're running out of bones to break.

255
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,270
<10-8,Taub>你会考虑做你不喜欢的事吗
<10-8,Taub>You ever think of doing something you don't love?

256
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,920
<10-9,Lane>骑牛虽然有不好的一面
<10-9,Lane>It has its downside,

257
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,210
<10-9,Lane>但哪件事不这样啊
<10-9,Lane>but everything does.

258
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,460
<10-9,Lane>没什么能比得上那八秒钟
<10-9,Lane>There ain't nothing like those eight seconds.

259
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,390
<10-9,Lane>旅行啦  和粉丝见面啦
<10-9,Lane>Traveling around, getting to meet the fans,

260
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,430
<10-9,Lane>那也很不错  如果你明白我的意思的话
<10-9,Lane>that ain't so bad either, if you know what I mean.

261
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,990
<10-9,Lane>好了  现在要做什么
<10-9,Lane>All right, now what?

262
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,860
<10-10,Foreman>我们会摇晃这个台子
<10-10,Foreman>We're gonna start rocking the platform

263
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,720
<10-10,Foreman>并且改变你的视野
<10-10,Foreman>and changing your visual field

264
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
<10-10,Foreman>你只能用右脚来保持平衡
<10-10,Foreman>while you balance on just your right leg.

265
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,180
<10-11,Masters>给  莱恩
<10-11,Masters>Here you go, Lane.

266
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,210
<10-11,Masters>我会从低速开始的
<10-11,Masters>I'm gonna start slow.

267
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,680
<10-12,Foreman>如果你感觉到
<10-12,Foreman>If you start to experience

268
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,320
<10-12,Foreman>恶心或者定向障碍
<10-12,Foreman>any nausea or disorientation,

269
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
<10-12,Foreman>告诉我们  我们就停止测试
<10-12,Foreman>just let us know and we'll stop the test.

270
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,100
<10-13,Lane>明白
<10-13,Lane>You got it.

271
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,130
<10-14,Masters>这太棒了
<10-14,Masters>That is amazing.

272
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,120
<10-15,Taub>我们可以停了
<10-15,Taub>We can stop.

273
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,480
<10-15,Taub>很明显他的内耳
<10-15,Taub>There's obviously nothing wrong

274
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,590
<10-15,Taub>没有任何问题
<10-15,Taub>with his inner ear.

275
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,800
<10-15,Taub>现在呢
<10-15,Taub>Now what?

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,030
<10-15,Taub>我并非在问我的老板
<10-15,Taub>And I direct that question not to my boss,

277
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,800
<10-15,Taub>而是在问任何知道答案的人
<10-15,Taub>but to anyone who has an answer.

278
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,230
<10-16,Foreman>如果问题不在他耳朵里  那就是他脑子
<10-16,Foreman>If it's not in his ear, it's got to be his brain.

279
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,300
<10-17,Masters>但如果我们没办法成像  我们怎么
<10-17,Masters>But if we can't get any images, then how do we...

280
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
<10-18,Lane>看来你们这里的水管生锈了
<10-18,Lane>Looks like you guys got some rusty pipes.

281
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,670
<10-18,Lane>这水是棕色的
<10-18,Lane>This water's brown.

282
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,410
<10-19,Foreman>不是水管的问题
<10-19,Foreman>That's not from the pipes.

283
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,280
<10-19,Foreman>是你的嘴
<10-19,Foreman>It's from your mouth.

284
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,950
<11-1,House>能递给我
<11-1,House>Can you pass me the, um...

285
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,050
<11-2,House>怎么花了这么久
<11-2,House>What took you so long?

286
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,480
<11-3,Foreman>他的耳朵没问题
<11-3,Foreman>There's nothing wrong with his ears,

287
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,030
<11-3,Foreman>但他的痰中带血
<11-3,Foreman>but he's got blood in his sputum.

288
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,690
<11-4,House>你没回答我的问题
<11-4,House>Doesn't answer the question.

289
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,520
<11-5,Foreman>我们不是为了避开你
<11-5,Foreman>We weren't avoiding you.

290
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,940
<11-5,Foreman>我们花了一点时间来想
<11-5,Foreman>It took us a little time to think up

291
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,500
<11-5,Foreman>一种没人曾考虑过的诊断测试办法
<11-5,Foreman>a diagnostic test no one's ever thought up before.

292
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,620
<11-6,House>我接受你们的道歉
<11-6,House>Apology accepted.

293
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,700
<11-7,Chase>可能是唾液腺里的肿瘤引起的
<11-7,Chase>It could be a tumor in a salivary gland.

294
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,080
<11-7,Chase>我们应该做个腮腺活检
<11-7,Chase>We should get a parotid biopsy.

295
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,860
<11-8,House>你好有爱啊
<11-8,House>Oh, that's so cute.

296
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,010
<11-8,House>你竟然在反抗代班当值的头头
<11-8,House>You're fighting over who's in charge.

297
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,930
<11-9,Taub>消化道出血更能解释
<11-9,Taub>GI bleed's more likely

298
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,810
<11-9,Taub>恶心想吐及身体虚弱
<11-9,Taub>to explain the nausea and weakness.

299
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,050
<11-10,House>现在谁当家
<11-10,House>Who's in charge?

300
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,490
<11-11,Foreman>豪斯  只要你不在这里
<11-11,Foreman>House, as long as you're not here,

301
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,460
<11-11,Foreman>就得有人做最后的
<11-11,Foreman>someone has to have the final...

302
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,640
<11-12,House>那我换个表达方式吧
<11-12,House>Let me rephrase.

303
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,450
<11-12,House>现在谁是你们大爷
<11-12,House>Who's your daddy?

304
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,500
<11-12,House>不如我换个说法吧
<11-12,House>Let me rephrase.

305
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,320
<11-13,Taub>你最好下定决心
<11-13,Taub>You have to decide

306
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
<11-13,Taub>是要振作起来  浪子回头
<11-13,Taub>if you're gonna buck up, get out of bed,

307
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,650
<11-13,Taub>继续工作
<11-13,Taub>and do your job,

308
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,570
<11-13,Taub>还是要沉湎于顾影自怜
<11-13,Taub>or if you're gonna wallow in self-pity.

309
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,940
<11-14,House>我只有这两个选择吗
<11-14,House>Those my only two choices?

310
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,090
<11-14,House>能容我指出顾影自怜的是你吗
<11-14,House>Or can I also point out the self-pity coming from you?

311
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,920
<11-14,House>你不就因为
<11-14,House>You're just annoyed

312
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,580
<11-14,House>自己的婚姻完蛋时无人问津
<11-14,House>because when your relationship ended,

313
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,300
<11-14,House>连你自己都不在乎而恼火吗
<11-14,House>no one gave a crap, including you.

314
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,550
<11-15,Taub>你这话怎么说都不对
<11-15,Taub>That is not true in so many ways.

315
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,880
<11-16,House>奇斯  别再跟福曼抬杠了
<11-16,House>And, Chase, stop screwing with Foreman.

316
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,300
<11-16,House>福曼  你错
<11-16,House>And, Foreman, no.

317
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,120
<11-16,House>除非等到电话遭逆转发明而消失
<11-16,House>Till the telephone gets uninvented,

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,800
<11-16,House>你们屋里这群人
<11-16,House>no one in that room

319
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,270
<11-16,House>就只有我赋予的权利
<11-16,House>needs more authority than I give them,

320
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,840
<11-16,House>而我现在就赐予你为病人
<11-16,House>and right now I give you the authority

321
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,820
<11-16,House>做消化道内镜检查和腮腺活检的权力
<11-16,House>to scope his GI tract and biopsy his parotid.

322
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,080
<11-16,House>你可以拿起听筒了
<11-16,House>And you can pick up the phone.

323
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,430
<11-17,Masters>等等  豪斯  我们是不是该更担心你一些
<11-17,Masters>Wait, House, should we be more worried about you?

324
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,810
<11-17,Masters>你在服用维科丁吗  如果是这样
<11-17,Masters>Are you on Vicodin? Because if you are,

325
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,420
<11-17,Masters>也许你就不该发号施令了
<11-17,Masters>you probably shouldn't be ordering procedures.

326
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,090
<11-18,House>我没吃维科丁
<11-18,House>I am not on Vicodin.

327
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
<11-18,House>做检查去
<11-18,House>Do the tests.

328
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,360
<11-18,House>我和手摇风琴先生还有个约
<11-18,House>I have to see a man about a hurdy-gurdy.

330
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,980
<12-1,Masters>你真的相信豪斯没嗑维科丁吗
<12-1,Masters>You really think House isn't using Vicodin?

331
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,030
<12-2,Taub>这事真的有让你担心吗
<12-2,Taub>Does it actually worry you?

332
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,150
<12-3,Masters>要是他在给自己开药
<12-3,Masters>If he's self-prescribing meds,

333
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,470
<12-3,Masters>可能会影响他的判断力
<12-3,Masters>that could affect his judgment.

334
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,820
<12-4,Taub>所以这让你担心了吗
<12-4,Taub>And does that worry you?

335
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,710
<12-5,Masters>你是在挖苦我吗
<12-5,Masters>Are you being sarcastic?

336
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,300
<12-6,Taub>他这不合规矩的做法影响到他的判断力
<12-6,Taub>If his rule-breaking is affecting his judgment,

337
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,020
<12-6,Taub>那你就可以正当插手  担你的心去
<12-6,Taub>then you can step in and you can worry,

338
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,140
<12-6,Taub>可如果这让他不断迸发出
<12-6,Taub>but if he's just coming up with ideas

339
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,470
<12-6,Taub>该我们想到却没想到的点子
<12-6,Taub>that we haven't thought of but we should have,

340
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,710
<12-6,Taub>那我们就只要闭嘴照做便是
<12-6,Taub>then our job is to shut up and do it.

341
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,410
<12-6,Taub>还有你看上这家伙哪点了
<12-6,Taub>And what do you see in this guy?

342
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,540
<12-7,Masters>什么  你说谁
<12-7,Masters>Hmm? What? Who?

343
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,610
<12-7,Masters>你觉得我对我们的病人有好感
<12-7,Masters>Oh. You think I'm attracted to our patient?

344
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,460
<12-7,Masters>没错
<12-7,Masters>Right.

345
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,340
<12-8,Taub>这不符合规定
<12-8,Taub>It's against the rules,

346
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,730
<12-8,Taub>所以你肯定不会采取行动的
<12-8,Taub>so you wouldn't do it.

347
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,040
<12-9,Masters>他是个有男子气概的傻瓜
<12-9,Masters>He's a macho half-wit.

348
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,700
<12-10,Taub>你没有任何理由喜欢上这样的人
<12-10,Taub>You have every reason to not be attracted to him,

349
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,500
<12-10,Taub>所以我才好奇
<12-10,Taub>which is why I ask the question.

350
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,560
<12-10,Taub>你怎么就看上他了
<12-10,Taub>Why are you attracted to him?

351
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,570
<12-11,Masters>-停  -我只是
<12-11,Masters>- Stop it. - I'm just...

352
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,460
<12-11,Masters>-不不不  拿出视镜  -但我没看到
<12-11,Masters>- No, no, no. Take out the scope. - But I don't see...

353
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,300
<12-11,Masters>不是显示器  看他的眼睛
<12-11,Masters>Not the monitor. Look at his eyes.

354
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,090
<13-1,Foreman>巩膜呈黄色  已做X光检查
<13-1,Foreman>Sclerae turned yellow. Did X-rays.

355
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,810
<13-1,Foreman>看上去他肝脏里有个团块
<13-1,Foreman>Looks like there's a mass in his liver,

356
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,290
<13-1,Foreman>但被他固定肋骨的金属棒挡住了
<13-1,Foreman>but the conductive metal rod in his ribs is blocking it.

357
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,280
<13-2,House>努力去实现吧  如他们所言
<13-2,House>Making it, as they say,

358
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,180
<13-2,House>哪怕这与叫会手摇风琴的妓女一样难
<13-2,House>as tough to find as a hooker who can play the hurdy-gurdy.

359
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,460
<13-3,Foreman>如果你有什么想法  麻烦你
<13-3,Foreman>If you have a point, can you please...

360
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,690
<13-4,House>打个比方而已
<13-4,House>It's an expression.

361
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,210
<13-4,House>意思是说虽然那不容易
<13-4,House>Means it's tough,

362
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,120
<13-4,House>但明显依旧可行
<13-4,House>but apparently it can be done.

363
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,470
<13-5,Chase>如果我们没有任何设备
<13-5,Chase>If we don't have any equipment...

364
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,630
<13-6,House>你们有双眼
<13-6,House>You have eyes.

365
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,170
<13-7,Taub>可不是透视眼
<13-7,Taub>Not that see through stuff.

366
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,660
<13-8,House>显然不是
<13-8,House>Obviously.

367
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,680
<13-9,Masters>你想要我们把他切开吗
<13-9,Masters>You want us to cut him open?

368
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,120
<13-10,House>只有你们想弄明白
<13-10,House>Only if you want to see

369
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
<13-10,House>他哪里出了问题才需要
<13-10,House>what's wrong with him.

370
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,430
<13-10,House>听过《自由鸟》吗
<13-10,House>Do you know Free Bird?

372
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,710
<14-1,Chase>你看到了吗
<14-1,Chase>Do you see what I see?

373
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,990
<14-2,Taub>没看到
<14-2,Taub>No.

374
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,670
<14-3,Chase>一点没错
<14-3,Chase>Exactly.

375
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,600
<14-4,Taub>再吸一点
<14-4,Taub>More suction.

376
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,900
<14-4,Taub>这怎么可能
<14-4,Taub>That's impossible.

377
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,660
<14-4,Taub>我肯定在X光片上看到团块了
<14-4,Taub>I definitely saw a mass on the X-rays.

378
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,800
<14-5,Chase>现在没了
<14-5,Chase>It's gone now.

379
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,610
<14-5,Chase>这是个团块
<14-5,Chase>It's a mass...

380
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,000
<15-1,House>接着就消失了
<15-1,House>And then it's not.

381
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,550
<15-2,Chase>你要不要  介绍一下我们
<15-2,Chase>You, uh, gonna introduce us?

382
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,670
<15-3,House>小组成员  见过杜可
<15-3,House>Team, meet Duke.

383
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,690
<15-4,Anke>是安卡
<15-4,Anke>Anke.

384
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,900
<15-5,House>是安卡吗  我怎么会想成杜可的
<15-5,House>Anke? How'd I get Duke?

385
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,630
<15-6,Masters>豪斯  你叫了多少鸡
<15-6,Masters>House, how many prostitutes have you had?

386
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,180
<15-7,House>是说吃的鸡吗
<15-7,House>As in eaten?

387
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,960
<15-7,House>这辈子吃的  还是就今年吃的
<15-7,House>Ever? This year?

388
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,680
<15-8,Masters>睡过的  从你住进来以后
<15-8,Masters>Slept with. Since you've been here.

389
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,900
<15-9,House>就一人幸免
<15-9,House>All but one.

390
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,490
<15-9,House>她帮我报税来着
<15-9,House>She did my taxes.

391
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,590
<15-9,House>另一方面
<15-9,House>On the other hand,

392
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
<15-9,House>已经钻出他小肠的绦虫
<15-9,House>tapeworm that burrowed outside his intestinal...

393
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,760
<15-10,Taub>我们会在粪便涂片中找到虫卵
<15-10,Taub>We would have seen eggs on a fecal smear

394
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,590
<15-10,Taub>或发现系统性嗜酸性粒细胞增多
<15-10,Taub>or systemic eosinophilia.

395
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,380
<15-11,House>脱落的囊肿呢
<15-11,House>Detached cyst?

396
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,520
<15-12,Foreman>不可能在一小时之内移位那么远
<15-12,Foreman>Couldn't migrate that far in one hour.

397
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,990
<15-12,Foreman>我们又不是无所事事
<15-12,Foreman>We haven't been sitting on our hands

398
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,940
<15-12,Foreman>坐等你的灵感迸发
<15-12,Foreman>just waiting for your brilliance to kick in.

399
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,690
<15-13,House>好吧  那你们是怎么排除
<15-13,House>Okay, so how did you shoot down

400
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,870
<15-13,House>间歇性肿大的淋巴结的呢
<15-13,House>intermittently swollen lymph node?

401
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,960
<15-14,Masters>那就是说这是感染造成的
<15-14,Masters>That would mean it's some kind of an infection,

402
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,870
<15-14,Masters>我们要做腰椎穿刺
<15-14,Masters>which would mean we'd have to do a spinal tap.

403
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,470
<15-14,Masters>可鉴于他目前颅骨骨折
<15-14,Masters>But with his recent skull fractures,

404
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,120
<15-14,Masters>可能会导致颅内压增高
<15-14,Masters>it could be an increased ICP.

405
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,680
<15-14,Masters>他可能会脑疝
<15-14,Masters>His brain could herniate.

406
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,560
<15-15,Chase>那做脑室穿刺呢
<15-15,Chase>What about a ventricular puncture?

407
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,430
<15-16,House>听起来不错
<15-16,House>Sounds good.

408
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,980
<15-17,Master>你们认为直接给他大脑刺一针
<15-17,Master>You think sticking a needle directly into his brain

409
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,280
<15-17,Master>会比刺他腰椎安全吗
<15-17,Master>would be less dangerous than sticking it in his spine?

410
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,660
<15-18,House>我也就随口一说
<15-18,House>It's probably a push.

411
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,050
<15-18,House>我只是想让你们出去
<15-18,House>I'm just trying to get you out of here,

412
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,870
<15-18,House>因为床单以下
<15-18,House>because underneath this sheet,

413
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,200
<15-18,House>小家伙起床了
<15-18,House>stuff is going on.

414
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,630
<15-19,House>选个地方来一针就是了
<15-19,House>Just pick a spot and stick a needle in it.

415
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,150
<16-1,Lane>你们想钻开我的颅骨
<16-1,Lane>You want to drill through my skull

416
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,310
<16-1,Lane>就因为有个不存在的团块吗
<16-1,Lane>because of a mass that's not there?

417
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,060
<16-2,Taub>原先存在的  意味着有地方出了问题
<16-2,Taub>It was there, which means something is wrong.

418
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,270
<16-2,Taub>我们得把它弄明白
<16-2,Taub>We need to find it.

419
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,240
<16-3,Masters>你想给谁打电话吗
<16-3,Masters>Is there anybody you'd like us to call?

420
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,100
<16-3,Masters>打给你希望陪在你身边的人
<16-3,Masters>Someone that you'd like to be here with you?

421
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,070
<16-3,Masters>妻子  或者是女朋友
<16-3,Masters>Maybe a wife or girlfriend?

422
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,250
<16-4,Lane>没有  我家人都在俄克拉荷马州
<16-4,Lane>No, my family's all back in Oklahoma,

423
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,510
<16-4,Lane>演出团的那些家伙
<16-4,Lane>and the guys on the circuit

424
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,580
<16-4,Lane>正在卡尔加里进行下一轮骑术表演
<16-4,Lane>are in Calgary at the next rodeo.

425
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,690
<16-5,Masters>真是太糟了
<16-5,Masters>Ah, that's too bad.

426
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,580
<16-5,Masters>能有个关心你的人在身边
<16-5,Masters>It's nice to have somebody nearby

427
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,350
<16-5,Masters>和你说说话是件幸福的事

428
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,200
<17-1,Taub>你还好吧
<17-1,Taub>You okay?

429
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,050
<17-3,Taub>你刚说  "能有个关心你的人在身边
<17-3,Taub>You just sang, "It's good to have somebody near by

430
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,240
<17-3,Taub>和你说说话是件幸福的事"
<17-3,Taub>to talk to who cares."

<17-5,Taub>No kidding. I just can't figure out why.

433
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,310
<17-6,Masters>我也弄不懂
<17-6,Masters>Neither can I.

434
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,320
<17-6,Masters>没有异样
<17-6,Masters>Looks clear.

435
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,060
<17-6,Masters>没有发炎的症状
<17-6,Masters>Nothing is suggesting inflammation.

436
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,650
<17-6,Masters>出问题了
<17-6,Masters>Something's wrong.

437
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,980
<17-7,Taub>血氧饱和度急剧下降
<17-7,Taub>O-2 stats are plummeting.

438
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,400
<17-7,Taub>需要插管
<17-7,Taub>We need to intubate.

439
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,710
<17-7,Taub>把手术台放低
<17-7,Taub>Drop the table.

440
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,310
<17-7,Taub>我插不进管去
<17-7,Taub>I can't get it in.

441
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,960
<17-8,Masters>呼吸道梗阻  快去拿气管切开包
<17-8,Masters>The airway's blocked. Get the trach kit.

442
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,720
<17-9,Masters>血氧饱和度回升
<17-9,Masters>O-2 are going back up.

443
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,480
<17-10,Nurse>这是什么味道啊
<17-10,Nurse>What's that smell?

444
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,620
<17-11,Masters>他刚排便了吗
<17-11,Masters>Did he defecate?

445
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,480
<17-12,Taub>看起来不像
<17-12,Taub>Doesn't look like it.

446
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,680
<17-13,Masters>我觉得是脚的问题
<17-13,Masters>I think it's his feet.

447
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,280
<17-13,Masters>绝对是脚的问题
<17-13,Masters>It's definitely his feet.

<18-10,Carnell>You can't be serious.

460
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,340
<18-11,House>为什么不啊
<18-11,House>Why not?

461
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,490
<18-11,House>出了问题

<18-11,House>而且我离她只有八步远
<18-11,House>And I'm only eight paces away.

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,180
<18-13,House>别把这感觉毁了
<18-13,House>Don't ruin it.

466
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,950
<18-13,House>脚臭可能是由糖尿病
<18-13,House>Stinky feet can point to diabetes,

467
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,250
<18-13,House>脚癣  坏疽引起的  选一个吧
<18-13,House>athlete's foot, or gangrene... Pick one.

468
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,170
<18-14,Carnell>不要

470
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,720
<18-15,Taub>没有一个会导致血痰
<18-15,Taub>None of those cause bloody sputum

471
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,850
<18-15,Taub>或者团块消失的
<18-15,Taub>or disappearing masses.

472
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,140
<18-16,Carnell>别别  别  别
<18-16,Carnell>No. No. No. No.

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,060
<18-16,Carnell>你会杀了她的
<18-16,Carnell>You're gonna kill her.

474
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,420
<18-16,Carnell>别这么做  卡内尔
<18-16,Carnell>Don't do that, Carnell.

475
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,460
<18-17,House>他们会以为
<18-17,House>They might get the idea

476
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,660
<18-17,House>我正要射杀一个妓女呢
<18-17,House>that I'm shooting at a hooker.

478
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,500
<18-17,House>霉菌感染可能会导致
<18-17,House>Fungal infection can cause

479
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,050
<18-17,House>足趾间溃疡
<18-17,House>ulceration between the toes

480
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,620
<18-17,House>而出血可能是
<18-17,House>and bleeding could be

481
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,360
<18-17,House>脓肿复发导致的
<18-17,House>from recurring abscesses

482
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,020
<18-17,House>看起来像是复发的团块而已
<18-17,House>that appear to be recurring masses.

483
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,300
<18-18,Masters>症状出现在头部或者脚部
<18-18,Masters>Symptoms in the head or feet

484
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,530
<18-18,Masters>说明感染来自心脏
<18-18,Masters>mean the infection would have to be

485
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,660
<18-18,Masters>或者脑部
<18-18,Masters>in the heart or the brain.

486
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,370
<18-19,Taub>我建议先检查心脏
<18-19,Taub>I say we start by looking in the heart,

487
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,810
<18-19,Taub>因为检查装着金属板的大脑
<18-19,Taub>because looking at his brain

488
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,340
<18-19,Taub>有点不大好整
<18-19,Taub>with a metal plate is problematic.

489
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,660
<18-20,Chase>那就用核磁共振检查他的心脏吧
<18-20,Chase>So's MRI'ing his heart.

490
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,060
<18-20,Chase>他靠着一根七厘米长的金属棒
<18-20,Chase>He's got a seven-centimeter conductive metal rod

491
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,450
<18-20,Chase>将肋骨固定在一起
<18-20,Chase>holding his rib together.

492
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,330
<18-20,Chase>那样会将他撕成两半的
<18-20,Chase>It'll rip him in two.

493
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,410
<18-21,House>不  只是感觉像是撕成两半了
<18-21,House>No, it'll just feel like it's ripping him in two,

494
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,060
<18-21,House>实际上可没那么糟
<18-21,House>which is much better.

495
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,180
<18-22,Taub>我们可以通过向腹腔
<18-22,Taub>We could minimize the damage

496
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,400
<18-22,Taub>注射冰水来尽量减少伤害
<18-22,Taub>by injecting ice water into his abdominal cavity.

497
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,970
<18-23,Carnell>不  求求你  别
<18-23,Carnell>No. Please, no.

498
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,900
<18-24,Carnell>天啊
<18-24,Carnell>Oh, God!

499
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,760
<18-25,House>先挂了
<18-25,House>Got to go.

500
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,100
<18-26,Carnell>快叫救护车
<18-26,Carnell>Call an ambulance!

501
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,640
<18-27,House>为什么啊
<18-27,House>Why?

502
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,690
<18-28,Carnell>这还用问为什么吗
<18-28,Carnell>What do you mean why?

503
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,340
<18-28,Carnell>她受伤了
<18-28,Carnell>She's hurt!

504
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,710
<18-29,House>她看着可不像受伤哟
<18-29,House>She doesn't look hurt.

505
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,530
<18-30,Carnell>不是真的吧
<18-30,Carnell>No, you didn't.

506
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,740
<18-31,House>是真的
<18-31,House>Yes, we did.

507
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,600
<18-32,Carnell>你真是个混蛋
<18-32,Carnell>You're an ass.

508
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,170
<18-33,House>帮我去拿巴顿将军四十五号雄驹枪
<18-33,House>Okay. Go get me, uh, General Patton's colt 45.

509
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,910
<18-33,House>有两道刻痕的那支
<18-33,House>The one with the two notches.

510
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,470
<18-34,Wilson>他不会给你拿枪来的
<18-34,Wilson>He's not getting you a gun.

511
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,620
<18-35,Carnell>你朋友知道怎么寻开心
<18-35,Carnell>Your friend knows how to have a good time.

512
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,550
<19-1,Taub>核磁共振中的磁铁会加热你体内的金属
<19-1,Taub>The MRI magnets are gonna heat the metal.

513
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,210
<19-1,Taub>会在十五秒中内
<19-1,Taub>Could get to over 300 degrees

514
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,300
<19-1,Taub>超过149度
<19-1,Taub>in 15 seconds.

515
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,610
<19-2,Masters>这就是为什么我们要向你的腹腔内
<19-2,Masters>Which is why we're injecting ice water

516
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,360
<19-2,Masters>注射冰水
<19-2,Masters>into your abdominal cavity.

517
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,120
<19-2,Masters>你会感到前所未有的寒冷
<19-2,Masters>You'll feel colder than you've ever felt,

518
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,060
<19-2,Masters>然后你会变得热辣
<19-2,Masters>and then you'll be hotter...

519
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,670
<19-2,Masters>你会感到前所未有的燥热
<19-2,Masters>Um, you'll feel hotter than you've ever felt.

520
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,910
<19-2,Masters>我们会尽快做完的
<19-2,Masters>We'll try to be as quick as possible.

521
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,420
<19-4,Masters>闭嘴
<19-4,Masters>Shut up.

522
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,890
<19-5,Taub>这真有意思
<19-5,Taub>It's interesting.

523
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,220
<19-5,Taub>不  没什么意思
<19-5,Taub>No, it's not.

524
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,470
<19-6,Masters>这很通俗易懂
<19-6,Masters>It's mundane and simple.

525
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,140
<19-6,Masters>他明显是个优良品种
<19-6,Masters>He's obviously a very blessed specimen,

526
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,990
<19-6,Masters>所以从进化论的角度来看
<19-6,Masters>so from an evolutionary point of view,

527
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,780
<19-6,Masters>他能繁衍健康的后代
<19-6,Masters>he'd produce healthy offspring,

528
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,080
<19-6,Masters>所以我的额前皮质告诉我
<19-6,Masters>so my prefrontal cortex is telling me

529
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,910
<19-6,Masters>我应该和他上床
<19-6,Masters>I should have sex with him.

530
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,230
<19-7,Taub>-就这样吗  -没错
<19-7,Taub>- Oh. Is that all? - Yes.

531
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,630
<19-8,Masters>我大脑的理性部分告诉我他粗俗而且愚蠢
<19-8,Masters>My rational brain knows he's a hillbilly and an idiot.

532
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,330
<19-9,Taub>但不知怎么你大脑理性的部分
<19-9,Taub>And yet somehow your rational brain

533
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,720
<19-9,Taub>没能说服你啊  这很有趣
<19-9,Taub>is losing the argument, which is interesting.

534
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,470
<20-1,Wilson>你无聊了
<20-1,Wilson>You were bored.

535
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,070
<20-1,Wilson>你肯定花了差不多两天时间
<20-1,Wilson>You must have spent about two days

536
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,780
<20-1,Wilson>策划这次假谋杀  你真是太无聊了
<20-1,Wilson>setting up a fake murder, and you were bored.

537
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,070
<20-2,House>我好着呢
<20-2,House>I'm fine.

538
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,250
<20-2,House>你不好
<20-2,House>You're not.

539
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,250
<20-3,Wilson>而且我担心你会做出更愚蠢的事情
<20-3,Wilson>And I'm worried you might do something even stupider.

540
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,350
<20-3,Wilson>要不你搬回来和我一起住吧
<20-3,Wilson>Why don't you move back in with me?

541
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,230
<20-3,Wilson>至少在你重回正轨之前
<20-3,Wilson>At least until you get back on track.

542
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,250
<20-4,House>太自恋了吧
<20-4,House>What an ego.

543
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,730
<20-4,House>你以为你是什么知心大哥哥
<20-4,House>You think you're some sort of emotional paragon?

544
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,560
<20-4,House>我的坚强后盾吗
<20-4,House>You're my rock?

545
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,130
<20-5,Wilson>我只是想当一个朋友
<20-5,Wilson>I'm trying to be a friend.

546
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,090
<20-6,House>至少我不会傻到
<20-6,House>At least I have the good sense

547
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,630
<20-6,House>去娶每个上过床的女人
<20-6,House>not to marry every woman I fall into bed with.

548
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,450
<20-6,House>或许你该搬过来和我住
<20-6,House>Maybe you should move in with me.

549
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,310
<20-7,Wilson>都行  如果你希望这样
<20-7,Wilson>Either way. If you prefer...

550
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,010
<20-8,House>我希望你别再说这事了
<20-8,House>I prefer you to stop talking about this.

551
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,000
<20-9,Wilson>豪斯  我们还没开始谈呢
<20-9,Wilson>House, we haven't even started talking about this

552
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
<20-9,Wilson>除了你一直在强调说你好着呢
<20-9,Wilson>except to establish the fact that you are fine,

553
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,060
<20-9,Wilson>但你现在明显不好
<20-9,Wilson>which clearly you aren't.

554
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,550
<20-10,House>别烦我
<20-10,House>Leave me alone!

555
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,320
<20-10,House>不行
<20-10,House>No.

556
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,630
<20-11,Wilson>我们要讨论这个问题
<20-11,Wilson>We are gonna talk about this,

557
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,140
<20-11,Wilson>并且解决这个问题
<20-11,Wilson>and we're gonna deal with this.

558
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,160
<20-12,House>就是说我没选择了
<20-12,House>So I have no choice?

559
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,510
<20-12,House>行吧
<20-12,House>Fine.

560
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,250
<20-12,House>除非
<20-12,House>Unless...

561
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,330
<20-12,House>除非  我有选择
<20-12,House>Unless...Yes, I do.

562
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,050
<20-12,House>我有腿啊
<20-12,House>I do have legs.

563
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,690
<20-12,House>看来你那高明的计划里没考虑这个因素啊
<20-12,House>I see you didn't factor those into your brilliant plan.

564
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,380
<21-1,Taub>莱恩  你能尽量保持不动吗
<21-1,Taub>Lane, can you try to hold still?

565
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,900
<21-2,Lane>我在尽力
<21-2,Lane>I'm trying.

566
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,690
<21-2,Lane>非常努力
<21-2,Lane>Real hard.

567
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,380
<21-3,Taub>我必须得说  这哥们真顽强
<21-3,Taub>Guy is tough. I'll give him that.

568
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,610
<21-3,Taub>我的额前皮质也有点兴奋了
<21-3,Taub>My prefrontal cortex is a little aroused.

569
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,150
<21-4,Masters>快点成像
<21-4,Masters>Just get the damn picture.

570
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,830
<21-4,Masters>肋温达到七十度了
<21-4,Masters>Rib temp is at 158.

571
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,520
<21-5,Taub>我还没拍到主动脉足够清晰的图像
<21-5,Taub>I don't have a clear view of his aorta yet.

572
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,290
<21-6,Masters>这样不行  我们得停下
<21-6,Masters>This isn't gonna work. We have to stop.

573
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,650
<21-7,Taub>不  你这是在保护他
<21-7,Taub>No. You're trying to protect him

574
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,210
<21-7,Taub>而不是救他
<21-7,Taub>instead of trying to save him.

575
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,290
<21-8,Masters>他冒烟了
<21-8,Masters>He's smoking.

576
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,540
<21-8,Masters>真的  你个混蛋
<21-8,Masters>Literally, you ass.

577
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,490
<21-9,Taub>再五秒钟
<21-9,Taub>Five more seconds.

578
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,600
<21-10,Masters>不  如果他胸腔没了
<21-10,Masters>No, getting a good image

579
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,410
<21-10,Masters>拍到张好图像
<21-10,Masters>isn't gonna mean anything

580
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,310
<21-10,Masters>还有什么意义
<21-10,Masters>if he doesn't have a rib cage.

581
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,080
<21-11,Taub>有了
<21-11,Taub>Got it.

582
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,850
<21-12,Lane>图像都  都没问题
<21-12,Lane>The images, they're normal.

583
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,270
<21-14,Lane>你最终还是要跟他谈这件事的
<21-14,Lane>You're gonna have to talk to him eventually.

584
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
<21-15,Wilson>他需要你
<21-15,Wilson>He needs you.

585
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,480
<21-16,Cuddy>我爱他
<21-16,Cuddy>I love him.

586
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,070
<21-16,Cuddy>我知道他也爱我
<21-16,Cuddy>And I know he loves me.

587
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,900
<21-16,Cuddy>但是我不能
<21-16,Cuddy>But I just can't...

588
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,720
<21-17,Wilson>他的生命中需要你
<21-17,Wilson>He needs you in his life.

589
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,470
<21-17,Wilson>即使你不和他上床  他依然需要你
<21-17,Wilson>Even if you're not sleeping with him, he needs you.

590
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,660
<21-17,Wilson>没有你
<21-17,Wilson>Without you...

591
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,100
<21-18,Cuddy>时光不能倒流
<21-18,Cuddy>You can't go backwards.

592
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,970
<21-18,Cuddy>我无法解决他的问题
<21-18,Cuddy>I can't fix his problem.

593
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,480
<21-18,Cuddy>我就是他的问题所在
<21-18,Cuddy>I am his problem.

594
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,870
<22-1,House>如果感染不是来自心脏
<22-1,House>If the infection's not in his heart,

595
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,790
<22-1,House>那就是来自大脑了
<22-1,House>then it's in his brain.

596
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,990
<22-1,House>你们挡住我的阳光了
<22-1,House>You're in my sun.

597
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,780
<22-1,House>-做个CT  -不行
<22-1,House>- Do a CT. - We can't.

598
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,090
<22-2,Foreman>他体内有钛板
<22-2,Foreman>He has a titanium plate

599
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,280
<22-2,Foreman>还有一堆金属钉
<22-2,Foreman>and a bunch of metal screws.

600
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
<22-3,House>那就拿出来呗
<22-3,House>So get rid of them.

601
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,160
<22-4,Taub>他的颅骨存在多发线性骨折
<22-4,Taub>His skull has multiple hairline fractures.

602
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,960
<22-4,Taub>拿掉金属板就像是
<22-4,Taub>Removing the metal plate will be like

603
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,490
<22-4,Taub>要拿掉一半蛋壳
<22-4,Taub>removing half an eggshell without

604
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,280
<22-4,Taub>而不弄碎剩下的一半蛋壳一样
<22-4,Taub>cracking the rest of the shell.

605
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,580
<22-5,House>不拿出金属片
<22-5,House>And not removing the plate

606
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,450
<22-5,House>就像是放任鸡蛋去腐烂一样
<22-5,House>will be like leaving the egg out to rot.

607
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,910
<22-6,Foreman>我们总不能因为每每给他做检查
<22-6,Foreman>We can't cut off the top of his head

608
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,880
<22-6,Foreman>都无故消失无从确诊的症状
<22-6,Foreman>based on a few symptoms that disappear

609
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,540
<22-6,Foreman>而掀起他的头盖骨吧
<22-6,Foreman>whenever we try to test for them.

610
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,710
<22-7,House>如果那个从未消失的症状
<22-7,House>What if the one symptom that hasn't disappeared

611
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,320
<22-7,House>其实从不存在呢
<22-7,House>was never actually there?

612
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,860
<22-7,House>他回答问题的时候是不是有停顿
<22-7,House>Any delays when he answers questions?

613
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,690
<22-7,House>他没有部分听觉丧失
<22-7,House>He doesn't have partial hearing loss.

614
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,160
<22-7,House>他是在遗失片段
<22-7,House>He's missing moments.

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,010
<22-7,House>据他说在骑牛期间
<22-7,House>He reported having something

616
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,850
<22-7,House>有过类似复杂性局部癫痫的症状
<22-7,House>like a complex partial seizure during a bull ride.

617
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,990
<22-7,House>说从那以后就没出现过了
<22-7,House>Said it hasn't happened since,

618
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,200
<22-7,House>但是如果是他错了呢
<22-7,House>but what if he's wrong?

619
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,260
<22-7,House>如果从始至终一直是
<22-7,House>What if the infection in the brain

620
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,720
<22-7,House>大脑中的感染导致的呢
<22-7,House>is causing it to happen all the time?

621
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,540
<22-8,Chase>脑电图没有显示任何癫痫的迹象
<22-8,Chase>His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.

622
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,380
<22-9,House>我没说是癫痫
<22-9,House>I didn't say it was a seizure.

623
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,860
<22-9,House>我说的是类似癫痫
<22-9,House>I said it was something like a seizure.

624
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,140
<22-10,Foreman>那我猜你是准备告诉我们
<22-10,Foreman>And I'm guessing you're about to tell us

625
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,680
<22-10,Foreman>我们得找个类似脑电图的东西来证明
<22-10,Foreman>we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove...

626
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,250
<22-11,House>不是  因为我已经想到用啥了
<22-11,House>Nope, 'cause I already got one.

627
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,580
<23-1,Lane>你们想让我唱歌
<23-1,Lane>You want me to sing?

628
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,570
<23-1,Lane>唱《我的邦妮》怎么能
<23-1,Lane>How's singing My Bonnie gonna

630
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,790
<23-1,Lane>帮你们弄清我大脑的情况
<23-1,Lane>help you see inside my brain?

631
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,800
<23-1,Lane>不能
<23-1,Lane>It won't.

632
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
<23-2,House>它只能证明我们需要
<23-2,House>It's just gonna prove that we need

633
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,050
<23-2,House>撬开你的脑壳
<23-2,House>to cut into your skull,

634
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,940
<23-2,House>可是会有点危险的哦
<23-2,House>which is gonna be kind of dangerous.

635
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,720
<23-2,House>所以你最好能像天使般的唱歌
<23-2,House>So you've got a real incentive to sing like an angel.

636
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,270
<23-3,Masters>我们认为你存在短暂昏厥
<23-3,Masters>We think you're having mini blackouts,

637
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,630
<23-3,Masters>但是你的大脑对此无意识
<23-3,Masters>but your brain compensates.

638
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,430
<23-4,House>如果有个预设的节奏就不会没意识了
<23-4,House>But it can't compensate if there's a preset rhythm.

639
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,840
<23-4,House>一  二  三
<23-4,House>One, two, three.

644
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,940
<23-5,Lane>看  跟你们说过了
<23-5,Lane>See? Told ya.

645
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,030
<23-6,Masters>莱恩  你唱的完全不着调
<23-6,Masters>Lane, that wasn't even close.

646
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,750
<23-6,Masters>你真牛
<23-6,Masters>That was brilliant.

647
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,990
<23-7,House>是啊
<23-7,House>Yeah.

648
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,350
<24-1,Wilson>我能理解
<24-1,Wilson>It's understandable.

649
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,010
<24-2,House>我讨厌死你这样了
<24-2,House>I hate when you do that.

650
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,890
<24-2,House>你对你脑海中我的想法作出反应
<24-2,House>You respond to what you think I'm thinking,

651
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,280
<24-2,House>因为你觉得我和你以为的一样
<24-2,House>because you think that I think like you do.

652
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,470
<24-2,House>真是又烦又侮辱人
<24-2,House>It's insulting and annoying.

653
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,810
<24-3,Wilson>你害怕是因为没有事情能让你兴奋了
<24-3,Wilson>You're scared because nothing excites you.

654
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,000
<24-3,Wilson>寻欢作乐不能再让你兴奋
<24-3,Wilson>Fun doesn't excite you.

655
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,580
<24-3,Wilson>医学谜题无法再让你兴奋
<24-3,Wilson>Puzzles don't excite you.

656
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,370
<24-3,Wilson>还剩下什么呢
<24-3,Wilson>What's left?

657
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,980
<24-3,Wilson>我想说的是  你没错
<24-3,Wilson>And I was saying you're right.

658
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,340
<24-3,Wilson>你伤感你郁闷
<24-3,Wilson>You're upset. You're depressed.

659
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,540
<24-3,Wilson>连五彩的世界都蒙上了一层灰色
<24-3,Wilson>Everything's gonna taste a little worse right now,

660
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,310
<24-3,Wilson>但这都会过去的
<24-3,Wilson>but it'll pass.

661
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,550
<24-3,Wilson>我能理解
<24-3,Wilson>It's understandable.

662
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,860
<24-4,House>你害怕是因为你觉得我就快要崩塌了
<24-4,House>You're scared because you think I'm falling apart,

663
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,650
<24-4,House>所以你试着说服自己
<24-4,House>and you're trying to convince yourself

664
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,230
<24-4,House>你不过是想多了而已
<24-4,House>that you're overreacting.

665
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,070
<24-5,Hooker 7>一直在响
<24-5,Hooker 7>Keeps ringing.

666
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:50,840
<24-6,House>喂
<24-6,House>Yeah.

667
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,290
<24-7,Foreman>豪斯  病人大脑里没有感染
<24-7,Foreman>House, there's no infection in this guy's brain.

668
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,590
<24-7,Foreman>CT没有问题
<24-7,Foreman>CT's clean.

669
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,220
<24-8,House>那太糟了
<24-8,House>Well, that sucks.

670
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,590
<24-8,House>现在我们不得不引爆他的心脏了
<24-8,House>Now we have to blow up his heart.

671
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,770
<25-1,Foreman>我们才不会弄爆他的心脏
<25-1,Foreman>We're not blowing up his heart,

672
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,500
<25-1,Foreman>因为已经排除心脏的问题了
<25-1,Foreman>because we've ruled out his heart.

673
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,030
<25-1,Foreman>核磁共振和食道心脏超声均没有显示
<25-1,Foreman>MRI and transesophageal echo reveal

674
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,580
<25-1,Foreman>任何肿大迹象  团块或者赘生物
<25-1,Foreman>no swelling, no masses, no vegetation,

675
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,190
<25-1,Foreman>没有任何异常
<25-1,Foreman>no sign of anything.

676
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,180
<25-2,House>因为我们用错方法了
<25-2,House>'Cause we're looking the wrong way.

677
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,710
<25-2,House>这管上有一处裂口
<25-2,House>There's an imperfection.

678
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,740
<25-2,House>怎么找出它的位置
<25-2,House>How do you find where?

679
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,970
<25-3,Foreman>我不知道  找个放大镜来
<25-3,Foreman>I don't know. Get a magnifying glass and...

680
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,380
<25-4,House>一吸便知[又意你真差劲]
<25-4,House>You suck.

681
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,690
<25-4,House>两种理解都没错
<25-4,House>Feel free to interpret that both ways.

682
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,740
<25-4,House>用吸管吸水
<25-4,House>Suck on the straw,

683
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,840
<25-4,House>看看哪里漏了
<25-4,House>see where the drink leaks.

684
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,710
<25-5,Chase>你是说我们给他的主动脉加压
<25-5,Chase>You're saying we put pressure on his aorta

685
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,220
<25-5,Chase>直到它裂开吗
<25-5,Chase>until it rips open?

686
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,380
<25-5,Chase>你确实了解这么做的后果吧
<25-5,Chase>You do realize the downside of that?

687
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,660
<25-5,Chase>如果我们不弄破它
<25-5,Chase>If we don't rip it,

688
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,710
<25-6,House>感染伤害也会
<25-6,House>the damage from the infection will,

689
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,210
<25-6,House>不过估计就不是在手术台上开腔躺着了
<25-6,House>probably not when he's got his chest open in an O.R.

690
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,320
<25-6,House>那时就不能在六十秒内缝合裂口
<25-6,House>where it can be repaired inside the 60 seconds

691
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,820
<25-6,House>他就会因失血过多而死
<25-6,House>it'll take him to bleed to death.

692
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,030
<25-7,Chase>这也太扯了
<25-7,Chase>It's a ridiculous idea.

693
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,740
<25-7,Chase>不会有用的
<25-7,Chase>It won't work.

694
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,110
<25-8,House>现在如果你不介意的话
<25-8,House>Now if you don't mind...

695
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,350
<25-8,House>我就去要他关于引爆他心脏手术的许可了
<25-8,House>Get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.

696
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,050
<26-1,House>我们认为你患有巴尔通体菌感染
<26-1,House>We think you have a Bartonella infection,

697
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,450
<26-1,House>导致你动脉壁上长了一个霉菌性动脉瘤
<26-1,House>which caused a mycotic aneurysm in your aortic wall.

698
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,890
<26-1,House>我们得找到它
<26-1,House>We need to find it,

699
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,870
<26-1,House>也就是说我们得诱发你的主动脉破裂
<26-1,House>which means we need to blow up your heart.

700
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,910
<26-1,House>而且  是的  这千真万确
<26-1,House>And, yes, I'm as serious as a heart attack.

701
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,630
<26-1,House>我们准备提升你的血压
<26-1,House>We're going to increase your blood pressure

702
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,730
<26-1,House>直到动脉壁的薄弱点爆开
<26-1,House>until the weak spot in your aortic wall explodes.

703
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,350
<26-1,House>但愿我们能在你失血过多
<26-1,House>Hopefully we'll be able to fix it

704
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,960
<26-1,House>致死前及时缝好
<26-1,House>before you bleed to death.

705
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,380
<26-1,House>还有疑问吗
<26-1,House>Any questions?

706
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,770
<26-2,Lane>没有
<26-2,Lane>Nope.

707
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,320
<26-2,Lane>真的吗
<26-2,Lane>Really?

708
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,160
<26-3,House>你都不想知道
<26-3,House>You don't even want to know

709
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,230
<26-3,House>是否还能做职业骑手吗
<26-3,House>if you'll be able to go back to bull riding?

710
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,720
<26-4,Lane>我猜不能了吧
<26-4,Lane>I assume no?

711
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,720
<26-4,Lane>我是说  你都给我开颅了
<26-4,Lane>I mean, you've already cracked open my skull,

712
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,640
<26-4,Lane>现在又打算诱发我主动脉破裂
<26-4,Lane>and now you're gonna blow up my heart.

713
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,270
<26-5,House>还以为你热爱制服斗牛呢
<26-5,House>Thought you loved those eight seconds.

714
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,510
<26-5,House>我是爱
<26-5,House>I do.

715
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,340
<26-6,Lane>而你现在告诉我  我得放弃它
<26-6,Lane>And now you're telling me that I got to give them up.

716
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,900
<26-6,Lane>我总能找到其它有爱的事情
<26-6,Lane>I can always find something else to love.

717
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,880
<26-6,Lane>豪斯
<26-6,Lane>House.

718
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,440
<26-7,Cuddy>我们得谈谈
<26-7,Cuddy>We need to talk.

719
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,430
<27-1,Cuddy>你没指望我同意
<27-1,Cuddy>You didn't expect me to say yes

720
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,530
<27-1,Cuddy>你弄爆他的主动脉吧
<27-1,Cuddy>to rupturing his aorta, did you?

721
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,100
<27-2,House>我都没问
<27-2,House>Since I didn't ask,

722
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,120
<27-2,House>自然指望你一言不发了
<27-2,House>I wasn't expecting you to say anything at all.

723
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,400
<27-3,Cuddy>你没理由相信这能救他的命
<27-3,Cuddy>You have no reason to believe this will save his life.

724
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,380
<27-3,Cuddy>是吗
<27-3,Cuddy>Really?

725
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,430
<27-4,House>没理由么  一点也没有
<27-4,House>No reason? None at all?

726
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,170
<27-4,House>我就是胡乱给他开个胸
<27-4,House>I'm just planning on cracking open his chest,

727
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,500
<27-4,House>诱发他主动脉破裂  为加收医疗费么
<27-4,House>blowing up his heart, what, to pad his bill?

728
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,120
<27-4,House>还是你觉得  因为你伤了我的心
<27-4,House>Or you think that since you broke my heart

729
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
<27-4,House>所以我就想折腾他的心
<27-4,House>I want to break his.

730
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,840
<27-4,House>我不知道
<27-4,House>I don't know.

731
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,970
<27-5,Cuddy>我想也许你在找
<27-5,Cuddy>I think maybe you're looking for something

732
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,600
<27-5,Cuddy>让你兴奋的东西
<27-5,Cuddy>that can excite you.

733
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,890
<27-5,Cuddy>填补空虚
<27-5,Cuddy>Fill a void.

734
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,510
<27-5,Cuddy>这影响了你的判断
<27-5,Cuddy>And it's affecting your judgment.

735
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,430
<27-5,Cuddy>你说的对  是
<27-5,Cuddy>You're right. I am.

736
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,670
<27-6,House>我受伤  抑郁  嗨糊涂了的判断
<27-6,House>My damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment

737
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,620
<27-6,House>也比你
<27-6,House>is still better than yours

738
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,720
<27-6,House>抑或这医院任何医生的好
<27-6,House>or any other doctor in this hospital,

739
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,650
<27-6,House>我的小队会如常手术  救他的命
<27-6,House>and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life.

740
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,290
<27-6,House>所以你要么找保安把我们抓走
<27-6,House>So you can either have security arrest me and my team,

741
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,070
<27-6,House>要么闪开  别挡我的路
<27-6,House>or you can get the hell out of my way.

742
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,970
<27-7,House>这女人屈服了
<27-7,House>And she caves.

743
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,090
<28-1,Chase>开胸器已固定
<28-1,Chase>Rib spreader in place.

744
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,480
<28-2,Taub>心脏看起来没问题
<28-2,Taub>Heart looks good.

745
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,210
<28-2,Taub>主动脉可视
<28-2,Taub>The aorta's exposed.

746
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,680
<28-3,House>是你给卡迪打的小报告吧
<28-3,House>I take it you ratted me out to Cuddy.

747
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,810
<28-4,Masters>我觉得你不在状态
<28-4,Masters>I think your judgment is compromised.

748
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,110
<28-4,Masters>好吧  不是你
<28-4,Masters>No, you don't.

749
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,420
<28-5,House>快点  我两点还要看壁球比赛呢
<28-5,House>Come on. I got a squash game at 2:00.

750
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,940
<28-5,House>让牛仔小子一步到位吧
<28-5,House>Let's give this cowboy a ride.

751
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,870
<28-6,Foreman>如果我再注射
<28-6,Foreman>If I inject more,

752
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,050
<28-6,Foreman>身体其它部分
<28-6,Foreman>there won't be any room for the blood

753
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,770
<28-6,Foreman>将会供血不足
<28-6,Foreman>to go through the rest of his body.

754
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,030
<28-7,House>你说的对
<28-7,House>You're right.

755
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,080
<28-7,House>诱发他主动脉破裂时
<28-7,House>Let's make damn sure we don't damage his toes

756
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,760
<28-7,House>还他妈要确保他脚趾不受损
<28-7,House>while we blow up his heart.

757
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,230
<28-8,Taub>没有气泡  裂伤或缺口出现
<28-8,Taub>No bubbles, no bruising, no gaps.

758
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,570
<28-8,Taub>不管用
<28-8,Taub>It's not working.

759
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,220
<28-9,Foreman>管用
<28-9,Foreman>Yes, it is.

760
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,380
<28-10,Masters>我错了
<28-10,Masters>I was wrong.

761
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,580
<28-11,House>还没
<28-11,House>Not yet.

762
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,690
<28-12,Chase>进行搭桥清创
<28-12,Chase>Let's switch him over to bypass for the debridement.

763
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,060
<28-12,Chase>快点  没多少时间了
<28-12,Chase>Come on. We don't have much time.

764
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,780
<28-13,Foreman>降低心率  不然
<28-13,Foreman>Slow the heart down so it doesn't...

765
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,670
<28-14,Chase>该死
<28-14,Chase>Damn.

766
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,930
<28-15,Taub>血压太高  不能夹住主动脉
<28-15,Taub>We can't clamp the aorta at this pressure.

767
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,220
<28-15,Taub>就算没这些血液阻碍视线也不行
<28-15,Taub>Even if you can see through all the blood.

768
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:56,760
<28-16,Chase>快夹住
<28-16,Chase>Do it anyway.

769
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,550
<28-16,Chase>快速抽吸  更多纱布
<28-16,Chase>We need suction and more sponges.

770
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,050
<28-17,Foreman>流血太快
<28-17,Foreman>Leak is too fast.

771
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,710
<28-18,Chase>不  还行  可以修复好
<28-18,Chase>No, it's not. We can fix this.

772
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,640
<28-19,Foreman>成功了
<28-19,Foreman>It worked.

773
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,430
<28-19,Foreman>豪斯  成功了
<28-19,Foreman>House, it worked.

774
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,230
<28-20,House>听到了
<28-20,House>I heard you.

775
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,600
<29-2,Lane>我既然能醒  那八成是手术成功了吧
<29-2,Lane>I'm awake, so I guess it worked.

776
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,860
<29-3,Masters>只要你别让自己的心率过高
<29-3,Masters>As long as you don't get your heart rate too high.

777
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,030
<29-3,Masters>你  最好近期别有性行为
<29-3,Masters>You, uh, probably shouldn't have sex for a while.

778
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,960
<29-4,Lane>我会记住的
<29-4,Lane>I'll keep that in mind.

779
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,430
<29-5,Masters>想找个时间一起逛逛你农场吗
<29-5,Masters>Want to hang out, see your ranch sometime?

780
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,920
<29-7,Masters>可能有点不合适哈
<29-7,Masters>That would probably be inappropriate,

781
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,480
<29-7,Masters>毕竟我是你医生什么的
<29-7,Masters>'cause I'm your doctor and everything.

782
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,750
<29-7,Masters>祝一切顺利
<29-7,Masters>Good luck with everything.

783
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,500
<30-1,House>双人份苏格兰威士忌  双人份
<30-1,House>Double scotch. Doubled.

784
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,980
<30-2,Bartender>兑和  单一纯麦  有个人偏好吗
<30-2,Bartender>Uh, blended? Single malt? Any preference?

785
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,920
<30-3,House>没
<30-3,House>No.

786
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,970
<30-4,Bartender>有点吵  不好意思
<30-4,Bartender>Yeah, sorry about the noise.

787
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,850
<30-4,Bartender>我猜是他们的队赢了
<30-4,Bartender>I guess, uh, their team won.

788
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,470
<30-4,Bartender>不过还是得和你说
<30-4,Bartender>Although I got to tell you,

789
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,680
<30-4,Bartender>有时  我也希望自己能那样
<30-4,Bartender>sometimes I wish I could still act like that, you know?

790
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,550
<30-4,Bartender>纵情愉悦
<30-4,Bartender>Just let loose.

791
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,360
<30-4,Bartender>那样生活会轻松一点吧
<30-4,Bartender>Ah, I guess it's a little easier, though,

792
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,900
<30-4,Bartender>无忧无虑的
<30-4,Bartender>when you got no troubles.

793
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,760
<30-4,Bartender>爸妈买单
<30-4,Bartender>Parents still paying your bills.

794
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,980
<30-4,Bartender>还有大好人生在前头
<30-4,Bartender>Got your whole life ahead of you.

823
