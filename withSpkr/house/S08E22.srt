00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,400
<1-1,House>喂
<1-1,House>Hey.

2
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,010
<1-2,Kutner>不必费心了
<1-2,Kutner>Don't bother.

3
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,840
<1-2,Kutner>他死了
<1-2,Kutner>He's dead.

4
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,040
<1-3,House>你也死了
<1-3,House>You're dead too.

5
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,760
<1-4,Kutner>但这火烧得正旺
<1-4,Kutner>The fire isn't.

13
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,250
<1-4,Kutner>为你熬制Vicodin的doodle

<1-4,Kutner>zlean

25
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,860
<2-1,Kutner>你是不是该起身
<2-1,Kutner>You might want to get up

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,280
<2-1,Kutner>找出口去了
<2-1,Kutner>and start heading for the exit signs.

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,330
<2-2,House>我觉得
<2-2,House>For all I know,

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,820
<2-2,House>我已经起来了
<2-2,House>I already am up.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,680
<2-2,House>更有意思的问题是
<2-2,House>More interesting question is why would I hallucinate

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,340
<2-2,House>为什么出现在我幻觉中的
<2-2,House>an ex-employee who I last saw

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,520
<2-2,House>会是你这个开枪自刎的前雇员
<2-2,House>with a self-inflicted gunshot wound,

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,930
<2-2,House>而不是什么
<2-2,House>as opposed to someone more...

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,350
<2-2,House>大波妹
<2-2,House>busty?

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,490
<2-2,House>劳驾给我解释一下你怎么会在这里
<2-2,House>Care to explain why you're here?

35
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,540
<2-3,Kutner>这具尸体
<2-3,Kutner>The dead guy.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
<2-3,Kutner>是谁
<2-3,Kutner>Who is he?

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,260
<2-3,Kutner>在哪里认识的
<2-3,Kutner>How'd you meet him?

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,420
<3-1,Oliver>上个月我出了场车祸
<3-1,Oliver>I was in a car accident last month.

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,880
<3-2,House>我高中时还赢过游泳比赛呢
<3-2,House>I won a swimming trophy in high school.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,050
<3-2,House>该你了
<3-2,House>Your turn.

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,440
<3-3,Oliver>我止痛药吃完了
<3-3,Oliver>I-I ran out of pain medication.

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,830
<3-3,Oliver>但因为眶骨骨折
<3-3,Oliver>I got an orbital fracture.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,470
<3-3,Oliver>估计要很久才会痊愈
<3-3,Oliver>It's just taking ages to heal.

44
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,400
<3-4,House>把上衣脱了
<3-4,House>Take off your shirt.

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,550
<3-5,Oliver>我的眼睛长这里
<3-5,Oliver>My eye's up here.

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,060
<3-6,House>眶骨骨折说明
<3-6,House>Orbital fracture means

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,400
<3-6,House>你的脸撞上了挡风玻璃
<3-6,House>your face went into the windshield,

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,080
<3-6,House>也就是说你的胸部必定撞到了方向盘
<3-6,House>which means your chest went into the steering wheel.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
<3-6,House>止痛药会抑制心率
<3-6,House>Painkillers can suppress heart rate,

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,390
<3-6,House>除非你不想活了
<3-6,House>so unless you want me to kill you,

51
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,470
<3-6,House>否则就老老实实脱衣服让我做个心脏检查
<3-6,House>take off your shirt, let me do a heart exam.

52
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,650
<3-7,House>我还想看看
<3-7,House>I also wanted to see the ring of burns

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,240
<3-7,House>你锁骨边的烧伤环
<3-7,House>around your collarbone.

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,860
<3-8,Oliver>你怎么知道的
<3-8,Oliver>How'd you know?

55
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,850
<3-9,House>你跟护士说对可待因类药物过敏
<3-9,House>The codeine allergy you told the nurse about.

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,630
<3-9,House>潜台词就是  给我下点猛药吧
<3-9,House>That's shorthand for "Give me the strong stuff,"

57
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,370
<3-9,House>挺称你散发着"爷也牛逼过"愤懑的装束
<3-9,House>which matches your seen-better-days-because-my-life-fell-apart suit.

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,750
<3-9,House>手指两处旧烫伤伤口
<3-9,House>The two old burns on your fingers

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,610
<3-9,House>估计是你边抽烟边打盹的误伤
<3-9,House>mean you tend to nod off with a cigarette in your hand.

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,750
<3-9,House>所以叼嘴里掉下来也不足为奇
<3-9,House>No reason you shouldn't do that with one in your mouth.

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,120
<3-9,House>上帝保佑你能多遇见些蠢医生
<3-9,House>May all your doctors be stupid.

62
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,320
<3-9,House>等等
<3-9,House>Hold on a second.

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,120
<3-9,House>脐周有挫伤
<3-9,House>That bruising around your belly button.

64
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,520
<3-9,House>看来你要的猛药
<3-9,House>Well, you might get some fun drugs

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,920
<3-9,House>有着落了
<3-9,House>out of this after all.

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,090
<4-1,House>出现卡伦氏征
<4-1,House>Cullen's sign.

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,240
<4-1,House>但B超显示有血气腹征象
<4-1,House>But the ultrasound showed air as well as blood.

69
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,230
<4-1,House>我知道你在想什么
<4-1,House>Now, I know what you're thinking.

70
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,350
<4-1,House>出血性胰腺炎
<4-1,House>Hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,230
<4-1,House>我来说说我怎么想
<4-1,House>But I also know what I'm thinking.

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,200
<4-1,House>这无法解释气腹问题
<4-1,House>Doesn't explain the pneuomoperitoneum.

73
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,210
<4-2,Adams>你接了个新病例
<4-2,Adams>You took a new case?

74
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
<4-3,Park>你自己做了化验
<4-3,Park>You ran tests yourself?

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,830
<4-4,House>看到需要帮助的人
<4-4,House>I saw the chance to help someone in need,

76
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,170
<4-4,House>我本能地
<4-4,House>and I instinctively--

77
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,380
<4-4,House>也不是啦  这是别人的本能
<4-4,House>oh, no, wait, that was someone else's instinct.

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,640
<4-5,Taub>威尔森快不行了
<4-5,Taub>Wilson is dying.

79
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,980
<4-5,Taub>你的假释官说不定
<4-5,Taub>Your parole officer is probably

80
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,270
<4-5,Taub>已经在来这里逮你的路上了
<4-5,Taub>on his way here right now.

81
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,550
<4-5,Taub>你怎么还笑得出来
<4-5,Taub>How are you possibly in a good mood?

82
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,620
<4-6,House>你没看过《死亡诗社》[电影]吗
<4-6,House>Did you never see Dead Poets Society?

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,180
<4-6,House>及时行乐
<4-6,House>Carpe diem.

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,280
<4-7,Adams>腹部积气说明
<4-7,Adams>Air in his abdomen could mean

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,370
<4-8,Taub>那个那个那个那个
<4-8,Taub>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,660
<4-8,Taub>但这个这个这个这个
<4-8,Taub>But blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

87
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,020
<4-8,Taub>什么  什么什么
<4-8,Taub>Blah. Blah, blah.

88
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,670
<4-10,House>没人关心怎么诊断
<4-10,House>Nobody cares about the medicine.

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,110
<4-10,House>显然是消化道溃疡性穿孔
<4-10,House>It was perforated ulcer.

90
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,420
<4-10,House>剖开肚子  补好窟窿
<4-10,House>Laparotomy to find the hole in his tummy and close it up.

91
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,690
<4-11,Kutner>你没有回答你团队的问题
<4-11,Kutner>You didn't answer the team's question.

92
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,100
<4-12,House>感觉真诡异  因为通常
<4-12,House>Which is weird, because normally,

93
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,340
<4-12,House>我跟我自己部下说话
<4-12,House>when I talk to my own employees,

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,410
<4-12,House>都要先宣个誓  再接个测谎仪
<4-12,House>I'm under oath and hooked up to a lie detector.

95
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,720
<4-13,Kutner>你面临的可是六个月的牢狱之灾
<4-13,Kutner>You were looking at six months of prison

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,460
<4-13,Kutner>将无法陪威尔森度过余生最后的五个月生命
<4-13,Kutner>instead of five months of Wilson.

97
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,710
<4-14,House>-有什么可乐的  -我早计上心头了
<4-14,House>- Why happy? - Obviously I had a plan.

98
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,300
<4-14,House>全世界都知道你主意多
<4-14,House>Obviously, obviously you had a plan.

99
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,140
<4-14,House>我比较感兴趣的是
<4-14,House>The more interesting question

100
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,490
<4-15,Kutner>你为什么不告诉你的团队
<4-15,Kutner>is why you didn't tell the team.

101
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,500
<4-15,Kutner>我猜是因为在潜意识里你一开始就觉得
<4-15,Kutner>I think it's because part of you knew from the start

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,280
<4-15,Kutner>这计划没戏
<4-15,Kutner>that the plan wouldn't work.

103
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,110
<5-1,House>我想跟你谈谈
<5-1,House>I need a meeting.

104
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,980
<5-2,Foreman>忙着呢  打到我办公室约
<5-2,Foreman>I'm busy. Call my office.

105
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,650
<5-3,House>倒也是
<5-3,House>Yes...

106
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,300
<5-3,House>歪了的桌子怎么可能自己站直
<5-3,House>Because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,110
<5-1,House>我有事找你
<5-1,House>I need a meeting.

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,570
<5-4,House>多谢你抽空招待我
<5-4,House>Thanks for fitting me in.

109
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,060
<5-4,House>我的团队接下了八个重症病例
<5-4,House>My team has eight urgent, life-or-death cases.

110
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,890
<5-4,House>他们还等着我回去裁决
<5-4,House>That they've been waiting for me

111
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,240
<5-4,House>是受理还是放弃呢
<5-4,House>to accept or reject.

112
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,840
<5-5,Foreman>你就给我吹吧
<5-5,Foreman>When is that not true?

113
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,330
<5-6,House>好吧  实话说  目前就一个
<5-6,House>Well, right now, for one.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,060
<5-6,House>你就告诉假释委员会说我准备接手八例
<5-6,House>But tell my parole board that I'm taking all eight...

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,310
<5-6,House>没人能解的案子
<5-6,House>that no one else can crack them,

116
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,890
<5-6,House>接下来的五个月你需要我留在这里
<5-6,House>that you need me here for the next five months

117
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,340
<5-6,House>否则那八条人命就没了
<5-6,House>or eight people will die.

118
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,160
<5-7,Foreman>你在请求我做伪证
<5-7,Foreman>You're asking me to perjure myself.

119
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,030
<5-8,House>这只是一个小小的善意的谎言[白色谎言]
<5-8,House>It's a tiny, white lie.

120
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,370
<5-8,House>恕我无心讽刺
<5-8,House>No offense.

121
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,190
<5-8,House>特别是自从  就我所闻
<5-8,House>Especially since, from what I hear,

122
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,710
<5-8,House>万物黑则硕  之后
<5-8,House>nothing black is tiny.

123
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,830
<5-8,House>不过我猜你的小弟弟例外
<5-8,House>Except your penis, I guess.

124
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,760
<5-8,House>你真觉得我主观上想让天花板塌陷的吗
<5-8,House>You really think I wanted to cave in that ceiling?

125
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,720
<5-8,House>那只是个出现意外的恶作剧
<5-8,House>It was a prank that went wrong.

126
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,190
<5-8,House>废我点工资吧  告我吧
<5-8,House>Dock my pay, sue me--

127
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,480
<5-9,Foreman>违反重罪会给你的判决上
<5-9,Foreman>Felony vandalism should have added

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,900
<5-9,Foreman>再添一两年
<5-9,Foreman>another year or two to your sentence.

129
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,540
<5-9,Foreman>假释委员会同意只判六个月已经是奇迹了
<5-9,Foreman>It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.

130
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,990
<5-10,House>不管如何  我最后都会进监狱
<5-10,House>I will go to jail, eventually.

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
<5-10,House>我会付出代价接受惩罚
<5-10,House>I will pay the price.

132
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,750
<5-10,House>我只是不想威尔森受罪
<5-10,House>I just rather that Wilson didn't.

133
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,200
<5-10,House>拜托  交个朋友
<5-10,House>Come on, be a friend.

134
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,580
<5-10,House>好吧
<5-10,House>Okay.

135
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,380
<5-11,Foreman>不过不管你有什么案例  你得全数拿下
<5-11,Foreman>But whatever cases you have, you have to take them all.

136
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,330
<5-12,Kutner>"交个朋友"
<5-12,Kutner>"Be a friend"?

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,710
<5-13,House>我竖着几根手指
<5-13,House>How many fingers am I holding up?

138
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,490
<5-13,House>你当然知道是三根了
<5-13,House>Of course you know it's three,

139
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,960
<5-13,House>因为你知我所知
<5-13,House>because you know everything I know.

140
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,700
<5-13,House>我那重击混乱着的大脑可以记住所有事
<5-13,House>Everything my smack-addled brain can remember,

141
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,900
<5-13,House>包括我确切地说了  交个朋友  这句话
<5-13,House>including that I actually said, "Be a friend."

142
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,000
<5-14,Kutner>我的重点不是你说了这话
<5-14,Kutner>My point wasn't that you said it.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,940
<5-14,Kutner>重点是  我再说一次  为什么
<5-14,Kutner>My point was, once again, why?

144
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,650
<5-14,Kutner>我认为  是因为你内心知道
<5-14,Kutner>I think it's because part of you knew

145
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,850
<5-14,Kutner>你需要朋友
<5-14,Kutner>you were gonna need a friend.

146
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,790
<5-14,Kutner>你内心知道那计划
<5-14,Kutner>Part of you knew the plan,

147
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,300
<5-14,Kutner>即便是顺利进行  也全然无效
<5-14,Kutner>even when it was working, wouldn't work.

148
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,260
<5-14,Kutner>而现在我所好奇的是
<5-14,Kutner>And right now, I'm curious about

149
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,390
<5-14,Kutner>为什么你坐在地板上
<5-14,Kutner>why you're sitting on the ground

150
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,940
<5-14,Kutner>而没有向门那边走
<5-14,Kutner>instead of heading for the door.

151
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,170
<6-1,Kutner>我们应该都弄懂了为什么你会看到我
<6-1,Kutner>Guess we figured out why you're seeing me,

152
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,450
<6-1,Kutner>你自行了断的朋友
<6-1,Kutner>your suicidal friend.

153
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,570
<6-1,Kutner>他会每天给你打两次电话
<6-1,Kutner>He'll call you twice a day.

154
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,200
<6-1,Kutner>然后他的夫人也会每天给你打两次电话
<6-1,Kutner>Then his wife will call you twice a day

155
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,870
<6-1,Kutner>确保她明白丈夫向她转述的你的话
<6-1,Kutner>to make sure she understands what he told her you told him,

156
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,920
<7-1,Wilson>可实际上她不会明白  因为他丈夫不会去转述
<7-1,Wilson>which she won't because he didn't.

157
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,010
<7-2,Frankel>也许你想把这案子交给康纳斯
<7-2,Frankel>Maybe you want to give this one to Connors.

158
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,210
<7-3,Foreman>豪斯在哪里
<7-3,Foreman>Where's house?

159
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,850
<7-4,Wilson>不知道  不关心
<7-4,Wilson>Don't know, don't care.

160
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,940
<7-4,Wilson>我正在工作
<7-4,Wilson>Working.

161
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,550
<7-4,Wilson>不好意思
<7-4,Wilson>Excuse me.

162
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,790
<7-5,Foreman>两天了  音信全无
<7-5,Foreman>No one has seen or heard from him

163
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,690
<7-5,Foreman>没人见过他
<7-5,Foreman>since two nights ago.

164
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,330
<7-6,Wilson>我敢保证他现在正爽着呢
<7-6,Wilson>I'm sure he's enjoying himself.

165
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,180
<7-7,Foreman>上一次他进监狱的时候
<7-7,Foreman>Last time he went to prison,

166
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,660
<7-6,Wilson>他刷爆了信用卡
<7-6,Wilson>he maxed out his credit cards.

167
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,370
<7-7,Foreman>上一次他进监狱的时候
<7-7,Foreman>Last time he went to prison,

168
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,000
<7-7,Foreman>他认为有你等他
<7-7,Foreman>he thought he had you waiting for him.

169
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,400
<7-8,Wilson>你觉得他会做出什么傻事吗
<7-8,Wilson>You think he could've done something stupid?

170
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,820
<7-9,Foreman>我认为他做傻事就已经是谢天谢地了
<7-9,Foreman>I think stupid is our best-case scenario.

171
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,280
<8-1,Kutner>你为什么要自杀呢
<8-1,Kutner>Why do you want to kill yourself?

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,360
<8-2,House>理由如下
<8-2,House>Well, here's a reason.

173
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,040
<8-2,House>我甚至不能用毒品的快感来摆脱一个混蛋
<8-2,House>I can't even get stoned without some annoying jerk

174
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,430
<8-2,House>对我指手划脚  认定我需深度分析
<8-2,House>deciding I need to be deeply analyzed.

175
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,320
<8-2,House>这难道不就是一个简单到愚蠢的数学题吗
<8-2,House>Isn't this just an incredibly simple calculation?

176
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,580
<8-2,House>我要进监狱了
<8-2,House>I'm going to jail,

177
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,460
<8-2,House>要失业  要失去最好的朋友
<8-2,House>losing my job, losing my best friend.

178
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,890
<8-2,House>还要再说下去吗
<8-2,House>Do I need more?

179
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,890
<8-3,Kutner>你以为那就是作为豪斯的全部吗
<8-3,Kutner>You think that's the sum total of who you are?

180
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,500
<8-3,Kutner>一个医生  威尔森的好友吗
<8-3,Kutner>A doctor? A friend to Wilson?

181
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,640
<8-4,House>我还是一个超棒的男中音
<8-4,House>I'm also a tremendous baritone.

182
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
<8-4,House>现在一边去
<8-4,House>Now go away.

183
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,260
<8-5,Kutner>即便是在你的潜意识中  你也是个逃避的人
<8-5,Kutner>Even with your subconscious, you're evasive.

184
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,890
<8-5,Kutner>死亡并不有趣
<8-5,Kutner>Death's not interesting.

185
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,900
<8-5,Kutner>你是为趣味而生的
<8-5,Kutner>You exist for what's interesting.

186
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,140
<8-5,Kutner>谜题啊  点子啊  分析啊
<8-5,Kutner>Puzzles, ideas, analysis.

187
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,460
<8-5,Kutner>死亡是炫目谜题的对立面
<8-5,Kutner>Death is the opposite of a cool puzzle.

188
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,500
<8-5,Kutner>是无尽的空虚
<8-5,Kutner>It's eternal nothingness.

189
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,840
<8-5,Kutner>但是你发现生命也了无生趣了
<8-5,Kutner>But you don't find life interesting anymore.

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,750
<8-6,Amber>别傻了
<8-6,Amber>Stop being an idiot.

191
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,790
<8-7,House>请问能让卡特那回来吗
<8-7,House>Can I have Kutner back, please?

192
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
<8-8,Amber>我还要看多久的苦情戏啊
<8-8,Amber>How much pathetic wallowing do I have to sit through?

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,820
<8-9,House>地狱怎么样
<8-9,House>How are things in hell?

194
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,490
<8-9,House>湿度是个大问题吧
<8-9,House>Is the humidity the big issue?

195
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,600
<8-10,Amber>这家伙的病后来怎么样了
<8-10,Amber>What happened next with the guy's medical case?

196
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,440
<8-11,House>-为什么问这个  -没错
<8-11,House>- Why? - Exactly.

197
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,850
<8-12,Amber>为什么我  也就是你
<8-12,Amber>Why am I, meaning you,

198
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,350
<8-12,Amber>仍在痴迷于这一病例
<8-12,Amber>still obsessing about this case?

199
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,860
<8-12,Amber>显然跟我们为什么仍安坐在
<8-12,Amber>Obviously we think it's relevant to

200
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,890
<8-12,Amber>失火大楼的地板上有关
<8-12,Amber>why we're still sitting on the floor of a burning building.

201
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,100
<8-13,House>他经历过一次急救
<8-13,House>There was a code.

202
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,080
<9-1,Adams>他肺部有血块
<9-1,Adams>Gotta be a clot in his lungs.

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
<9-1,Adams>得马上送他去手术室
<9-1,Adams>We need to get him to an O.R.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,010
<9-2,Park>没时间了  他的血氧饱和度在下降
<9-2,Park>No time. His O-2 stats are falling.

205
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,040
<9-2,Park>得在这里吸出来  床边血栓清除术
<9-2,Park>We have to suck it out here. Bedside embolectomy.

206
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,220
<9-3,Adams>漂浮导管通过心脏
<9-3,Adams>Float a catheter through his heart

207
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,000
<9-3,Adams>他的血氧状态会更糟
<9-3,Adams>and his oxygenation will get even worse.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,920
<9-3,Adams>我们还没完成他就会送命的
<9-3,Adams>He'll die before we can finish the procedure.

209
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,540
<9-4,Taub>豪斯  你快做决定
<9-4,Taub>House, we need a call here.

210
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,110
<9-5,Adams>你干什么
<9-5,Adams>What are you doing?

211
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,150
<9-5,Adams>你给他用什么了
<9-5,Adams>What did you give him?

212
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,760
<9-6,House>五  四
<9-6,House>Five, four...

213
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,650
<9-6,House>三  二
<9-6,House>Three, two...

214
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,200
<9-7,Oliver>纳络酮
<9-7,Oliver>Naloxone.

215
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,030
<9-8,House>看到他那个自称叫"焦白粉"的表兄来拜访他
<9-8,House>We should've got suspicious when his visiting cousin

216
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,240
<9-8,House>我们就该心中有数了
<9-8,House>signed in as "Mr. Tar H. Horse."

217
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,790
<9-8,House>海络因导致呼吸窘迫
<9-8,House>Heroin caused the respiratory distress.

218
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,750
<9-8,House>纳络酮封闭了吗啡受体
<9-8,House>The naloxone turned off the receptors,

219
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,870
<9-8,House>结果就这样了
<9-8,House>caused your distress.

220
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,340
<9-9,Oliver>我不会停止吸毒
<9-9,Oliver>I'm not gonna stop doing drugs!

221
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,470
<9-9,Oliver>现实悲剧透了
<9-9,Oliver>It's reality that sucks!

222
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,570
<9-10,House>你想说我这是在欺骗
<9-10,House>You're saying I'm lying...

223
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,220
<9-10,House>自己的潜意识吗
<9-10,House>to my subconscious?

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,820
<9-11,Amber>人之常情
<9-11,Amber>People do it all the time.

225
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,300
<9-11,Amber>无论你喜不喜欢  你也是人
<9-11,Amber>And like it or not, you are a person.

226
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,850
<9-12,House>-那些话都是他说的  -但不是此情
<9-12,House>- He said every one of those things. - But not then

227
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,940
<9-13,Amber>不是此景
<9-13,Amber>and not like that.

228
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,780
<9-13,Amber>纳络酮让他失去了理智
<9-13,Amber>This guy was going nuts from the naloxone.

229
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,550
<9-13,Amber>只要你想  他就无法保持理性
<9-13,Amber>He couldn't be rational if you wanted him to be,

230
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,460
<9-13,Amber>你还真就想
<9-13,Amber>which you did.

231
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,440
<9-13,Amber>为什么
<9-13,Amber>Why?

232
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,860
<9-14,House>-故事虽略有加工  -情境才是关键
<9-14,House>- I compressed the story a little-- - Context matters.

233
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,610
<9-15,Amber>你从不为与诊断无关的事情跟病人聊天
<9-15,Amber>You never talk to patients for non-diagnostic reasons,

234
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,320
<9-15,Amber>但这个人
<9-15,Amber>but this guy...

235
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,900
<9-16,House>好点了吗
<9-16,House>Feeling better?

236
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,380
<9-17,Oliver>我不会停止吸毒
<9-17,Oliver>I'm not gonna stop doing drugs.

237
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,840
<9-18,House>你以前是股票经纪人
<9-18,House>You were a stockbroker.

238
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,400
<9-18,House>你父亲是股票经纪人
<9-18,House>Son of a stockbroker.

239
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,940
<9-19,Oliver>-你有妻子  有孩子  -我很痛苦
<9-19,Oliver>- Married, children. - I was miserable.

240
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,910
<9-20,House>你说你很痛苦
<9-20,House>Well, you say you were miserable

241
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,150
<9-20,House>是为了给自己的一败涂地找借口
<9-20,House>because you need to rationalize screwing it up.

242
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,540
<9-20,House>我没有找借口
<9-20,House>Except I didn't.

243
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,510
<9-21,Oliver>我是说  我是一败涂地
<9-21,Oliver>I mean, I-I did.

244
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,310
<9-21,Oliver>但我不痛苦了  不再痛苦了
<9-21,Oliver>But I'm not miserable. Not anymore.

245
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,650
<9-21,Oliver>我滑雪受过伤
<9-21,Oliver>I had a ski injury

246
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,110
<9-21,Oliver>而止痛药不够强效
<9-21,Oliver>and painkillers weren't enough,

247
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,430
<9-21,Oliver>一位朋友给了我点海洛因
<9-21,Oliver>and a friend of mine gave me some heroin.

248
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
<9-21,Oliver>毒品一进入我的血管
<9-21,Oliver>The second it entered my veins,

249
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,410
<9-21,Oliver>就好像上帝抚慰了我的身体
<9-21,Oliver>it was like God had taken over my body.

250
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,540
<9-21,Oliver>似乎这世界上所有的痛苦
<9-21,Oliver>It was like there was no more pain

251
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,620
<9-21,Oliver>所有的不幸  都离我远去  离所有人远去
<9-21,Oliver>or unhappiness in my life or anybody else's.

252
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,390
<9-22,House>但之后你失去了一切
<9-22,House>But then you lost everything.

253
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,540
<9-23,Oliver>那所谓的"一切"并不够
<9-23,Oliver>Everything wasn't enough.

254
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,730
<9-23,Oliver>因为现实悲剧透了
<9-23,Oliver>Because it's reality that sucks.

255
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,670
<10-1,Amber>你在辩说他是行为模范吗
<10-1,Amber>Are you arguing that he's a good role model?

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,390
<10-2,House>-他快乐了  -他死了
<10-2,House>- He's happy. - He's dead.

257
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,190
<10-3,Amber>你只听自己想听的
<10-3,Amber>You heard what you wanted to hear.

258
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,190
<10-3,Amber>最有趣的地方
<10-3,Amber>The more interesting question--

259
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,900
<10-3,Amber>永远都是  你为什么想听那些
<10-3,Amber>always--is why you wanted to hear it.

260
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,240
<11-1,Foreman>你在偷吸他的氧气
<11-1,Foreman>You're stealing this guy's oxygen?

261
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,510
<11-2,House>氧气到处都有
<11-2,House>There's oxygen everywhere.

262
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,680
<11-3,Foreman>你把你的病例全移交了
<11-3,Foreman>You passed on all your cases,

263
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,410
<11-3,Foreman>扔给了其他的医生
<11-3,Foreman>reassigned them to other doctors.

264
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,340
<11-4,House>那些病例太无趣了
<11-4,House>They weren't interesting.

265
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,230
<11-5,Foreman>那些病例才是我要推迟对你判决的原因
<11-5,Foreman>They were my reason for getting your sentence delayed!

266
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,440
<11-6,House>是啊  那我看
<11-6,House>Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to tell

267
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,130
<11-6,House>你得跟假释裁决委员会说点别的了
<11-6,House>the parole board something else.

268
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,680
<11-6,House>比如天花板倒塌那天
<11-6,House>Maybe that I was in the O.R.

269
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,260
<11-6,House>我一整天都在手术室
<11-6,House>the entire day the ceiling collapsed,

270
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,430
<11-6,House>所以不可能是我造成的水管问题
<11-6,House>so I couldn't have caused the plumbing problem.

271
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,640
<11-7,Foreman>-你设计我  -也不算啦
<11-7,Foreman>- You set me up. - Not really.

272
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
<11-8,House>你原本就要出庭作"伪证"
<11-8,House>You were going to basically perjure yourself

273
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,480
<11-8,House>好让我推迟入狱
<11-8,House>so that I could delay jail time.

274
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,670
<11-8,House>你干脆出庭作伪证
<11-8,House>Doesn't it make more sense to actually perjure yourself

275
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,010
<11-8,House>好让我不必入狱岂非更好
<11-8,House>so that I can actually avoid jail time?

276
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,310
<11-9,Foreman>你为什么要这么做
<11-9,Foreman>Why are you doing this?

277
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,050
<11-9,Foreman>为什么要冒险自我毁灭
<11-9,Foreman>Why are you risking destroying yourself?

278
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,170
<11-10,House>没什么冒险的  我了解你
<11-10,House>There's no risk. I know you.

279
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,630
<11-10,House>你会如实处事
<11-10,House>You'll do the honest thing.

280
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,080
<11-10,House>你会撒谎
<11-10,House>You'll lie.

281
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,690
<11-11,Foreman>我不会
<11-11,Foreman>No.

282
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,710
<12-1,House>他快乐了
<12-1,House>He's happy.

283
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,840
<12-2,Amber>他死了
<12-2,Amber>He's dead.

284
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,130
<13-1,Amber>你并没有担心
<13-1,Amber>You weren't worried.

285
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,610
<13-2,House>我当然担心了  我的计划失败了
<13-2,House>Of course I was worried. My plan fell through.

286
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,640
<13-3,Amber>计划不是重点
<13-3,Amber>The plan didn't matter.

287
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,840
<13-3,Amber>你的第二个计划也不重要
<13-3,Amber>Your plan to replace that plan didn't matter.

288
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,740
<13-3,Amber>威尔森不重要  监狱不重要
<13-3,Amber>Wilson didn't matter. Jail didn't matter.

289
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,100
<13-3,Amber>唯一要紧的事
<13-3,Amber>The only thing that mattered,

290
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,250
<13-3,Amber>自始至终唯一要紧的事
<13-3,Amber>the only thing that ever mattered,

291
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,760
<13-3,Amber>就是谜题
<13-3,Amber>was the puzzle.

292
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,480
<13-3,Amber>我发现他的鱼际有轻微的抽搐
<13-3,Amber>I noticed a slight twitch in his thenar eminence,

294
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,360
<13-3,Amber>这说明...
<13-3,Amber>which meant...

295
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,650
<14-1,House>你就要死了
<14-1,House>you're dying.

296
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,550
<14-2,Oliver>就因为我拇指抖了一下
<14-2,Oliver>Because my thumb's a little shaky?

297
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,490
<14-3,House>加上拇指上的肌肉萎缩
<14-3,House>Plus the thinning in the muscle,

298
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,800
<14-3,House>加上你在洋基体育场发表的演讲
<14-3,House>plus that speech you gave at yankee stadium

299
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,910
<14-3,House>说什么你是这世上
<14-3,House>saying you were the luckiest man

300
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,190
<14-3,House>最幸运的男人
<14-3,House>on the face of the earth.

301
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,940
<14-3,House>全部加起来就是肌萎缩侧索硬化症
<14-3,House>Add them up, it means ALS.

302
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,480
<14-4,Oliver>鲁盖瑞氏症吗
<14-4,Oliver>Lou Gehrig's disease?

303
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,090
<14-4,Oliver>被自己的身体困住  不能行动不能说话
<14-4,Oliver>You're trapped in your body, you can't move or speak

304
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,350
<14-4,Oliver>就这样死去
<14-4,Oliver>while you just die.

305
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,560
<14-7,House>如果能对你有些安慰
<14-7,House>If it makes you feel any better,

306
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,170
<14-10,Amber>以目前的速度  不会拖太久
<14-10,Amber>at this rate, it'll be fast.

307
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,150
<14-13,House>你的肌力不对称
<14-13,House>You're not symmetrical.

308
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,000
<14-5,House>等等
<14-5,House>Wait.

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,180
<14-6,Amber>现在你站在门前了
<14-6,Amber>Now you're standing at the door.

310
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,540
<14-6,Amber>这之间发生了什么事
<14-6,Amber>What happened in the meantime?

311
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,110
<14-7,House>真难想象  奇迹般的事情发生了
<14-7,House>And lo, there was a miraculous wonder--

312
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,320
<14-7,House>我从房间一头走到了另一头
<14-7,House>I walked across the room.

313
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,150
<14-8,Amber>不  你跳过了一大段的对话
<14-8,Amber>No, you just skipped over a chunk of conversation.

314
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,830
<14-9,House>他发了誓会在所剩时间内
<14-9,House>He swore that he would live a better

315
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,940
<14-9,House>让自己做一个更好更无私的人
<14-9,House>and more selfless life in his remaining time,

316
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,650
<14-9,House>废话连篇
<14-9,House>blah, blah, blah.

317
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,890
<14-9,House>听两句我就受够了
<14-9,House>After two blahs, I'd heard enough.

318
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,970
<14-9,House>走向了门口
<14-9,House>I moved to the door.

319
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,430
<14-10,Amber>不  你是在躲避
<14-10,Amber>No, you're avoiding it.

320
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,900
<14-11,House>你有闻到烟味吗
<14-11,House>Do you smell smoke?

321
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
<14-12,Amber>好吧  这次就算了
<14-12,Amber>Fair enough.

322
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,060
<14-13,House>你的肌力不对称
<14-13,House>You're not symmetrical.

323
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,050
<14-13,House>右侧静脉曲张
<14-13,House>The veins on your right side are distended.

324
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,370
<14-14,Oliver>那是什么意思
<14-14,Oliver>What does that mean?

325
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,290
<14-15,House>锁骨上窝隆起
<14-15,House>There's a bulge in your superclavicular notch.

326
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,520
<14-15,House>里面有东西
<14-15,House>There's something in there.

327
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,730
<14-16,Oliver>什么东西
<14-16,Oliver>What?

328
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,850
<14-17,House>我没你想的那么神奇
<14-17,House>Well, I'm not that good a doctor.

329
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,640
<14-17,House>好消息
<14-17,House>Good news.

330
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,920
<14-17,House>你的病例非常有趣
<14-17,House>Your case is fascinating.

331
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,690
<14-17,House>告诉你个好消息
<14-17,House>And good news for you:

332
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,880
<14-17,House>你会活下来的
<14-17,House>you're gonna live.

333
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,800
<15-1,House>你吸入了一根小小的树枝
<15-1,House>You've inhaled a small branch,

334
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,270
<15-1,House>大概是你晕倒在公园里的长椅上
<15-1,House>probably while you were realizing that it's all

335
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,730
<15-1,House>突然发觉活着还挺有意义的时候
<15-1,House>worth it while you were passed out on a park bench.

336
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,490
<15-1,House>其他人会把它咳出来
<15-1,House>Anyone else would have coughed it up,

337
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,370
<15-1,House>但是因为你吸毒过多
<15-1,House>but 'cause you're a junkie,

338
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,010
<15-1,House>你的咳嗽反射被抑制了
<15-1,House>your cough reflex is suppressed.

339
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,970
<15-2,Oliver>它就这样长大了
<15-2,Oliver>And it grew?

340
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,320
<15-3,House>别傻了  如果你还吸入了太阳
<15-3,House>Not unless you also inhaled a chunk of the sun

341
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,950
<15-3,House>和一个滴灌系统倒是有可能
<15-3,House>and a drip-irrigation system, you idiot.

342
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,560
<15-3,House>只是引发了自身免疫反应  而这
<15-3,House>It set off an auto-immune reaction, which--

343
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,370
<15-3,House>我忍不住得说
<15-3,House>I can't help saying this--

344
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,690
<15-3,House>这就是你问题的"根"本
<15-3,House>Was the root of all your problems.

345
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,750
<15-3,House>你笑了
<15-3,House>You're smiling.

346
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,350
<16-1,Amber>我刚才是笑了  现在没有了
<16-1,Amber>I was, and now I'm not,

347
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,960
<16-2,House>因为几天前一瞬间的乐趣
<16-2,House>because a moment's fun a few days ago

348
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,000
<16-2,House>抵不过友人将死的悲痛
<16-2,House>does not trump a friend dying.

349
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,270
<16-3,Amber>别傻了  乐趣当首  你个白痴
<16-3,Amber>Yeah, it does, you idiot.

350
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,750
<16-3,Amber>他死了之后  你会哭一阵
<16-3,Amber>'Cause after he's dead, you cry for a while,

351
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,510
<16-3,Amber>然后继续做你爱做的事情
<16-3,Amber>and then you go back to doing what you love.

352
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,060
<16-4,House>我治疗过的每一位病患
<16-4,House>Every patient that I've had,

353
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,380
<16-4,House>70年后的今天  他们和威尔森一样都会死
<16-4,House>70 years from now, they'll all be as dead as Wilson.

354
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,330
<16-4,House>谁都会死  治疗他们毫无意义
<16-4,House>Everybody dies. It's meaningless.

355
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,680
<16-5,Amber>但当你解开一个谜题  世界就有了意义
<16-5,Amber>When you solve a puzzle, the world makes sense,

356
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,170
<16-5,Amber>一切自如
<16-5,Amber>everything feels right.

357
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,530
<16-5,Amber>而且你的谜题会源源不断
<16-5,Amber>And you'll always have another one,

358
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,440
<16-5,Amber>因为时时刻刻都有人会得病
<16-5,Amber>because people always get sick.

359
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,030
<16-5,Amber>虽然这想法肤浅  毫无价值
<16-5,Amber>It's shallow and it's insignificant,

360
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,810
<16-5,Amber>但如果你对人命都毫不在乎
<16-5,Amber>but if you don't give a damn if idiots live,

361
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,690
<16-5,Amber>又怎么会介意肤浅呢
<16-5,Amber>why would you possibly give a damn about shallowness?

362
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,250
<16-5,Amber>谜题让你开心
<16-5,Amber>It makes you happy.

363
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,730
<16-5,Amber>你还需要什么呢
<16-5,Amber>And why would you need more than that?

364
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,590
<16-5,Amber>回家吧
<16-5,Amber>Go home.

365
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,980
<17-1,Wilson>福曼
<17-1,Wilson>Foreman!

366
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,440
<17-1,Wilson>豪斯是绝不会让食物就这样馊掉的
<17-1,Wilson>House would never leave food out here rotting for days.

367
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,240
<17-2,Foreman>他的行李箱还在衣橱里
<17-2,Foreman>His suitcases are in his closet.

368
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,730
<17-3,Wilson>要是我们当时换种方式处理此事
<17-3,Wilson>If we had handled this differently--

369
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,810
<17-4,Foreman>我们没有做错
<17-4,Foreman>We did the right thing.

370
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,100
<17-4,Foreman>喂
<17-4,Foreman>Hello?

371
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,580
<17-4,Foreman>我会转告他的会计
<17-4,Foreman>I'll let his accountant know.

372
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,080
<17-4,Foreman>豪斯两晚前没去找一个妓女
<17-4,Foreman>House no-showed on a hooker two nights ago.

373
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,400
<17-5,Wilson>呼出电话
<17-5,Wilson>Outgoing calls.

374
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,930
<17-5,Wilson>妓女
<17-5,Wilson>Hooker...

375
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,200
<17-5,Wilson>我...我没接
<17-5,Wilson>Me... I didn't pick up.

376
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,210
<17-5,Wilson>中餐馆
<17-5,Wilson>Chinese place...

377
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,820
<17-6,Foreman>慢着  这是谁
<17-6,Foreman>Wait, wait, wait. Who's that?

378
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,270
<17-6,Foreman>他打了四通电话
<17-6,Foreman>He called four times.

379
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,890
<17-7,Wilson>不知道
<17-7,Wilson>I don't know.

380
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,920
<18-1,Male Patient>真是场灾难
<18-1,Male Patient>It's a total disaster.

381
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,130
<18-1,Male Patient>我工作时间那么长
<18-1,Male Patient>Do you have any idea how hard it is

382
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,520
<18-1,Male Patient>就连做个有线电视的预约
<18-1,Male Patient>to schedule a cable appointment

383
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
<18-1,Male Patient>都难上青天
<18-1,Male Patient>with the hours that I work?

384
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,790
<18-2,Foreman>豪斯失踪两天了
<18-2,Foreman>House has been missing for two days.

385
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,720
<18-2,Foreman>我们知道他跟你通过话
<18-2,Foreman>We know he talked to you.

386
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,690
<18-3,Wilson>你能告诉我们他的精神状态
<18-3,Wilson>Anything you can tell us about his mental state,

387
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,420
<18-3,Wilson>或去向吗  任何事都行
<18-3,Wilson>or where he was headed-- anything at all--

388
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,940
<18-4,Nolan>那就违反了保密协议  也是违法的
<18-4,Nolan>Would be a breach of confidentiality and a violation of the law.

389
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,260
<18-5,Foreman>除非他可能伤害自己或他人
<18-5,Foreman>Not if he's a danger to himself or someone else.

390
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,380
<18-6,Male Patient>这会从我们的五十分钟里扣吗
<18-6,Male Patient>Is this coming out of our 50 minutes?

391
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,090
<18-7,Foreman>这是你的二逼组吗
<18-7,Foreman>Is this your douche bag group?

392
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,770
<18-8,Nolan>失陪一下
<18-8,Nolan>Excuse me.

393
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,500
<18-9,Nolan>你们为什么认为他会伤害自己
<18-9,Nolan>What makes you think he's a danger to himself?

394
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,440
<18-10,Foreman>他没回家
<18-10,Foreman>He hasn't been home,

395
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,850
<18-10,Foreman>却没随身带走任何东西  连手机都没带
<18-10,Foreman>but he didn't take anything with him, not even his cell.

396
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,100
<18-11,Wilson>你沉默不语
<18-11,Wilson>You're not saying anything,

397
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,270
<18-11,Wilson>说明他没有明确提到过自杀
<18-11,Wilson>which means he didn't specifically mention suicide,

398
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,810
<18-11,Wilson>但你出来跟我们说话
<18-11,Wilson>but you came out here to talk to us,

399
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,310
<18-11,Wilson>那他肯定是说了什么让你担心的话
<18-11,Wilson>so he must have said something that worries you.

400
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,150
<18-12,Nolan>还有其它方式能使人失去意识
<18-12,Nolan>There are other ways of reaching oblivion.

401
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,640
<18-13,Wilson>-维科丁吗  -他一直嗑维科丁
<18-13,Wilson>- Vicodin? - He always has his vicodin.

402
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,160
<18-14,Foreman>他没必要打电话给心理...
<18-14,Foreman>There's no reason to call a shr--

403
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,660
<18-14,Foreman>他最后一个病人是瘾君子
<18-14,Foreman>His last patient was a heroin addict.

404
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,140
<18-15,Nolan>那我们没事了吧
<18-15,Nolan>So I guess we're all done here.

405
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,020
<18-16,Wilson>他的地址肯定在档案里
<18-16,Wilson>The guy's address has gotta be in the file.

406
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,920
<19-1,Stacy>那上帝呢
<19-1,Stacy>What about god?

407
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,440
<19-1,Stacy>你刚才要走的  却又留下了
<19-1,Stacy>You were leaving, and then you stopped.

408
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,740
<19-1,Stacy>为什么
<19-1,Stacy>Why?

409
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,020
<19-2,House>你认为我不走  是因为我信上帝
<19-2,House>Your theory is I'm not leaving, because I believe in god?

410
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,210
<19-2,House>怎么  他喊我回家吃饭了
<19-2,House>What, he's calling me home?

411
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,880
<19-3,Stacy>或许从地板上掉下来是个启示呢
<19-3,Stacy>Maybe falling through that floor was a sign.

412
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,170
<19-3,Stacy>或许这世界恨你  什么的
<19-3,Stacy>Maybe that the universe hates you--something.

413
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,320
<19-3,Stacy>你真的不信吗
<19-3,Stacy>You really don't believe?

414
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,030
<19-3,Stacy>真的吗  在你内心
<19-3,Stacy>Really? Not in some deep crack

415
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,600
<19-4,House>某个阴暗角落的裂口深处  也完全不信吗
<19-4,House>of some remote recess of some dark corner of your mind?

416
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,920
<19-4,House>没有
<19-4,House>No.

417
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,530
<19-4,House>但我内心
<19-4,House>Except that some deep crack

418
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,670
<19-4,House>某个阴暗角落的裂口深处
<19-4,House>of some remote recess of some dark corner

419
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,770
<19-4,House>-有个声音在对我说  -这就足够了
<19-4,House>- is here telling me- - That's enough.

420
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,140
<19-5,Stacy>在一栋燃烧的大楼里
<19-5,Stacy>In a burning building,

421
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,700
<19-5,Stacy>死亡步步逼近  这就足够了
<19-5,Stacy>facing imminent death, that's more than enough.

422
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,630
<19-5,Stacy>帕斯卡的赌注认为人应信上帝
<19-5,Stacy>但是上帝是否真的存在永不得而知

423
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,630
<19-6,House>帕斯卡的赌注就是小聪明
<19-6,House>Pascal's wager is facile.

424
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,930
<19-7,Stacy>说他耍小聪明也是一种小聪明
<19-7,Stacy>Saying it's facile is facile.

425
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,480
<19-7,Stacy>为什么就不对
<19-7,Stacy>Why is it wrong?

426
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,250
<19-7,Stacy>别那么理智  绝望一点
<19-7,Stacy>And don't be logical. Be desperate.

427
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,900
<19-7,Stacy>你总得有个支撑
<19-7,Stacy>You gotta have something to hold on to.

428
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,330
<19-8,House>你不能把人生建构在你不相信的东西上
<19-8,House>You can't live your life based on something you don't believe.

429
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,100
<19-9,Stacy>那你就能为你不信的东西结束生命了吗
<19-9,Stacy>But you can end your life based on something you don't believe?

430
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,430
<19-9,Stacy>那么爱呢
<19-9,Stacy>What about love?

431
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,600
<19-9,Stacy>我曾跟你生活多年
<19-9,Stacy>I lived with you for years.

432
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,660
<19-9,Stacy>我知道你相信爱
<19-9,Stacy>I know you believe in love.

433
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,050
<20-1,House>福曼不肯帮我
<20-1,House>Foreman wouldn't help me,

434
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,450
<20-1,House>所以我需要你替我顶罪
<20-1,House>which means I need you to take the fall.

435
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,010
<20-2,Wilson>你还记得我就要死了吧
<20-2,Wilson>You do remember I'm dying, right?

436
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,320
<20-3,House>所以说你能免去牢狱之灾
<20-3,House>Which is why you will never spend a day in jail.

437
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,850
<20-3,House>没前科又受癌症折磨
<20-3,House>Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden.

438
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,560
<20-3,House>同时做到两者不容易  你还是做到了
<20-3,House>It's tough to do both, but you pull it off.

439
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,360
<20-4,Wilson>那些球票上都是你的指纹
<20-4,Wilson>Your fingerprints are all over those hockey tickets.

440
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,860
<20-5,House>但我没承认冲下过任何东西
<20-5,House>I never admitted to flushing anything.

441
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,090
<20-5,House>有我指纹能说得通
<20-5,House>My prints make sense

442
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,400
<20-5,House>比如我把票给了你
<20-5,House>if I gave those tickets to you

443
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,610
<20-5,House>激励你活下去
<20-5,House>as an incentive to stay alive.

444
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,180
<20-6,Wilson>而你不尊重我寻死的意愿令我勃然大怒
<20-6,Wilson>And I was so angry that you didn't respect my dying wishes,

445
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,420
<20-6,Wilson>以至于把上千元的季票
<20-6,Wilson>I took thousands of dollars of season tickets

446
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,740
<20-6,Wilson>冲下下水道吗
<20-6,Wilson>and flushed them down toilets?

447
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,710
<20-7,House>你只需要制造合理疑点
<20-7,House>All you have to do is create reasonable doubt.

448
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,940
<20-8,Wilson>好啊  如果我做过头了呢
<20-8,Wilson>Great, what if I do more than that?

449
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,280
<20-8,Wilson>如果我进了班房呢
<20-8,Wilson>What if I end up in jail?

450
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,040
<20-8,Wilson>或是浪费最后的时光在各种听证会上了呢
<20-8,Wilson>Or spending my final months in endless hearings?

451
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,700
<20-9,House>那是你甘愿冒的险
<20-9,House>That is a risk you are willing to take.

452
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,820
<20-10,Wilson>我是有声誉的
<20-10,Wilson>I have a reputation.

453
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,320
<20-10,Wilson>我还能留下...
<20-10,Wilson>I have a legacy that could--

454
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,620
<20-10,Wilson>威尔森
<20-10,Wilson>Wilson...

455
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,560
<20-11,House>我不想失去有你在的最后时光
<20-11,House>I don't want to lose this time with you.

456
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,770
<20-12,Wilson>好吧
<20-12,Wilson>Okay.

457
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,850
<20-13,House>谢谢
<20-13,House>Thanks.

458
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,310
<20-13,House>就知道我能指望你
<20-13,House>I knew I could count on you.

459
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,730
<20-14,Wilson>等等  等等
<20-14,Wilson>Wait! Wait.

460
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,500
<20-15,House>想要回你的薯条吗
<20-15,House>You want the fries back?

461
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,670
<20-16,Wilson>我不会替你顶罪的
<20-16,Wilson>I'm not gonna take the fall.

462
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,780
<20-17,House>别这么对我  威尔森
<20-17,House>Don't do this to me, Wilson.

463
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,480
<20-17,House>这是我们唯一的选择
<20-17,House>This is our only option.

464
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,540
<20-18,Wilson>没错  因为你跟福曼玩过火了
<20-18,Wilson>Exactly, because you overplayed your hand with Foreman,

465
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,620
<20-18,Wilson>因为你知道还有我能给你擦屁股
<20-18,Wilson>because you knew you had me as a backstop.

466
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,030
<20-18,Wilson>我都要死了
<20-18,Wilson>Even with me dying,

467
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,400
<20-18,Wilson>你也想当然地认为我会助你脱离窘境
<20-18,Wilson>you just assumed I'd be here to bail you out.

468
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,290
<20-19,House>可你的确来了
<20-19,House>Since you're here,

469
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,490
<20-19,House>也打算帮我脱离窘境
<20-19,House>and you are bailing me out,

470
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,190
<20-19,House>看来我想得没错啊
<20-19,House>seems like a pretty safe assumption.

471
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,430
<20-20,Wilson>很快我就不在了
<20-20,Wilson>I won't be here soon.

472
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,070
<20-20,Wilson>我要是帮了你  就是在教你
<20-20,Wilson>If I do this, I'm teaching you

473
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,300
<20-20,Wilson>你做错事还总能得到甜头
<20-20,Wilson>that your bad behavior will always be rewarded.

474
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,570
<20-20,Wilson>你需要学会
<20-20,Wilson>You need to learn--

475
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
<20-21,House>你不在了要如何处事吗
<20-21,House>How to act when you're gone?

476
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,970
<20-21,House>如果这就是我要长的教训
<20-21,House>'cause if that's the lesson,

477
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,410
<20-21,House>我们马上就有个不错的机会
<20-21,House>we got a really great opportunity coming up.

478
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,710
<20-22,Wilson>出了事你只会找别人帮忙
<20-22,Wilson>You'll just try to find someone else,

479
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,950
<20-22,Wilson>但那没用  也不该有用
<20-22,Wilson>and it won't work, and it shouldn't work!

480
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,250
<20-23,House>这就是你要传授给我的真知灼见吗
<20-23,House>So that's the great wisdom you're imparting?

481
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,020
<20-23,House>我永远都会孤身一人
<20-23,House>That I'll always be alone?

482
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,520
<20-24,Wilson>这世上你只能指望一个人
<20-24,Wilson>There's only one person you can count on.

483
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,190
<20-25,House>我还以为有两个
<20-25,House>I thought there were two.

484
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,160
<20-26,Wilson>我必须这么做...
<20-26,Wilson>I need to do this...

485
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,610
<20-26,Wilson>为了你好
<20-26,Wilson>for you.

486
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,630
<21-1,Stacy>威尔森是对的
<21-1,Stacy>Wilson's right.

487
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,880
<21-1,Stacy>他一直是对的
<21-1,Stacy>He's always right.

488
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,180
<21-1,Stacy>他总是充当你的善心[好看的一面]
<21-1,Stacy>He's always been your good side.

489
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,050
<21-2,House>怪不得我照相总那么难看
<21-2,House>I always wondered why I photographed so poorly.

490
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,820
<21-3,Stacy>因为他总是做大好人
<21-3,Stacy>And because he's always played that role,

491
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,410
<21-3,Stacy>所以你从来不用长良心
<21-3,Stacy>you've never had to develop a conscience of your own.

492
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,690
<21-4,House>人是不会变的
<21-4,House>People don't change.

493
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,890
<21-4,House>良心也不会自己长出来
<21-4,House>Consciences don't spontaneously develop.

494
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,760
<21-5,Stacy>你错了  格雷戈
<21-5,Stacy>You're wrong, Greg.

495
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,330
<21-5,Stacy>所以说...
<21-5,Stacy>Which is...

496
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
<21-5,Stacy>没有他  对你反而更好
<21-5,Stacy>why you'll be better off without him.

497
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,080
<21-5,Stacy>你一直依赖他
<21-5,Stacy>You've been looking to him

498
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,440
<21-5,Stacy>来寻找你自身的东西
<21-5,Stacy>to find what you have gotta find within yourself.

499
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,550
<21-5,Stacy>这是你能找到的
<21-5,Stacy>Something you can find.

500
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,670
<21-6,Stacy>抱抱你的孩子
<21-6,Stacy>Hold your child.

501
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,800
<21-7,House>这正是我该去死的理由
<21-7,House>This is a reason to die.

502
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,320
<21-7,House>我的人生本可如此
<21-7,House>This is what my life could've been,

503
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,890
<21-7,House>现在却不可能了
<21-7,House>not what it can be.

504
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,410
<21-8,Stacy>既然曾经可能
<21-8,Stacy>If it could've been,

505
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,760
<21-8,Stacy>现在也为时不晚
<21-8,Stacy>you're capable of it now.

506
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,570
<21-9,House>你结婚了  卡迪走了
<21-9,House>You're married. Cuddy's gone.

507
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,280
<21-10,Stacy>世上并不只有我们两个人会爱你
<21-10,Stacy>We aren't the only two people who could love you.

508
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,950
<21-11,House>干嘛就这么容易满足
<21-11,House>Why settle so easily?

509
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,990
<21-11,House>这些只是不切实际的幻想...
<21-11,House>These are just idiotic fantasies...

510
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,340
<21-12,Stacy>格雷戈  不要
<21-12,Stacy>Greg, don't.

511
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,960
<21-13,House>跟我身体里的全部理智做斗争
<21-13,House>...at odds with every logical bone in my body.

512
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,730
<21-14,Stacy>起来
<21-14,Stacy>Get up.

513
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,420
<21-14,Stacy>你犯不着死在这里
<21-14,Stacy>You do not have to die in here!

514
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,610
<22-1,House>这就是地狱吗
<22-1,House>Is this hell?

515
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,290
<22-1,House>永远都有人跑来劝我活下去
<22-1,House>An eternity of people trying to convince me to live?

516
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,590
<22-2,Cameron>谁说我是来劝你活下去的
<22-2,Cameron>Who says I'm here to convince you to live?

517
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,920
<22-2,Cameron>真没想到你竟然会恨我
<22-2,Cameron>You're the last one I thought would hate me.

518
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,040
<23-1,House>我不恨你
<23-1,House>I don't hate you.

519
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,260
<23-2,Cameron>我爱你
<23-2,Cameron>I love you.

520
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,800
<23-3,House>但你认为我应该去死
<23-3,House>And yet you think I deserve to die.

521
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,110
<23-4,Cameron>但不是作为惩罚
<23-4,Cameron>But not as a punishment.

522
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,420
<23-4,Cameron>而是作为奖励
<23-4,Cameron>As a reward.

523
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,220
<23-4,Cameron>我认为...你经受得够多了
<23-4,Cameron>I think... you've suffered enough.

524
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,180
<23-4,Cameron>也付出得够多了
<23-4,Cameron>You've given enough.

525
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,800
<23-4,Cameron>我认为你应该获得一个...
<23-4,Cameron>I think you deserve a chance to just...

526
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,020
<23-4,Cameron>放弃的机会
<23-4,Cameron>give up.

527
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,670
<23-5,House>就像威尔森那样
<23-5,House>Like Wilson did?

528
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,690
<23-5,House>就像威尔森那样
<23-5,House>Like Wilson did.

529
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,200
<23-6,Cameron>你接受了他的选择
<23-6,Cameron>You accepted his choice,

530
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,470
<23-6,Cameron>结束痛苦好过忍受痛苦
<23-6,Cameron>that ending the pain was better than the pain.

531
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,150
<23-6,Cameron>为什么你不能如此厚待自己呢
<23-6,Cameron>Why can't you give yourself that gift?

532
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,580
<24-1,Foreman>这就是豪斯的病人给的地址吗
<24-1,Foreman>This is the address House's patient gave?

533
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,670
<24-2,Wilson>看来人人都撒谎
<24-2,Wilson>Everybody lies.

534
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,850
<24-2,Wilson>闻到烟味了吗
<24-2,Wilson>You smell smoke?

535
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,980
<24-2,Wilson>放手吧
<24-2,Wilson>Just let go.

536
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,440
<25-1,Cameron>就这样睡去
<25-1,Cameron>Just go to sleep.

537
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,020
<25-2,House>我本有机会避免这一切的
<25-2,House>I had a chance to avoid this.

538
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,670
<25-3,Cameron>你有过很多机会  但你把它们都毁了
<25-3,Cameron>You had many chances, and you blew them all up.

539
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,820
<25-4,House>不  这次不一样
<25-4,House>No, this was different.

540
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,410
<25-5,Cameron>每次都不一样
<25-5,Cameron>They're all different,

541
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,170
<25-5,Cameron>但理由都是一样的
<25-5,Cameron>but the reasons are all the same.

542
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,330
<25-5,Cameron>你傲慢  有自毁倾向
<25-5,Cameron>You're arrogant. You're self-destructive.

543
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,600
<25-5,Cameron>你只关心你自己
<25-5,Cameron>You only care about yourself.

544
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,550
<25-6,House>和病人一起的时候
<25-6,House>That moment with the patient...

545
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,890
<25-6,House>我跳过的那段对话
<25-6,House>The chunk of the conversation I skipped over...

546
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,540
<25-6,House>我告诉他他就要死了
<25-6,House>I told him he was dying.

547
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,340
<26-1,House>如果能对你有些安慰
<26-1,House>If it makes you feel any better,

548
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,210
<26-1,House>以目前的速度  不会拖太久
<26-1,House>at this rate, it'll be fast.

549
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,800
<26-2,Oliver>我替你顶罪吧
<26-2,Oliver>Let me take the fall.

550
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,360
<26-2,Oliver>你的那个恶作剧
<26-2,Oliver>For you, for that prank.

551
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,910
<26-3,House>你不欠我什么
<26-3,House>You don't owe me anything.

552
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,280
<26-4,Oliver>-你努力救过我  -但我失败了
<26-4,Oliver>- You tried to save me. - I failed.

553
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,310
<26-5,House>动机不重要  重要的是行动
<26-5,House>Motives don't matter. Only actions.

554
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,120
<26-6,Oliver>努力也是一种行动
<26-6,Oliver>Trying is an action.

555
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,020
<26-6,Oliver>你为什么还要劝我别帮你
<26-6,Oliver>Why are you trying to talk me out of this?

556
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,290
<26-6,Oliver>你只管伪造记录
<26-6,Oliver>You just fake the records.

557
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,740
<26-6,Oliver>说我是上周来看的门诊
<26-6,Oliver>You say I came into the clinic last week.

558
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,260
<26-6,Oliver>我就告诉警察  你态度恶劣
<26-6,Oliver>I'll tell the cops you treated me like crap,

559
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,660
<26-6,Oliver>所以我偷了你的票冲进下水道
<26-6,Oliver>so I stole your tickets and flushed 'em.

560
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,890
<26-7,House>谢谢
<26-7,House>Thank you.

561
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,790
<26-7,House>你是因为要死了才帮的我
<26-7,House>And you're doing this because you're dying?

562
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,360
<26-8,Oliver>我这样做是因为我没什么可失去的了
<26-8,Oliver>I'm doing this because I have nothing left to lose.

563
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,290
<26-9,House>你活得好好的时候从不帮助任何人
<26-9,House>So when you were living, you did nothing for anyone

564
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,000
<26-9,House>也毫不在意  现在你要死了
<26-9,House>and you didn't care. Now that you're dying,

565
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,590
<26-9,House>倒乐意对陌生人伸出援手
<26-9,House>you're willing to help a virtual stranger.

566
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,000
<26-9,House>垂死之际  你变得比以往任何时候都善良
<26-9,House>Which means you're a better person dying than you ever were living,

567
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,330
<26-9,House>我没能救你反倒令世界更美好
<26-9,House>and the world is a better place because I didn't save you.

568
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,870
<26-9,House>令我不禁怀疑自己为什么要告诉你
<26-9,House>Which makes me wonder why I'm about to tell you...

569
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,140
<26-9,House>你的肌力不对称
<26-9,House>You're not symmetrical.

570
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,190
<26-10,Cameron>你想说明什么
<26-10,Cameron>What's your point?

571
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,960
<26-10,Cameron>你关心他胜过你自己吗
<26-10,Cameron>That you cared about him more than you cared about yourself?

572
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,000
<26-10,Cameron>你是关心谜题胜过关心自己
<26-10,Cameron>You cared about the puzzle more than you cared about yourself.

573
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,140
<26-11,House>我要是没说
<26-11,House>If I kept it to myself,

574
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,820
<26-11,House>那就仅仅是个谜题
<26-11,House>then it would just be a puzzle,

575
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,300
<26-11,House>可我既然开了口  就是因为不止如此
<26-11,House>but I opened my mouth because I thought it was more.

576
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,370
<26-12,Cameron>你知道根本没有差别
<26-12,Cameron>You know it's the same,

577
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,630
<26-12,Cameron>不然你就不会火烧到脚下
<26-12,Cameron>or you wouldn't be bickering with me

578
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,840
<26-12,Cameron>还在和我争吵
<26-12,Cameron>while the flames lick at your feet.

579
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,810
<26-12,Cameron>你害怕这个决定
<26-12,Cameron>You're afraid of this decision,

580
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,440
<26-12,Cameron>不停与我争辩不过是想拖到无路可走
<26-12,Cameron>and you are trying to argue until fate takes it out of your hands.

581
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,680
<26-12,Cameron>你选了一种懦弱的方式
<26-12,Cameron>You're taking the cowardly way out.

582
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,330
<26-12,Cameron>更糟糕的是
<26-12,Cameron>And worse...

583
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,360
<26-12,Cameron>你懦弱到甚至不敢承认
<26-12,Cameron>You're too cowardly to even admit

584
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,720
<26-12,Cameron>你的选择有多懦弱
<26-12,Cameron>you're taking the cowardly way out.

585
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,040
<27-1,House>你说对了
<27-1,House>You're right.

586
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,610
<27-1,House>但我还能改变
<27-1,House>But I can change.

587
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,570
<27-1,House>他本可以出来的
<27-1,House>He could've gotten out.

588
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,690
<28-1,Adams>也不是没可能幸存  即便是在...
<28-1,Adams>People are found sometimes, even in...

589
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,410
<28-2,Park>倒塌的...
<28-2,Park>collapsed...

590
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,370
<28-3,Taub>好像找到了一具尸体
<28-3,Taub>I think they're pulling a body out.

591
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,280
<28-3,Taub>法医确认是他
<28-3,Taub>Coroner confirms it's him.

592
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,780
<28-3,Taub>走投无路时是他聘用了我
<28-3,Taub>House hired me when no one else would.

593
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,360
<30-1,Park>他害我被解雇
<30-1,Park>He got me fired.

594
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,680
<30-2,Adams>他给了我被解雇的勇气
<30-2,Adams>He gave me the guts to get fired.

595
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,060
<30-3,Masters>他给了我辞职的勇气
<30-3,Masters>He gave me the courage to quit.

596
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,220
<30-4,Blythe>格利高里...
<30-4,Blythe>Gregory was...

597
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,910
<30-4,Blythe>他是个好儿子
<30-4,Blythe>He was a good son.

598
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,560
<30-5,Stacy>他是个讨人厌的男友
<30-5,Stacy>He was a trying boyfriend,

599
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,540
<30-5,Stacy>可是我
<30-5,Stacy>but I...

600
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,390
<30-5,Stacy>从没停止过爱他
<30-5,Stacy>never stopped loving him.

601
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,630
<30-6,Dominika>他是我真正意义上的丈夫
<30-6,Dominika>He was my husband for real.

602
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,880
<30-6,Dominika>我无法自拔地爱上了他
<30-6,Dominika>I couldn't help but love him.

603
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,890
<30-7,Foreman>他是我上司
<30-7,Foreman>He was my boss.

604
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,910
<30-7,Foreman>后来又成了我的下属
<30-7,Foreman>And my employee.

605
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,800
<30-7,Foreman>无论何时
<30-7,Foreman>And both times...

606
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,960
<30-7,Foreman>我都能从他身上学到东西
<30-7,Foreman>I learned from him.

607
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,730
<30-8,Taub>他让我成为了更好的父亲
<30-8,Taub>He made me a better parent,

<30-11,Cameron>但在内心深处
<30-11,Cameron>But somewhere in there...

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,780
<30-13,Wilson>豪斯就是个混蛋
<30-13,Wilson>House was an ass.

<30-13,Wilson>所有达不到他心里疯狂的正直标准的人
<30-13,Wilson>anyone who didn't measure up to his insane ideals of integrity.

<30-13,Wilson>他声称自己勇于探索真相
<30-13,Wilson>He claimed to be on some heroic quest for truth,
