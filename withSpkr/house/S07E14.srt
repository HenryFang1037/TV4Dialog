204
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,340

209
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,070
<7-3,Foreman >我们没有测试他是否对麻醉药过敏
<7-3,Foreman >We didn't test for an allergic reaction to narcotics.

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,730
<8-4,Chase >从没见过烧得这么快的
<8-4,Chase >Never seen a fever spike this fast before.

218
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,580
<8-5,Masters >硼酸灼伤的只是表面  不应该导致发烧
<8-5,Masters >Acid exposure burns literally. It shouldn't be causing this.

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,180
<8-7,Masters >我们得立刻让他退烧

222
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,140
<8-7,Masters >如果体温再升高
<8-7,Masters >If it gets any higher,

223
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,680
<8-7,Masters >就可能导致永久脑损伤

<9-1,Chase >我们用冷却毯把他的体温降下来了

<9-1,Chase >稳定在39度

226
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,440
<9-2,Masters >不是硼酸的问题
<9-2,Masters >Problem's not boric acid.

<9-4,Taub >我们在他办公室里发现了维科丁
<9-4,Taub >We found vicodin in his office.

232
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,100
<8-3,Bert >给我
<8-3,Bert >Give it to me.

233
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,240
<8-4,Chase >看着像维科丁的也有可能不是
<8-4,Chase >Might look like vicodin but be something else.

234
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,140
<8-5,Masters >是它没错
<8-5,Masters >It's real.

235
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,050
<8-6,Diane >很遗憾
<8-6,Diane >Unfortunately...

236
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,170
<8-7,Masters >维科丁不会引起皮疹  发烧和关节痛
<8-7,Masters >his vicodin doesn't cause rash, fever, and joint pain.

237
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,250
<12-6,Foreman >不过确实能让陶博显得不那么烦人了
<12-6,Foreman >Does make Taub considerably less annoying, though.

238
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,610
<9-5,Foreman >也许我们想得太复杂了
<9-5,Foreman >Maybe we're thinking too far outside the box here.

239
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,570
<9-5,Foreman >他的工作有可能暗含着
<9-5,Foreman >Just because he could have picked up

<9-5,Foreman >一百种外来病  这就代表
<9-5,Foreman >any one of a hundred exotic diseases from his job

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,420
<9-5,Foreman >他很难幸免于难

<9-6,House >最初的抗生素治疗反而使他的病情更糟了
<9-6,House >Started treatment with antibiotics, and he got worse.

<9-6,House >最简单的答案就是以M开头Mia结尾的病

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,380

<11-3,House >Don't you think she deserves more

290
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,000

<11-3,House >更有价值的东西吗

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,060
<11-4,Wilson >都是陈词滥调

<11-6,Wilson >You mean screwing this up for cuddy

298
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,660
<11-6,Wilson >这样卡迪就不会再妄想让你去类似场合了
<11-6,Wilson >so she won't even dream of asking you to go to one again.

<14-6,Chase >There'd have to be a cause,

342

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,880
<17-4,Bert >为什么我...  出不去
<17-4,Bert >Why can't I...get out?

419
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,310
<18-1,Masters >皮疹消失了
<18-1,Masters >Skin rash is gone.

420
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,230
<18-1,Masters >但不管是什么
<18-1,Masters >But whatever it is,

421
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,710
<18-1,Masters >很显然已经波及到他的大脑了
<18-1,Masters >it obviously moved into his brain.

422
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,200
<18-2,Foreman >不一定
<18-2,Foreman >Or not.

423
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
<18-3,Masters >他刚发作了一次精神崩溃
<18-3,Masters >He had a psychotic break.

424
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,210
<18-3,Masters >要我说这通常说明有神经性的疾病
<18-3,Masters >I'd say that usually indicates neurological involvement.

425
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,900
<18-4,Foreman >通常  又不是一定
<18-4,Foreman >Usually. Not always.

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,480
<18-4,Foreman >清理系统的时候他的幻觉就停止了
<18-4,Foreman >once the steroids we gave him cleared his system.

428
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,610
<18-4,Foreman >我认为
<18-4,Foreman >I think that--

429
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,020
<18-4,Foreman >我认为是我们引起的
<18-4,Foreman >I think we caused this.

430
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,530
<18-5,Chase >你怎么了
<18-5,Chase >What happened to you?

431
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,130
<18-6,Foreman >陶博昨晚想杀我

432
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,190
<18-7,Masters >类固醇可能确实清除了皮疹
<18-7,Masters >The steroids probably did clear up the rash,

433
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,630
<18-7,Masters >但其他症状还是没有好转
<18-7,Masters >but the rest of his symptoms are the same.

434
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,580
<18-8,Chase >而且现在两只眼睛都有了结膜炎
<18-8,Chase >And now bilateral conjunctivitis.

<19-1,House >Seriously?

441
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,260
<19-2,Taub >怎么  你们粑粑的时候不能思考吗
<19-2,Taub >What, you two can't think and poop at the same time?

442
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,780
<19-2,Taub >病人可是危在旦夕啊

<19-4,Chase >the skin and eye involvement,

449
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,810
<19-4,Chase >更像是系统性真菌感染
<19-4,Chase >it's more likely a systemic fungal infection.

450
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,560
<19-5,Masters >那早就该在血液检查里看出来了
<19-5,Masters >Well, we would have seen it in his blood work.

451

<20-6,Chase >我们开始给他用肠胃外抗菌疗法

480
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,960
<20-10,Diane >我们邻居都没有

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,960
<24-2,Cuddy >原因你懂的
<24-2,Cuddy >Well, you know the because.

00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,570
<24-3,Wilson >你觉得豪斯会让你丢脸
<24-3,Wilson >You think House is going to embarrass you.

561
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,980
<24-4,Cuddy >可能不是有意的

562
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,110
<24-5,Wilson >-也可能是有意的  -我知道你的意思

<24-6,Cuddy >实际上  这倒还能接受
<24-6,Cuddy >Well, actually, I could get behind that.

566
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,720
<24-6,Cuddy >我去年就想请一个
<24-6,Cuddy >I tried to hire one last year,

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,680
<24-6,Cuddy >但董事会不让
<24-6,Cuddy >but the board wouldn't let me

568
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,660
<24-6,Cuddy >因为他们觉得太贵了
<24-6,Cuddy >because they thought it was too expensive.

569
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,170
<25-1,Bert >我好冷

<25-3,Masters >她不会回来了  我不会骗他的
<25-3,Masters >She's not coming back. I'm not gonna lie to him.

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,930
<25-5,Chase >他两个肾都被烤熟了
<25-5,Chase >Both his kidneys are fried.

581
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,860
<26-1,Chase >他正处于昏迷状态
<26-1,Chase >He's in a coma.

582
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,020
<26-2,Taub >可能只剩几天了
<26-2,Taub >He has maybe a few days left.

583
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,130
<26-3,Chase >我们可以试试把他放到器官移植名单上
<26-3,Chase >We can try and get him on the transplant list,

584
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,010
<26-3,Chase >但就他现在的情况  又没有确诊
<26-3,Chase >but in his condition and without a diagnosis,

585
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,120
<26-3,Chase >我想他不会被选上的
<26-3,Chase >I don't see him getting selected.

586
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,070
<26-4,Masters >他也撑不下来手术的
<26-4,Masters >He wouldn't survive the surgery.

587
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,840
<26-5,Chase >符合我刚才的结论
<26-5,Chase >Hence my previous comment.

<26-6,Foreman>你希望我们怎么做  豪斯
<26-6,Foreman>What do you want us to do, House?

00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,140
<26-7,House >用射线轰他的脑袋
<26-7,House >Bombard his head with radiation.

591
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,600
<26-8,Foreman >在这个状态下  可能会害死他
<26-8,Foreman >Which will probably kill him in this state.

592
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,620
<26-9,Chase >而且没做核磁共振
<26-9,Chase >And without an MRI,

593
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,510
<26-9,Chase >我们都不确定他是不是有肿瘤
<26-9,Chase >we don't even know if he has one.

594
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,090
<26-10,House >但我们什么都不做他肯定会死
<26-10,House >He's definitely dead if we do nothing.

<26-10,House >如果我错了

<26-12,House >Masters will get it.

599
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,150
<26-13,Chase >恐怕不是个好主意

604
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,880
<27-3,Chase >咋了
<27-3,Chase >Why?

605
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,150
<27-4,Masters >我一直把恋爱交友搁置一旁
<27-4,Masters >I put making friends and having relationships on hold

606
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,530
<27-4,Masters >就为了能一心扑在学业上
<27-4,Masters >so I could concentrate on studying.
