65
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,910
<3-19,Thirteen>不代表它们就不存在

69
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,430

<4-8,Darrien>安德烈得想法子拖住警察

<4-11,Darrien>我知道我说过他不好
<4-11,Darrien>I know what I told you about him,

88
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,940
<4-11,Darrien>不过我又开始吸毒不是他的错
<4-11,Darrien>but it's not his fault I started using again.

89
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,170
<4-11,Darrien>怪我自己

<4-15,Thirteen>你一直在说话  神志清楚
<4-15,Thirteen>You're talking and alert,

96
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,810
<4-15,Thirteen>就是说你脑部供血正常
<4-15,Thirteen>so your brain is getting blood.

97
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,260
<4-16,Thirteen>右上肢脉搏没问题

<5-6,Thirteen>take a look at it till tomorrow morning,

110
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,520

<22-5,Chase>有痉挛现象

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,780
<14-24,Thirteen>双腿僵直
<14-24,Thirteen>Their legs would stiffen up.

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,360
<14-25,Chase>行动出现困难
<14-25,Chase>They were having trouble moving around.

124
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,250
<14-26,Chase>我们还以为是它们的机体
<14-26,Chase>We just thought their bodies

125
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,030
<14-27,Chase>正在适应新生的肌肉
<14-27,Chase>were adjusting to the increase in muscle mass,

<7-3,Chase>And, unfortunately, so is your shirt,

135
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,980
<7-3,Chase>说明要么是你为了见我而特地更衣
<7-3,Chase>which means you either just changed to greet me,

136
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,840
<7-3,Chase>要么是你打算用它救人
<7-3,Chase>or you need this for something medical.

<8-2,Thirteen>是  那是一段不堪回首的经历
<8-2,Thirteen>Yes. It was awful and devastating,

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,040
<8-2,Thirteen>但那不是谋杀
<8-2,Thirteen>but it wasn't murder.

143
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,560
<8-2,Thirteen>他病了  但求一死
<8-2,Thirteen>He was sick and he wanted to die,

144
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,240
<8-2,Thirteen>而我保证过会帮他
<8-2,Thirteen>and I promised I would help.

145
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,570
<8-2,Thirteen>别再走来走去了
<8-2,Thirteen>Now please stop pacing

146
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,030
<8-2,Thirteen>来帮我找找是哪里出了问题
<8-2,Thirteen>and help me find this thing.

147
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,430
<8-3,Chase>你跟其他人谈过吗
<8-3,Chase>Have you talked to anybody about it?

148
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,660
<8-3,Chase>我是说  你还好吗
<8-3,Chase>I mean, are you okay?

149
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,650
<8-4,Thirteen>不好  我可能有主动脉弓动脉瘤
<8-4,Thirteen>No, I may have an aortic arch aneurysm.

150
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,070
<8-4,Thirteen>等等  应该是她
<8-4,Thirteen>Oh, wait, that's her.

151
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,960
<8-4,Thirteen>要不来帮忙  要不请离开
<8-4,Thirteen>Either help me or leave.

152
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,950
<8-5,Thirteen>我看不清楚
<8-5,Thirteen>Having trouble getting a clear look.

153
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,760
<8-6,Chase>试试从胸骨上部看纵向切面的图像
<8-6,Chase>Try a long axis view from the suprasternal notch.

154
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,820
<8-7,Thirteen>等下  戴上手套  她有丙肝
<8-7,Thirteen>Wait! Put on some gloves. She's got Hep-C.

155
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,570
<8-8,Chase>太妙了
<8-8,Chase>Wonderful.

156
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,060
<8-8,Chase>你们两个是狱友吗
<8-8,Chase>Take it you two were cell mates.

157
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,300
<8-9,Darrien>朋友而已
<8-9,Darrien>Just friends.

158
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,260
<8-10,Thirteen>她有恩于我
<8-10,Thirteen>She saved me.

159
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,090
<8-10,Thirteen>牢中自有牢规
<8-10,Thirteen>There's a culture in prison.

160
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,900
<8-10,Thirteen>如果没人告诉你
<8-10,Thirteen>If you don't have someone to show you

161
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,440
<8-10,Thirteen>如何获取所需
<8-10,Thirteen>how to get the stuff you need

162
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,550
<8-10,Thirteen>如何远离风险
<8-10,Thirteen>and stay away from the stuff you don't,

163
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,210
<8-10,Thirteen>你就惨了
<8-10,Thirteen>you're screwed.

164
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,420
<8-11,Chase>她的手指发绀
<8-11,Chase>Her fingers are turning blue.

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,680
<8-11,Chase>你能活动下手指吗
<8-11,Chase>Can you move those?

166
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,390
<8-12,Darrien>我胳膊麻了
<8-12,Darrien>My arm's starting to go numb.

167
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,680
<8-13,Thirteen>主动脉弓没问题
<8-13,Thirteen>Arch of aorta's clear.

168
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,190
<8-13,Thirteen>这不可能是动脉瘤
<8-13,Thirteen>This can't be an aneurysm.

169
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,790
<8-14,Chase>或许是从伤口脱落的血凝块
<8-14,Chase>Maybe the wound threw a clot.

170
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,390
<8-14,Chase>检查下腋动脉
<8-14,Chase>Check axillary arteries.

171
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,850
<8-15,Chase>停  就在那里
<8-15,Chase>Stop. Right there.

172
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,910
<8-16,Thirteen>是个直径五厘米边界模糊的肿块
<8-16,Thirteen>5 centimeter gooey mass.

173
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,700
<8-16,Thirteen>不是血凝块  会不会是脂肪瘤
<8-16,Thirteen>Not a clot. Maybe a lipoma?

174
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,900
<8-17,Darrien>那是什么
<8-17,Darrien>What the hell is that?

175
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,820
<8-18,Chase>一堆脂肪
<8-18,Chase>Fat-filled sack.

176
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,610
<8-18,Chase>大概是受外伤刺激而变大的
<8-18,Chase>Probably aggravated by the stab wound.

177
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,620
<8-18,Chase>你有注射器吗
<8-18,Chase>You got any syringes in here?

178
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
<8-19,Thirteen>我来找
<8-19,Thirteen>Give me that.

179
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,590
<8-20,Darrien>挨刀的是肚子  又不是胳膊
<8-20,Darrien>I was stabbed in my gut, not in my arm.

180
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,510
<8-21,Thirteen>你失血过多
<8-21,Thirteen>You lost a lot of blood,

181
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,430
<8-21,Thirteen>让脂肪瘤有了膨胀空间
<8-21,Thirteen>gave the lipoma room to swell.

182
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,130
<8-21,Thirteen>它压迫上肢动脉
<8-21,Thirteen>It's compressing the arteries in your arm,

183
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,530
<8-21,Thirteen>阻断了血流
<8-21,Thirteen>blocking your blood flow.

184
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,420
<8-21,Thirteen>或许能用针头抽出来一点
<8-21,Thirteen>Maybe we can suck some of it out.

185
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,570
<8-22,Thirteen>不是大事  会有点疼
<8-22,Thirteen>You'll be fine. Little pinch.

186
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
<8-23,Chase>那可不是脂肪瘤
<8-23,Chase>That's not lipoma.

187
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,380
<9-1,Taub>我无法理解  她居然会考虑
<9-1,Taub>I don't know why she's even considering

188
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,700
<9-1,Taub>生下我的孩子
<9-1,Taub>having my kid.

189
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,760
<9-1,Taub>她又不了解我
<9-1,Taub>She barely knows me.

190
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,020
<9-1,Taub>只知道我是个秃顶的矮子
<9-1,Taub>All she knows is I'm a short, balding guy.

191
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,080
<9-1,Taub>这甚至不符合进化逻辑
<9-1,Taub>It doesn't even make evolutionary sense.

192
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,460
<9-2,Foreman>-你想要这个孩子吗  -不想
<9-2,Foreman>- You want her to keep it? - No.

193
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,490
<9-4,Foreman>因为你会是个糟糕透顶的老爹
<9-4,Foreman>'Cause you'd make a crappy dad.

194
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,090
<9-5,Taub>我说了  我不想要
<9-5,Taub>I said, "No."

195
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,970
<9-6,Foreman>你太自私了
<9-6,Foreman>You're too selfish.

196
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,240
<9-6,Foreman>那是你搞婚外情的原因
<9-6,Foreman>That's why you cheated on your wife,

197
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,270
<9-6,Foreman>导致你婚姻破裂
<9-6,Foreman>why your marriage fell apart--

198
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,120
<9-7,Taub>伙计  我说了
<9-7,Taub>Dude, I said--

199
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
<9-7,Taub>我了解你
<9-7,Taub>I know you.

200
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,930
<9-8,Foreman>你呆在脱衣舞酒吧
<9-8,Foreman>The only reason you're sitting in a strip club,

201
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,800
<9-8,Foreman>却不看脱衣舞的唯一原因就是
<9-8,Foreman>ignoring the strip club,

202
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,790
<9-8,Foreman>你在考虑留下这个孩子
<9-8,Foreman>is because you actually are considering it.

203
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,710
<9-9,Taub>可如果世界上没有不负责任的老爹...
<9-9,Taub>Although without crappy dads in the world...

204
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,720
<10-1,Thirteen>再试着动动手指
<10-1,Thirteen>Try moving your fingers again.

205
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,000
<10-1,Thirteen>好的
<10-1,Thirteen>Good.

206
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,510
<10-2,Thirteen>这么说已经快抽干净了
<10-2,Thirteen>Means it's almost drained.

207
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,150
<10-3,Chase>还不够
<10-3,Chase>Not good enough.

208
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,370
<10-3,Chase>我们不知道它还会不会再次膨胀
<10-3,Chase>We don't know if it's gonna come back.

209
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,390
<10-3,Chase>我们不知道是什么引起的
<10-3,Chase>We don't even know what it is--

210
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,620
<10-3,Chase>毒品  病毒  监狱里的有毒物质
<10-3,Chase>drugs, viruses, toxins from that crack house

211
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,350
<10-3,Chase>还有天知道她还去过哪
<10-3,Chase>and god knows where else she's been.

212
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,470
<10-4,Thirteen>如果是由毒品引起的话
<10-4,Thirteen>If this were caused by the drugs,

213
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,220
<10-4,Thirteen>她会出现肾衰竭  心脏问题
<10-4,Thirteen>she'd have kidney failure, cardiac involvement.

214
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,660
<10-5,Chase>她的丙肝呢
<10-5,Chase>What about her hep-C?

215
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,300
<10-5,Chase>可能摧毁了她的肝脏  失去了合成功能
<10-5,Chase>Could have fried her liver. Loses its synthetic function.

216
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,220
<10-6,Thirteen>那么她整个身体都会出现肿胀
<10-6,Thirteen>Then her entire body would be swelling,

217
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,320
<10-6,Thirteen>不会只是她的胳膊
<10-6,Thirteen>not just her arm.

218
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,950
<10-7,Chase>那就只剩有毒物质了
<10-7,Chase>That leaves us with toxins.

219
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,890
<10-7,Chase>你是在哪里遭袭的
<10-7,Chase>Where exactly were you when you were attacked?

220
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,400
<10-8,Thirteen>你又不能去搜毒贩的老窝  那太危险了
<10-8,Thirteen>You're not doing a home search in a crack den. That's insane.

221
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
<10-9,Chase>显然我们没有太多的选择
<10-9,Chase>Apparently, we don't have much of a choice.

222
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,130
<10-10,Thirteen>那是个犯罪现场  而且不是有毒物质
<10-10,Thirteen>It's a crime scene, and it's not toxins

223
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,930
<10-10,Thirteen>也不是病毒或你提到的其它因素引起的
<10-10,Thirteen>or viruses or anything else you mentioned,

224
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,230
<10-10,Thirteen>因为这肯定不是偶然
<10-10,Thirteen>because it's not a coincidence.

225
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,800
<10-10,Thirteen>她的症状肯定和刀伤有关
<10-10,Thirteen>Her symptoms have to be related to the stabbing.

226
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,960
<10-11,Thirteen>会不会是她的身体为了止住伤口流血
<10-11,Thirteen>What if her body used up all the clotting factors

227
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,620
<10-11,Thirteen>而消耗了所有的凝血因子
<10-11,Thirteen>dealing with the stab wound?

228
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,550
<10-12,Chase>可以解释那个血块
<10-12,Chase>Explains the bloody mass.

229
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,450
<10-12,Chase>但若如此  她身体的任何部位都可能出血
<10-12,Chase>But if you're right, she could start bleeding anywhere,

230
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,780
<10-12,Chase>比如她的大脑和心脏
<10-12,Chase>like in her brain or in her heart.

231
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,360
<10-13,Darrien>那些东西也会出现在我大脑里吗
<10-13,Darrien>One of those things could start growing in my brain?

232
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,590
<10-14,Chase>得送你去医院了
<10-14,Chase>It's time to get you to the hospital.

233
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,170
<10-15,Darrien>不
<10-15,Darrien>Oh, no.

234
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,670
<10-15,Darrien>莱米  你答应过我的
<10-15,Darrien>Remy, you promised.

235
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,430
<10-16,Thirteen>在医院里  不过是能让她躺在病床上
<10-16,Thirteen>All we'll do at the hospital is stick her in a patient bed

236
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,830
<10-16,Thirteen>给她输入凝血因子
<10-16,Thirteen>and give her I.V. clotting factors.

237
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,820
<10-16,Thirteen>在这里也能做啊
<10-16,Thirteen>We can do that right here.

238
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,720
<10-17,Chase>但她很可能也就死在这里了
<10-17,Chase>We could also embalm her right here.

239
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,740
<10-18,Thirteen>我打电话订药  你去拿
<10-18,Thirteen>I'll call the drugs in. You go pick them up.

240
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,630
<10-18,Thirteen>如果我是对的  她就没事了
<10-18,Thirteen>If I'm right, she'll be fine.

241
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,490
<10-18,Thirteen>我知道你不认识她
<10-18,Thirteen>Look, I know you don't know her

242
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,720
<10-18,Thirteen>也不关心她  但是我在乎
<10-18,Thirteen>and you don't care about her, but I do.

243
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,100
<10-18,Thirteen>求你了
<10-18,Thirteen>Please.

244
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,150
<11-1,Thirteen>躺好  抬高左肩
<11-1,Thirteen>Lie down, elevate your shoulder.

245
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,910
<11-2,Thirteen>你说安德烈跟你吸毒没关系
<11-2,Thirteen>You said Andre wasn't responsible for the drugs.

246
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,040
<11-2,Thirteen>那你是为什么
<11-2,Thirteen>What is?

247
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,120
<11-3,Darrien>我不知道
<11-3,Darrien>Oh, I don't know.

248
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,360
<11-4,Thirteen>不  你知道
<11-4,Thirteen>Yes, you do.

249
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,500
<11-4,Thirteen>到底怎么了
<11-4,Thirteen>What happened to you?

250
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,980
<11-4,Thirteen>如果你不正视真正的问题
<11-4,Thirteen>If you don't deal with the real problem--

251
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,830
<11-5,Darrien>我来这  是因为你是个医生
<11-5,Darrien>I came here because you're a doctor...

252
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,950
<11-5,Darrien>我不需要心理医生
<11-5,Darrien>Not a shrink.

253
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,810
<12-1,Stripper>你手机在震
<12-1,Stripper>Your lap is vibrating.

254
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,180
<12-1,Stripper>不好意思
<12-1,Stripper>Oh, sorry.

255
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,420
<12-2,Taub>是我老板
<12-2,Taub>It's my boss.

256
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,130
<12-2,Taub>可能喝醉了
<12-2,Taub>Probably drunk.

257
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,550
<12-2,Taub>想让我载他回家  让他打车好了
<12-2,Taub>Wants a ride home. He can take a cab.

258
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,230
<12-2,Taub>你有孩子吗
<12-2,Taub>Do you have any kids?

259
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,650
<12-3,Stripper>怎么  你有恋母情结吗
<12-3,Stripper>Why? You like moms?

260
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,960
<12-3,Stripper>我可以当你妈妈
<12-3,Stripper>I could be your mommy.

261
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,420
<12-3,Stripper>打你的小屁屁
<12-3,Stripper>Spank your little ass.

262

263
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,270
<12-4,Taub>如果你怀孕了你会怎么办
<12-4,Taub>What would you do if you got pregnant?

<12-4,Taub>当然不是我的了
<12-4,Taub>Not by me...at all,

265
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,030
<12-4,Taub>假想有这么一个人
<12-4,Taub>but by some hypothetical guy

266
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,470
<12-4,Taub>他不想留着这个假想中的孩子
<12-4,Taub>who didn't want to keep the hypothetical kid.

267
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,750
<12-4,Taub>他用什么方式告诉你
<12-4,Taub>What would be the least awful way

268
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,670
<12-4,Taub>你更容易接受
<12-4,Taub>for him to tell you that?

269
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,830
<12-5,Stripper>别说话
<12-5,Stripper>Don't talk.

<12-6,Taub>要在小卡片上写"门诊见"吗
<12-6,Taub>Maybe write the clinic appointment on the little card?

<12-6,Taub>给她个惊喜
<12-6,Taub>Surprise!

274
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,360
<12-6,Taub>我恨我自己

275
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,960
<12-6,Taub>就没有好办法...
<12-6,Taub>There's just no good way to--

<12-6,Taub>你有这颗痣多长时间了
<12-6,Taub>How long have you had this mole?

00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,540
<12-6,Taub>它是不对称的

<12-9,Stripper>鲍比
<12-9,Stripper>Bobby!

282
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,000
<12-10,Taub>我没有碰她  我只是
<12-10,Taub>I wasn't touching her. I was just--

283
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,760
<12-10,Taub>我的天

<14-8,Cuddy>你在看什么
<14-8,Cuddy>What are you watching?

301
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,340
<14-9,Rachel>妈妈
<14-9,Rachel>Mom!

302
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,050
<14-11,Cuddy>你最好是快死了
<14-11,Cuddy>Someone better be dying.

303
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,140
<14-12,Thirteen>她出现幻觉了  我需要你再去一趟
<14-12,Thirteen>She hallucinated. I need you to go back out.

304
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,570
<14-12,Thirteen>我刚有又多要了些凝血因子
<14-12,Thirteen>I just called in more clotting factor.

305
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,290
<14-13,Chase>就是说  她现在颅内出血
<14-13,Chase>So she's bleeding in her brain now.

306
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,950
<14-14,Thirteen>用两倍的剂量  她就会没事的
<14-14,Thirteen>We double up the dose, she'll be fine.

307
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,860
<14-14,Thirteen>不行
<14-14,Thirteen>No.

308
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,030
<14-15,Chase>我们得把她送医院
<14-15,Chase>We bring her to the hospital,

309
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,810
<14-15,Chase>做CT确认出血部位
<14-15,Chase>we do a CT scan to locate the bleed,

310
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,110
<14-16,Thirteen>给她做颅骨钻孔
<14-16,Thirteen>drill a burr hole in her skull,

311
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,140
<14-14,Thirteen>这样她才可能会没事
<14-14,Thirteen>and maybe she'll be fine.

312
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,950
<14-16,Thirteen>在这里我们也可以做颅骨钻孔
<14-16,Thirteen>We can drill a burr hole here.

313
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,760
<14-17,Chase>你现在不仅在拿我们的职业生涯冒险
<14-17,Chase>You're not just risking our careers here.

314
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,180
<14-17,Chase>你还可能会二进宫
<14-17,Chase>You could go back to prison.

315
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,250
<14-18,Thirteen>我向她承诺过
<14-18,Thirteen>I made a promise.

316
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,290
<14-19,Chase>你承诺过什么
<14-19,Chase>You made a promise?

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,580
<14-20,Thirteen>我不会送她去医院
<14-20,Thirteen>I will not take her to the hospital.

318
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,600
<14-21,Chase>很好  那我来
<14-21,Chase>Great. Then I will.

319
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,690

<14-23,Chase>把她弄到我车里  送她去医院
<14-23,Chase>carry her down to my car, take her to the hospital,

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,740
<14-23,Chase>尽力挽救她的性命
<14-23,Chase>and try to save her life.

324
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,160
<14-24,Thirteen>她得留在这里
<14-24,Thirteen>She's staying here.

325
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,630
<14-25,Chase>让开

<14-27,Chase>她得去医院
<14-27,Chase>She's going to the hospital.

328
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,550
<14-28,Cuddy>甜心

<14-28,Cuddy>Go wait for mommy by the couch, okay?

330
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,450
<14-28,Cuddy>去吧
<14-28,Cuddy>Go on.

331
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,590
<14-29,House>我试过打给其他人
<14-29,House>I tried calling everyone else.

332
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,320
<14-29,House>你是名单上的最后一位
<14-29,House>You were the last one on the list.

333
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,740
<14-30,Cuddy>能给个理由为什么911不在名单上吗
<14-30,Cuddy>Any reason why 911 wasn't on the list?

334
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,350
<14-31,House>又不是什么紧急情况
<14-31,House>It's not an emergency.

335
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,840
<14-31,House>没错
<14-31,House>Right.

336
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,590
<14-32,Cuddy>你是要自杀吗
<14-32,Cuddy>Are you suicidal?

337
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,810
<14-33,House>我又没在做高难度手术
<14-33,House>I'm not attempting bypass surgery.

338
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,300
<14-33,House>肿瘤很小
<14-33,House>The tumors are small

339
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,480
<14-33,House>靠近表皮
<14-33,House>and they're close to the surface.

340
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,200
<14-33,House>我以为切除它就像
<14-33,House>I thought it'd be like...

341
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,310
<14-33,House>切除疣那么简单
<14-33,House>Removing a wart.

342
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,110
<14-34,Cuddy>你就等不到早晨吗
<14-34,Cuddy>You couldn't wait till morning,

343
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,630
<14-34,Cuddy>把你的CT给真正的外科医生看看
<14-34,Cuddy>Bring your CT to an actual surgeon?

344
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,700
<14-35,House>外科医生都是蠢货
<14-35,House>Surgeons are idiots.

345
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,870
<14-35,House>他们只会在肌肉上乱动刀子
<14-35,House>They'd just hack away at the muscle

346
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,970
<14-35,House>直到他们切除肿瘤
<14-35,House>until they get worn out.

347
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,980
<14-36,Cuddy>也可能是你为自己注射还未通过
<14-36,Cuddy>Or you're just ashamed you've been injecting a drug

348
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,310
<14-36,Cuddy>安全试验的药物为耻
<14-36,Cuddy>that hasn't even gone through safety trials.

349
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,820
<14-36,Cuddy>这药还未在人体上用过
<14-36,Cuddy>It's never even been in the human body.

350
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,300
<14-37,House>我已经摘除了其中一个肿瘤了
<14-37,House>I got one of the tumors.

351
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,310
<14-37,House>第二个也快了
<14-37,House>The second one is close.

352
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,460
<14-37,House>你可以用CT找到第三个肿瘤
<14-37,House>You can use the CT to help you find the third.

353
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,570
<14-38,Cuddy>我要带你去医院
<14-38,Cuddy>I'm taking you to the hospital.

354
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,750
<14-39,House>你就  就帮我切除肿瘤吧
<14-39,House>Just--just excise the tumor.

355
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,590
<14-40,Cuddy>绝对不行
<14-40,Cuddy>Absolutely not!

356
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,600
<15-1,Chase>把她的头再抬高点
<15-1,Chase>Elevate her head more.

357
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,310
<15-2,Darrien>不用麻烦了
<15-2,Darrien>Don't bother.

358
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,550
<15-2,Darrien>警察会在医院正门守着我的
<15-2,Darrien>Cops are gonna be waiting at the front door.

359
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,380
<15-3,Chase>我先进医院
<15-3,Chase>I'll go in first.

360
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,250
<15-3,Chase>我会找个用生命维持设备等死的病人
<15-3,Chase>I'll find a patient on life support who's waiting to die.

361
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,940
<15-3,Chase>我们会以他的名字帮你做检测
<15-3,Chase>We'll use their name on all your tests.

362
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,530
<15-3,Chase>没人会知道你在那里
<15-3,Chase>No one will ever know you're there.

363
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,930
<15-4,Darrien>谢了
<15-4,Darrien>Thanks.

364

<16-1,Rachel>你的腿怎么了
<16-1,Rachel>What happened to your leg?

365
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,770
<16-2,House>我想治好它
<16-2,House>I was trying to make it better.

366
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,400
<16-3,Cuddy>他没动脑筋
<16-3,Cuddy>He was being reckless.

367
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
<16-3,Cuddy>宝贝  坐好了
<16-3,Cuddy>Sit back, honey.

368
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,830
<16-3,Cuddy>你不是想治好你的腿
<16-3,Cuddy>This isn't about making your leg better.

369
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,410
<16-3,Cuddy>你是想让你的生活回到正轨
<16-3,Cuddy>It's about making your life better.

370
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,080
<16-4,House>又来了
<16-4,House>Here we go.

371
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,080
<16-4,House>早知道我就打911了
<16-4,House>Wish I had called 911.

372
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,280
<16-5,Cuddy>否则你为什么会冒生命危险
<16-5,Cuddy>Why else would you risk your life

373
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,230
<16-5,Cuddy>做这么愚蠢的事情呢
<16-5,Cuddy>doing something so stupid?

374
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,570
<16-6,House>你也知道  我最近遭受了很多挫折
<16-6,House>Well, you know, I've had a lot of setbacks lately.

375
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,620
<16-7,Cuddy>别拿我们俩分手来说事
<16-7,Cuddy>Don't blame our breakup for this.

376
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,160
<16-7,Cuddy>你不是因为我才不快乐
<16-7,Cuddy>You're not unhappy because of me.

377
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,730
<16-7,Cuddy>你就是不快乐
<16-7,Cuddy>You're just unhappy.

378
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,770
<16-7,Cuddy>不快乐的人就会做脑残的事情
<16-7,Cuddy>Unhappy people do reckless things.

379
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,770
<16-8,Thirteen>达里恩
<16-8,Thirteen>Darrien!

380
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,510
<16-9,Darrien>别叫了  我头疼
<16-9,Darrien>Stop screaming. My head hurts.

381
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,290
<16-10,Thirteen>我需要你保持清醒  跟我说话
<16-10,Thirteen>I need you to stay awake. Talk to me.

382
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,920
<16-11,Darrien>说什么啊
<16-11,Darrien>About what?

383
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,210
<16-12,Thirteen>你在我房间里尖叫的时候
<16-12,Thirteen>When you were screaming in my room,

384
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,690
<16-12,Thirteen>你觉得自己看到什么了
<16-12,Thirteen>what did you think you saw?

385
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,660
<16-12,Thirteen>你说"把枪放在地上  走开"
<16-12,Thirteen>You said, "Put it down on the ground and get away."

386
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,160
<16-13,Chase>听起来像警察说的话
<16-13,Chase>Sounds like a cop.

387
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,950
<16-14,Darrien>估计是旧习惯了
<16-14,Darrien>Old habits, I guess.

388
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,500
<16-15,Thirteen>你原本是名警察吗
<16-15,Thirteen>You were a cop?

389
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,480
<16-16,Darrien>那是我还是个清白的人时候的事情了
<16-16,Darrien>Back when I was a decent person.

390
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,930
<16-17,Thirteen>我怎么不知道这事呢  你知道所有...
<16-17,Thirteen>How do I not know this? You knew everything--

391
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,350
<16-18,Darrien>想在监狱里存活就不能抖露出你的"好"履历
<16-18,Darrien>Not a good resume when you're trying to survive in prison.

392
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,710
<16-19,Thirteen>那你在我卧室里是在跟谁说话呢
<16-19,Thirteen>So who were you talking to in my bedroom?

393
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,020
<16-19,Thirteen>你为什么一直道歉
<16-19,Thirteen>Why did you keep apologizing?

394
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,080
<16-20,Darrien>因为我很抱歉
<16-20,Darrien>Cause I'm sorry.

395
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,710
<16-21,Thirteen>为什么
<16-21,Thirteen>For what?

396
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,530
<16-22,Darrien>我杀了一个孩子
<16-22,Darrien>I killed a kid.

397
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,750
<16-22,Darrien>他才十九岁
<16-22,Darrien>He was 19.

398
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,280
<16-22,Darrien>我最先进入
<16-22,Darrien>I went in first.

399
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,100
<16-22,Darrien>看见他在摸枪
<16-22,Darrien>Saw him going for his gun.

400
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,370
<16-22,Darrien>我试图劝他缴械  但是...
<16-22,Darrien>I tried to talk him down, but...

401
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,390
<16-22,Darrien>他们说我是英雄
<16-22,Darrien>They told me I was a hero.

402
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,430
<16-23,Thirteen>你就是从那时起开始吸毒的吗
<16-23,Thirteen>So that's when you started using drugs?

403
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,820
<16-23,Thirteen>我很遗憾
<16-23,Thirteen>I'm sorry.

404
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,220
<16-24,Thirteen>达里恩
<16-24,Thirteen>Darrien?

405
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,950
<16-24,Thirteen>达里恩
<16-24,Thirteen>Darrien!

406
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,870
<16-24,Thirteen>她失去知觉了
<16-24,Thirteen>She lost consciousness.

407
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,530
<16-25,House>前面没车  穿过去吧
<16-25,House>There are no cars coming. Just go.

408
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,800
<16-26,Rachel>还是红灯  你个饭桶
<16-26,Rachel>The light is red, ye bloody scallywag.

409
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,040
<16-27,Cuddy>别再学海盗说话了
<16-27,Cuddy>Stop with the pirate talk.

410
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,110
<16-28,House>如果你不想让棕胡子的腿
<16-28,House>If you don't want brownbeard

411
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,680
<16-28,House>最后变成两条木头腿
<16-28,House>to end up with two wooden legs,

412
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,350
<16-28,House>那最好让你妈妈启动这艘船
<16-28,House>better get yer ma to move this ship,

413
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,800
<16-28,House>你这卑鄙的舱底鼠
<16-28,House>you mangy bilge rat.

414
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,690
<16-29,Cuddy>难怪了
<16-29,Cuddy>Of course...

415
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,070
<16-29,Cuddy>是你让她看那部下流的动画片的
<16-29,Cuddy>you showed her that filthy cartoon.

416
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,600
<16-29,Cuddy>你是白痴吗  让三岁小孩看那个
<16-29,Cuddy>What kind of idiot lets a three-year-old watch that?

417
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,030
<16-30,House>如果你想教训我缺乏判断力
<16-30,House>If you want to lecture me on my poor judgment,

418
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:53,100
<16-30,House>有些别的事例更有说服力
<16-30,House>there would seem to be more relevant examples.

419
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,840
<17-1,Foreman>你在这里啊
<17-1,Foreman>There you are.

420
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,420
<17-1,Foreman>你在贵宾室里待了那么久
<17-1,Foreman>You were in the vip room so long,

421
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,510
<17-1,Foreman>我还以为你要为那姑娘付房贷呢
<17-1,Foreman>I thought you were gonna pay off that girl's mortgage.

422
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,730
<17-2,Taub>我被保镖鲍比扔出来了
<17-2,Taub>I got tossed out by Bobby the bouncer.

423
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,230
<17-3,Foreman>你摸她了吗
<17-3,Foreman>You touched her?

424
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,360
<17-4,Taub>我在看她的痣
<17-4,Taub>I was looking at her mole.

425
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,950
<17-5,Foreman>真是天才  咱们回家吧
<17-5,Foreman>Genius. Let's go home.

426
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,490
<17-6,Taub>我想等她出来
<17-6,Taub>I want to wait for the girl,

427
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,340
<17-6,Taub>确保那颗痣没问题
<17-6,Taub>make sure that mole's okay.

428
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,120
<17-7,Foreman>要是保镖看到你站在这里
<17-7,Foreman>Bobby the bouncer sees you

429
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,290
<17-7,Foreman>像个跟踪者一样
<17-7,Foreman>standing out here like a stalker,

430
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,000
<17-7,Foreman>他会把你打散架的
<17-7,Foreman>he's gonna break open your skull.

431
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,580
<17-8,Taub>那颗痣不对称  可能是癌性的
<17-8,Taub>It was asymmetrical. It could be cancerous.

432
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,240
<17-9,Foreman>你想被打得散架
<17-9,Foreman>You want to get your skull cracked open.

433
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,530
<17-9,Foreman>你试图惩罚自己
<17-9,Foreman>You're trying to punish yourself.

434
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,760
<17-10,Taub>我想实现医生的誓言
<17-10,Taub>I want to fulfill my oath as a doctor.

435
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,810
<17-11,Foreman>你觉得自己是个混蛋
<17-11,Foreman>You think you're a screw-up.

436
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,480
<17-11,Foreman>觉得自己该打  因为你让一姑娘怀孕了
<17-11,Foreman>Because you got a girl pregnant and you deserve to suffer.

437
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,540
<17-11,Foreman>可你不必
<17-11,Foreman>You don't.

438
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,240
<17-11,Foreman>你只需要好好睡一觉  再来处理这事
<17-11,Foreman>You just need some sleep and you'll handle this mess.

439
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,730
<17-11,Foreman>我们上车吧
<17-11,Foreman>Let's get in the car.

440
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,840
<17-12,Taub>她估计很快就下班了
<17-12,Taub>She's probably off work soon.

441
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,290
<17-13,Foreman>把钥匙给我  我来开车
<17-13,Foreman>Give me the keys. I'll drive.

442
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,260
<17-14,Foreman>我搭出租车好了
<17-14,Foreman>I'll get a cab.

443
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,340
<17-14,Foreman>一切好运
<17-14,Foreman>Good luck with everything.

444
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,730
<18-1,Chase>为了维护你朋友你简直失去理智了
<18-1,Chase>You were defending your friend beyond all rationality,

445
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,290
<18-1,Chase>甚至给了她死在你卧室的权利
<18-1,Chase>granting her the right to die in your bedroom.

446
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,220
<18-1,Chase>这真的只是因为一句承诺吗
<18-1,Chase>Was it really all because of a promise?

447
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,430
<18-2,Thirteen>承诺这词对有些人是有意义的
<18-2,Thirteen>That word means something to some people.

448
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,180
<18-3,Chase>也不至于这样啊
<18-3,Chase>Not that much.

449
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,310
<18-4,Thirteen>没发现出血
<18-4,Thirteen>I don't see the bleed.

450
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,270
<18-4,Thirteen>把成像部位移到脑干处
<18-4,Thirteen>I'm moving down to the brain stem.

451
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,390
<18-5,Chase>你向你哥哥保证会为他进行安乐死
<18-5,Chase>You promised your brother you'd euthanize him

452
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,830
<18-5,Chase>你认为只要归咎于承诺本身
<18-5,Chase>and you think you won't feel bad about it

453
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,510
<18-5,Chase>你就不会为此而感到内疚
<18-5,Chase>as long as you can blame it on the promise.

454
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,140
<18-5,Chase>因此你对于信守承诺
<18-5,Chase>That's why you have this twisted obligation

455
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,740
<18-5,Chase>有着如此扭曲的执著
<18-5,Chase>to keep all promises...

456
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,890
<18-5,Chase>否则你小心翼翼建立起来的心理防线
<18-5,Chase>or your carefully constructed defense mechanism

457
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,380
<18-5,Chase>就会崩溃
<18-5,Chase>could crumble down.

458
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,550
<18-6,Thirteen>我使我哥免遭巨大的痛苦
<18-6,Thirteen>I saved my brother from a lot of pain.

459
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,460
<18-6,Thirteen>重建图像是阴性的
<18-6,Thirteen>Reconstructed image is clear.

460
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,020
<18-6,Thirteen>达里恩的大脑中没有出血
<18-6,Thirteen>There's no bleed in Darrien's brain.

461
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,310
<18-7,Chase>图像模糊了  她醒了吗
<18-7,Chase>Image just blurred. Did she wake up?

462
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,250
<18-8,Thirteen>她正在发抖
<18-8,Thirteen>she's shivering.

463
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,550
<18-8,Thirteen>她肯定是发烧了
<18-8,Thirteen>She must have a fever.

464
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,130
<18-9,Chase>感染吗
<18-9,Chase>Infection?

465
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,390
<18-10,Thirteen>不可能是刺伤造成的
<18-10,Thirteen>It couldn't be from the stabbing.

466
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,450
<18-11,Chase>必须是由刺伤造成的
<18-11,Chase>It has to be from the stabbing.

467
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,250
<18-12,Thirteen>不  不可能发展得这么快
<18-12,Thirteen>No, it couldn't be acting that quickly.

468
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,260
<18-13,Chase>那她究竟是怎么了
<18-13,Chase>Well, then what's wrong with her?

469
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,780
<19-1,Cuddy>你的心率已经超过120了
<19-1,Cuddy>Your heart rate's over 120.

470
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,410
<19-1,Cuddy>你皮肤湿冷  我想你快要休克了
<19-1,Cuddy>You're clammy. I think you're going into shock.

471
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,990
<19-1,Cuddy>你是否感觉头昏眼花
<19-1,Cuddy>Are you lightheaded?

472
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,840
<19-2,House>我没事
<19-2,House>I'm fine.

473
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,660
<19-3,House>你看了最新棕胡子那集了吗
<19-3,House>Did you see the new brownbeard episode?

474
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,440
<19-4,Rachel>很滑稽
<19-4,Rachel>It was so funny.

475
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,740
<19-5,House>那集很差劲
<19-5,House>No, it was so lame.

476
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,400
<19-5,House>一船的男海盗
<19-5,House>Got a boat full of guy pirates

477
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,500
<19-5,House>却让女海盗去走跳板
<19-5,House>and they make the girl pirate walk the plank.

478
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,680
<19-6,Rachel>她浮起来了
<19-6,Rachel>She floated.

479
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,640
<19-7,House>那是因为她咪咪很大
<19-7,House>That's 'cause she had big boobies.

480
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,810
<19-7,House>所以他应该留着她才对
<19-7,House>That's why he should have kept her.

481
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,300
<19-8,Cuddy>你得赶紧做手术  护士都跑哪里去了
<19-8,Cuddy>We've got to get you into surgery. Where is that nurse?

482
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,410
<19-8,Cuddy>瑞秋  咱们去找护士
<19-8,Cuddy>Rachel, let's go find the nurse.

483
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,190
<19-9,House>凌晨2点
<19-9,House>2:00 A.M.

484
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,680
<19-9,House>感谢你回我电话
<19-9,House>Nice of you to call me back.

485
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,390
<19-10,Thirteen>我和奇斯正和病人在医院里
<19-10,Thirteen>Chase and I are in the hospital with a patient.

486
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,060
<19-11,House>你们黔驴技穷了
<19-11,House>You've completely run out of ideas

487
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,160
<19-11,House>打给我就为了给你们出主意
<19-11,House>and you're calling me to bail you out.

488
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,460
<19-11,House>我太感动了  把情况告诉我
<19-11,House>I'm touched. Hit me.

489
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,220
<20-1,Computerized car voice>请说指令
<20-1,Computerized car voice>Command, please.

490
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,470
<20-2,Taub>拨通露比
<20-2,Taub>Call Ruby.

491
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,080
<20-3,Car>您要拨打露比的移动电话吗
<20-3,Car>Would you like to call Ruby on mobile?

492
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,890
<20-4,Taub>不
<20-4,Taub>No.

493
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,540
<20-5,House>她是否服药了  快克[毒品]不算
<20-5,House>She on any medication... besides crack?

494
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,370
<20-6,Thirteen>她在监狱时一直注射干扰素
<20-6,Thirteen>She was taking interferon in prison,

495
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,830
<20-6,Thirteen>因此我猜测她患丙肝至少有十年了
<20-6,Thirteen>so I'm guessing she's had Hep-C for at least ten years.

496
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,390
<20-7,House>我是不是也能猜一下
<20-7,House>Can I guess stuff too?

497
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,360
<20-7,House>这样的话做诊断就容易多了
<20-7,House>'cause that's gonna make the diagnosis really easy.

498
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,300
<20-8,Thirteen>监狱的医务室不知道要保存病历
<20-8,Thirteen>Prison infirmary isn't known for stellar record keeping.

499
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,070
<20-9,Chase>现在我们也没办法问病人
<20-9,Chase>And we can't exactly ask the patient.

500
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,110
<20-10,House>那看来她已经进入昏迷前期了
<20-10,House>Yeah, that would have been pre-coma.

501
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,770
<20-10,House>但你们怎么知道
<20-10,House>But how could you have known

502
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,310
<20-10,House>病人已经进入昏迷前期了
<20-10,House>that it would affect her that way?

503
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,890
<20-11,Chase>我们一开始没发现任何异常  直到
<20-11,Chase>We didn't think we had anything mysterious until--

504
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,230
<20-12,House>会不会是肾癌释放的栓子
<20-12,House>How about renal cancer throwing clots?

505
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,490
<20-13,Thirteen>-尿检呈阴性  -太糟了
<20-13,Thirteen>- Urinalysis was negative. - That's too bad.

506
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,490
<20-14,House>我就想出这么一个好主意
<20-14,House>'cause that was my one big idea.

507
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,690
<20-15,Thirteen>真的吗
<20-15,Thirteen>Really?

508
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,500
<20-16,Thirteen>豪斯
<20-16,Thirteen>House?

509
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,510
<20-16,Thirteen>豪斯  你还在吗
<20-16,Thirteen>House, you there?

510
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,040
<20-17,House>再跟我说说病人的情况
<20-17,House>Tell me more about the patient.

511
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,160
<20-17,House>进监狱前她是做什么的
<20-17,House>What was she doing before prison?

512
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,250
<20-18,Thirteen>警察
<20-18,Thirteen>She was a cop.

513
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,660
<20-18,Thirteen>正当防卫时射杀了一个孩子
<20-18,Thirteen>Shot a kid in self defense,

514
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,670
<20-18,Thirteen>一直心怀内疚不能自拔
<20-18,Thirteen>never got over the guilt,

515
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,430
<20-18,Thirteen>从此开始磕药然后被抓
<20-18,Thirteen>started taking drugs, and got busted.

516
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,010
<20-19,House>你还真会挑重点
<20-19,House>Way to bury the lead.

517
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,700
<20-19,House>枪击事件是什么时候发生的
<20-19,House>How long ago was the shooting?

518
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,810
<20-20,Thirteen>我不知道  怎么了
<20-20,Thirteen>I'm not sure. Why?

519
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,270
<20-21,House>再者  你只是假设她患丙肝十年了
<20-21,House>Again, you assumed she's had Hep-C for ten years.

520
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,610
<20-21,House>去查出她何时杀了那孩子
<20-21,House>Find out when she shot the kid,

521
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,390
<20-21,House>你就能知道她何时开始磕药
<20-21,House>you'll find out when she started taking drugs,

522
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,470
<20-21,House>以及她究竟何时感染的丙肝
<20-21,House>and when she actually contracted the Hep-C.

523
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,940
<20-22,Chase>你认为这些跟她的现状有关联吗
<20-22,Chase>And you think this is relevant?

524
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,430
<20-23,House>比你们现在知道的信息更有用
<20-23,House>It's more relevant than what you got now,

525
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,890
<20-23,House>那些根本一文不值
<20-23,House>which is squat.

526
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,440
<20-24,House>我屋里来了三位美女
<20-24,House>Three chicks just came into my bedroom.

527
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,410
<20-24,House>先挂了
<20-24,House>I got to go.

528
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,110
<21-1,Computerized car voice>请说指令
<21-1,Computerized car voice>Command, please.

529
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,190
<21-2,Taub>拨通瑞秋
<21-2,Taub>Call Rachel.

530
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,630
<21-3,Car>您是要拨打瑞秋的移动电话吗
<21-3,Car>Would you like to call Rachel on the cell phone?

531
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,760
<21-4,Taub>不
<21-4,Taub>No.

532
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,630
<21-5,Stripper>你想干什么
<21-5,Stripper>What the hell?

533
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,230
<21-6,Taub>我真是个医生  我只是想
<21-6,Taub>I really am a doctor. I just wanted--

534
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,500
<21-7,Stripper>想偷摸我吗  离我远点
<21-7,Stripper>Cop another feel? Get away from me.

535
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,860
<21-8,Taub>不  是那颗痣  我不过想
<21-8,Taub>No, that mole. I just wanted--

536
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,690
<21-8,Taub>求你  别叫保镖
<21-8,Taub>Please, don't call Bobby.

537
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,540
<21-8,Taub>请你...
<21-8,Taub>Just...

538
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,330
<21-9,Taub>-冷静点  -闭嘴
<21-9,Taub>- Calm down.  - Shut up!

539
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,460
<21-10,Stripper>变态  跪下
<21-10,Stripper>Sick perv! Get down on your knees!

540
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,420
<21-10,Stripper>你以为我是开玩笑吗
<21-10,Stripper>You think I'm kidding?

541
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,620
<21-10,Stripper>转过去  跪下
<21-10,Stripper>Turn around and get down on your knees!

542
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,870
<21-11,Taub>求求你别
<21-11,Taub>Please don't.

543
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,780
<21-12,Stripper>-我说了闭嘴  -上帝保佑  上帝保佑
<21-12,Stripper>- I said shut up!  - Please, please please...

544
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,520
<21-13,Taub>你以为你是第一个自视特殊的人吗
<21-13,Taub>You think you're the first guy who thought he was special?

545
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,000
<21-15,Taub>上帝保佑  上帝保佑
<21-15,Taub>Please, please, please...

546
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,380
<21-16,Dina>你以为你能为所欲为吗
<21-16,Dina>You think you can do whatever you want?

547
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,760
<21-16,Dina>我不会再犯傻了
<21-16,Dina>I am not going through that again!

548
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,840
<21-17,Taub>上帝保佑  上帝保佑
<21-17,Taub>Please... Please...Please...

549
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,610
<22-1,Chase>找到什么吗
<22-1,Chase>Find anything?

550
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,170
<22-2,Thirteen>令人震惊啊
<22-2,Thirteen>Shockingly...

551
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,900
<22-2,Thirteen>一个朋克小子摸枪时被警察击毙
<22-2,Thirteen>A punk kid getting shot pulling a gun on a cop

552
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,690
<22-2,Thirteen>没能成为国家新闻
<22-2,Thirteen>did not make national news.

553
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,490
<22-3,Chase>你的脖子还好吧
<22-3,Chase>Is your neck okay?

554
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,730
<22-4,Thirteen>挺好  没事
<22-4,Thirteen>Yeah, it's fine.

555
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,930
<22-5,Chase>我去给你拿些冰
<22-5,Chase>I'll get you some ice.

556
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,600
<22-6,Thirteen>我说过没事了
<22-6,Thirteen>I said it was fine.

557
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,860
<22-7,Chase>我不该那么大力抓你的
<22-7,Chase>I shouldn't have grabbed you so hard.

558
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,780
<22-8,Thirteen>你是迫于无奈
<22-8,Thirteen>You had to.

559
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,690
<22-8,Thirteen>你说得对  全都对
<22-8,Thirteen>You were right... about everything.

560
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,070
<22-9,Thirteen>有了
<22-9,Thirteen>Oh, I got something.

561
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,160
<22-10,Thirteen>达里恩肯定用过别的姓
<22-10,Thirteen>Darrien must have had a different last name then.

562
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,120
<22-10,Thirteen>她肯定结过婚
<22-10,Thirteen>She must have been married.

563
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,290
<22-11,Chase>2008年  可能吗
<22-11,Chase>2008? Is that possible?

564
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,760
<22-12,Thirteen>我们从没谈论过她进去多久
<22-12,Thirteen>We never actually talked about how long she'd been in.

565
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,400
<22-13,Chase>豪斯是对的
<22-13,Chase>House was right.

566
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,660
<22-13,Chase>她可能才得了丙肝没多久
<22-13,Chase>She could have only had her Hep-C for a few years.

567
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,860
<22-14,Thirteen>若非检查结果显示她的丙肝是慢性的
<22-14,Thirteen>There's no way the prison would have prescribed interferon

568
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,220
<22-14,Thirteen>监狱不会向她提供干扰素
<22-14,Thirteen>unless the lab showed her Hep-C to be chronic.

569
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,950
<22-15,Chase>什么能让新乙肝看起来像是旧病呢
<22-15,Chase>So what makes new Hep-C looks like old Hep-C?

570
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,490
<22-16,Thirteen>如果她有寄生虫呢
<22-16,Thirteen>What if she got a parasite?

571
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,130
<22-16,Thirteen>丙肝让她易感寄生虫
<22-16,Thirteen>The Hep-C made her susceptible

572
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,220
<22-16,Thirteen>而寄生虫又加剧了她的肝脏病变
<22-16,Thirteen>and the parasite sped up the liver damage.

573
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,750
<22-17,Chase>阿米巴虫
<22-17,Chase>Entamoeba.

574
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,310
<22-17,Chase>如果寄生虫在寄生虫囊中的话
<22-17,Chase>If they were in a parasitoma,

575
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,010
<22-17,Chase>刺伤可能把它们放了出来
<22-17,Chase>the stab wound could have freed them,

576
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,490
<22-17,Chase>让它们随血液肆意流动  破坏组织
<22-17,Chase>sent them coursing through her bloodstream, wreaking havoc.

577
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,700
<22-18,Thirteen>给她输一袋甲硝唑
<22-18,Thirteen>A single bag of metronidazole.

578
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,640
<22-18,Thirteen>如果我们是对的  几小时后她就能醒了
<22-18,Thirteen>If we're right, she could wake up from the coma in a few hours.

579
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,340
<22-19,Nurse>为您准备好了
<22-19,Nurse>They're ready for you.

580
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,340
<22-19,Nurse>等等
<22-19,Nurse>Wait.

581
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,520
<22-20,House>我想让你也进来
<22-20,House>I want you in there.

582
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,400
<22-21,Cuddy>我不是外科医生
<22-21,Cuddy>I'm not a surgeon.

583
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,190
<22-21,Cuddy>什么也帮不上
<22-21,Cuddy>There's nothing I can do.

584
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,290
<22-22,House>你可以确保  那白痴屠夫
<22-22,House>Well, you can make sure that... idiot butcher

585
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,560
<22-22,House>不做不必要的切除
<22-22,House>doesn't cut more than he needs to.

586
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,420
<22-23,Cuddy>你已经在手术协议上签字了
<22-23,Cuddy>You already signed a release.

587
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,260
<22-23,Cuddy>他会做他该做的
<22-23,Cuddy>He's gonna do what he needs to do.

588
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,050
<22-24,House>是啊  可如果那包括截肢
<22-24,House>Yeah, and if that involves chopping off my leg...

589
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,900
<22-24,House>我希望能肯定那该死的决定是必要的
<22-24,House>I want to be sure that that's damn well necessary.

590
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,840
<22-25,Cuddy>豪斯
<22-25,Cuddy>House...

591
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,780
<22-26,House>我不相信他
<22-26,House>I don't trust him.

592
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,230
<22-26,House>我相信你
<22-26,House>I trust you.

593
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,140
<23-1,Thirteen>能听到我说话吗
<23-1,Thirteen>Can you hear me?

594
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,480
<23-2,Darrien>可以
<23-2,Darrien>Yeah.

595
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,260
<23-3,Thirteen>你肝脏里有寄生虫
<23-3,Thirteen>You had parasites in your liver.

596
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,070
<23-3,Thirteen>可能是因不干净的针头或是监狱环境
<23-3,Thirteen>Probably from a dirty needle or prison...

597
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,430
<23-3,Thirteen>又或者...谁知道呢
<23-3,Thirteen>or...  who knows what?

598
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,490
<23-3,Thirteen>刺伤使情况变得更糟糕...
<23-3,Thirteen>The stabbing made it worse...

599
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,810
<23-3,Thirteen>但你会好起来的
<23-3,Thirteen>But you're gonna be okay.

600
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,390
<23-4,Thirteen>我很抱歉  但我们必须这么做
<23-4,Thirteen>I'm sorry. We had to.

601
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,690
<23-5,Darrien>我告诉过你  我不能回去
<23-5,Darrien>I told you I couldn't go back.

602
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,260
<23-5,Darrien>我真不该相信你
<23-5,Darrien>I shouldn't have trusted you.

603
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,130
<23-5,Darrien>我从没喜欢过你
<23-5,Darrien>I never liked you.

604
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,940
<23-5,Darrien>我和你在一起  只因我身陷囹圄
<23-5,Darrien>I killed time with you 'cause I was locked in a cage.

605
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,060
<23-5,Darrien>你不过是我用来消遣的
<23-5,Darrien>You were a distraction.

606
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,520
<23-5,Darrien>有人能说说话  好让我不用...
<23-5,Darrien>Someone to talk to so I didn't have to think about...

607
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,120
<23-5,Darrien>胡思乱想
<23-5,Darrien>Everything else.

608
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,730
<23-6,Thirteen>你是在说气话  我明白的
<23-6,Thirteen>You're lashing out... I get it.

609
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,330
<23-6,Thirteen>但一个月后  你会感谢我的
<23-6,Thirteen>But in a month, you'll thank me.

610
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,520
<23-7,Thirteen>或许你不会  我不知道
<23-7,Thirteen>Or maybe you won't. I don't know.

611
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,330
<23-7,Thirteen>但是...
<23-7,Thirteen>But...

612
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,150
<23-7,Thirteen>我知道我救了你的命
<23-7,Thirteen>I know I saved your life.

613
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,290
<24-1,Rachel>他会好起来吗
<24-1,Rachel>Is he going to be okay?

614
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,750
<24-2,Cuddy>他会好起来的
<24-2,Cuddy>He'll be fine.

615
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,300
<24-2,Cuddy>闭上眼睛
<24-2,Cuddy>Close your eyes.

616
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,140
<24-3,Rachel>我希望豪斯还能来跟我一起玩
<24-3,Rachel>I wish house still came over to play.

617
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,780
<24-4,Cuddy>也许你该给他写封信
<24-4,Cuddy>Maybe you should write him a letter.

618
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,180
<24-4,Cuddy>想写吗
<24-4,Cuddy>Want to do that?

619
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,010
<24-4,Cuddy>好的  现在就写
<24-4,Cuddy>Okay, let's do it.

620
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,480
<25-1,Taub>露比
<25-1,Taub>Ruby.

621
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,670
<25-2,Ruby>你看上去好糟糕  而且闻起来...
<25-2,Ruby>You look like hell and you smell like...

622
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,560
<25-3,Taub>我想了很多
<25-3,Taub>I've been doing a lot of thinking.

623
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,720
<25-4,Ruby>你身上沾的是亮片吗
<25-4,Ruby>Is that glitter on you?

624
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,160
<25-4,Ruby>听我说完
<25-4,Ruby>Just hear me out.

625
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,720
<25-5,Taub>我还在做整形的时候
<25-5,Taub>Back when I still had my practice,

626
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,220
<25-5,Taub>遇过一位病人  50岁的男性
<25-5,Taub>this patient came in, 50-year-old guy,

627
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,660
<25-5,Taub>来做腹部拉皮
<25-5,Taub>wanted a tummy tuck.

628
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,920
<25-5,Taub>可是在做准备工作的时候
<25-5,Taub>But when we do some prelim work,

629
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,860
<25-5,Taub>我们发现他的胃里布满了肿瘤
<25-5,Taub>we discover that his stomach is filled with cancer.

630
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,660
<25-5,Taub>于是我非但没能让他在海滩秀健美
<25-5,Taub>So instead of telling him that he's gonna look great at the beach,

631
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,530
<25-5,Taub>还得告诉他大限将至
<25-5,Taub>I got to tell him that he's dying.

632
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,510
<25-6,Ruby>你去脱衣舞夜总会了吗
<25-6,Ruby>Were you at a strip club?

633
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,570
<25-7,Taub>听我说完  最奇怪的是
<25-7,Taub>Please. The weird part was

634
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,150
<25-7,Taub>我甚至比他更难接受事实
<25-7,Taub>I was more upset about the whole thing than he was.

635
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,380
<25-7,Taub>以至于他反过来安慰我
<25-7,Taub>He actually had to calm me down.

636
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,660
<25-7,Taub>他说他有非常优秀的子女  教养得法
<25-7,Taub>Said he had great kids, raised them right,

637
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,290
<25-7,Taub>因为有了他们
<25-7,Taub>knew that because of them,

638
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,520
<25-7,Taub>这世界会更美好  他死而无憾
<25-7,Taub>he was leaving the world a better place.

639
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,110
<25-7,Taub>昨晚我以为自己会死掉
<25-7,Taub>I thought I might die last night.

640
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,570
<25-8,Ruby>在脱衣舞夜总会吗
<25-8,Ruby>At a strip club?

641
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,730
<25-8,Ruby>是的  我当时在脱衣舞夜总会
<25-8,Ruby>Yes, I was at a strip club.

642
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,720
<25-9,Taub>昨晚事发时
<25-9,Taub>And while it was happening,

643
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,100
<25-9,Taub>我一直想着那位病人
<25-9,Taub>I kept thinking about that patient

644
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,680
<25-9,Taub>无比希望我能够像他一样坦然
<25-9,Taub>and how I wish I was like him.

645
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,760
<25-9,Taub>我想要这个孩子
<25-9,Taub>I want to have this baby.

646
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,690
<26-1,Thirteen>达里恩射杀那孩子是迫不得已
<26-1,Thirteen>Darrien had to shoot that kid.

647
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,460
<26-1,Thirteen>她做得对  完全合理
<26-1,Thirteen>It was the right thing. Completely justified.

648
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,590
<26-1,Thirteen>可是那都没有用
<26-1,Thirteen>But it didn't matter.

649
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,730
<26-1,Thirteen>她为忘却这件事毁了自己的生活
<26-1,Thirteen>She destroyed her life trying to forget.

650
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,380
<26-1,Thirteen>我好怕我也会变成她那样
<26-1,Thirteen>I'm afraid that's what's gonna happen to me.

651
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,700
<26-2,Chase>你得找人谈谈
<26-2,Chase>You really should talk to someone.

652
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,710
<26-3,Thirteen>我找心理治疗师谈过了  没有用
<26-3,Thirteen>I've talked to a therapist. It didn't help.

653
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,230
<26-4,Chase>那就找个不是心理治疗师的人谈谈
<26-4,Chase>Well, maybe you should talk to someone who isn't a therapist.

654
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,160
<26-5,Thirteen>你真以为你对杀了人以后的生活是什么滋味
<26-5,Thirteen>Do you really think you have any idea what it's like

655
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,750
<26-5,Thirteen>能有一丝的了解吗
<26-5,Thirteen>to live with something like this?

656
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,170
<26-6,Chase>去喝杯咖啡吧
<26-6,Chase>Let's grab a coffee.

661
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,840
<27-1,Chase>熬夜了
<27-1,Chase>Late night?

662
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,700
<27-2,Taub>没有  只是早上没喝咖啡而已
<27-2,Taub>No. Just haven't had my coffee yet.

663
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,270
<27-3,Thirteen>呵欠传染
<27-3,Thirteen>Sympathetic yawn.
