<6-6,House>Can we talk aboutabcsomething besides you for a moment?

120
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,850
<6-6,House>譬如说 第5行?
<6-6,House>Like maybe the fifth line?

121
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,740
<6-7,Apple>F...E...O...S...P
<6-7,Apple>F... E... O... S... P.

122
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,220
<6-8,House>靠
<6-8,House>Damn.

123
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,910
<6-9,Foreman>很抱歉abc我们必须摘除你的眼睛
<6-9,Foreman>I'm sorry. We need to remove your eye.

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,230
<6-10,Apple>我的眼睛?
<6-10,Apple>My eye?

125
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,320
<6-11,House>不久前 你还以为你会死掉
<6-11,House>A moment ago,you thought you were dying.

126
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,220
<6-11,House>相比之下 失明要算好消息了
<6-11,House>Blind's actually good news.

127
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,610
<6-11,House>不幸的是 他错了
<6-11,House>Unfortunately,he's wrong.

128
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,980
<6-12,Foreman>你刚做了视力检查
<6-12,Foreman>You just did the test.

129
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,340
<6-13,House>她没有眯眼去看
<6-13,House>She didn't squint.

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,200
<6-13,House>意味着她的眼睛以为看到了
<6-13,House>Which means the eye thinks it's fine.

131
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,130
<6-15,House>- 你错了abc- 我知道 眼睛不会"以为"
<6-15,House>- It was wrong.abc- I know. The eye doesn't think.

132
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,580
<6-15,House>是脑子以为abc说明她脑子出毛病了
<6-15,House>The brain thinks, which means if theabcthinking's wrong, the brain's wrong.

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,020
<6-15,House>就是说已经扩散到了大脑abc现在摘除眼睛太晚了
<6-15,House>Which means it's spread to the brain, whichabcmeans it's too late for us to remove the eye.

134
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,650
<6-15,House>也就是说abc只能把她整个脑袋摘除
<6-15,House>Which means we're gonna haveabcto remove your whole head.

135
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,510
<6-15,House>别担心 一点也不痛
<6-15,House>Don't worry. It doesn't hurt.

136
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,040
<6-16,House>幻觉
<6-16,House>Hallucination.

137
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,370
<6-16,House>这是脑子的问题 对吧?
<6-16,House>That's a brain thing, right?

138
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,660
<7-1,Foreman>引起幻觉的病因足有500种
<7-1,Foreman>500 different things canabccause hallucination.

139
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,240
<7-1,Foreman>不一定是神经上的
<7-1,Foreman>Doesn't mean it's neurological.

140
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,790
<7-2,House>如果其他移植者的脑子都有毛病abc那就是它了
<7-2,House>it does if one of the other organabcrecipients also had a brain issue.

141
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,270
<7-2,House>他刚才手垂下了吗?
<7-2,House>Did he just drop his hands?

142
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,320
<7-3,Thirteen>没有 他们的脑子都没问题
<7-3,Thirteen>No, none of them had brain issues.

143
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,820
<7-4,House>如果看到他的瞳孔扩张 固定abc如果看到脸部抽搐...
<7-4,House>if his pupils dilated, if his pupilsabcwere fixed,if there was a twitch...

144
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,840
<7-5,Foreman>他的脑袋受到重击abc然后挂了 没可疑
<7-5,Foreman>he got hit in the head,abche died,no mystery.

145
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,760
<7-5,Foreman>这正是你的观点
<7-5,Foreman>That was your point.

146
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,850
<7-6,House>昨天的
<7-6,House>Yesterday.

147
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,460
<7-6,House>活到老 学到老
<7-6,House>You live,you learn.

148
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,470
<7-6,House>这是谁拍的?
<7-6,House>Who shot this?

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,520
<7-7,Taub>拳击馆的老板有台摄像机
<7-7,Taub>guy who runs the gym has a camera.

150
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,600
<7-7,Taub>把拍的恶心东西传到网上
<7-7,Taub>Uploads the nasty stuff online.

151
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,590
<7-8,House>看不到死者的正面
<7-8,House>can't see the dead guy's face.

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,180
<7-8,House>看不到他的脸 看不到抽搐abc看不到瞳孔--
<7-8,House>I can't see his face,can't seeabcthe twitch, can't see the pupils--

153
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,230
<7-9,Thirteen>我们知道网球手的心脏有问题
<7-9,Thirteen>we know the tennis playerabchad a heart problem.

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,120
<7-9,Thirteen>也许可以和吹号手的肺联系起来
<7-9,Thirteen>We can maybe tie that toabcthe tuba player's lungs,

155
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,540
<7-9,Thirteen>接着把这两者和地盘工人的肝联系起来
<7-9,Thirteen>and then somehow tie both those things,abcto the construction worker's liver,

156
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,270
<7-9,Thirteen>然后七拐八拐地绕到abcFrank崩溃的胰脏上面
<7-9,Thirteen>and then possibly meander overabcto frank's pancreatic failure,

157
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,310
<7-9,Thirteen>但没什么会同时引发脑子和心脏的问题
<7-9,Thirteen>but nothing causesabcsimultaneous brain and heart problems.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,570
<7-10,Taub>癌症说不通
<7-10,Taub>Cancer made no sense.

159
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,900
<7-10,Taub>脑子和心脏的问题更说不通
<7-10,Taub>The head and heart makeabcless than no sense.

160
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,930
<7-11,Lucas>这句话完全没意义
<7-11,Lucas>that makes no sense.

161
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,720
<7-12,Taub>我知道 我只是强调这个观点
<7-12,Taub>I know. I was making a point.

162
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,040
<7-13,Lucas>这就好 我还以为你是傻子
<7-13,Lucas>Oh, good. I thought you were an idiot.

163
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,640
<7-14,Taub>你为什么要插话?
<7-14,Taub>Why are you talking?

164
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,190
<7-15,Lucas>维修工不能发表意见吗?
<7-15,Lucas>Oh, the guy doing manualabclabor can't have an opinion?

165
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,600
<7-15,Lucas>搞不好我是个热衷于修理咖啡机的天才
<7-15,Lucas>I might be a genius who just happens toabchave a passion for fixing coffee machines.

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,950
<7-15,Lucas>不 显然我不是abc但对他人妄下论断很不礼貌
<7-15,Lucas>No, I'm obviously not,but that'sabcrude to make assumptions about people.

167
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,830
<7-16,Kutner>捐赠者的经历没有异常
<7-16,Kutner>Donor's history came up clean.

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,230
<7-18,Kutner>他在笑吗?
<7-18,Kutner>Did he just laugh?

169
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,760
<7-19,Lucas>不 不 我在打喷嚏
<7-19,Lucas>No, no, I sneezed.

170
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,840
<7-20,Taub>他是个天才咖啡机修理工
<7-20,Taub>he's a genius coffee repairman.

171
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,940
<7-21,Kutner>咖啡机修理工为什么会穿格子袜?
<7-21,Kutner>Coffee repairman who wears argyle socks?

172
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,890
<7-22,Lucas>我想我已经说过了abc不要对他人妄下论断
<7-22,Lucas>I thought I alreadyabctalked about not judging.

173
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,530
<7-23,House>什么样的笨蛋会在工靴里穿格子袜?
<7-23,House>What kind of idiot wears argyleabcsocks with construction boots?

174
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,230
<7-24,Lucas>我不是笨蛋
<7-24,Lucas>Uh, I'm not an idiot.

175
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,510
<7-24,Lucas>我只是--不善于伪装
<7-24,Lucas>I'm just--I'm notabcgood at disguises.

176
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,670
<7-25,Foreman>他是谁?
<7-25,Foreman>Who is he?

177
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,380
<7-26,House>很明显 他是个很烂的私家侦探
<7-26,House>He's apparently a veryabcbad private investigator.

178
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,490
<7-27,Taub>那他为什么要假扮成咖啡机修理工?
<7-27,Taub>Uh, why is he pretending toabcfix the coffee machine?

179
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,000
<7-28,House>因为我想知道 在他发现什么之前abc你们这帮人能发现什么
<7-28,House>Because I wanted to find out what you guysabcfound out before I find out what he found out.

180
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,170
<7-28,House>我就可以知道abc是否需要雇一个私家侦探了
<7-28,House>So I can find out if Iabcneed a private investigator.

181
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,590
<7-28,House>还有呢?

<7-30,Lucas>他去了马德里和巴哈马

<7-36,Lucas>Timing fits.

192

<7-36,Lucas>她现在还是很正点

00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,040
<8-5,House>我还真是心胸狭窄

<8-6,Foreman>他是有肌肉紧张度abc但被打中时 暂时丧失
<8-6,Foreman>He maintained muscle tensity, but wasabcmomentarily distracted when he got hit.

215
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,340
<8-7,Kutner>他请私家侦探是否就说明abc以后不用我们破别人家的门了?
<8-7,Kutner>Does that P.I. Guy mean we don't haveabcto break into people's homes anymore?

216
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,230
<8-8,House>你们就是为了那个上医学院的
<8-8,House>It's the whole reason youabcwent to medical school.

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,450
<13-10,Lucas>第三种人和我要阐述的论点无关
<13-10,Lucas>but the third type's irrelevant toabcthe point I want to make.

343
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,220
<13-11,House>请你去这样烦人要收多少钱?
<13-11,House>Do you have a special rateabcplan for being a pain in the ass?

344
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,820
<13-12,Lucas>一种是要证明他们是对的abc一种要证明他们是错的
<13-12,Lucas>One type wants to find out that they're right,abcone type wants to find out that they're wrong.

345
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,030
<13-13,House>我是哪一种?
<13-13,House>Which type am I?

346
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,320
<13-14,Lucas>你是第三种
<13-14,Lucas>You're the third type.

347
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,020
<13-15,House>你先说和我无关的两种?
<13-15,House>You lead with the irrelevant types?

348
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,650
<13-16,Lucas>你这种是不在乎自己是对是错
<13-16,Lucas>You're the type that doesn't careabcif you're right or wrong

349
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,190
<13-16,Lucas>因为你雇我查的人就是错的
<13-16,Lucas>because they've hired me toabcinvestigate the wrong person.

350
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,220
<13-17,House>还真有这一种?
<13-17,House>That's an actual type?

351
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,660
<13-18,Lucas>你想让我调查的是Wilson.
<13-18,Lucas>You want meto check out Wilson.

352
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,140
<13-19,House>- 你想让我找出他是否--abc- 你怎么知道Wilson的?
<13-19,House>- You want to find out if he's--abc- how do you know about Wilson?

353
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,540
<13-20,Lucas>看我是干那一行的?
<13-20,Lucas>What do I do for a living?

354
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,620
<13-21,House>你调查过我?
<13-21,House>Have you been checking me out?

355
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,790
<13-21,House>这也要向我收费?
<13-21,House>I've been paying for that?

356
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,090
<13-22,Lucas>到目前为止 你什么钱都没付
<13-22,Lucas>So far,you haven't paid for anything.

357
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,310
<13-22,Lucas>你想找出他是否痛苦
<13-22,Lucas>You want to find out he's pining;

358
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,720
<13-22,Lucas>你想找出是否有迹象说明他会回来
<13-22,Lucas>you want to find out if there's something aboutabchim that will tell you he's gonna come back

359
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,580
<13-22,Lucas>或能让你把他弄回来
<13-22,Lucas>or something you canabcuse to make him come back.

360
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,900
<13-23,House>有吗?
<13-23,House>Is there?

361
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,930
<13-24,Lucas>没 什么都没有
<13-24,Lucas>No, no, there's nothing.

362
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,690
<13-24,Lucas>抱歉
<13-24,Lucas>Sorry.

363
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,030
<13-24,Lucas>这些要900块
<13-24,Lucas>That will be $900.

364
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,100
<13-25,House>我得走了
<13-25,House>I gotta go.

365
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,450
<13-25,House>我写支票给你
<13-25,House>I'll get you a check.

366
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
<14-1,Kutner>结肠镜没有发现
<14-1,Kutner>Colonoscopy was clean.

367
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,710
<14-2,House>那就剩癌症啦
<14-2,House>Then that just leaves cancer.

368
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,760
<14-3,Foreman>孩子的结肠镜检查结果阴性abc什么也证明不了
<14-3,Foreman>The fact that the kid's colonoscopyabcwas negative doesn't prove anything.

369
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,300
<14-4,House>什么也证明不了abc证明不了什么
<14-4,House>Yes, the fact that it didn't proveabcanything didn't prove anything.

370
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,040
<14-4,House>这观点好
<14-4,House>Excellent point.

371
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,980
<14-5,Foreman>我们不知道孩子有没遗传什么
<14-5,Foreman>We don't know if theabckid inherited anything.

372
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,900
<14-5,Foreman>即使有 按照Kutner的理论abc这是间歇性的
<14-5,Foreman>Even if she did, Kutner's theoryabcis that the thing's intermittent.

373
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,180
<14-6,Kutner>穿孔发生在死前不久
<14-6,Kutner>The opening would have to beabcopen shortly before death.

374
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,590
<14-7,House>不幸的是 只有在人死后abc才知道死前不久是哪个时点
<14-7,House>Unfortunately, we can't know when shortlyabcbefore death is until shortly after death.

375
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,150
<14-7,House>那可真是麻烦了
<14-7,House>And that seems like an obstacle.

376
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,900
<14-8,Kutner>如果有别的办法呢?
<14-8,Kutner>What if there was a way around that?

377
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,400
<14-9,House>那我们就算是白费功夫了
<14-9,House>Then we're kind of allabcsweating over nothing.

378
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,440
<14-10,Kutner>不是对付死亡 而是绕过死亡
<14-10,Kutner>Not around death,aroundabcdeath as an obstacle.

379
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,020
<14-10,Kutner>我们要看看他的结肠怎么活动
<14-10,Kutner>We need to see his colon at work.

380
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,900
<14-11,Forman>你知道死了就不活动了吧?
<14-11,Forman>You do know what death means, right?

381
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,360
<14-12,Kutner>没有生命系统 就没有压力让体液流动
<14-12,Kutner>Without a living system, there's notabcenough pressure to get fluid all the way up.

382
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,710
<14-12,Kutner>生命是不能创造 但制造压力不难
<14-12,Kutner>Life we can't create,abcyet,but pressure's easy.

383
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,700
<14-12,Kutner>可以用通常测试心脏工作量的abc高压水喷射器
<14-12,Kutner>We use the same high pressure waterabcjet we use to test cardiac workload.

384
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,360
<14-12,Kutner>虽然他不会醒着告诉我们哪里痛
<14-12,Kutner>I mean, he's not gonna beabcawake to tell us where it hurts--

385
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,360
<14-14,House>- 这不会abc- 就这样
<14-14,House>- it's notabcgonna-- - do it.

386
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,190
<15-1,Kutner>好像堵住了
<15-1,Kutner>It's kinda stuck.

387
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,540
<15-2,Foreman>不是一般的堵
<15-2,Foreman>It's more than stuck.

388
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,490
<15-2,Foreman>肠子都死了六小时了
<15-2,Foreman>The bowel's been dead for six hours.

389
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,650
<15-2,Foreman>不管打什么进去都弄不开的
<15-2,Foreman>No matter what you shootabcup there, it's closed.

390
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,850
<15-2,Foreman>真是疯了
<15-2,Foreman>This is nuts.

391
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,560
<15-3,Kutner>这是可调整的哦
<15-3,Kutner>It's adjustable.

392
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,180
<15-3,Kutner>- 成功了abc- 是啊
<15-3,Kutner>- It's working.abc- Yeah.

393
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,400
<15-4,Foreman>还不够
<15-4,Foreman>Not much.

394
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,470
<15-4,Foreman>再加压
<15-4,Foreman>Increase the pressure.

395
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,630
<15-5,Kutner>内诊境弯曲了
<15-5,Kutner>The endoscope's bowing.

396
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,740
<15-5,Kutner>推到胃部
<15-5,Kutner>Push on the stomach.

397
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,380
<15-6,Kutner>这些只是正常体液
<15-6,Kutner>Those are normal bodily fluids.

398
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,570
<15-7,Foreman>是啊 正常的体内污水
<15-7,Foreman>Yeah, normal bodily sewage.

399
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,150
<15-8,Kutner>再加压力
<15-8,Kutner>Put the pressure back on.

400
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,280
<15-8,Kutner>到底了 没病变
<15-8,Kutner>That's the end. No leaks.

401
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,250
<15-9,Foreman>等等 那是什么?
<15-9,Foreman>Wait. What's that?

402
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,790
<15-10,Kutner>只是末端阴影
<15-10,Kutner>That's just dark'cause I'm at the end.

403
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,240
<15-11,Foreman>如果这还不是末端呢?
<15-11,Foreman>What if you're not at the end?

404
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,100
<15-11,Foreman>如果这是损伤呢?
<15-11,Foreman>What if it's a core lesion?

405
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,360
<15-12,Kutner>要不再加点压?
<15-12,Kutner>Maybe a little more pressure?

406
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,670
<15-13,Foreman>别加太多 要这真是末端了我就...
<15-13,Foreman>Not too much.

407
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,990
<16-1,Thirteen>终于还是恶化了
<16-1,Thirteen>it's finally accelerating.

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,210
<16-1,Thirteen>Apple的心率变得不规律
<16-1,Thirteen>Apple's heart rate has become irregular.

409
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,000
<16-1,Thirteen>呼吸吃力
<16-1,Thirteen>Breathing is labored.

410
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,030
<16-1,Thirteen>结肠镜没查出病变
<16-1,Thirteen>Colonoscopy's still showing no leaks.

411
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,310
<16-2,Taub>会是自身免疫疾病吗?
<16-2,Taub>What if it is autoimmune?

412
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,180
<16-3,House>我们别再重复以前的对话行吗?
<16-3,House>What if we don't have conversationsabcwe've already had?

413
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,890
<16-3,House>5个中4个都活不了 病死了
<16-3,House>Four out of the five didn'tabclinger. They got sick and died.

414
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,520
<16-3,House>没时间去排除已经排除过的病
<16-3,House>We don't have time to dismiss thingsabcwe've already dismissed.

415
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,130
<16-4,Kutner>没有一种病症说得通
<16-4,Kutner>Nothing fits.

416
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,960
<16-5,House>这正是重复以前对话的一个例子
<16-5,House>See, that's an example of aabcconversation we've already had.

417
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,990
<16-5,House>她病了 肯定有病症说得通
<16-5,House>She's sick. Something fits.

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,300
<16-6,Foreman>- 多发性硬化病?abc- 不是!
<16-6,Foreman>- Ms?abc- No!

419
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,870
<16-7,House>从现在起 没有新建议就别发话
<16-7,House>Okay, from now on,no one saysabcanything unless no one's said it before.

420
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,040
<16-8,Foreman>你去哪?
<16-8,Foreman>Where are you going?

421
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,920
<16-9,House>给她脑脊液用免疫凝胶查隐藏蛋白指标
<16-9,House>You guys start immuno-gels on her csfabcto look for hidden protein markers.

422
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,330
<16-9,House>然后给她做基因测序
<16-9,House>Then start sequencing her genes.

423
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,140
<16-9,House>我要开始治疗了
<16-9,House>I'm gonna start treatment.

424
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,690
<16-10,Foreman>- 按什么治?abc- 癌症
<16-10,Foreman>- Treatment for what?abc- Cancer.

425
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,910
<16-12,Thirteen>不是癌症 化疗是很危险的
<16-12,Thirteen>It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.

426
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,580
<16-13,House>反正是有病了
<16-13,House>It's something.

427
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,500
<16-13,House>那我们就得治病
<16-13,House>Which means we shouldabctreat her for something.

428
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,590
<17-1,House>她没事
<17-1,House>She's fine.

429
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,360
<17-1,House>她的表在哪?
<17-1,House>Where's her chart?

430
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,550
<17-2,Nurse>你按紧急铃就是为了找她的表?
<17-2,Nurse>You rang emergency to get her chart?

431
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,920
<17-2,Nurse>我知道是我不好
<17-2,Nurse>I know. That was bad of me.

432
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,950
<17-3,House>但是病人的表是应该扣在床尾
<17-3,House>But I'm pretty sure the chart'sabcsupposed to be attached to the bed

433
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,580
<17-3,House>这样病人快死时abc跛子医生就不用满医院找了
<17-3,House>so that gimp doctors don't have toabclook all over the place while patients die.

434
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,570
<17-3,House>非常感谢
<17-3,House>Thank you so much.

435
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,890
<17-3,House>有空的话给我来一杯胡椒薄荷茶
<17-3,House>And some peppermintabctea when you get a chance.

436
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,870
<17-3,House>我要你签点东西
<17-3,House>I need you to sign something.

437
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,980
<17-4,Apple>化疗同意书
<17-4,Apple>Consent to chemotherapy.

438
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,020
<17-4,Apple>你发现肿瘤了?
<17-4,Apple>You found cancer?

439
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,890
<17-5,House>没有
<17-5,House>No.

440
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,360
<17-6,Apple>- 那检测结果显示-- - 没有
<17-6,Apple>- Then you have tests indicating--abc- nope.

441
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,470
<17-8,Apple>那我为什么要签?
<17-8,Apple>Then why should I sign it?

442
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,960
<17-9,House>问得好
<17-9,House>That's a good question.

443
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,500
<17-9,House>值得我详细解答
<17-9,House>It deserves a complicated answer.

444
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,590
<17-9,House>安慰剂效应
<17-9,House>Placebo effect.

445
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,550
<17-9,House>人们对医生 诊断和药有信心
<17-9,House>People have confidence in doctors, they haveabcconfidence in diagnoses, confidence in medicine.

446
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,890
<17-9,House>有时候会因为心理作用而有点好转
<17-9,House>Sometimes they get a little betterabcjust because they think they will.

447
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,260
<17-9,House>这样会使我们误以为找对了路子
<17-9,House>And that can make us think thatabcthe wrong answer is the right answer.

448
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,740
<17-9,House>是很不好的
<17-9,House>Which is very bad.

449
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,310
<17-10,Apple>所以你有证据指明癌症但不能告诉我
<17-10,Apple>So you do have proof that it'sabccancer but you can't tell me

450
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,750
<17-10,Apple>因为这样会影响我对药物的反应?
<17-10,Apple>because it might affect theabcway I react to the medicine?

451
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,080
<17-11,House>要是真的如此 就会有影响
<17-11,House>If that were true, and itabcwould certainly make sense,

452
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,380
<17-11,House>你想我会告诉你这是真的?
<17-11,House>do you think I couldabctell you that it's true?

<20-7,House>我从不认为是癌症

<20-9,House>我认为她的病有着癌症的表相
<20-9,House>I thought that what sheabchad acted like cancer.

546
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,100
<20-9,House>如果表现得像癌症abc也许对治疗的反应也会像癌症
<20-9,House>If it acts like cancer,maybeabcit'll respond like cancer.

547
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,900
<20-10,Thirteen>确实反应像 因为就是癌症
<20-10,Thirteen>It did. 'Cause it's cancer.

548
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,050
<20-11,House>得揪出这个走着唱着都像癌症
<20-11,House>We have to find something that walksabclike cancer, talks like cancer,

549

<20-11,House>却不是癌症的家伙
<20-11,House>tastes like cancer,but isn't cancer.

<20-12,Kutner>我们不干
<20-12,Kutner>No, we don't.

551

555
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,080

<20-16,Thirteen>Tibalt.

556
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,970
<20-17,House>关键在于他最后一个死 还是死了
<20-17,House>The point is,he died last, but he died.

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,260
<20-17,House>说明她也会死
<20-17,House>Which means she's gonna die too.

558
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,360
<20-18,Foreman>Tibalt 没有服用治疗癌症的药物
<20-18,Foreman>Tibalt wasn'tabcreceiving cancer medication.

559
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,210
<20-19,House>有一种治癌药私下被用来治疗关节炎
<20-19,House>there's a cancer drug that'sabcused off-label for arthritis.

<20-20,Kutner>他没得关节炎
<20-20,Kutner>There's no record of arthritis.

<20-21,House>有没有询问过所有学吹大号的学生?
<20-21,House>Did you interview all the tuba students?

<20-22,Thirteen>如果他手上关节痛 不可能弹奏
<20-22,Thirteen>If he had joint pain in hisabchands, he couldn't have played.

563
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,820
<20-23,House>那就不是手关节
<20-23,House>Then it wasn't in his hands.

564
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,150
<20-24,Taub>为什么要关注他的学生?

<22-14,House>- Do you wanna be my friend?abc- No. You scare me a little.

626
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,760
<22-16,House>他觉得如果他不是我朋友 就不能跟我说话
<22-16,House>He thinks if he's not aabcfriend,he can't talk to me.

627
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,790

633
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,520

<22-21,Lucas>It's like that"cancer, but not cancer"abcthing you were talking about before.

634
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:39,630
<22-21,Lucas>朋友是朋友 客户是客户abc一就是一 二就是二
<22-21,Lucas>Friends are friends, customers are customers,abcand everything elseis everything else.

<22-21,Lucas>如果不这样 那就都乱套了
<22-21,Lucas>If it's not,nothing's nothing.

636
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,330
<22-22,House>或者说万事皆有可能

<22-24,House>世界没有她想得那么丑陋
<22-24,House>The world is not asabcugly as she thinks it is.

00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,260
<22-24,House>是癌症 但又不是
<22-24,House>Cancer, but not cancer.

640
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,170
<23-1,House>这说不通 除非...
<23-1,House>Doesn't make any sense unless...

641
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,900
<23-1,House>病人大脑也不是大脑
<23-1,House>brain, but not brain.

642

<23-1,House>枕叶正常 可她眼睛失明
<23-1,House>Occipital lobe's normal.abcBut her eyes suck.

643
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,920
<23-1,House>枕叶应该起到代偿视力的作用
<23-1,House>That lobe should be compensating.

644
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,940
<23-1,House>既然没有 那就说明大脑里有不该有的东西
<23-1,House>Since it's not, that tells me that something'sabcin there that shouldn't be in there.

645
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,990
<23-1,House>是大脑 可又不是
<23-1,House>Brain, but not brain.

646
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,050
<23-2,Cuddy>你为什么来我的办公室?
<23-2,Cuddy>Why are you in my office?

647
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,650
<23-3,House>要找出病变 我得切下她的头顶盖
<23-3,House>To find the anomaly, I needabcto chop off the top of her head.

<23-4,Cuddy>我打算相信你的第一直觉
<23-4,Cuddy>I'm gonna trust your first instinct.

650
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,080
<23-5,House>你这么说把我弄糊涂了
<23-5,House>I'm not usually confused whenabcyou say things like that.

651
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,890
<23-6,Cuddy>我让他们继续按癌症给她治疗
<23-6,Cuddy>I'm ordering herabccancer treatment to be continued.

652
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,050
<23-6,Cuddy>怎么修个咖啡机花了2300块?
<23-6,Cuddy>Why does it cost $2,300 toabcfix a coffee machine?

653
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,360
<23-7,House>是存在肿瘤干细胞
<23-7,House>Cancer stem cells are real.

654
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,990
<23-7,House>它们是一切问题的答案
<23-7,House>They explain everything.

655
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,640
<23-7,House>它们就像胚胎干细胞
<23-7,House>They're like embryonic stem cells.

656
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,800
<23-7,House>想变成什么就变成什么
<23-7,House>They become whatever they want.

657
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,150
<23-7,House>捐赠人是携带者 所以感染了器官接受者
<23-7,House>Donor had them, the recipients got them.

658
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,120
<23-7,House>这些细胞随着血液流动 停到某个器官上
<23-7,House>They floated around,theyabclanded on an organ,

<23-7,House>浸润在细胞群中 部分分化
<23-7,House>got bathed in cytomes andabcpartially differentiated.

660
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,890
<23-7,House>关键就在于'部分'
<23-7,House>And the key word there is partially.

661
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,490
<23-7,House>在大号手体内 它们变成肺abc但又不是肺
<23-7,House>In the tuba player,theyabcbecame lung, but not lung.

<23-7,House>如果你明白规律了 就让我闭嘴
<23-7,House>Stop me if you'veabcfigured out the pattern.

<23-7,House>看起来是器官的一部分abc可并没有发挥器官的功能
<23-7,House>They looked as if they belonged,abcbut they weren't doing their jobs.

665
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,230
<23-7,House>当需要这些器官发挥作用的时候abc就出事了
<23-7,House>And when they were really needed, boom.

666
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,670
<23-7,House>化疗起作用是因为abc这些细胞基本算是肿瘤
<23-7,House>Chemo worked becauseabccells are basically tumors.

667
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,110
<23-7,House>化疗抑制了它们
<23-7,House>Chemo shrunk them.

668
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,730
<23-7,House>你还是不同意 对吧?
<23-7,House>You're still gonna say no,aren't you?

669
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,000
<23-8,Cuddy>你没法证实
<23-8,Cuddy>You've no proof.

670
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,030
<23-9,House>我有大脑扫描结果
<23-9,House>I have the brain scan.

<23-10,Cuddy>结果是正常的
<23-10,Cuddy>The normal brain scan.

672
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,560
<23-11,House>所以我才需要切下她的头顶盖
<23-11,House>This is whyI need to take off her head.

673
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,200
<23-12,Cuddy>为了治疗 还是为了证明你是对的?
<23-12,Cuddy>To treat or to prove you're right?

674
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,010
<23-12,Cuddy>为了治疗
<23-12,Cuddy>To treat.

675
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,020
