<1-3,Jessica>- Mmm. You don't feel warm. - My stomach hurts.

<1-4,Mom>亲爱的  如果你没发烧...
<1-4,Mom>Well, honey, if you don't have a fever-

<1-5,Jessica>我不想去学校  我可以在家学习
<1-5,Jessica>I don't wanna go to school. I can do my work at home.

<1-6,Mom>杰西卡  怎么了
<1-6,Mom>Jessica, what's wrong?

8
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,720
<1-7,Jessica>大家都讨厌我
<1-7,Jessica>Everybody hates me.

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,220
<1-8,Mom>他们不会讨厌你的
<1-8,Mom>Oh, they don't hate you.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,030
<1-8,Mom>他们都不了解你
<1-8,Mom>They don't even know you

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,570
<1-8,Mom>因为他们愚蠢得对你产生了成见
<1-8,Mom>because they're too ignorant to try.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,360
<1-9,Jessica>-我讨厌我自己  -杰西卡  别这么说
<1-9,Jessica>- I hate myself. - Jessica, don't say that.

<1-10,Mom>亲爱的  看着我  看着我
<1-10,Mom>Oh, honey. Look at me. Look at me.

<1-11,Jessica>- Don't let a few bad apples - A few? Try my whole class.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,630
<1-12,Mom>记得那个故事吗
<1-12,Mom>Remember the story where the guy

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,130
<1-12,Mom>有个人一直说自己讨厌鸡蛋和火腿
<1-12,Mom>keeps saying that he hates green eggs and ham?

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,070
<1-12,Mom>最后他才发现其实他喜欢
<1-12,Mom>And then at the end he realized he really loved them?

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,280
<1-12,Mom>总有一天他们会知道你是个多么好的孩子
<1-12,Mom>One day, they're gonna realize what a great kid you really are.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,250
<1-12,Mom>你只要做自己就好了  而且不要放弃
<1-12,Mom>You just gotta be like Sam-l-Am. And don't give up.

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,710
<1-13,Jessica>好吧
<1-13,Jessica>Okay.

<10-5,Foreman>-我胸口疼  -你以为地板不疼吗
<10-5,Foreman>- My chest hurts. - How do you think the ground feels?

<10-6,Chase>赛斯  罚跑两圈  再见
<10-6,Chase>Hey, Seth. Two laps. Bye.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,450
<10-7,Jessica>杰西卡  只是一点小疼痛
<10-7,Jessica>Hey, Jess. It's just a stitch.

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,140
<10-8,Cameron>保持呼吸节奏  你能行的
<10-8,Cameron>Okay? Just... keep breathin". You got it.

<10-9,Jessica>I can't.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,640
<10-10,Mom>只剩10秒了  你能行的
<10-10,Mom>Only 10 more seconds. You got it.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,580
<10-11,Jessica>杰西卡  杰西卡
<10-11,Jessica>Jessica? Jessica?

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,300
<10-12,Mom>杰西卡
<10-12,Mom>Jessica!

37
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,280
<10-12,Mom>天啊  快去办公室叫帕森斯老师  快
<10-12,Mom>Oh, my God. Hey, go to the office. Get Miss Parsons. Now!

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,450
<12-1,House>我在芬利小学的操场上
<12-1,House>I'm on the playground at Finley Elementary.

39
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,070
<12-2,Foreman>有个学生心脏病发作了
<12-2,Foreman>One of my students is havin' a heart attack.

40
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,650
<12-2,Foreman>她10岁  你以为我不知道吗
<12-2,Foreman>Yeah, she's 10. Don't you think I know that?

41
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,840
<12-2,Foreman>赶紧派辆该死的救护车来
<12-2,Foreman>Just send the damn ambulance.

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,540
<12-2,Foreman>拜托  醒醒  拜托了宝贝儿
<12-2,Foreman>Come on. Wake up. Come on, sweetie.

43
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,670
<12-2,Foreman>本德尔医生  请拨分机2870
<12-2,Foreman>Dr. Bender, call extension 2870.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,830
<12-2,Foreman>你见过因为穿孔而感染的阴囊吗
<12-2,Foreman>You ever seen an infected pierced scrotum?

45
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,870
<3-1,House>没  不过我倒是先看看什么人会这么做
<3-1,House>Um, no, but I know a few people on whom I'd like to see it happen.

46
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,710
<3-2,Cuddy>我们得谈谈
<3-2,Cuddy>We need to talk.

47
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,370
<3-3,House>要是想找疼的话  应该穿阴茎
<3-3,House>Well, if pain's what you're after, the penis is really the way to go.

48
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,460
<3-4,Cuddy>-我推荐阴茎钉  -我们说正经的
<3-4,Cuddy>- I'd recommend the apadravya. - We're not talking.

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,740
<3-4,Cuddy>不是挺正经的吗
<3-4,Cuddy>Oh. It sounded like we were.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,120
<3-5,House>不  你总是绕开话题
<3-5,House>No, you're attempting to avoid talking

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,220
<3-6,Cuddy>因为你知道我要谈什么
<3-6,Cuddy>because you know what I wanna talk about.

52
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,980
<3-8,Cuddy>-乳头吗  -你得炒掉你的人其中一个
<3-8,Cuddy>- Nipples? - You need to get rid of one of your people.

53
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,120
<3-9,House>当然  等我做完绩效考核
<3-9,House>Absolutely. As soon as I do performance reviews.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,380
<3-9,House>然后再复审一下考核结果
<3-9,House>And then review the reviews, of course.

55
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,580
<3-9,House>没有调查就没有发言权  你知道的
<3-9,House>A decision like this can't be made without proper, you know, review.

56
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,810
<3-9,House>应该不会超过一个月  可能两个月
<3-9,House>Shouldn't take longer than a month, maybe two.

57
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,320
<3-9,House>最多四个月  除非变得复杂不堪
<3-9,House>Four at the most, unless it gets complicated.

58
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,320
<3-10,Cuddy>没门
<3-10,Cuddy>There's no way outta this.

59
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,650
<3-10,Cuddy>你最好速战速决
<3-10,Cuddy>You might as well get it over with as fast as you can,

60
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,630
<3-10,Cuddy>快刀斩乱麻
<3-10,Cuddy>like ripping off a Band-Aid.

61
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,030
<3-11,House>可要搞定的不是一团乱麻
<3-11,House>Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze,

62
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,200
<3-11,House>而是一个人
<3-11,House>it's a human being.

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,030
<3-12,Cuddy>-说得你很在乎似的  -说得你不在乎似的
<3-12,Cuddy>- Like you care. - Like you don't.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,350
<3-14,Cuddy>给你一周时间  搞定这事
<3-14,Cuddy>You have a week. Get it done.

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,450
<3-15,Cameron>我们有个从兰基威兹医生那转来的病人
<3-15,Cameron>We have a referral from Dr. Lenkiewicz.

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
<3-17,Cameron>-我不认识他  -他认识你
<3-17,Cameron>- Don't know him. - He knows you.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,370
<3-19,Cameron>-什么问题  -心脏病发作
<3-19,Cameron>- What's the problem? - Heart attack.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,930
<3-20,House>-真不认识他  -病人才10岁
<3-20,House>- Definitely don't know him. - The patient's 10.

69
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,610
<4-1,Foreman>10岁不应该有心脏病  肯定是弄错了
<4-1,Foreman>Ten-year-olds do not have heart attacks. It's gotta be a mistake.

70
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,220
<4-2,House>当然  最简单的解释是
<4-2,House>Right. Simplest explanation is

71
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,060
<4-2,House>她在撒谎  她其实40岁了
<4-2,House>she's a 40-year-old lying about her age.

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,960
<4-2,House>说不定是个想装嫩的女演员
<4-2,House>Maybe an actress trying to hang on.

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,890
<4-3,Foreman>我是说可能检查出问题了
<4-3,Foreman>I meant maybe the tests were wrong.

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,550
<4-4,Cameron>急诊室也这么想的
<4-4,Cameron>That's what the E.R. Thought.

75
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,860
<4-4,Cameron>三次肌酸激酶检测都是阳性
<4-4,Cameron>Three C.K. -M.B. 's were positive.

76
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,100
<4-4,Cameron>心电图显示ST段抬高  确实是心脏病
<4-4,Cameron>The E.K.G. shows classic signs of S. T. Elevation. It's a heart attack.

77
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,390
<4-5,Chase>她病态肥胖  所以有这些心脏病征兆
<4-5,Chase>She's morbidly obese. The "Morbid" Part of that raises alarms.

78
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,370
<4-6,Foreman>拜托  要吃成心脏病得好几十年呢
<4-6,Foreman>Come on. It takes decades to eat your way into a heart attack.

79
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,890
<4-7,Chase>但自杀用不了几十年
<4-7,Chase>Doesn't take decades to kill yourself.

80
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,980
<4-7,Chase>如果我那么胖  我宁肯服毒自尽了
<4-7,Chase>If I was that fat, I'd be pretty tempted to knock back a bottle of pills.

81
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,660
<4-8,Cameron>不是服药过量
<4-8,Cameron>It's not a drug overdose.

82
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,050
<4-8,Cameron>疲劳  肌肉疼痛和无法集中精神
<4-8,Cameron>The fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating

83
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,270
<4-8,Cameron>这些症状已经持续一年多了
<4-8,Cameron>have been bothering her for over a year.

84
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,370
<4-9,Chase>这是因为她的体重  还有抑郁
<4-9,Chase>That's because of her weight, her depression.

85
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,390
<4-10,House>五个儿科医生  两个营养学家
<4-10,House>That's what five pediatricians, two nutritionists

86
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,300
<4-10,House>和一个心理学家都这么说
<4-10,House>and a psychologist said.

87
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,790
<4-10,House>心脏发病说明他们肯定遗漏了什么
<4-10,House>The heart attack would seem to indicate that they missed something.

88
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,840
<4-11,Foreman>应该是遗传因素吧
<4-11,Foreman>It's gotta be something genetic.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,650
<4-12,Cameron>是不是X代谢综合征
<4-12,Cameron>What about metabolic syndrome "X"?

90
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,000
<4-13,Chase>抗胰岛素吗
<4-13,Chase>Insulin resistance?

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,290
<4-14,Foreman>X综合征可以导致中风
<4-14,Foreman>Syndrome "X" Could cause a stroke.

92
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,420
<4-14,Foreman>但我没听过还有心脏病的
<4-14,Foreman>I don't know about a heart attack.

93
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,210
<4-15,House>如果血压够高的话  可能的
<4-15,House>It could, if her blood pressure was high enough.

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,910
<4-16,Cameron>很有可能  看看她的体重就知道了
<4-16,Cameron>Which is likely, considering her weight.

95
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,670
<4-17,House>和症状相符  我同意
<4-17,House>Fits the symptoms. Me likee.

96
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,680
<4-17,House>做一个高胰岛素-正常血糖钳夹检测
<4-17,House>Do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.

97
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,030
<4-17,House>对了  还有件事
<4-17,House>Oh, and one more thing.

98
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,440
<4-17,House>上级通知我  这周内我得炒掉你们中的一个
<4-17,House>I've been told that I gotta get rid of one of you guys by the end of the week.

99
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,930
<4-17,House>新官上任三把火  你们明白的
<4-17,House>New sheriff. Belt tightening. You know how it goes.

100
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,600
<4-17,House>行了  去吧
<4-17,House>Okay. Carry on.

101
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,910
<4-18,Foreman>他又在戏弄我们了
<4-18,Foreman>Some kind of game.

102
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,130
<4-18,Foreman>豪斯自创的整人节目
<4-18,Foreman>House's own version of Punk'd.

103
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,610
<4-19,Cameron>不是豪斯  是沃格勒
<4-19,Cameron>It's not House. It's Vogler.

104
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,110
<4-19,Cameron>不能让这事影响我们  我们得团结一致
<4-19,Cameron>We can't let it get to us. We've gotta stick together.

105
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,710
<4-20,Chase>为什么
<4-20,Chase>Why?

106
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,070
<4-21,Cameron>难道你觉得我们该为此斗得你死我活吗
<4-21,Cameron>Are you suggesting we start slashing each other's throats?

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,940
<4-22,Chase>我是说这是个零和博弈
<4-22,Chase>I'm suggesting it's a zero-sum game.

108
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,190
<4-22,Chase>你输了我就赢了
<4-22,Chase>Your loss is my win.

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,110
<4-22,Chase>团队合作好像没什么好处
<4-22,Chase>That's not conducive to team play.

110
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,820
<4-23,Foreman>豪斯就是想看好戏
<4-23,Foreman>Which is what House seems to want.

111
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,520
<4-23,Foreman>我同意卡梅隆
<4-23,Foreman>Look, I'm with Cameron.

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,710
<4-23,Foreman>虽然可能不是个好主意
<4-23,Foreman>It may be a bad strategy,

113
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,750
<4-23,Foreman>但我不想满足豪斯的看客心理
<4-23,Foreman>but I don't wanna give House that satisfaction.

114
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,870
<4-23,Foreman>走啦  孩子还病着呢
<4-23,Foreman>Come on. Sick kid, remember?

115
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,090
<5-1,Mom>她有糖尿病吗
<5-1,Mom>She's diabetic?

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,490
<5-2,Cameron>不  但差不多
<5-2,Cameron>No, but it's similar.

117
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,750
<5-2,Cameron>X代谢综合征的病人对胰岛素没有反应
<5-2,Cameron>M.S.X. Patients don't respond normally to insulin,

118
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,310
<5-2,Cameron>所以他们的身体产生了过多的糖
<5-2,Cameron>which causes their body to create too much,

119
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,170
<5-2,Cameron>导致一系列的代谢异常
<5-2,Cameron>and that leads to metabolic abnormalities.

120
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,610
<5-2,Cameron>我们会做个测试来确诊
<5-2,Cameron>We're going to do a test to be sure,

121
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,080
<5-2,Cameron>但这个测试有一定的风险
<5-2,Cameron>but there are certain dangers.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,230
<5-3,Mom>这个病可以...  治疗吗
<5-3,Mom>Is this... thing treatable?

123
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,340
<5-4,Cameron>可以通过适当的饮食和锻炼控制病情
<5-4,Cameron>It's controllable through proper diet and exercise.

124
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,270
<5-5,Mom>等等  杰西卡的饮食已经很健康了
<5-5,Mom>Wait. Jessica already eats right,

125
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,560
<5-5,Mom>而且她每天都锻炼
<5-5,Mom>and she exercises every day.

126
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,110
<5-6,Cameron>我知道你们看过一些营养学家
<5-6,Cameron>I know you've already seen several nutritionists-

127
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,720
<5-7,Mom>而且我们采纳了他们所有的建议
<5-7,Mom>And we've done everything they've recommended.

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,960
<5-8,Cameron>我明白  但...
<5-8,Cameron>I understand, but-

129
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,440
<5-9,Mom>为什么你们医生就没有人能忽略她的肥胖呢
<5-9,Mom>Why can't any of you doctors see past her weight?

130
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,460
<5-9,Mom>如果饮食和锻炼可以治疗的话
<5-9,Mom>If diet and exercise are the treatment,

131
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,560
<5-9,Mom>那这个诊断肯定是错的
<5-9,Mom>then the diagnosis is wrong.

132
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,730
<5-10,Cameron>有可能
<5-10,Cameron>It might be.

133
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,610
<5-10,Cameron>但确诊的唯一方法是你允许我们做这个检测
<5-10,Cameron>But the only way we'll know is if you let us do this test.

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,680
<6-1,Lucille>很难受  特别是晚上
<6-1,Lucille>It's really bad, especially at night.

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,990
<6-1,Lucille>好像心里着火了似的
<6-1,Lucille>It's like my heart is on fire. Like it's, um-

136
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,950
<6-1,Lucille>我也说不清楚  好像...
<6-1,Lucille>Oh, I don't know. Like, uh-

137
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,760
<6-2,House>-灼热  -没错
<6-2,House>- Burning? - Exactly.

138
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,460
<6-4,House>听上去像是...  烧心
<6-4,House>sounds almost like... heartburn.

139
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,190
<6-5,Lucille>-你能给我点什么吗  -给你本十万个为什么?
<6-5,Lucille>- So, can you give me somethin'? - Like a thesaurus?

140
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,020
<6-6,House>什么
<6-6,House>What?

141
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,120
<6-8,House>你没在产前检查时提过这个症状吧
<6-8,House>I take it you never mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits.

142
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,050
<6-9,Lucille>产前
<6-9,Lucille>Prenatal?

143
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,450
<6-9,Lucille>我没怀孕
<6-9,Lucille>I'm not pregnant.

144
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,090
<6-10,House>不好意思  除非你是听诊器
<6-10,House>Sorry, you don't get to make that call

145
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,020
<6-10,House>否则你没资格这么说  统一规定
<6-10,House>unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules.

146
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,050
<6-11,Lucille>我知道我怀没怀孕
<6-11,Lucille>I know when I'm pregnant, all right?

147
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,600
<6-11,Lucille>我都有六个小孩了
<6-11,Lucille>I have six kids.

148
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,550
<6-11,Lucille>所以我丈夫做了输精管切除术
<6-11,Lucille>That's why my husband had a vasectomy,

149
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,010
<6-11,Lucille>而且我们还用安全套
<6-11,Lucille>and we use condoms.

150
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,630
<6-12,House>输精管被切了可以自己恢复
<6-12,House>Vasectomies can reverse themselves.

151
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,870
<6-12,House>安全套可能会破
<6-12,House>Condoms break.

152
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,560
<6-13,Lucille>好吧  女人就该长成这样
<6-13,Lucille>Okay. This... is what a woman is supposed to look like.

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,860
<6-13,Lucille>我们不能只是皮包骨头
<6-13,Lucille>Okay? We're not just skin and bones.

154
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,240
<6-13,Lucille>我们有...  肉肉  有...  曲线
<6-13,Lucille>We have... flesh. We have... curves.

155
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,570
<6-14,House>你有个小小人在你身体里
<6-14,House>You have little people inside you.

156
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,700
<6-14,House>好吧  好吧
<6-14,House>Okay, okay.

157
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,340
<6-14,House>对不起  我想我可能被媒体
<6-14,House>I'm sorry. I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media...

158
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,050
<6-14,House>和多年的医学教育给洗脑了
<6-14,House>and all those years of medical training.

159
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,770
<6-16,House>-没错  -趁护士给你抽血
<6-16,House>- Damn right. - I'll see if I can

160
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,290
<6-16,House>我去试着帮你找点抗酸剂
<6-16,House>find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood.

161
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,090
<6-17,Lucille>抽血  为什么
<6-17,Lucille>Blood? Why?

162
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,570
<6-18,House>烧心  我们得确定它不会传染
<6-18,House>The heartburn. Gotta make sure it's not... spreading.

163
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,710
<7-1,Jessica>我不要
<7-1,Jessica>I don't want to.

164
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,450
<7-2,Chase>这项测试涉及一些十分精确的测量手段
<7-2,Chase>The test involves some pretty precise measurements.

165
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,560
<7-2,Chase>如果我们不知道你的精确体重
<7-2,Chase>If we don't know exactly how much you weigh,

166
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,500
<7-2,Chase>我们就无法得到正确结果
<7-2,Chase>we won't get the right answers.

167
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,910
<7-3,Foreman>告诉你个秘密
<7-3,Foreman>Let me tell you a secret.

168
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,670
<7-3,Foreman>我在你这么大的时候也很胖
<7-3,Foreman>When I was your age, I was heavy too.

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,380
<7-4,Jessica>你超过了100磅吗
<7-4,Jessica>Were you over a hundred?

170
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,540
<7-5,Foreman>胖多了  邻居的小孩都叫我"里让"
<7-5,Foreman>Way over. Kids in my neighborhood used to call me "Rerun."

171
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,070
<7-6,Jessica>-里让  -他是电视里一个很胖的人
<7-6,Jessica>- Rerun? - He was a heavy guy from TV.

172
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,500
<7-7,Foreman>我装作很喜欢这个外号  其实并不是
<7-7,Foreman>I used to pretend I liked it, but I didn't.

173
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,630
<7-8,Jessica>那你怎么瘦下来的
<7-8,Jessica>How come you're not heavy anymore?

174
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,770
<7-9,Foreman>九年级的时候  长高了5英寸
<7-9,Foreman>Ninth grade, grew five inches.

175
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,420
<7-9,Foreman>所有问题都迎刃而解
<7-9,Foreman>Everything kind of evened out.

176
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,140
<7-10,Jessica>-你觉得我也会那样吗  -当然
<7-10,Jessica>- You think that'll happen to me? - Well, yeah.

177
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,700
<7-11,Foreman>你妈妈挺高的
<7-11,Foreman>Your mom's tall,

178
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,390
<7-11,Foreman>你在这个年龄又偏矮
<7-11,Foreman>and you are a little short for your age.

179
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,450
<7-11,Foreman>可能马上就要猛长了
<7-11,Foreman>Probably spring right up.

180
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,420
<8-1,Chase>肥胖可不是你长着长着就没了
<8-1,Chase>Obesity isn't something you just grow out of.

181
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,960
<8-2,Foreman>你没见过婴儿吗
<8-2,Foreman>I take it you've never seen a baby?

182
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,010
<8-3,Chase>她可不是婴儿  她都10岁了
<8-3,Chase>She's not a baby. She's 10.

183
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,430
<8-4,Foreman>你以为让她觉得自己是个废物就能帮到她吗
<8-4,Foreman>And you figure making her feel like crap would do her a world of good?

184
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,310
<8-5,Chase>当然  如果能让她不再成天躺在沙发上的话
<8-5,Chase>Yeah, if it gets her off the couch.

185
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,620
<8-6,Cameron>我确信她承受的压力已经够大了
<8-6,Cameron>I'm sure she's already under enough pressure.

186
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,640
<8-7,Chase>肯定不是她妈妈给的
<8-7,Chase>Not from Mummy.

187
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,750
<8-8,Cameron>社会的方方面面都表明  苗条才能成功
<8-8,Cameron>Everything in society tells us we have to be thin to be successful.

188
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,390
<8-8,Cameron>才不是
<8-8,Cameron>No.

189
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,860
<8-9,Chase>社会只是告诉大家纤瘦比较有吸引力
<8-9,Chase>Society tells you you have to be thin to be attractive.

190
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,590
<8-9,Chase>知道吗
<8-9,Chase>And guess what?

191
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,980
<8-9,Chase>苗条和吸引力就是同义词
<8-9,Chase>That's what attractive means,

192
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,770
<8-9,Chase>大家都喜欢观摩你
<8-9,Chase>that society likes looking at you.

193
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,740
<8-10,Cameron>我觉得应该告诉孩子们  健康才是最美的
<8-10,Cameron>I think we should be telling our kids it's fine as long as they're healthy.

194
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,090
<8-11,Chase>当然  你只有90磅是因为这样更健康吗
<8-11,Chase>Right. You weigh 90 pounds because it makes you healthier?

195
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,890
<8-12,Foreman>算了
<8-12,Foreman>Forget it.

196
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,670
<8-12,Foreman>他只是觉得要滚蛋的是他  所以心情不好
<8-12,Foreman>He's just cranky because he knows he's the one who's gonna get the ax.

197
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,140
<9-1,Wilson>有想法了吗
<9-1,Wilson>So, any thoughts?

198
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,910
<9-2,House>什么  沙龙[以色列总理]对加沙的政策吗
<9-2,House>On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?

199
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,310
<9-3,Wilson>你要炒谁鱿鱼
<9-3,Wilson>Who you gonna let go?

200
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,120
<9-4,House>我想我可以说服沃格勒
<9-4,House>I'm thinking I can convince Vogler

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,800
<9-4,House>把他们全留下最划算
<9-4,House>it would be more cost-efficient to keep all of them.

202
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,590
<9-5,Wilson>好吧  你可能会搞定他
<9-5,Wilson>Yeah, you should be able to pull that off.

203
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,730
<9-5,Wilson>大部分亿万富翁都没什么数学头脑
<9-5,Wilson>Most billionaires aren't very good with numbers.

204
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,900
<9-6,House>如果我可以摸卡梅隆的屁股
<9-6,House>It will be more cost-efficient once I grab Cameron's ass,

205
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,250
<9-6,House>叫福曼黑桃小子  肯定更划算
<9-6,House>call Foreman a spade,

206
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,240
<9-6,House>还有奇斯  我也要摸他屁股
<9-6,House>and Chase- Well, I'll grab his ass too.

207
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,170
<9-7,Wilson>你在很多领域都相当杰出
<9-7,Wilson>You are uniquely talented in many areas,

208
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,200
<9-7,Wilson>但不包括办公室政治
<9-7,Wilson>but office politics is not one of them.

209
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,760
<9-7,Wilson>别和沃格勒较量
<9-7,Wilson>Don't take Vogler on.

210
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,070
<9-8,Cashier>-分开付还是一起  -一起
<9-8,Cashier>- Separate or together? - Together.

211
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,520
<10-1,Chase>血糖每分钟上升6.9毫克
<10-1,Chase>Increasing glucose to 6.9 milligrams per minute.

212
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,880
<10-2,Mom>-你还好吗  -我很渴
<10-2,Mom>- Are you okay? - I'm thirsty.

213
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,470
<10-4,Cameron>再忍一小会儿就完事了
<10-4,Cameron>Just a little bit longer, and you'll be done.

214
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,580
<10-5,Foreman>就像奇斯医生
<10-5,Foreman>Like Dr. Chase.

215
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,750
<10-6,Chase>赌一把吗
<10-6,Chase>Wanna put some money on it?

216
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,410
<10-7,Jessica>我说了我渴
<10-7,Jessica>I said I'm thirsty.

217
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,280
<10-8,Cameron>再忍五分钟  好吗  甜心
<10-8,Cameron>Just five more minutes.Okay, sweetheart?

218
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,130
<10-9,Jessica>我不是你的甜心  别那么叫我
<10-9,Jessica>I'm not your sweetheart. Don't call me that.

219
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,000
<10-10,Mom>杰西卡  那样说不礼貌
<10-10,Mom>Jessica, that's not nice.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
<10-11,Jessica>他们这样做才不好
<10-11,Jessica>They're the ones who aren't nice.

221
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,960
<10-12,Mom>杰西卡
<10-12,Mom>Jessica.

222
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,700
<10-13,Jessica>你也不是好人  我忍不下去了
<10-13,Jessica>You're not, either. I don't wanna do this anymore.

223
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,340
<10-14,Mom>杰西卡  杰西卡
<10-14,Mom>Jessica. Jessica,

224
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,860
<10-14,Mom>你要冷静
<10-14,Mom>you have to calm down.

225
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,010
<10-14,Mom>不  不
<10-14,Mom>No.! No.!

226
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,140
<10-15,Jessica>放开我
<10-15,Jessica>Let me go.

227
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,200
<10-16,Cameron>检测血糖浓度  她出现低血糖症了
<10-16,Cameron>Check her blood sugar. She's gotta be getting hypoglycemic.

228
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,310
<10-18,Chase>我从没见过她这样  肯定有问题
<10-18,Chase>I've never seen her like this before. Something's wrong.

229
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,220
<10-19,Jessica>放开我  把它拿开
<10-19,Jessica>Let go of me! Get it out of me!

230
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,780
<10-19,Jessica>放开我  你们这些婊子养的  混蛋
<10-19,Jessica>Let go of me, you son of a bitch! You bastard!

231
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,230
<10-19,Jessica>不
<10-19,Jessica>Oh, no.

232
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,050
<11-1,Foreman>给她用了镇静剂
<11-1,Foreman>She's sedated.

233
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,210
<11-1,Foreman>不用担心  斯密斯太太
<11-1,Foreman>Mrs. Simms, don't worry.

234
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,560
<11-1,Foreman>低血糖症可以导致暂时性精神病
<11-1,Foreman>Hypoglycemia can cause temporary psychosis

235
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,400
<11-1,Foreman>是高胰岛素正血糖钳夹检测的常见并发症
<11-1,Foreman>and is a common complication during an H.E.C. Procedure.

236
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,540
<11-2,Mom>我原本就不想做那个实验
<11-2,Mom>I never wanted it done in the first place.

237
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,710
<11-3,Chase>我们能理解你心情不好
<11-3,Chase>We understand you're upset

238
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,120
<11-4,Mom>你们本来应该维护好她的状况
<11-4,Mom>You were supposed to be monitoring her condition,

239
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,170
<11-4,Mom>可事实你们却在斗嘴打赌
<11-4,Mom>but instead you were bickering and placing bets.

240
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,820
<11-5,Cameron>我很抱歉   如果我们让你觉得
<11-5,Cameron>I apologize if it looked like

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,460
<11-5,Cameron>没有全心全意关注你的女儿
<11-5,Cameron>we weren't devoting our full attention to your daughter,

242
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,340
<11-5,Cameron>但我可以向你保证
<11-5,Cameron>but I assure you

243
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,330
<11-6,Mom>拜托了
<11-6,Mom>Oh, please.

244
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,500
<11-6,Mom>省省你的虚情假意  说给你男朋友听吧
<11-6,Mom>Save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend.

245
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,370
<11-7,House>你错了  她  实际上
<11-7,House>You're wrong. She is, in fact,

246
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,250
<11-7,House>是绝对真诚的
<11-7,House>pathetically sincere.

247
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,940
<11-7,House>而且他们也没有搞砸
<11-7,House>And they didn't screw it up.

248
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,880
<11-8,Mom>-你是谁  -我从实验室来
<11-8,Mom>- Who are you? - I'm from the lab.

249
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,470
<11-9,House>血检结果说明你女儿不是低血糖症
<11-9,House>The blood tests show your daughter was not hypoglycemic,

250
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,720
<11-9,House>那意味着她的精神病
<11-9,House>which means her psychosis

251
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,260
<11-9,House>不是某个医生的治疗导致的
<11-9,House>wasn't caused by anything these doctors did.

252
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,650
<11-10,Mom>-那么什么原因呢  -我不知道
<11-10,Mom>- So then what was it caused by? - I've no idea.

253
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
<11-11,House>不过我想你会很高兴得知
<11-11,House>But you'll be happy to hear

254
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,390
<11-11,House>不能靠节食或运动治疗她
<11-11,House>it cannot be cured by diet or exercise.

255
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,120
<12-1,House>还有什么能让10岁的女孩怒不可遏呢
<12-1,House>What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a 10-year-old?

256
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,490
<12-2,Foreman>没什么还能同时引发心脏病的
<12-2,Foreman>Nothing that could also cause a heart attack.

257
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,100
<12-3,House>我想不用挑明了
<12-3,House>I assume I don't have to point out

258
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,080
<12-3,House>现在是个绝佳的时机
<12-3,House>that now would be an extremely good time

259
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,440
<12-3,House>你们中的某一个
<12-3,House>for one of you to

260
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,210
<12-3,House>可以用一个绝妙的想法让自己脱颖而出
<12-3,House>distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.

261
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,650
<12-4,Chase>血液高凝状态可以引起血栓
<12-4,Chase>A hypercoagulable state can cause a blood clot.

262
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,200
<12-4,Chase>血栓可以导致心脏病
<12-4,Chase>Blood clots can cause a heart attack.

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,700
<12-5,Cameron>更可能导致中风  胆不是精神病
<12-5,Cameron>More likely to cause a stroke, not the psychosis.

264
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,910
<12-5,Cameron>不  你错了
<12-5,Cameron>No, you're wrong.

265
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,900
<12-6,Chase>如果栓子随血液进入到大脑扁桃腺
<12-6,Chase>If a clot made it to the amygdala area of the brain,

266
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,460
<12-6,Chase>就可能引发无法控制的狂怒
<12-6,Chase>it might cause uncontrollable rage.

267
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,890
<12-7,Cameron>不错  一切皆有可能
<12-7,Cameron>Right, because anything's possible,

268
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,170
<12-7,Cameron>但不会有东西能引起这个年龄孩子出现多发性血栓
<12-7,Cameron>but nothing's gonna cause multiple clots in a kid this age.

269
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,070
<12-9,Cameron>-她胖  -肥胖症不会导致血栓
<12-9,Cameron>- She's fat. - Obesity doesn't cause blood clots.

270
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,260
<12-10,Chase>极度肥胖的病人可能脂肪栓
<12-10,Chase>Extremely obese patients can get a fat embolus.

271
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,580
<12-11,Cameron>是的  吸脂手术失败后
<12-11,Cameron>Right, after they've had liposuction,

272
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,770
<12-11,Cameron>很明显她没做过
<12-11,Cameron>which she's clearly never had.

273
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,320
<12-12,Chase>你怎么知道
<12-12,Chase>How do you know?

274
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,870
<12-13,Cameron>因为我们有她的医疗记录
<12-13,Cameron>Because we have her medical records,

275
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,940
<12-13,Cameron>而且没有哪个精神正常的整形医生
<12-13,Cameron>and because no plastic surgeon in his right mind is

276
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,580
<12-13,Cameron>会给10岁的孩子做吸脂
<12-13,Cameron>gonna give a 10-year-old liposuction.

277
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,450
<12-14,Chase>你见过正常的整形医生吗
<12-14,Chase>Have you ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind?

278
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,940
<12-15,House>-她没做过吸脂  -谢谢
<12-15,House>- She hasn't had liposuction. - Thank you.

279
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,540
<12-17,House>那其它荒唐的减肥治疗呢
<12-17,House>But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment?

280
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,580
<12-18,Foreman>比如
<12-18,Foreman>Like what?

281
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,250
<12-19,House>减肥药可以导致心脏病和血栓
<12-19,House>Diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots.

282
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,900
<12-20,Cameron>她的药物毒性分析结果阴性
<12-20,Cameron>Her tox screen was negative.

283
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,890
<12-21,House>不能说明没用过非处方减肥药
<12-21,House>Wouldn't show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.

284
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,410
<12-22,Cameron>她妈妈不会让她吃减肥药的
<12-22,Cameron>Her mother wouldn't give her diet pills.

285
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,370
<12-23,Chase>她觉得她的女儿这样很完美
<12-23,Chase>She thinks her daughter's perfect just the way she is.

286
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,630
<12-23,Chase>她在撒谎
<12-23,Chase>She's lying.

287
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,870
<12-24,House>好吧  你们两个
<12-24,House>Okay. You two,

288
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,870
<12-24,House>给她用肝素和华法林防止再次栓塞
<12-24,House>heparin and warfarin to prevent further clotting.

289
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,360
<12-24,House>而你负责找出她吃什么药
<12-24,House>And you find those pills.

290
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,320
<12-24,House>不是减肥药
<12-24,House>Not diet pills.

291
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,950
<13-1,House>你最好扩大一点搜索范围
<13-1,House>You might wanna broaden the search just a little.

292
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,200
<13-1,House>还有  别只问那个妈妈
<13-1,House>And don't just ask the mom.

293
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,420
<13-1,House>如果她没有提起过  那她...
<13-1,House>If she hasn't mentioned it yet, she's not-

294
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,060
<13-2,Foreman>如果你要炒什么人  炒就好了
<13-2,Foreman>If you're gonna fire someone, go ahead and do it.

295
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,390
<13-2,Foreman>别把我们当成是小白鼠
<13-2,Foreman>But don't treat us like lab rats,

296
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,280
<13-2,Foreman>考验多久后我们会开始相互残杀
<13-2,Foreman>testing how long it takes to get us at one another's throats.

297
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,810
<13-4,Foreman>-那我该怎么做  -我才不管你怎么做
<13-4,Foreman>- So what should I do? - I don't give a damn what you do.

298
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,110
<13-5,House>是啊  我早就发现你对此非常冷漠
<13-5,House>Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference.

299
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,050
<13-5,House>你甚至都不再提诊断建议了
<13-5,House>You don't even offer a medical opinion anymore.

300
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,360
<13-6,Foreman>-你会炒谁  -我可没那个权力
<13-6,Foreman>- Who would you fire? - Not my call.

301
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,500
<13-7,House>我想听听你的意见
<13-7,House>I want your opinion.

302
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,540
<13-7,House>好  那就炒你
<13-7,House>Fine, it's you.

303
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,850
<13-7,House>说还是不说  你决定吧
<13-7,House>Either way, you're making a choice.

304
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,630
<13-8,Foreman>奇斯
<13-8,Foreman>Chase.

305
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,350
<13-9,House>因为他一个月前搞砸了一根血管
<13-9,House>Because he screwed up an angio a month ago?

306
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,200
<13-10,Foreman>任何人都会犯错
<13-10,Foreman>Anyone can make a mistake.

307
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,920
<13-10,Foreman>好吧  那就是因为钱了
<13-10,Foreman>Right. So it's the money.

308
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,100
<13-11,House>你羡慕嫉妒恨
<13-11,House>You resent it,

309
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,270
<13-11,House>却还跟我说他不需要这份工作
<13-11,House>but you're gonna tell me that he doesn't need the job.

310
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,660
<13-12,Foreman>他不珍惜这份工作
<13-12,Foreman>He doesn't appreciate the job.

311
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,900
<13-13,House>为了工作他打算和卡梅隆大战三个回合
<13-13,House>He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.

312
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,050
<13-14,Foreman>他想要这份工作  他只是不珍惜
<13-14,Foreman>He wants the job. He just doesn't appreciate it.

313
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,590
<13-14,Foreman>混日子本身没什么错
<13-14,Foreman>There's nothing wrong with just wanting to hang out,

314
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,920
<13-14,Foreman>但这里不是混日子的地方
<13-14,Foreman>but this is not the place to do it.

315
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,830
<13-16,Foreman>-我很吃惊  -你以为我会选卡梅隆
<13-16,Foreman>- I'm surprised. - You thought I'd pick Cameron?

316
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,990
<13-17,House>我以为你谁都不会选
<13-17,House>I didn't think you'd pick at all.

317
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,450
<14-1,House>早猜到他不是"与世无争"的人
<14-1,House>Guess he's not the "Rise above the fray" Guy

318
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,000
<14-1,House>他只是希望别人认为他是
<14-1,House>he'd like us to think he is.

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,850
<14-2,Wilson>实际是你逼他选的
<14-2,Wilson>You practically forced it out of him.

320
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,720
<14-3,House>和其他人一样  他也害怕被炒
<14-3,House>He's scared of losing his job, just like everybody else.

321
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,140
<14-4,Wilson>我一直在想  你表现得你很可悲
<14-4,Wilson>I've been thinking. You've made it quite clear that you're miserable here.

322
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,090
<14-5,House>-我不可悲  -你不开心
<14-5,House>- I am not miserable. - You're not happy.

323
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,530
<14-8,Wilson>-那你呢  -对于工作来说我很开心
<14-8,Wilson>- And you are? - With my job, yes.

324
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,830
<14-9,House>我在我喜欢的地方  做我想做的事情
<14-9,House>I am exactly where I wanna be, doing exactly what I wanna do.

325
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,870
<14-10,Wilson>我想我嗅到了一丝醋意
<14-10,Wilson>Think I sense a hint of sarcasm there.

326
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,760
<14-10,Wilson>你怎么不选自己呢  辞职
<14-10,Wilson>Why don't you pick yourself? Quit?

327
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,740
<14-11,House>我错了
<14-11,House>Hmm, I was wrong.

328
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,720
<14-12,Wilson>关于沃格勒还是福曼么
<14-12,Wilson>About Vogler or Foreman?

329
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,260
<14-13,House>贺尔南德斯太太的孕检
<14-13,House>Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy test.

330
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,230
<14-14,Wilson>谁是贺尔南德斯太太
<14-14,Wilson>Who's Mrs. Hernandez?

<14-15,House>一个怀了外星宝宝的女人或着是你的最新病人
<14-15,House>Either a woman carrying an alien baby or your newest patient.

332
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,470
<15-1,Foreman>所以说你从没见过她吃药
<15-1,Foreman>So you never saw her with any pills.

333
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,040
<15-1,Foreman>她从没提到过什么吗
<15-1,Foreman>She never mentioned anything?

334
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,710
<15-1,Foreman>没有  当然没有
<15-1,Foreman>No, of course not.

335
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,750

<15-2,Foreman>和她的朋友聊聊  方不方便呢
<15-2,Foreman>uh, talk to a couple of her friends?

<15-2,Foreman>-她的朋友  -我不是要审问他们
<15-2,Foreman>- Her friends? - I'm not gonna interrogate them.

338
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,660
<15-3,Foreman>我只想问问杰西卡有没有提起过什么
<15-3,Foreman>I just wanna ask if Jessica ever mentioned anything.

339
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,790
<15-3,Foreman>这  这很重要  她病得很重
<15-3,Foreman>It's- It's pretty important. She's very sick.

340
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,600
<15-3,Foreman>我明白  只是  好吧
<15-3,Foreman>I understand. It's just, well

341
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,540
<15-4,Foreman>杰西卡真的没有什么朋友
<15-4,Foreman>Jessica really doesn't have any friends.

342
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,880
<15-4,Foreman>-一个也没有吗  -我试着帮过她
<15-4,Foreman>- Not one? - I've tried to help,

343
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,350
<14-10,Wilson>想让孩子们多和她玩玩  可孩子们
<14-10,Wilson>make the kids include her more, but... kids can be

344
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,510
<14-11,House>-孩子们  -我本想说小混蛋
<14-11,House>- Kids? - I was gonna say jerks.

345
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,570
<18-1,Clementine>五年级学生和八年级学生结对子
<18-1,Clementine>All the fifth-graders are assigned an eighth-grade buddy.

346
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,040
<18-1,Clementine>或许你可以找她的搭档谈谈
<18-1,Clementine>Maybe you could talk to hers.

347
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,790
<16-1,Vogler>豪斯那边怎样
<16-1,Vogler>What's the status on House?

348
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,550
<16-2,Cuddy>他需要时间完成对他每个组员的绩效考核
<16-2,Cuddy>He asked for time to complete performance reviews for everyone in his department.

349
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,460
<16-3,Vogler>你对他说不  然后给了他多长时间
<16-3,Vogler>And you told him no and gave him how long?

350
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,250
<16-4,Cuddy>一个星期  他会搞定的
<16-4,Cuddy>A week. He'll do it.

351
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,780
<16-5,Vogler>那家伙从不屈服于命令
<16-5,Vogler>Guy's never done what he's told.

352
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,650
<16-5,Vogler>我不觉得他会展开实际行动
<16-5,Vogler>I don't see why he's gonna start now.

353
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,550
<16-5,Vogler>你好  我是爱德华·沃格勒
<16-5,Vogler>Hi. Edward Vogler.

354
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,680
<16-5,Vogler>豪斯是不是说我逼他炒了你们中一个
<16-5,Vogler>Is Dr. House claiming that i'm forcing him to get rid of one of you?

355
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,040
<16-5,Vogler>我打赌他的目的是想煽动你们和我对着干
<16-5,Vogler>I assume his goal is to stir up antagonism toward me.

356
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,410
<16-6,Cameron>-那你的目的是  -我是在给他施压
<16-6,Cameron>- And your goal is? - I am forcing him.

357
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,630
<16-7,Vogler>不管他选了谁
<16-7,Vogler>I'll do whatever I can to

358
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,670
<16-7,Vogler>我会尽我所能帮那个人度过过渡期
<16-7,Vogler>ease the transition for whoever he chooses.

359
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,090
<16-8,Cameron>如果你有负罪感  有个简单的解决办法
<16-8,Cameron>If you're feeling guilty about your decision, there is an easy solution.

360
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,680
<16-9,Vogler>我没有负罪感
<16-9,Vogler>I don't feel guilty.

361
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,340
<16-10,Cameron>那么  为什么跟我说这些
<16-10,Cameron>Then... why approach me and tell me all this?

362
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,080
<16-11,Vogler>我没有负罪感  那不代表我不内疚
<16-11,Vogler>I don't feel guilty. That doesn't mean I don't feel bad.

363
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,360
<16-11,Vogler>我有钱  但我还是个人
<16-11,Vogler>I'm rich, but I'm still human.

364
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,790
<16-11,Vogler>我只希望你能明白
<16-11,Vogler>I just wanted you to know

365
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,220
<16-11,Vogler>如果有什么能帮你的  可以随时来找我
<16-11,Vogler>that if there's anything I can do for you, my door's open.

366
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,250
<16-12,Cameron>谢谢
<16-12,Cameron>Thank you.

367
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,310
<16-13,Cuddy>你在收集情报吗
<16-13,Cuddy>You're lookin' for info?

368
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,970
<16-13,Cuddy>我以为你早就对豪斯了如指掌
<16-13,Cuddy>Thought you already had House all figured out.

369
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,040
<16-14,Vogler>是的  但还不了解他的团队
<16-14,Vogler>I do. Don't know his team though.

370
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,810
<17-1,Wilson>B超和活检证明了我们的担忧
<17-1,Wilson>The ultrasound and biopsy confirmed our worry.

371
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,220
<17-1,Wilson>肿瘤极大  至少有30磅
<17-1,Wilson>The tumor is extremely large, at least 30 pounds.

372
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,350
<17-2,Lucille>上帝
<17-2,Lucille>Oh, God.

373
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,830
<17-3,House>实际上是这家医院的个人纪录
<17-3,House>It's actually a personal record for this clinic.

374
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,030
<17-4,Wilson>不过完全良性  没有任何癌变的迹象
<17-4,Wilson>But it's completely benign. There's no sign of cancer at all.

375
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,270
<17-4,Wilson>我已经和博金医生谈过了  他上午有空
<17-4,Wilson>I've already spoken with Dr. Bergin, and he's available first thing in the morning.

376
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,640
<17-5,Lucille>做什么
<17-5,Lucille>For what?

377
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,110
<17-6,Wilson>做手术
<17-6,Wilson>For the surgery.

378
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,090
<17-7,Lucille>可如果它不是癌  我不会死  对吧
<17-7,Lucille>But if it's not cancer, it can't kill me, right?

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,180
<17-8,Wilson>-是的  -而我会有一个大疤
<17-8,Wilson>- Mmm, no. - I'll have a huge scar.

380
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,550
<17-9,Lucille>我就不能再穿比基尼了
<17-9,Lucille>I won't be able to wear a bikini.

381
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,080
<17-11,Lucille>-你现在穿比基尼吗  -是  你有意见吗
<17-11,Lucille>- You wear a bikini now? - Yeah. You got a problem with that?

382
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,750
<17-12,House>没有  不过我不会跟你去游泳的
<17-12,House>Nope. But I've never gone swimming with you.

383
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,560
<17-13,Lucille>我明白了  我知道是怎么一回事了
<17-13,Lucille>I knew it. That's what this is all about.

384
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,070
<17-13,Lucille>你们想逼我做整形手术
<17-13,Lucille>You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery.

385
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,210
<17-14,House>是啊  所以我在你卵巢上
<17-14,House>That's exactly why I planted

386
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,500
<17-14,House>种了个30磅肿瘤
<17-14,House>a 30-pound tumor on your ovary.

387
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,080
<17-15,Lucille>肿瘤不会害死我
<17-15,Lucille>It's not gonna kill me.

388
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,410
<17-15,Lucille>手术将改变的唯一东西就是我的身材
<17-15,Lucille>The only thing surgery is gonna do is change the way I look.

389
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,320
<17-15,Lucille>那就是整形手术的意义
<17-15,Lucille>That is the definition of cosmetic surgery.

390
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,340
<17-16,Wilson>手术也能让你不再烧心和不舒服
<17-16,Wilson>Uh, it would also relieve your heartburn and discomfort.

391
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,590
<17-16,Wilson>是的  没错
<17-16,Wilson>Yeah, right.

392
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,000
<17-17,Lucille>把人切开变得让你看来舒服点的话
<17-17,Lucille>Why give an antacid if you can cut someone up and

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,610
<17-17,Lucille>你们又怎么会开抗酸药呢
<17-17,Lucille>make them a little easier on your eyes?

394
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,740
<17-17,Lucille>我的丈夫
<17-17,Lucille>My husband

395
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,800
<17-17,Lucille>爱死了我的身体  欲罢不能
<17-17,Lucille>loves my body. He can't get enough of it.

396
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,600
<17-17,Lucille>你觉得如果我看起来像是条开膛破肚的鱼
<17-17,Lucille>You think he's gonna wanna touch me if

397
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,780
<17-17,Lucille>他还想碰我吗
<17-17,Lucille>I look like I've been gutted like a fish?

398
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,750
<17-18,Wilson>真出乎意料
<17-18,Wilson>That was unexpected.

399
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,340
<17-19,House>没错
<17-19,House>Yeah, it was.

400
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,070
<18-1,Clementine>课间她只会围着操场不停地跑
<18-1,Clementine>All she does during recess is run laps around the playground.

401
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,250
<18-1,Clementine>她说那是在运动
<18-1,Clementine>She says she's exercising,

402
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,860
<18-1,Clementine>不过所有人都知道那是因为没人和她玩
<18-1,Clementine>but everyone knows it's just because no one wants to play with her.

403
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,790
<18-1,Clementine>我意思是
<18-1,Clementine>I mean,

404
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,470
<18-1,Clementine>我是她拍档只因为埃尔斯老师让我俩结对子
<18-1,Clementine>I'm only her buddy because Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.

405
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,530
<18-1,Clementine>但不意味着我是她朋友
<18-1,Clementine>That does not mean I am her friend.

406
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,590
<18-2,Foreman>我会告知让她的医生们
<18-2,Foreman>I'll make sure her doctors are all clear on that.

407
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,990
<18-3,Clementine>谢谢
<18-3,Clementine>Thanks.

408
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,550
<18-4,Foreman>那么  她有和你说起过减肥药吗
<18-4,Foreman>So, has she ever said anything to you about diet pills?

409
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,660
<18-5,Clementine>她也和你说了吗
<18-5,Clementine>Ha. She told you that too?

410
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,620
<18-6,Foreman>什么意思
<18-6,Foreman>What do you mean?

411
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,950
<18-7,Clementine>有一天我撞见她在吃药
<18-7,Clementine>I totally busted her for taking drugs one day.

412
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,990
<18-7,Clementine>她撒谎  说那是她妈妈给他的减肥药
<18-7,Clementine>She totally lied, said that they were diet pills her mom had given her.

413
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,010
<18-7,Clementine>够了  现实点
<18-7,Clementine>Come on. Get real.

414
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,430
<18-7,Clementine>她那样的女孩不可能吃减肥药
<18-7,Clementine>No way a girl like that is taking diet pills.

415
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,550
<19-1,Mom>我没有给她减肥药  永远不会
<19-1,Mom>I didn't give her diet pills. I would never do that.

416
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,350
<19-2,Foreman>没错  那么就是她想象中的妈妈
<19-2,Foreman>Right. So it was her imaginary mom.

417
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,730
<19-3,Mom>她没吃任何药  那女孩撒谎
<19-3,Mom>She didn't take any pills. The girl's lying.

418
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,750
<19-4,Foreman>她为什么要撒谎
<19-4,Foreman>Why would she lie?

419
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,840
<19-5,Mom>因为她也是个卑鄙的小混蛋
<19-5,Mom>Because she's another mean little jerk.

420
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,800
<19-7,Mom>-妈妈  -对不起  宝贝
<19-7,Mom>- Mom. - I'm sorry, honey.

421
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,630
<19-8,Jessica>克雷米没有撒谎
<19-8,Jessica>Clemmie didn't lie.

422
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,070
<19-8,Jessica>是我撒谎了  我吃过减肥药
<19-8,Jessica>I did. I took the pills.

423
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,860
<19-8,Jessica>我告诉她是你给的  因为我不想惹麻烦
<19-8,Jessica>I told her you gave them to me because I didn't wanna get in trouble.

424
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,170
<19-9,Foreman>你从哪搞来的
<19-9,Foreman>Where did you get them?

425
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,890
<19-10,Jessica>从商店
<19-10,Jessica>I took them from the store.

426
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,670
<19-11,Mom>为什么  为什么这么做
<19-11,Mom>Why? Why would you do that?

427
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,720
<19-12,Jessica>因为我不想那么丑
<19-12,Jessica>Because I didn't wanna be ugly anymore.

428
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,710
<19-13,Mom>-宝贝  你不丑  -不  我丑
<19-13,Mom>- Oh, baby. You're not ugly. - Yes, I am.

429
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,380
<19-14,Jessica>我知道你不这样想  但我是  丑极了
<19-14,Jessica>I know you don't think so, but I am. I'm disgusting.

430
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,460
<19-15,Mom>杰西卡  求你不要那么说
<19-15,Mom>Jessica, please don't say that.

431
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,900
<19-16,Jessica>我就是  我就是想融入大家
<19-16,Jessica>I just- I just wanted to fit in.

432
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,560
<19-16,Jessica>你明白吗  有朋友
<19-16,Jessica>You know, have friends?

433
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,350
<19-16,Jessica>或者至少有一个同龄人能对我友好些
<19-16,Jessica>Or at least have one person my age be nice to me.

434
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
<19-17,Foreman>听着
<19-17,Foreman>Listen, the, uh-

435
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,560
<19-17,Foreman>减肥药导致血栓  心脏病发和失眠
<19-17,Foreman>The pills cause blood clots, heart attacks and insomnia.

436
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,980
<19-17,Foreman>解释了所有
<19-17,Foreman>It explains everything.

437
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,740
<19-17,Foreman>我们会观察一晚来确诊
<19-17,Foreman>We'll keep her overnight to make sure,

438
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,640
<19-17,Foreman>不过  她会没事的
<19-17,Foreman>but, uh, she'll be fine.

439
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,690
<19-17,Foreman>谢谢
<19-17,Foreman>Thank you.

440
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,190
<20-1,Cameron>我无法相信她那么绝望
<20-1,Cameron>I can't believe she was that desperate.

441
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,880
<20-2,House>是啊  我确定要是所有人都讨厌我
<20-2,House>Yeah, I'm sure that if everyone I knew hated me,

442
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,180
<20-2,House>忍受不了看我  我可不会去商店偷东西
<20-2,House>couldn't bear to look at me, I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.

443
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,230
<20-3,Cameron>我不是指偷东西的事
<20-3,Cameron>I'm not talking about the shoplifting.

444
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,270
<20-4,Foreman>我相信她根本不知道那有多危险
<20-4,Foreman>I'm sure she didn't even know they were dangerous.

445
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,350
<20-4,Foreman>她可能在电视或网上看了广告
<20-4,Foreman>She probably saw them advertised on TV or over the Internet.

446
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,250
<20-5,Chase>没错  我猜  现在又是媒体和药厂的错
<20-5,Chase>Right. So I guess it's the media and pharmaceutical companies' fault now,

447
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,310
<20-5,Chase>而不是她毫不控制暴饮暴食
<20-5,Chase>not the fact that she can't stop shoveling food down her throat.

448
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,890
<20-6,Cameron>没人逼她长胖
<20-6,Cameron>No one forced her to get fat.

449
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
<20-6,Cameron>没人强迫癌症病人得癌
<20-6,Cameron>No one forced a cancer patient to get cancer.

450
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,360
<20-7,Chase>饶了我吧  这不是病
<20-7,Chase>Give me a break. It's not a disease.

451
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,990
<20-8,Foreman>-看了最新的研究吗  -是  看了
<20-8,Foreman>- Have you seen the latest research? - Yes, I have.

452
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,920
<20-9,Chase>最近没看到孩子吃苹果或骑自行车
<20-9,Chase>What I haven't seen lately is a kid eating an apple or riding a bike.

453
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,470
<20-9,Chase>你们美国人甚至在篮球上都无法与世界抗衡了
<20-9,Chase>You Americans can't even compete with the rest of the world in basketball anymore,

454
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,250
<20-9,Chase>当然  除非
<20-9,Chase>unless, of course,

455
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,240
<20-9,Chase>是用遥控器在大屏幕上玩的那种
<20-9,Chase>it's the type you play with a remote control on a big-screen TV.

456
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
<20-10,Foreman>-没错  -等等  等等
<20-10,Foreman>- Right. - Wait, wait, wait.

457
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,690
<20-11,House>你就打算让他那么说下去吗
<20-11,House>Are you gonna let him say that?

458
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,450
<20-11,House>他在鄙视咱们的篮球队
<20-11,House>He insulted our basketball teams.

459
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,900
<20-11,House>老天
<20-11,House>Oh, my God.

460
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,330
<21-1,Jessica>疼死了
<21-1,Jessica>It hurts so bad.

461
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,210
<21-2,Foreman>怎么了
<21-2,Foreman>What happened?

462
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,610
<21-5,Cameron>-她在出血  -哪里
<21-5,Cameron>- She's bleeding. - From where?

463
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,830
<21-5,Cameron>上帝啊
<21-5,Cameron>Oh, my gosh.

464
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,980
<21-6,Jessica>求求你们帮帮我
<21-6,Jessica>Just please stop it. Please!

466
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,780
<22-1,Cameron>减肥药不会导致皮肤坏死
<22-1,Cameron>Diet pills don't cause skin necrosis

467
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,480
<22-2,Chase>可能是和药物有关的
<22-2,Chase>Could be something related to the pills

468
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,560
<22-3,Cameron>-或者不是  -或两者兼有
<22-3,Cameron>- Or not  - Or both

469
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,870
<22-4,House>减肥药把她带到我们这里
<22-4,House>Diet pills brought her to us.

470
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,290
<22-4,House>我们给了她皮肤溃疡
<22-4,House>We gave her the sores.

471
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,470
<22-5,Foreman>你觉得是她在这里感染了葡萄球菌吗
<22-5,Foreman>You think she got a staph infection from something here?

472
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,190
<22-6,House>我没说是医院给的皮肤溃疡
<22-6,House>I am not saying the hospital gave the sores

473
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,310
<22-6,House>我说我们干的  因为治疗
<22-6,House>I'm saying we did, by treating her.

474
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,830
<22-6,House>华法令导致皮肤坏死
<22-6,House>Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

475
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,160
<22-7,Cameron>极度不可能  用华法令前我们用了肝素
<22-7,Cameron>Highly unlikely. We started her on heparin before the warfarin.

476
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,120
<22-8,House>谁给的肝素
<22-8,House>Who gave her the heparin?

477
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,640
<22-9,Chase>我给的华法令  她给的肝素
<22-9,Chase>I did warfarin. She did heparin.

478
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,970
<22-10,House>确定你们两个没有都给华法令吗
<22-10,House>Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?

479
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,540
<22-11,Cameron>确定  我没搞错
<22-11,Cameron>Yes. I did not screw up.

480
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,050
<22-12,House>你有亲眼看到她准备并给了肝素吗
<22-12,House>Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin?

481
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,360
<22-12,House>不用多说了
<22-12,House>Nuff said.

482
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,440
<22-13,Cameron>你当时就站在那里
<22-13,Cameron>You were standing right there.

483
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,050
<22-14,Chase>我在准备我自己的针剂
<22-14,Chase>I was preparing my own dose.

484
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,510
<22-15,Cameron>是啊  没错  应该有其它原因的
<22-15,Cameron>Yeah, right. There's gotta be some other cause.

485
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,000
<22-16,House>我一个都想不出来
<22-16,House>None that I can think of.

486
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,430
<22-16,House>让我们纠正错误吧
<22-16,House>Let's fix the mistake.

487
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,060
<22-16,House>给她用普通静注肝素和
<22-16,House>Give her unfractionated I. V. Heparin and

488
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,670
<22-16,House>低分子量肝素  立即皮下注射
<22-16,House>low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection, stat.

489
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,420
<22-17,Cameron>把我弄得难堪不等于能保住你的工作
<22-17,Cameron>Making me look bad is not gonna save your job.

490
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,620
<22-18,Chase>你觉得你不可能犯错吗
<22-18,Chase>You think you're incapable of making a mistake?

491
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,860
<22-19,Cameron>你以为我会不了了之吗
<22-19,Cameron>You think that I'm just gonna roll over and take this?

492
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,180
<22-20,Chase>豪斯不会因为你拍马屁而保你的
<22-20,Chase>House isn't gonna protect you just because you kiss his ass.

493
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,710
<22-21,Cameron>沃格勒想帮我
<22-21,Cameron>Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.

494
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,980
<22-22,House>别在那战战兢兢了  赶紧去看病人吧
<22-22,House>Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the patient's.

495
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,800
<23-1,Vogler>她睡着了么
<23-1,Vogler>She sleeping?

496
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,930
<23-2,Foreman>镇静剂的作用  不能让她醒着  太疼
<23-2,Foreman>As a result of the sedatives, yeah. Can't let her wake up. Too much pain.

497
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,240
<23-2,Foreman>华法令诱使皮肤坏死
<23-2,Foreman>"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis."

498
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,820
<23-3,Vogler>我不明白是什么意思
<23-3,Vogler>I... have no idea what that means.

499
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,360
<23-3,Vogler>不过这里写着我们给她用了华法令
<23-3,Vogler>But it says here we gave her the warfarin.

500
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,160
<23-3,Vogler>我还知道"诱使"的意思  是我们的过失吗
<23-3,Vogler>And I do know what "Induced" Means. We did this?

501
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,570
<23-4,Foreman>眼下看  还不明确
<23-4,Foreman>At this point, it's not exactly clear.

502
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,070
<23-4,Foreman>你或许该和豪斯医生谈
<23-4,Foreman>You should probably talk to Dr. House.

503
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,020
<23-5,Vogler>哦  你们两个得花时间把故事编圆了
<23-5,Vogler>Oh. You two need time to get your stories straight.

504
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,440
<23-6,Foreman>他没告诉我要干什么
<23-6,Foreman>He doesn't tell me what to do.

505
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,860
<23-7,Vogler>那么你没有只是盲目执行他的命令
<23-7,Vogler>So you don't just blindly follow his commands.

506
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,430
<23-7,Vogler>你有主张
<23-7,Vogler>You're your own man.

507
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,990
<23-7,Vogler>可是你在这里
<23-7,Vogler>And yet here you are,

508
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,920
<23-7,Vogler>为一个你无法忍受的人工作
<23-7,Vogler>working for a guy you can't stand.

509
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,000
<23-8,Foreman>-我尊敬他  -你到底尊敬他什么
<23-8,Foreman>- I respect him. - What exactly is it you respect?

510
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,560
<23-9,Vogler>他对人性的态度吗
<23-9,Vogler>His attitude toward humanity?

511
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,620
<23-9,Vogler>他觉得我们都是傻瓜  说谎成性
<23-9,Vogler>He thinks we're all idiots and liars.

512
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,350
<23-9,Vogler>他对你的态度呢
<23-9,Vogler>How about his attitude toward you?

513
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,270
<23-9,Vogler>耍你就像用线球逗小猫
<23-9,Vogler>Plays with you like a cat with a ball of string.

514
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,910
<23-10,Foreman>你想干吗
<23-10,Foreman>What do you want?

515
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,280
<23-11,Vogler>我想知道你是否想保住自己的工作
<23-11,Vogler>I wanna know if you wanna keep your job.

516
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,650
<23-12,Foreman>要是他选择解雇我  我能接受
<23-12,Foreman>If he chooses to let me go, I can live with that.

517
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,120
<23-14,Foreman>-这不是回答  -你想保我吗
<23-14,Foreman>- That's not an answer. - Are you offering to protect me?

518
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,430
<23-15,Vogler>-仍不是回答  -我要我的工作
<23-15,Vogler>- Still not an answer. - I want my job.

519
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,470
<23-17,Vogler>-奇斯医生  -老板
<23-17,Vogler>- Dr. Chase. - Boss.

520
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,560
<23-18,Chase>那是怎么回事
<23-18,Chase>What was that about?

521
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,850
<23-19,Foreman>他想知道华法令是什么  不清楚
<23-19,Foreman>He wanted to know what warfarin is. I don't know.

522
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,260
<24-1,House>冻死了
<24-1,House>Brr. Icy.

523
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,270
<24-1,House>在再次纠正你的错误前  我绝对会三思
<24-1,House>I'll definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.

524
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,450
<24-2,Cameron>尽管纠正
<24-2,Cameron>Correct all you want.

525
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,610
<24-2,Cameron>当然  若真有错的话  就更有效了
<24-2,Cameron>Of course, it's a bit more productive if there's an actual mistake.

526
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,670
<24-3,House>没错  我老忘了这个
<24-3,House>Right. I always forget that part.

527
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,290
<24-3,House>我给她用了肝素
<24-3,House>I gave her the heparin,

528
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,700
<24-4,Cameron>也就是说坏死不是华法令导致的
<24-4,Cameron>which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin,

529
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,430
<24-4,Cameron>恐怕也是为何她对你的治疗没有反应的原因
<24-4,Cameron>which is probably why she's not responding to your treatment.

530
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,510
<24-6,Cameron>目前还没
<24-6,Cameron>Yet.

531
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,320
<24-5,House>要是你没搞错  那么是什么缘故
<24-5,House>If you didn't screw up, then what is it?

532
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,220
<24-5,House>-你不知道答案  -目前还没
<24-5,House>- You don't have an answer. - Yet.

533
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,020
<24-7,House>要是你有了什么想法  告诉我
<24-7,House>When you come up with something, let me know.

534
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,840
<24-7,House>我在门诊  去暖和暖和
<24-7,House>I'll be in the clinic, warming up.

535
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,130
<24-8,Cameron>你出问题的时候
<24-8,Cameron>I'm the only one who's always stood behind you

536
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,170
<24-8,Cameron>我总是唯一那个支持你的人
<24-8,Cameron>when you've screwed up.

537
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,200
<24-9,House>为什么你要支持一个总出问题的家伙
<24-9,House>Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?

538
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,210
<24-10,Cameron>因为我没有疯狂的不安全感
<24-10,Cameron>Because I'm not insanely insecure,

539
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,210
<24-10,Cameron>也因为我能真正的信任另一个人类
<24-10,Cameron>and because I can actually trust in another human being,

540
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,680
<24-10,Cameron>我不是个愤怒的  憎恶人类的混蛋
<24-10,Cameron>and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.

541
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,620
<24-11,House>抱歉  你说你不愤怒的
<24-11,House>I'm sorry. You said you weren't angry.

542
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,200
<24-11,House>你会解雇谁
<24-11,House>Who would you fire?

543
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,120
<24-12,Cameron>谁也不解雇
<24-12,Cameron>No one.

544
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,830
<24-13,House>没有这个选项
<24-13,House>Not an option.

545
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,770
<24-14,Cameron>要是大家减薪  延长工作时间
<24-14,Cameron>If everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours,

546
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,520
<24-14,Cameron>我们都能留下  用同样的预算
<24-14,Cameron>we could all stay for the same amount of money.

547
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,700
<24-15,House>料到你会试着想办法不伤害别人
<24-15,House>Figures you'd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt.

548
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,570
<24-15,House>问题是
<24-15,House>The problem is,

549
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,540
<24-15,House>世界总是不会如你所愿的
<24-15,House>the world doesn't work that way just 'cause you want it to.

550
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,750
<24-16,Cameron>料到你会逃避问题
<24-16,Cameron>Figures you'd stall and refuse to deal with the issue.

551
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,420
<24-16,Cameron>问题是
<24-16,Cameron>Problem is,

552
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,570
<24-16,Cameron>世界也不会因你逃避而如你所愿的
<24-16,Cameron>the world doesn't go away just because you want it to.

553
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,380
<24-16,Cameron>打扰了  是豪斯医生吗
<24-16,Cameron>Excuse me. Dr. House?

554
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,750
<24-16,Cameron>我妻子昨天见过你  露西尔·贺尔南德斯
<24-16,Cameron>My wife saw you yesterday. Lucille Hernandez?

555
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,530
<25-1,House>他今天不在
<25-1,House>Uh, he's not in today.

556
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,100
<25-1,House>我妻子说他拄拐杖
<25-1,House>My wife said he walked with a cane.

557
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,660
<25-2,House>他还有吸毒的毛病
<25-2,House>He's also got a bit of a drug problem.

558
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,510
<25-2,House>有时候几周不见人
<25-2,House>Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.

559
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,780
<25-3,Cuddy>核磁共振是租的  不过
<25-3,Cuddy>The M.R.I. 's are rented, but, um-

560
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,080
<25-4,Vogler>-决定了吗  -他不会解雇任何人的
<25-4,Vogler>- Did you make a decision? - He's not gonna fire anybody.

561
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,400
<25-5,House>对  我们四个都减薪
<25-5,House>Yes. I'm gonna cut the pay of all four of us.

562
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,150
<25-5,House>减薪17%能让你留住我们全部
<25-5,House>Seventeen percent across the board will

563
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,780
<25-5,House>能让你用同样的预算留住我们全部
<25-5,House>allow you to keep us all for the same amount of money.

564
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,470
<25-5,House>我相信这就是你们生意人说的"双赢"
<25-5,House>I believe it's what you suits call a "Win-win".

565
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,290
<25-6,Cuddy>-行  我  要是你能...  -不
<25-6,Cuddy>- All right, uh, I-if you can... - No.

566
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,420
<25-7,Vogler>要是他能接受
<25-7,Vogler>If he can work it

567
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,560
<25-8,Cuddy>那么我们用同样的预算保留现有人员
<25-8,Cuddy>so we keep the current staff for the same amount of money,

568
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,200
<25-8,Cuddy>有什么不同吗
<25-8,Cuddy>what difference does it make?

569
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,500
<25-9,House>不是关于钱
<25-9,House>It's not about the money.

570
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,330
<25-10,Vogler>这不是谈判  从来不是
<25-10,Vogler>This is not a negotiation. It never was.

571
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,730
<25-10,Vogler>我得知道  无论我让你做什么
<25-10,Vogler>I need to know that whatever I ask you to do,

572
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,280
<25-10,Vogler>无论你觉得多么不愉快  你都会做
<25-10,Vogler>however distasteful you find it, you'll do it.

573
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,910
<25-10,Vogler>同样重要的是  你得明白这点
<25-10,Vogler>And just as importantly, you need to know that.

574
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,900
<25-10,Vogler>我妻子怎么了
<25-10,Vogler>What's going on with my wife?

575
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,050
<25-11,House>就算我是豪斯医生
<25-11,House>Even if I was Dr. House,

576
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,700
<25-11,House>医患保密协定允许我不必非得答话
<25-11,House>physician-patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations.

577
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,940
<25-11,House>-她和我说了瘤的事  -是吗
<25-11,House>- She told me about the tumor. - Yeah?

578
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,220
<25-12,House>她还说了她拒绝摘除手术的原因
<25-12,House>She also tell you why she's refusing to have it removed?

579
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,780
<25-12,House>我不在乎疤痕
<25-12,House>I don't care about a scar.

580
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,900
<25-13,House>她还会胖回来的
<25-13,House>And she can always gain the weight back.

581
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,540
<25-13,House>你要她胖回来吗
<25-13,House>You want her to regain the weight?

582
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,220
<25-13,House>对  我是说  只要她愿意
<25-13,House>Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.

583
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,230
<25-14,House>为什么
<25-14,House>Why?

584
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,060
<25-14,House>我总是认为她怀孕的时候最性感
<25-14,House>I've always thought she looked sexiest when she was pregnant.

585
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,280
<25-15,House>知道她是个母亲就让我想要...
<25-15,House>Something about knowing she's a mother just makes me want to

586
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,860
<25-15,House>和她说  别烦我
<25-15,House>Tell her that and leave me alone.

587
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,530
<25-15,House>我说了  你得和她谈谈
<25-15,House>I did. You gotta talk to her.

588
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,470
<25-16,House>要是她有什么不测  我没法忍受
<25-16,House>I couldn't bear it if something happened to her.

589
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,210
<25-16,House>瘤是良性的  什么也不会发生
<25-16,House>The tumor is benign. Nothing's gonna happen,

590
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,380
<25-16,House>除了有点烧心
<25-16,House>except maybe some more heartburn.

591
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,590
<25-16,House>要是它变大呢  或者癌变了
<25-16,House>What if it gets even bigger, or it changes?

592
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,830
<25-17,House>你知道去哪找我们  这座楼是不会跑走的
<25-17,House>You know where to find us. Building's not going anywhere.

593
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,150
<25-17,House>告诉她是癌症  显然你撒谎很在行
<25-17,House>Tell her it's cancer. You obviously don't have a problem with lying.

594
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,470
<25-18,House>想法说服我
<25-18,House>Oh. Way to win me over.

595
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,960
<27-1,Foreman>我们有6个孩子  她不能有侥幸心理
<27-1,Foreman>We got six kids. She can't afford to take a chance.

596
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,590
<25-19,House>你们有孩子  多新鲜啊
<25-19,House>You have kids. How novel.

597
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,670
<25-19,House>那样的话就不一样了
<25-19,House>That changes everything.

598
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,340
<25-19,House>要是妈妈烧心了  其中一个就着火了
<25-19,House>So if Mommy gets heartburn, one of them might catch on fire.

599
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,850
<25-19,House>求你  我不知道我们该怎么办
<25-19,House>Please. I don't know what we do.

600
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,430
<25-20,House>他们很可爱
<25-20,House>They are cute.

601
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,740
<25-20,House>-让她回来  -什么
<25-20,House>- Have her come back in. - What?

602
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,000
<25-21,House>你的境况打动了我  让你妻子回来
<25-21,House>Your plight has moved me. Tell your wife to come back.

603
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,980
<26-1,Foreman>坏死情况更严重了
<26-1,Foreman>The necrosis is getting worse.

604
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,280
<26-2,Cameron>可能是我们找错病因了
<26-2,Cameron>Maybe because we're treating her for the wrong thing.

605
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,490
<26-3,House>-那你找到真正的病因了吗  -没有
<26-3,House>- Have you found the right thing? - No.

606
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,440
<26-5,House>那就接着治疗
<26-5,House>Then we continue the treatment,

607
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,420
<26-5,House>希望只是时间问题
<26-5,House>hope it's just taking longer than it should.

608
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,020
<26-6,Wilson>现在  是什么引起细胞坏死已不重要了
<26-6,Wilson>At this point, it doesn't matter what caused the necrosis.

609
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,320
<26-7,House>-或者是谁  -若我们不阻止它扩散的话
<26-7,House>- Or who. - If we don't stop it from spreading,

610
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,850
<26-8,Wilson>她撑不到明天
<26-8,Wilson>it'll kill her before the end of the day.

611
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,430
<26-9,Foreman>-我们还能做什么  -除掉它
<26-9,Foreman>- What else can we do?  - Get rid of it.

612
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,530
<26-10,Wilson>在坏死肌肉
<26-10,Wilson>Remove the dying flesh

613
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,280
<26-10,Wilson>穿透腹壁前除掉它
<26-10,Wilson>before it penetrates the abdominal wall.

614
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,180
<26-11,House>照做吧
<26-11,House>Do it.

615
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,360
<27-1,Foreman>肝素治疗还是有可能
<27-1,Foreman>There's still a chance the heparin treatment

616
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,370
<27-1,Foreman>会起作用
<27-1,Foreman>could start to take effect.

617
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,910
<27-2,Wilson>我们会尽量等
<27-2,Wilson>We're gonna wait as long as we can,

618
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,350
<27-2,Wilson>但若接下来的几小时内仍无好转的话
<27-2,Wilson>but if there's no change in the next few hours,

619
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,300
<27-2,Wilson>我们只能直接对病患进行手术了
<27-2,Wilson>we're gonna have to treat the symptoms directly.

620
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,110
<27-3,Mom>-你们能去除溃疡吗  -通过外科手术
<27-3,Mom>- So you can get rid of the sores? - Through surgery.

621
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,270
<27-4,Foreman>基本来说  就是切除术
<27-4,Foreman>technically, it's an amputation.

622
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,590
<27-5,Mom>切除术  但溃疡是...
<27-5,Mom>Amputation? But the sores are-

623
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,340
<27-6,Wilson>华法林导致的坏死细胞攻击脂肪组织
<27-6,Wilson>Warfarin-induced necrosis attacks fatty tissue,

624
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,420
<27-6,Wilson>主要是乳房
<27-6,Wilson>mainly in the breasts.

625
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,460
<27-7,Mom>等等  你是说要割除
<27-7,Mom>Wait. Are you talking about cutting off

626
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,020
<27-7,Mom>我女儿的  乳房
<27-7,Mom>my daughter's... breasts?

627
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,240
<27-7,Mom>她才10岁
<27-7,Mom>She's 10 years old.

628
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,960
<27-8,Wilson>乳房切除术可能是她生存的唯一希望了
<27-8,Wilson>A radical mastectomy may be her only chance for survival.

629
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,630
<27-9,Foreman>很抱歉  但还得请你在这上面签字
<27-9,Foreman>I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to sign this.

630
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,180
<28-1,Cameron>我们能谈谈吗
<28-1,Cameron>Could we talk?

631
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,990
<28-2,House>怎么  没玫瑰  没巧克力
<28-2,House>What, no roses, no chocolates?

632
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,290
<28-3,Cameron>-若你是来道歉的  -我不是来道歉的
<28-3,Cameron>- If you're here to apologize... - I'm not here to apologize.

633
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,540
<28-4,House>看来事情还没那么简单
<28-4,House>That means you're here for something more complicated.

634
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,840
<28-5,Cameron>你想炒了我吗
<28-5,Cameron>Do you want to fire me?

635
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,300
<28-6,House>是的  只等恰当的时机了
<28-6,House>Yes. Just waiting for an excuse.

636
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,340
<28-6,House>谁让沃格勒出现了呢
<28-6,House>Thank God Vogler came along.

637
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,190
<28-7,Cameron>只有这能解释你为什么
<28-7,Cameron>It's the only reason I can think of

638
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,800
<28-7,Cameron>坚持说我犯了错
<28-7,Cameron>why you're insisting that I made a mistake.

639
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,930
<28-8,House>是吗  还有另一种解释啊
<28-8,House>Really? Because there is another explanation.

640
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,710
<28-8,House>可能没你那个弗洛伊德式的分析有趣
<28-8,House>Perhaps not as much fun as your Freudian analysis,

641
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,030
<28-8,House>但也许你确实犯了错
<28-8,House>but maybe you actually made a mistake.

642
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,300
<28-9,Cameron>这样做是因为你无法控制
<28-9,Cameron>You're doing this because you can't deal with

643
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,800
<28-9,Cameron>对我的感情
<28-9,Cameron>your feelings for me.

644
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,340
<28-10,House>是你在一厢情愿吧
<28-10,House>I believe that you are the only one to express feelings.

645
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,250
<28-10,House>从一个刚入门的心理医生
<28-10,House>And if we're gonna look at this from

646
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,140
<28-10,House>的角度来看的话
<28-10,House>a first-year psych's point of view,

647
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,750
<28-10,House>也许是你想让我炒了你
<28-10,House>maybe you want me to fire you.

648
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,360
<28-10,House>所以你才表现的很奇怪
<28-10,House>Maybe that's why you're acting weird

649
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,740
<28-11,Cameron>你才奇怪呢
<28-11,Cameron>You're the one being different.

650
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,650
<28-11,Cameron>你总是在施压  压迫规则
<28-11,Cameron>You're always pushing things, pushing the rules,

651
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,800
<28-11,Cameron>压迫我们  但这次却没有
<28-11,Cameron>pushing us. But not this time.

652
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,400
<28-11,Cameron>你像看到救命稻草一样死抓住那个诊断
<28-11,Cameron>You jumped on this idea like a life raft.

653
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,620
<28-11,Cameron>一点不怀疑可能是别的病
<28-11,Cameron>Not one question about what else it could be.

654
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,300
<28-11,Cameron>不追问其他答案
<28-11,Cameron>No riding us for other answers.

655
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,110
<28-12,House>我知道答案
<28-12,House>I have the answer.

656
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,190
<28-13,Cameron>那你干嘛不看看电视
<28-13,Cameron>Then why aren't you watching TV

657
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,240
<28-13,Cameron>玩玩混账的掌上游戏
<28-13,Cameron>or playing your damn Game Boy...

658
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,150
<28-13,Cameron>或者无论什么你能独乐乐的事情呢
<28-13,Cameron>or whatever else you have so much fun doing by yourself?

659
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,500
<28-13,Cameron>也许是我该退出
<28-13,Cameron>Maybe I should just quit.

660
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,740
<28-13,Cameron>让大家都好过
<28-13,Cameron>Make it easy for everyone.

661
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,920
<28-14,House>也许你确实该如此
<28-14,House>Maybe you should.

662
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,860
<29-1,House>男人是蠢猪
<29-1,House>Men are pigs.

663
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,140
<29-2,Lucille>你把我叫来就为了告诉我
<29-2,Lucille>You called me in to tell me-

664
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,510
<29-3,House>我竟没注意到结扎和避孕套
<29-3,House>I should've realized the vasectomy and condoms

665
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,700
<29-3,House>是万无一失的
<29-3,House>was overkill,

666
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,100
<29-3,House>但这个就不容忽视了
<29-3,House>but this was too obvious to miss.

667
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,570
<29-3,House>可爱的孩子
<29-3,House>Cute kids.

668
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,580
<29-3,House>我爱死她的绿眼睛和他的蓝眼睛
<29-3,House>Love her green eyes and his baby blues.

669
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,530
<29-3,House>当然  因为你和你丈夫
<29-3,House>Of course, since both you and your husband

670
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,870
<29-3,House>是棕色眼睛
<29-3,House>have brown eyes-

671
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,880
<29-4,Lucille>你从哪儿拿到的
<29-4,Lucille>Where'd you get that?

672
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,620
<29-5,House>是其中三个
<29-5,House>From the father of three,

673
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,720
<29-5,House>最多四个孩子是爸爸生的
<29-5,House>maximum four, of your six children.

674
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,120
<29-5,House>所以我猜  你不想做手术的原因也许是
<29-5,House>So I'm thinking maybe the reason you don't want surgery...

675
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,050
<29-5,House>尽管不论变成啥样  你丈夫
<29-5,House>is that while your husband will find you attractive

676
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,060
<29-5,House>都不会嫌弃你
<29-5,House>no matter what,

677
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,650
<29-5,House>但和你有关系的其他男人
<29-5,House>all the other men you're sleeping with

678
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,260
<29-5,House>可没那么大度
<29-5,House>might not be so open-minded.

679
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,640
<29-5,House>也回归了我最初的定论  男人是蠢猪
<29-5,House>Which brings me back to my original thesis: Men are pigs.

680
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
<29-5,House>你没必要担心
<29-5,House>You got nothing to worry about.

681
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,220
<29-5,House>他们可能和任何人做爱
<29-5,House>They'll pretty much have sex with anyone:

682
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,830
<29-5,House>胖的  瘦的  已婚的  单身的
<29-5,House>Fat, skinny, married, single,

683
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,650
<29-5,House>陌生的  亲戚
<29-5,House>complete strangers, relatives-

684
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,120
<29-6,Lucille>-你有病  -你也是
<29-6,Lucille>- You... are sick.  - So are you.

685
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,250
<29-7,House>网上肯定有一堆的男人
<29-7,House>And I'm sure there are Web Sites full of men...

686
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,060
<29-7,House>喜欢有手术疤痕的已婚妇女
<29-7,House>Iooking for married women with surgical scars.

687
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,410
<29-7,House>接受手术吧  好吗
<29-7,House>So have the surgery. Please?

688
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,560
<29-7,House>好吧
<29-7,House>Okay.

689
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,330
<30-1,Chase>你为什么找卡梅隆谈话
<30-1,Chase>Why have you been talking to Cameron?

690
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,000
<30-2,Vogler>如果豪斯选了你
<30-2,Vogler>If House picks you,

691
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,290
<30-2,Vogler>我得找个新耳目啊
<30-2,Vogler>I'll be needing a new source in that room.

692
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,520
<30-3,Chase>如果他选我  怎讲
<30-3,Chase>If he picks me?

693
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,630
<30-4,Vogler>当然  福曼比你聪明
<30-4,Vogler>Sure. Foreman's smarter.

694
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,480
<30-4,Vogler>豪斯很欣赏卡梅隆
<30-4,Vogler>House has got a thing for Cameron.

695
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,880
<30-5,Chase>我一直给你提供消息  你得保护我
<30-5,Chase>I've been feeding you information so you'll protect me.

696
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,150
<30-6,Vogler>我需要你时自然会保护你
<30-6,Vogler>And I will protect you as long as I need you.

697
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,680
<30-6,Vogler>只要你需要我  你也得一直提供我消息
<30-6,Vogler>And you will feed me information as long as you need me.

698
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,210
<30-6,Vogler>我和卡梅隆谈话是因为若有了替代人选
<30-6,Vogler>I spoke with Cameron because if I have alternatives,

699
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,630
<30-6,Vogler>我就不需要你了
<30-6,Vogler>I don't need you.

700
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,110
<30-7,Chase>她不会背叛豪斯的
<30-7,Chase>She's not gonna rat on House.

701
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,200
<30-8,Vogler>福曼没提到和我谈过话吗
<30-8,Vogler>Foreman never said anything about talkin' to me?

702
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,970
<30-8,Vogler>有意思啊
<30-8,Vogler>Interesting, huh?

703
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,250
<31-1,House>快3个小时了
<31-1,House>It's been almost three hours.

704
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
<31-1,House>还是没任何好转
<31-1,House>Still no change in her condition.

705
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,950
<31-2,Foreman>我觉得该动手术了
<31-2,Foreman>I think we should get her into surgery.

706
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,090
<31-3,Chase>你想怎么做
<31-3,Chase>So what do you wanna do?

707
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,700
<31-4,House>假如卡梅隆没错
<31-4,House>Assume that Cameron didn't screw up.

708
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,750
<31-4,House>万一不是华法林的问题呢
<31-4,House>What if it's not the warfarin?

709
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,510
<31-5,Chase>只可能是这原因
<31-5,Chase>It has to be.

710
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,870
<31-5,Chase>我们一用华法林她就出现了溃疡
<31-5,Chase>The sores presented right after we administered it.

711
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,360
<31-6,House>是的  没错  但就假设不是
<31-6,House>Right, right, right. But let's just say it's not.

712
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,690
<31-6,House>快想  快想  还有其他可能没
<31-6,House>Come on. Come on. What do you got?

713
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,740
<31-7,Foreman>能给点时间想一下吗
<31-7,Foreman>Can I have a second to think?

714
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,730
<31-8,House>不行  没时间了
<31-8,House>No. There's no time to think.

715
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,770
<31-8,House>说出你脑子里的第一反应
<31-8,House>Just say the first thing that comes into your head.

716
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,880
<31-9,Chase>她很胖
<31-9,Chase>She's fat.

717
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,480
<31-10,Foreman>够了好吗  我们知道  你讨厌胖人
<31-10,Foreman>Enough already, okay? We got it. You hate fat people.

718
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,330
<31-11,Chase>我不是这个意思
<31-11,Chase>That's not what I meant.

719
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,370
<31-12,House>我们已经讨论过那个了
<31-12,House>We already considered obesity as a cause.

720
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,560
<31-13,Foreman>她的其他医生也是
<31-13,Foreman>So did all her other doctors.

721
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,130
<31-14,Chase>不  我是说万一那不是病因
<31-14,Chase>No, I mean what if it's not a cause?

722
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,310
<31-14,Chase>而是病症呢
<31-14,Chase>What if it's a symptom?

723
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,570
<31-15,House>好  那什么能引起肥胖和皮肤坏死呢
<31-15,House>Okay. So, what could cause obesity and skin necrosis?

724
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,590
<31-15,House>不管说不说得通  先给点意见
<31-15,House>I don't care if it makes sense. Just give me something.

725
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,410
<31-16,Foreman>溃疡继发性血管炎
<31-16,Foreman>Ulcers secondary to vasculitis.

726
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,330
<31-17,House>不是  那只能引发溃疡  没有坏死
<31-17,House>No, that's just sores, not obesity.

727
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,220
<31-18,Chase>-坏疽性脓皮病  -也是溃疡
<31-18,Chase>- Pyoderma gangrenosum. - More sores.

728
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,810
<31-19,House>从另一个方面来想
<31-19,House>Let's look at it from the other side.

729
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,570
<31-19,House>肥胖是什么的病症
<31-19,House>What has obesity as a symptom?

730
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,570
<31-21,Foreman>-甲状腺功能减退  -更可能是遗传
<31-21,Foreman>- Hypothyroidism?  - Genetics are more likely.

731
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,820
<31-21,Foreman>她妈妈也很胖
<31-21,Foreman>Her mom's heavy too.

732
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,460
<31-22,House>她虽胖  但也很高
<31-22,House>She's not just heavy, she's tall.

733
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,380
<31-22,House>-有没有她爸爸的记录  -有
<31-22,House>- We have any history on the dad? - Yeah.

734
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,740
<31-22,House>6英尺1英寸[约1米85]
<31-22,House>6'1 .

735
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,770
<31-24,House>孩子很矮
<31-24,House>Kid's short.

736
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,160
<31-24,House>她发育迟缓  血压高
<31-24,House>We got stunted growth, high blood pressure,

737
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,990
<31-24,House>血栓  肥胖
<31-24,House>blood clots, obesity-

738
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,970
<31-24,House>是库欣病
<31-24,House>It's Cushing's.

739
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,230
<31-25,Chase>不可能  那不会引起细胞坏死
<31-25,Chase>No. Necrosis doesn't present-

740
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,130
<31-26,House>在少数情况下  库欣病能引发高钙血症
<31-26,House>In rare cases, Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia,

741
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,000
<31-26,House>它能和华法林一样导致皮肤坏死
<31-26,House>which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin.

742
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,130
<31-26,House>绝对是的  解释通了所有病症
<31-26,House>It's perfect. It explains everything.

743
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,880
<31-27,Foreman>但不是库欣病
<31-27,Foreman>Except it's not Cushing's.

744
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,060
<31-27,Foreman>她已经接受过多项血液检测
<31-27,Foreman>She's had multiple blood tests,

745
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,030
<31-27,Foreman>但没一个显示皮质醇水平不正常
<31-27,Foreman>and none show abnormal cortisol levels.

746
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,770
<31-28,House>高钙血症可能是周期性的
<31-28,House>The hypercortisolism could be cyclical.

747
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,400
<31-28,House>我们没有抓住时机
<31-28,House>We didn't catch it in the right phase.

748
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,240
<31-29,Chase>那得再做一次血检
<31-29,Chase>We'll have to do another U.F.C.

749
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,210
<31-29,Chase>没时间了
<31-29,Chase>There's no time.

750
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,410
<31-30,House>必须在一小时内做决定
<31-30,House>We've got less than an hour to make a call.

751
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,490
<31-31,Chase>若我们按库欣病治疗  结果不是
<31-31,Chase>If we treat for Cushing's and we're wrong,

752
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,560
<31-31,Chase>她就没命了
<31-31,Chase>she's dead.

753
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,460
<31-32,Foreman>假若不是库欣病
<31-32,Foreman>If we assume it's not Cushing's,

754
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,440
<31-32,Foreman>等她的乳房被摘除后还是不行
<31-32,Foreman>she'll lose her breast and may still be sick.

755
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,420
<31-33,House>做磁共振
<31-33,House>Do an M.R.I.

756
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,230
<31-34,Foreman>你想用磁共振来检测高钙血症吗
<31-34,Foreman>You want us to look for hypercortisolism with an M.R.I.?

757
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,730
<31-35,House>不  我是说用磁共振来检查
<31-35,House>No, I want you to look for

758
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,460
<31-35,House>是什么引发了高钙血症
<31-35,House>what could cause hypercortisolism with an M.R.I.

759
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,660
<32-1,Foreman>肾上腺没问题
<32-1,Foreman>Nothing on the adrenals.

760
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,430
<32-1,Foreman>听说卡梅隆回家了  她病了吗
<32-1,Foreman>Heard Cameron went home. Is she sick?

761
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,160
<32-2,Chase>返回脑垂体视图
<32-2,Chase>Go back to the pituitary views.

762
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,440
<32-2,Chase>她看起来很好啊
<32-2,Chase>She seemed okay.

763
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,260
<32-3,Foreman>那还能有别的原因离开吗
<32-3,Foreman>Think she's got another reason for leaving?

764
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,090
<32-4,Chase>希望吧  等等  停
<32-4,Chase>I hope so. Wait, stop.

765
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,570
<32-4,Chase>那里  那是什么
<32-4,Chase>There. What's that?

766
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,360
<32-5,Foreman>一个肿瘤
<32-5,Foreman>A tumor.

767
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,720
<32-5,Foreman>是库欣病
<32-5,Foreman>It's Cushing's.

768
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,430
<33-1,Foreman>肿瘤引发了库欣病
<33-1,Foreman>The tumor causes Cushing's.

769
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,060
<33-1,Foreman>库欣病扰乱了荷尔蒙分泌
<33-1,Foreman>Cushing's messes with hormone production.

770
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,020
<33-1,Foreman>荷尔蒙对各方面都有影响
<33-1,Foreman>Hormones control everything:

771
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,040
<33-1,Foreman>发育  体重
<33-1,Foreman>Growth, weight-

772
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:42,350
<33-3,Foreman>-能治好吗  -需要手术摘除肿瘤
<33-3,Foreman>- Can you fix it? - She'll need surgery to remove the tumor.

773
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,410
<33-3,Foreman>一旦肿瘤清除  很快一切都会恢复正常
<33-3,Foreman>Once it's gone, everything will get normal very fast.

774
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,890
<33-4,Mom>-不需要切除乳房吗  -不需要
<33-4,Mom>- No mastectomy? - No.

775
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,800
<33-6,Mom>-太好了  -手术会有风险
<33-6,Mom>- Thank God. - The surgery is dangerous.

776
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,660
<33-7,Foreman>脑下垂体位于海绵状窦之间
<33-7,Foreman>The pituitary's located between the cavernous sinuses,

777
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,580
<33-7,Foreman>基本上  就是两眼之间
<33-7,Foreman>basically right between the eyes.

778
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,130
<33-7,Foreman>那里还有控制
<33-7,Foreman>The area contains the nerves that control

779
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,690
<33-7,Foreman>眼球运动的神经和给大脑供血的主动脉
<33-7,Foreman>eye movement and the major arteries that feed the brain.

780
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,090
<33-8,Mom>天哪
<33-8,Mom>Oh, my God.

781
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,810
<33-9,Foreman>手术会采用经蝶窦入路法靠近腺体
<33-9,Foreman>The surgeon will approach the gland transsphenoidally.

782
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,330
<33-9,Foreman>医生会在唇下开个切口
<33-9,Foreman>An incision will be made under the lip,

783
