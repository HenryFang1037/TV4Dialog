14
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,020
<1-7,Joseph>这个只是民事诉讼
<1-7,Joseph>This is only a civil lawsuit.

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,440
<1-7,Joseph>我们可以不去管它
<1-7,Joseph>We can ignore it.

16

<1-7,Joseph>总统先生

21
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,750
<2-3,Chase>他们怎么了?
<2-3,Chase>What happened to them?

22
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,110
<2-4,Foreman>他辞职了 我不得不炒了13
<2-4,Foreman>He quit,and I had to let her go.

23
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,350
<2-5,Chase>你把你女朋友给炒了?
<2-5,Chase>you actually fired your girlfriend?

24
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,250
<2-5,Chase>是的
<2-5,Chase>Yes.

28
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,190
<2-9,Chase>有意思的是

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,440
<2-9,Chase>我们可以一起工作
<2-9,Chase>We could work together.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,220
<2-10,Cameron>你知道病人是谁吗?
<2-10,Cameron>Did you see who the patient is?

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,360
<2-11,Chase>那也是我觉得有趣的原因之一
<2-11,Chase>That's one of the reasons it'll be interesting.

32

<2-12,Cameron>Dibala是世界上最强制的独裁者之一
<2-12,Cameron>Dibala is one of the most repressive dictators or the wld.

<2-13,Foreman>你治疗死刑犯的时候并没有什么意见
<2-13,Foreman>You had no problem treating a guy on death row.

34
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,300
<2-14,Cameron>我们治好他 他还会再回去监狱
<2-14,Cameron>Who was still in prison after we patched him up.

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,990
<2-14,Cameron>如果我们治好了Dibala他可能飞回去他的国家大屠杀
<2-14,Cameron>We fix dibala,he gets on a plane and executes half his country.

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,830
<2-14,Cameron>他在镇压南方Sitibi人的民族叛乱
<2-14,Cameron>He's been repressing an ethnic rebellion in the south,the sitibi people.

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,230
<2-14,Cameron>情况还在越变越糟
<2-14,Cameron>It's getting worse.

38
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,790
<2-15,Cuddy>Dibala是美国政府请来的
<2-15,Cuddy>Dibala is a guest of the U.S.Government.

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,140
<2-15,Cuddy>他还被邀请在联合国发言
<2-15,Cuddy>And he's been invited to speak at the U.N.

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,590
<2-15,Cuddy>我不是要求你喜欢他
<2-15,Cuddy>I'm not asking you to love him.

41
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,080
<2-15,Cuddy>只是要求你做好你的工作而已
<2-15,Cuddy>I'm asking you to do your job.

42
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,570
<3-1,Chase>可能无法理解
<3-1,Chase>Possibly incomprehensible

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,210
<3-1,Chase>当然我在说你炒掉你女朋友这事
<3-1,Chase>Of course,I'm talkg about you firing your girlfriend.

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,330
<3-2,Foreman>她在我手下工作我们无法好好相处
<3-2,Foreman>We weren't getting along with her working under me.

45
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,030
<3-3,Cameron>这个很有帮助
<3-3,Cameron>This'll help.

46
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,270
<3-4,Chase>Cameron和我也一起工作
<3-4,Chase>Cameron and I work together.

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,440
<3-5,Foreman>但你不是她的老板
<3-5,Foreman>But you weren't her boss.

48
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,220
<3-5,Foreman>而且你们后来也没在一起工作了
<3-5,Foreman>And you stopped working together.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,220
<3-6,Chase>为什么你不告诉她你错了
<3-6,Chase>Why don't you just tell her you were wrong?

50
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,820
<3-6,Chase>因为我没错
<3-6,Chase>'Cause I wasn'T.

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,210
<3-7,Foreman>我知道这很难接受
<3-7,Foreman>I know how this looks.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,300
<3-7,Foreman>我知道这可能使我们分手
<3-7,Foreman>I know it might break us up.

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,150
<3-7,Foreman>总比教我俩确凿无疑分手的好
<3-7,Foreman>But that's better than definitely breaking us up,

54
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,530
<3-7,Foreman>如果我不这样做我们就真的会分手
<3-7,Foreman>which is what would have happened otherwise.

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,600
<4-1,Foreman>肺部的出血性溃疡
<4-1,Foreman>Hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.

56
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,590
<4-2,House>老天 好像回到了三年前
<4-2,House>Oh,my god,it's tee years ago.

57
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,230
<4-2,House>这是不是意味着我还是个疯子?
<4-2,House>Does that mean I'm still crazy?

58
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,260
<4-3,Foreman>你回来了?

<4-6,House>节哀顺变啊
<4-6,House>My condolences.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,630
<4-6,House>虽然她不是这个世界上最辣的女人
<4-6,House>Although it's not like she's the hottest woman

64
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,670
<4-7,Foreman>我们没有分手
<4-7,Foreman>- in the world. -We haven't broken up.

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
<4-7,Foreman>你回来了吗?

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,590
<4-8,House>一点点
<4-8,House>Sort of.

67
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,780
<4-9,Foreman>你拿回你的执照了吗?
<4-9,Foreman>Did you get your license back?

68
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,140
<4-10,House>还要一个月
<4-10,House>Not for a month or so.

69
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,110
<4-10,House>所以你还是老大
<4-10,House>So you'll be in charge.

70
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,240
<4-10,House>而我只是做点贡献
<4-10,House>I'm just gonna pitch in a little.

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,770
<4-11,Chase>Dibala认为有人想要暗杀他
<4-11,Chase>dibala thinks it was an assassination attempt.

72
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,740
<4-11,Chase>钋 就像在伦敦中毒的俄罗斯特工
<4-11,Chase>Polonium,like the russian guy in loon.

73
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,090
<4-12,Foreman>FBI检查了他的传票和宾馆房间
<4-12,Foreman>Fbi chked the service of process forms and his hotel room.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,950
<4-13,Cameron>胃酸倒流?

<4-14,Chase>没有哮喘或者心痛的病史
<4-14,Chase>No history of asthma or heartburn.

<4-15,Foreman>他的手上被虫子咬过
<4-15,Foreman>he has a bug bite on his hands.

78
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,970
<4-15,Foreman>而且他国家盛行疟疾
<4-15,Foreman>Malaria's endemic in his country.

79
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,890
<4-15,Foreman>先给他用复方蒿甲醚
<4-15,Foreman>Let's start him on coartem.

80
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,680
<4-16,House>我不想招人不快
<4-16,House>I don't want to step on any toes,

81
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,330
<4-16,House>但我觉得我对病人要负责
<4-16,House>but I guess I do have higher duty to the patient.

82
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,970
<4-17,Foreman>有什么你就说吧
<4-17,Foreman>If you have something to say,say it.

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,550
<4-18,House>你匆匆做出一个诊断因为你想赶快离开这个房间
<4-18,House>You're rushing to a diagnosis because you're rushing out of this room

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,260
<4-18,House>因为你不愿和我多待
<4-18,House>because you're rightly upset withe.

85
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,590
<4-18,House>虽然我不是想出馊主意的那个人
<4-18,House>Although I wasn't the one who made that asinine decision.

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,360
<4-19,Foreman>有什么和医学相关的话你要说吗
<4-19,Foreman>Do you have anything medical to say?

87
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,150
<4-20,House>因为有呕吐中毒更有可能
<4-20,House>Poison fits better because of the vomiting.

88
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,810
<4-20,House>可能不是真的虫咬痕迹
<4-20,House>Bug bite might not be a bite.

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,540
<4-20,House>可能是氯痤疮
<4-20,House>It might be the start of chloracne.

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,400
<4-21,Chase>二恶英暗杀
<4-21,Chase>Assassination attempt through dioxin poisoning.

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,990
<4-21,Chase>很难检测出来
<4-21,Chase>It's hard to detect.

92
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,640
<4-21,Chase>很有可能
<4-21,Chase>Fi .

93
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,640
<4-22,Foreman>给他用蔗糖聚酯
<4-22,Foreman>Start him on olestra.

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,160
<4-22,Foreman>你为什么不直接了当地说二恶英中毒
<4-22,Foreman>You couldn't have just said dioxin up front?

95
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,860
<4-23,House>我希望你能自己推测出来
<4-23,House>I was hoping you'd get there on your own.

96
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,170
<4-23,House>我觉得我们应该找Cuddy谈一下
<4-23,House>So I guess we should talk to cuddy.

97
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,270
<5-1,Dibala>你确定是二恶英?
<5-1,Dibala>You are sure it is dioxin?

98
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,770
<5-2,Cameron>不
<5-2,Cameron>No.

99
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,980
<5-3,Chase>是我们认为最有可能的
<5-3,Chase>It's our best guess.

100
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,070
<5-3,Chase>蔗糖聚酯能合毒素结合排出体外
<5-3,Chase>The olestra here binds to the poison and flushes it out of your system.

101
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,340
<5-4,Dibala>你是哪里人 医生?
<5-4,Dibala>Where are you from,doctor?

102
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,730
<5-5,Chase>我是澳大利亚人
<5-5,Chase>I'm australian.

103
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,930
<5-6,Dibala>怎么听着有点英国口音?
<5-6,Dibala>Do I hear a bit of the british?

104
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,720
<5-7,Chase>大多数人都没留意到
<5-7,Chase>Most people don't notice it.

105
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,740
<5-7,Chase>是的 我在那里混了几年
<5-7,Chase>Yeah,I kicked around there for a while.

106
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,650
<5-8,Dibala>在那上的医学院吗?
<5-8,Dibala>You went to medical school there?

107
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,450
<5-9,Chase>上了一年神学院
<5-9,Chase>Actually a year of seminary.

108
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,630
<5-10,Dibala>然后你不念了
<5-10,Dibala>And you left.

109
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,060
<5-10,Dibala>我小时候村子里有一个天主教教堂
<5-10,Dibala>There was a catholic mission near my childhood village.

110
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,490
<5-10,Dibala>我喜欢牧师
<5-10,Dibala>I liked the priests.

111
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,740
<5-10,Dibala>他们都是好人
<5-10,Dibala>They were good people.

112
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,310
<5-10,Dibala>但当我的两个妹妹因肺病奄奄一息时
<5-10,Dibala>But when my two younger sisters were dying from consumption,

113
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,730
<5-10,Dibala>牧师可没什么用
<5-10,Dibala>it wasn't more priests we wanted.

114
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,400
<6-1,Foreman>我解雇了我的女朋友因为他说他会永远离开
<6-1,Foreman>I fired my girlfriend because he said he was gone for good.

115
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,030
<6-2,House>我的生活离不开这工作
<6-2,House>I need this in my life.

116
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,060
<6-3,Cuddy>一星期之前 你头也不回地要走
<6-3,Cuddy>A week ago,it was the last thing you needed.

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,190
<6-4,Houes>这是个过程
<6-4,Houes>It's a process.

118
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,240
<6-4,Houes>我在学习
<6-4,Houes>I'm learning.

119
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,620
<6-5,Foreman>顺便耍我一通
<6-5,Foreman>And screwing me over as you O.

120
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,940
<6-6,House>是啊 我正有此意

121
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,760
<6-6,House>对不起
<6-6,House>Sorry.

122
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,080
<6-6,House>如果你愿意 我可以向13解释
<6-6,House>If you want,I'll explain it to thirteen.

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,230
<6-7,Foreman>他还没准备好
<6-7,Foreman>He's not ready.

124
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,210
<6-7,Foreman>他没有行医执照
<6-7,Foreman>He doesn't have his license.

125
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,060
<6-8,Cuddy>那他就不能行医
<6-8,Cuddy>Then he can't practice.

126
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,120
<6-8,Cuddy>但我们不听他的就太傻了
<6-8,Cuddy>But we'd be idiots not to listen to him.

127
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,100
<6-8,Cuddy>你负责病例 他旁听所有鉴别诊断
<6-8,Cuddy>You're in charge,he sits in on all the differentials.

128
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,340
<6-8,Cuddy>你拿回你的执照之前 这些都是非正式的
<6-8,Cuddy>Until you get your license back,this is all unofficial.

<6-8,Cuddy>不插手治疗 不和病人接触
<6-8,Cuddy>No procedures,no patient contact.

130
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,290
<6-9,House>最后一条我能遵守
<6-9,House>Think I can probably deal with that last one.

131
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:56,070
<7-1,Foreman>我解雇你唯一的原因是如果我是上司我们的关系一定会搞糟
<7-1,Foreman>The only reason I let you go is because our relationship wouldn't work if I was in charge.

132
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,430
<7-1,Foreman>但我马上就不做主了 所以
<7-1,Foreman>But I won't be in charge soon,so...

133
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,960
<7-1,Foreman>我来是想让你回来工作
<7-1,Foreman>I came to offer you your old job back.

<7-1,Foreman>我知道
<7-1,Foreman>I know.

135
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,770

136
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,770
<7-1,Foreman>但是情况有变
<7-1,Foreman>But circumstances have changed.

137
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,200
<7-2,Thirteen>我不想要这个工作
<7-2,Thirteen>I don't want the job.

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,060
<7-3,Foreman>为什么?
<7-3,Foreman>Why not?

139
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,550
<7-4,Thirteen>因为有个更简单的方法解释你为什么解雇我
<7-4,Thirteen>Because there's a much simpler explanation for you firing me.

140
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,970
<7-4,Thirteen>你想和我分手 又没胆量说出来
<7-4,Thirteen>You wanted to break up with me,but you were too weak to do it yourself.

141
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,880
<7-5,Foreman>那我为什么要你回来?
<7-5,Foreman>Then why would I try to hire you back?

142
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,290
<7-5,Foreman>今晚一起吃晚饭好吗?

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,550
<8-2,Ruwe>你不能治好他
<8-2,Ruwe>You must not treat him.

<8-4,Ruwe>他掩饰说是为了让青年人不在街头游荡
<8-4,Ruwe>He pretends it's to get young people off the street.

<8-5,Chase>你应该和律师谈 跟联合国谈
<8-5,Chase>You should talk to a lawyer,talk to the U.N...

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,190
<11-2,Dibala>医生会尽力的
<11-2,Dibala>These people know what they are doing.

234
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,280
<11-2,Dibala>你结婚了么?
<11-2,Dibala>Are you married,doctor?

235
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,430
<11-3,Foreman>没
<11-3,Foreman>No.

236
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,400
<11-4,Dibala>你有女朋友?
<11-4,Dibala>You have a girlfriend.

237
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,460
<11-5,Foreman>是的
<11-5,Foreman>Yes.

238
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,960
<11-6,Dibala>从你斟酌的语气和那个姑娘复杂的神情看
<11-6,Dibala>Judging by your tentative answer and the complicated expression on her face,

239
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,900
<11-6,Dibala>过道里的那个应该就是你女朋友吧
<11-6,Dibala>I believe that is she,standing in the hallway.

240
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,360
<11-6,Dibala>我接到Princeton总院Douglas那儿打来的电话
<11-6,Dibala>I got a call from douglas' department at princeton general.

241
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,540
<12-1,Thirteen>喊我去面试
<12-1,Thirteen>They want me to interview with them.

242
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,440
<12-1,Thirteen>奇怪的是 我上周刚打去问过
<12-1,Thirteen>Which is weird,because when I called last week,

243
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,670
<12-1,Thirteen>那时还说不招人
<12-1,Thirteen>they said they had nothing available.

244
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,570
<12-1,Thirteen>所以我连简历都没寄
<12-1,Thirteen>So I never sent in my resume.

245
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,460
<12-2,Foreman>Douglas欠我情
<12-2,Foreman>Douglas owes me a favor.

246
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,050
<12-3,Thirteen>正常人道歉送巧克力
<12-3,Thirteen>Most people send ctes.Cola

247
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,700
<12-4,Foreman>我本打算在你家楼下整夜举着唱机
<12-4,Foreman>I'd stand outside your apartment all night holding up a boom box,

248
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,330
<12-4,Foreman>可你说过你讨厌80年代的歌
<12-4,Foreman>except you told me you hate '80s music.

249
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,040
<12-5,Thirteen>说到晚饭?
<12-5,Thirteen>So about dinner?

250
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,220
<12-5,Thirteen>我明晚有空
<12-5,Thirteen>I'm free tomorrow night.

251
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,560
<12-5,Thirteen>我还在纳闷哪儿来的噪音
<12-5,Thirteen>I was wondering what that noise was.

252
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,340
<13-1,Murphy>原来是该死的拐杖
<13-1,Murphy>It's the damn cane.

253
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,530
<13-2,House>你好 我是Greg
<13-2,House>And I'm greg.

254
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,350
<13-3,Murphy>你这玩意乒乒乓乓 我可睡不着
<13-3,Murphy>And I can't sleep with you banging around with that thing.

255
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,950
<13-4,House>你不是在埋怨我这根拐杖动静太大吧
<13-4,House>You're not actually saying that I have too loud a cane?

256
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,260
<13-5,Murphy>有这么难理解么?
<13-5,Murphy>Is that hard for you to understand?

257
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,090
<13-6,House>敢情你没注意它可不是踢踏舞鞋还包着橡皮头呢
<13-6,House>Only in the sense that it has a rubber tip on the end and not a tap shoe.

258
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,270
<13-7,Murphy>你想惹毛我
<13-7,Murphy>Now you're getting cute with me.

259
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,260
<13-8,House>好啦 起头不算 从新来过
<13-8,House>Okay,we started badly.

260
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,680
<13-8,House>我为噪音道歉 我会想办法更安静些
<13-8,House>I apologize for the noise,and we will try to figure out a way to be quieter¡ª

261
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,190
<13-9,Murphy>别想来这套
<13-9,Murphy>and a thousand other things I don't give a crap about.

262
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,160
<13-9,Murphy>要是不让我清静 我有你好看
<13-9,Murphy>Now you keep it down,or we're gonna have trouble.

263
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,140
<14-1,Cameron>你呼我?
<14-1,Cameron>you paged me?

264
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,230
<14-2,Dibala>这是Ama
<14-2,Dibala>This is ama.

265
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,570
<14-2,Dibala>你从我们国家来 现在住在这儿
<14-2,Dibala>She is from our country,but she lives here now.

266
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,010
<14-2,Dibala>我们希望用她的血
<14-2,Dibala>We'd like you to use her blood.

267
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,860
<14-3,Cameron>干什么?
<14-3,Cameron>For what?

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,050
<14-4,Dibala>她两年前得过拉沙热 后来康复了
<14-4,Dibala>She recovered from lassa fever two years ago.

269
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,900
<14-4,Dibala>我们的卫生部长建议
<14-4,Dibala>Our health minister has advised us that

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,700
<14-4,Dibala>用含有抗体的血浆比病毒唑有效多了
<14-4,Dibala>plasma from one who has the antibodies is much more effective than ribavirin.

271
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,320
<14-5,Joseph>这是签过名的同意书
<14-5,Joseph>This is a signed consent form.

272
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,100
<14-5,Joseph>你会用她的血吧?
<14-5,Joseph>Will you take her blood,please?

273
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,510
<14-5,Joseph>不
<14-5,Joseph>No.

274
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,270
<15-1,Ama>我愿意的
<15-1,Ama>I want to do this.

275
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,100
<15-2,Cuddy>你明白我们将用你的血来治疗Dibala总统
<15-2,Cuddy>you understand that we would be using your blood to cure president dibala.

276
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,560
<15-3,Ama>我明白
<15-3,Ama>I know.

277
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,440
<15-4,Cameron>你是Sitibi人么?
<15-4,Cameron>Are you from the sitibi people?

278
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,730
<15-5,Ama>我是Sitibi
<15-5,Ama>I am sitibi.

279
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,840
<15-6,Cameron>他们威胁你?
<15-6,Cameron>Did they threaten you in some way?

280
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,250
<15-6,Cameron>你的家人回国了?
<15-6,Cameron>Your family members back home?

281
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
<15-7,Ama>请让我捐血吧
<15-7,Ama>Please let me give the blood.

282
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,180
<15-7,Ama>求你们
<15-7,Ama>Please.

283
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
<15-8,Cuddy>就这么办吧
<15-8,Cuddy>Do it.

284
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,440
<15-9,Cameron>她是被威逼的
<15-9,Cameron>She's being coerced.

285
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:16,480
<15-10,Cuddy>就算她是 我宁愿背负插针头的罪也不愿害死她的家人
<15-10,Cuddy>If she is,I'd rather have a needle prick on my conscience than the death of her family members.

286
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,280
<16-1,Chase>拦住他
<16-1,Chase>Don't let him in there!

287
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,960
<17-1,Bass>够了 制服他了
<17-1,Bass>That's enough!We got him.

288
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,060
<17-2,Chase>你没事吧?
<17-2,Chase>You all right?

289
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,090
<17-3,Dibala>这人是谁?
<17-3,Dibala>Who is that man?

290
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,990
<17-4,Bass>他中弹了?
<17-4,Bass>He shot him?

291
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,190
<17-4,Bass>没
<17-4,Bass>No.

292
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,700
<17-4,Bass>你需要律师
<17-4,Bass>you need a lawyer.

293
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,810
<17-4,Bass>可以让法庭指派
<17-4,Bass>You can get a court-appointed.

294
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,060
<18-1,Chase>能帮到你
<18-1,Chase>They can help you.

295
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,540
<18-2,Ruwe>没人能帮我
<18-2,Ruwe>I can't be helped.

296
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,160
<18-3,Chase>你干了件蠢事
<18-3,Chase>You did a stupid,terrible thing.

297
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,580
<18-3,Chase>但基于你妻子的遭遇
<18-3,Chase>But given the circumstances with your wife,

298
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,230
<18-3,Chase>会轻判的
<18-3,Chase>you could get a reduced sentence.

299
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,720
<18-4,Ruwe>她不是我妻子
<18-4,Ruwe>She wasn't my wife.

300
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,980
<18-5,Chase>那她是谁?
<18-5,Chase>Then who was she?

301
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,390
<18-6,Ruwe>他们没告诉我们她的名字
<18-6,Ruwe>They never told us her name.

302
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,600
<18-6,Ruwe>他的人逼我们对这女人犯下的罪
<18-6,Ruwe>What his men made us do to that woman...

303
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:06,600
<18-6,Ruwe>他将要残害所有的Sitibi人
<18-6,Ruwe>he is now going to do to all the sitibi.

304
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,460
<19-1,Cameron>你可能会死的
<19-1,Cameron>you could have gotten killed.

305
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,280
<19-2,Chase>他不是要伤害我
<19-2,Chase>He wasn't going to hurt me.

306
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,380
<19-3,Cameron>他在医院里开枪
<19-3,Cameron>He fired a gun in the hospital.

307
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,860
<19-4,Chase>抱抱
<19-4,Chase>Come here.

308
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,080
<19-5,Cameron>或者下次别大声示警
<19-5,Cameron>Maybe next time don't yell out that warning.

309
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,840
<20-1,Foreman>眼睛出血是因为淋巴结肿大压迫了视网膜静脉
<20-1,Foreman>The bloody eye was from an enlarged lymph node blocking the retinal vein.

310
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,170
<20-1,Foreman>我们疏导了循环
<20-1,Foreman>We restored circulation,

311
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,580
<20-1,Foreman>意味着在心脏 肺 发热之外 还得加上淋巴
<20-1,Foreman>but it means we've got to add lymph involvement to the heart,lungs,and rising fever.

312
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,520
<20-2,House>我准备静静坐着
<20-2,House>I'm just gonna sit here quietly.

313
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,910
<20-3,Foreman>为什么?
<20-3,Foreman>Why?

314
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,730
<20-4,House>我发觉我不由自主地损害您的威严
<20-4,House>I feel like I've been inadvertently undermining your authority,

315
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
<20-2,House>所以我就旁观
<20-2,House>so I'm just gonna observe.

316
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,630
<20-4,House>不说一个字
<20-4,House>Not gonna say a rd.

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,180
<20-5,Foreman>心脏问题可能指向肉状瘤病
<20-5,Foreman>The heart could point to sarcoidosis.

318
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:08,440
<20-6,Chase>我猜X光片没有显示肺门淋巴结肿大否定了肉状瘤病
<20-6,Chase>I'm thinking the x-rays indicate a lack of hilar adenopathy,which rules it out.

319
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,680
<20-7,Foreman>金黄色葡萄球菌感染?
<20-7,Foreman>Staph aureus?

320
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,290
<20-7,Foreman>不
<20-7,Foreman>no.

321
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,670
<20-8,Chase>因为...
<20-8,Chase>Because...

322
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,470
<20-8,Chase>他...
<20-8,Chase>he...

323
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,130
<20-8,Chase>抽烟?
<20-8,Chase>smokes?

324
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,800
<20-9,Foreman>他模仿的是体温计
<20-9,Foreman>He's miming a thermometer.

325
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,010
<20-9,Foreman>他意思是体温不够高
<20-9,Foreman>He says the fever's not high enough.

326
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,620
<20-10,Chase>那是其他的感染
<20-10,Chase>So some other infection.

327
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,380
<20-11,Foreman>他错了
<20-11,Foreman>he's wrong.

328
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,440
<20-11,Foreman>发烧容易引导我们去想感染
<20-11,Foreman>The fever could be misleading us into thinking infection.

329
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,670
<20-12,Foreman>说啊
<20-12,Foreman>Talk.

330
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,140
<20-13,Foreman>淋巴瘤都符合
<20-13,Foreman>It could all fit with lymphoma.

331
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,170
<20-14,House>请你跨开双腿 我好搭成H
<20-14,House>Um,I need you to spread your legs so I can do an H.

332
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,990
<20-15,Cameron>淋巴瘤不可能
<20-15,Cameron>Can't be lymphoma.

333
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,640
<20-15,Cameron>乳酸脱氢酶值正常
<20-15,Cameron>Ldh is normal.

334
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,910
<20-16,Foreman>他肝脏功能完好
<20-16,Foreman>He's got good liver function.

335
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,990
<20-16,Foreman>掩盖了乳酸脱氢酶值升高
<20-16,Foreman>It's masking the elevated levels.

336
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,430
<20-16,Foreman>活检淋巴结
<20-16,Foreman>Biopsy the lymph node.

337
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,020
<20-16,Foreman>证实一下
<20-16,Foreman>Check it out.

338
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,810
<20-17,House>有道理
<20-17,House>Makes sense.

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,860
<20-17,House>看来你不需要我
<20-17,House>I guess you don't need me.

340
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,890
<20-17,House>要不你顺手拉上百叶窗吧
<20-17,House>Oh,by the way,you might want to close the blinds.

341
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,320
<20-17,House>有点儿太亮堂了
<20-17,House>A little bright in here.

342
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,430
<21-1,Wilson>好巧不巧 他居然认为你是个无赖
<21-1,Wilson>It's just a wild coincidence that he thought you were a rude jerk.

343
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,800
<21-2,House>得了 要相信我是无辜的
<21-2,House>Come on.Give me the benefit of the doubt.

344
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,710
<21-2,House>你说他蛮不讲理的
<21-2,House>You said he's a jerk.

345
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,740
<21-2,House>我几乎没还嘴
<21-2,House>I barely talked.

346
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,390
<21-3,Wilson>你动嘴皮子了
<21-3,Wilson>You talked!

347
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,240
<21-3,Wilson>我只想早晨醒来在微微鼓泡的宁静喷泉旁 呷口Espresso
<21-3,Wilson>All I wanted was to sip morning espresso next to a peaceful,burbling fountain.

348
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,060
<21-4,House>你可以呷着极品干邑
<21-4,House>You could be sipping courvoisier

349
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,170
<21-4,House>倚在花花公子乐园的复制品旁只要你掌握了他的弱点
<21-4,House>next to a replica of the playboy grotto if you tell him what you got on him.

350
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,810
<21-5,Wilson>我可没有他的把柄
<21-5,Wilson>I don't have anything on him.

351
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,120
<21-5,Wilson>我根本不想抓他的把柄
<21-5,Wilson>I don't want anything onim.

352
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,490
<21-6,House>据说他去过越南?
<21-6,House>The closest he's been to vietnam?

353
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,890
<21-6,House>可以在街角那个馆子订香脆面
<21-6,House>Ordering the mee krob at that place on the corner.

354
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,540
<21-7,Wilson>香脆面是泰国菜
<21-7,Wilson>Mee krob is from thailand.

355
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,500
<21-8,House>没错
<21-8,House>Exactly.

356
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,720
<21-9,Wilson>你在想什么?
<21-9,Wilson>What did you do?

357
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,850
<21-9,Wilson>为什么怀疑他说谎呢?
<21-9,Wilson>Why do you think he's faking?

358
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,170
<21-10,House>我看见了他的信
<21-10,House>I saw his mail.

359
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,110
<21-11,Wilson>你撬了他的门?
<21-11,Wilson>Your broke in?

360
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,940
<21-11,Wilson>没有
<21-11,Wilson>No.

361
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,310
<21-12,House>他当时拿着信
<21-12,House>He was holding it.

362
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,900
<21-12,House>私人医疗保险
<21-12,House>Private medical insurance.

363
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,610
<21-12,House>不是退役军人管理局寄来的
<21-12,House>Not from the V.A.

364
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,690
<21-12,House>再说 他也就五十来岁
<21-12,House>Plus,he's got to be early 50s.

365
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,670
<21-12,House>过分年轻的老兵
<21-12,House>He's too young to be a vet.

366
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,940
<21-12,House>所以我又进一步调查了一下
<21-12,House>So I looked further.

367
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,920
<21-13,Wilson>你真的撬了门
<21-13,Wilson>You did break in.

368
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,510
<21-14,House>上网查
<21-14,House>Online.

369
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,120
<21-14,House>所有退伍记录里都没他的名字
<21-14,House>There's no reference to him in any of the vet records.

370
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,570
<21-15,Wilson>他为什么要假装是退伍兵呢?
<21-15,Wilson>Why would he fake being a veteran?

371
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,830
<21-16,House>看看你是怎么对他的吧
<21-16,House>Just look how you're acting.

372
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,010
<21-16,House>多年来人们都为了这混蛋而蹑手蹑脚
<21-16,House>People have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.

373
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,710
<21-17,Wilson>通常我们都对肢残人士说去死吧
<21-17,Wilson>Normally,we'd all tell the amputee to go screw himself.

374
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,050
<21-18,House>同情给受害者 谄媚献给英雄
<21-18,House>Victims get pity,heroes get adulation.

375
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:29,810
<21-18,House>这样多好
<21-18,House>It's way better.

376
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,910
<21-19,Wilson>谢谢你帮我解决邻居的事
<21-19,Wilson>Thank you for trying to help me out with my neighbor.

377
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,290
<21-19,Wilson>忘了越南这回事吧
<21-19,Wilson>Now forget the vietnam stuff.

378
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,460
<21-20,House>我可以证明的
<21-20,House>I could prove this.

379
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,780
<21-21,Wilson>但你不行因为你要忙着给他写封道歉信
<21-21,Wilson>But you won't because you'll be too busy writing him a letter of apology

380
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,180
<21-21,Wilson>放到门前 但是不要敲门
<21-21,Wilson>and dropping it at his door without knocking at his door.

381
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,160
<21-22,House>我什么都没做啊
<21-22,House>I didn't do anything.

382
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,900
<21-22,House>那家伙就是个混蛋
<21-22,House>That guy's a total ass.

383
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,060
<21-23,Wilson>这才是关键
<21-23,Wilson>Which is the point.

384
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,150
<21-23,Wilson>对你喜欢的人友善很容易
<21-23,Wilson>It's easy to be nice to people you like.

385
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,430
<21-23,Wilson>对你讨厌的人友善 这就是个本事了
<21-23,Wilson>But being nice to people you hate,that's a skill.

386
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,040
<21-23,Wilson>照做吧
<21-23,Wilson>Do it.

387
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,420
<22-1,Dibala>谢谢你救了我的命
<22-1,Dibala>Thank you for saving my life.

388
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,590
<22-2,Chase>那个要杀你的人
<22-2,Chase>The man that tried to kill you,

389
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,200
<22-2,Chase>说你在筹划一场大屠杀
<22-2,Chase>he said that you were preparing a massacre.

390
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,120
<22-3,Dibala>Sitibi人是我的子民
<22-3,Dibala>The sitibi are my countrymen.

391
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,450
<22-3,Dibala>我在对抗一场游击战争
<22-3,Dibala>I am fighting a guerilla war.

392
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,680
<22-4,Chase>另外一种说法也叫种族屠杀
<22-4,Chase>In a way that's being called genocide.

393
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:23,120
<22-5,Dibala>二十年前就是这些Sitibi造反派占领了南部
<22-5,Dibala>20 years ago,these same sitibi rebels took over the south,

394
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,060
<22-5,Dibala>他们屠杀了上万人现在他们又要重演历史
<22-5,Dibala>they massacred tens of thousands,and they would happily do it again.

395
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,020
<22-5,Dibala>我在维持秩序
<22-5,Dibala>I'm trying to impose order.

396
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,860
<22-5,Dibala>我在阻止一场种族屠杀
<22-5,Dibala>I'm trying to prevent a genocide.

397
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,460
<22-4,Chase>种族屠杀
<22-4,Chase>Genocide.

398
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,980
<22-5,Dibala>我最小的儿子在这儿念书
<22-5,Dibala>My own son,my youngest,he is a student here.

399
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,050
<22-5,Dibala>他很多年没跟我说过话了因为你们报纸上的报道
<22-5,Dibala>He hasn't spoken to me in years because of what he read in your newspapers.

400
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,880
<22-5,Dibala>但他看到的不是真的
<22-5,Dibala>But what he read is not true.

401
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,470
<22-6,Chase>那你的青年劳动联盟呢?
<22-6,Chase>What about your youth labor league?

402
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,770
<22-7,Dibala>这桩事我犯错了
<22-7,Dibala>There I was at fault.

403
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:13,670
<22-7,Dibala>我雇了一些满腔热血的人他们逾越了界限 违背了本意
<22-7,Dibala>I hired men,who,in their zeal,stepped over the line,and there were abuses.

404
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,060
<22-7,Dibala>但这种事不会再发生了
<22-7,Dibala>But that will not happen ain.

405
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,530
<23-1,House>有人吗?
<23-1,House>Hello?

406
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,370
<24-1,Chase>怎么样了?
<24-1,Chase>How's it going?

407
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,410
<24-2,Cameron>细胞核看上去正常
<24-2,Cameron>Normal-looking nucleus.

408
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,110
<24-3,Chase>你怎么样了?
<24-3,Chase>How's it going with you?

409
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,070
<24-3,Chase>你开玩笑说让那人杀了Dibala时我很担心
<24-3,Chase>It worried me when you joked about letting that man shoot dibala.

410
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,510
<24-4,Cameron>我没有开玩笑
<24-4,Cameron>I wasn't joking.

411
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,720
<24-5,Chase>你不应该想杀任何人
<24-5,Chase>You can't want to kill anyone,

412
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,420
<24-6,Cameron>-特别是你的病人-这么希望很自然...
<24-6,Cameron>-especially not your own patient. -It's only natural to feel he should

413
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,090
<24-7,Chase>不 这样很不正常
<24-7,Chase>no,it's completely unnatural.

414
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,370
<24-7,Chase>只有精神病人才能杀人后不自我崩溃
<24-7,Chase>Only psychopaths can kill other people without ving some sort of breakdown.

415
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,270
<24-8,Cameron>有正当理由时则不是 比如说军人
<24-8,Cameron>Not when it's justified.Look at soldiers.

416
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,360
<24-9,Chase>即使是有正当理由时
<24-9,Chase>Even when it's justified.

417
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,070
<24-10,Cameron>我在害他死吗?
<24-10,Cameron>Am I trying to kill our patient?

418
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,460
<24-10,Cameron>当然没有
<24-10,Cameron>Of course not.

419
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,630
<24-10,Cameron>但如果他死了我要假装这是世界的损失吗?
<24-10,Cameron>But if he died,am I supposed to just pretend that wouldn't be good for the world?

420
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,970
<24-10,Cameron>细胞分化整齐
<24-10,Cameron>The cells are neatly differentiated.

421
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,110
<24-10,Cameron>不是淋巴瘤
<24-10,Cameron>This isn't lymphoma.

422
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,680
<25-1,House>我就说我闻到一股甜到腻的枫糖味还有公费医疗的味道
<25-1,House>thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine.

423
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,840
<25-1,House>闻起来像是
<25-1,House>It smells like.

424
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,550
<25-1,House>胜利的味道
<25-1,House>victory.

425
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,140
<25-1,House>你房间里的大旗促使我和你的清洁工聊了聊
<25-1,House>That big flag in your place prompted me to chat with your housekeeper.

426
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,030
<25-1,House>原来你是北大荒人啊
<25-1,House>Turns out you're a citizen of the great white north.

427
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,490
<25-2,Murphy>你闯入了我家?
<25-2,Murphy>You broke into my apartment?

428
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,800
<25-3,House>严格来说 没有
<25-3,House>Technically,no.

429
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,430
<25-3,House>嗯 严格来说 是 但仅仅两步
<25-3,House>Well,technically,yeah,but two steps.

430
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,720
<25-4,Murphy>-算不上--你得进监狱了
<25-4,Murphy>Hardly-- you're going to jail.

431
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,190
<25-5,House>说到这个你知道你要获刑六个月和十万元罚款吗?
<25-5,House>Speaking of,you know what can get you six months and a $100,000 fine?

432
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,140
<25-5,House>假称自己得过越战勋章
<25-5,House>Falsely claiming that you won a medal in vietnam.

433
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,120
<25-6,Murphy>你觉得我在说谎?
<25-6,Murphy>You think I'm faking?

434
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,760
<25-7,House>加拿大没有往越南派兵 你个笨蛋
<25-7,House>Canada did not send troops to fight in vietnam,you idiot.

435
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,810
<25-8,Murphy>他们派了兵去执行巴黎和约
<25-8,Murphy>They sent troops to reinforce the '73 peace accords,

436
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,440
<25-8,Murphy>在那儿我试图解救一名踩上地雷的十二岁少年
<25-8,Murphy>which is where I tried to free a 12-year-old boy who stepped on a land mine.

437
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,360
<25-8,Murphy>36年之后的每一秒钟
<25-8,Murphy>36 years later,every second,

438
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,990
<25-8,Murphy>我都能感觉到还紧拽着那孩子的胳膊手上传来刺骨的疼痛
<25-8,Murphy>I feel the pain in my hand like I'm still grabbing that boy's arm,

439
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,690
<25-8,Murphy>即使我已经没了胳膊
<25-8,Murphy>even though my arm isn't there.

440
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,580
<25-8,Murphy>所以 我没有撒谎
<25-8,Murphy>So,no,I'm not faking.

441
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,380
<25-9,House>我顶你 加油吧 红枫飘飘
<25-9,House>On a related note,go maple leafs.

442
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,480
<26-4,Chase>有活检结果了吗?
<26-4,Chase>Did you get the biopsy results?

443
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,880
<26-5,Dibala>是淋巴瘤吗?
<26-5,Dibala>Is it lymphoma?

444
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,880
<26-1,Dibala>不是
<26-1,Dibala>No.

445
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,600
<26-2,Chase>那我们就得继续查了
<26-2,Chase>So we have to move on.

446
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,920
<26-3,Dibala>-感染 或许是自体免疫病-有活检结果了吗?
<26-3,Dibala>-Infection,perhaps autoimmune. -Did you get the biopsy results?

447
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,840
<26-4,Chase>是的 我刚告诉你的
<26-4,Chase>Yes,I just told you.

448
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,940
<26-5,Dibala>是淋巴瘤吗?
<26-5,Dibala>Is it lymphoma?

449
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,420
<26-5,Dibala>Cameron和Chase如何?
<26-5,Dibala>Camen and chase?

450
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
<27-1,Thirteen>他们很喜欢诊断
<27-1,Thirteen>They both really like diagnostics,

451
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,320
<27-2,Foreman>我想他们更喜欢看House折磨我
<27-2,Foreman>and I think they both really like watching house torture me.

452
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,520
<27-2,Foreman>无论如何 谢谢你理解我
<27-2,Foreman>Anyway,thank you for understanding about the job.

453
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,110
<27-2,Foreman>我只能两害相权取其轻
<27-2,Foreman>I had two really crappy alternatives.

454
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,530
<27-3,Thirteen>还有第三个选择
<27-3,Thirteen>There was a third.

455
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,150
<27-4,Foreman>是什么?
<27-4,Foreman>What's that?

456
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,680
<27-5,Thirteen>你可以放弃这个职位
<27-5,Thirteen>You could have stepped aside.

457
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,170
<27-6,Foreman>那我们俩都会失业的
<27-6,Foreman>We both would have lost our jobs.

458
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,360
<27-7,Thirteen>你可以让Cameron或Chase取代你当部门领导
<27-7,Thirteen>You could have asked cameron or chase to take your place.

459
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,510
<27-8,Foreman>他们可不乐意
<27-8,Foreman>They wouldn't have wanted to.

460
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,330
<27-9,Thirteen>你不是说他们喜欢诊断吗?
<27-9,Thirteen>You just said they both really like diagnostics.

461
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,600
<27-10,Foreman>你想回去工作?
<27-10,Foreman>You want to go back in time?

462
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,870
<27-11,Thirteen>我想解决问题
<27-11,Thirteen>I want to make this work.

463
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,040
<27-11,Thirteen>我想尽量去理解你
<27-11,Thirteen>I want to understand you.

464
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,640
<27-11,Thirteen>你知道 你上次的决定让我作何感想
<27-11,Thirteen>I mean,you know how you made me feel.

465
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,580
<27-11,Thirteen>如果让你重新选择...
<27-11,Thirteen>If you could do it again...

466
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,090
<27-12,Foreman>我的决定是正确的
<27-12,Foreman>I made the right decision.

467
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,040
<28-1,Joseph>我需要你的专业意见并希望你保密
<28-1,Joseph>I need your confidential medical opinion.

468
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,700
<28-1,Joseph>总统现在能正常思考吗?
<28-1,Joseph>Is the president capable of thinking clearly?

469
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,590
<28-2,Cameron>显然不能 目前来说
<28-2,Cameron>Obviously not,right now.

470
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,230
<28-3,Joseph>那么以后呢?
<28-3,Joseph>Will he ever be?

471
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,000
<28-3,Joseph>我认为...
<28-3,Joseph>I think...

472
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,710
<28-4,Cameron>神经损伤无法复原而且他现在每况愈下
<28-4,Cameron>neurons don't grow back,and he's already ihis clinE.

473
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,490
<28-4,Cameron>所以他说的话 下达的命令
<28-4,Cameron>Anything he tells you,any command he gives,

474
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,770
<28-4,Cameron>也许只是一个病入膏肓的老人的胡言乱语罢了
<28-4,Cameron>how will you ever know it's not just the delusions of a sick,mad,dying old man?

475
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,080
<28-5,Chase>病人发高烧了
<28-5,Chase>He just started spiking a fever.

476
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,510
<29-1,House>是硬皮病
<29-1,House>It's scleroderma.

477
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,020
<29-2,Foreman>你这次不搞花样来揭晓谜底了?
<29-2,Foreman>You don't have some clever way of telling me this time?

478
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,180
<29-3,House>病人快死了
<29-3,House>Patient's dying.

479
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,270
<29-3,House>我不会胡搅了
<29-3,House>I'm done with clever.

480
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,690
<29-3,House>你看他的皮肤
<29-3,House>Look at his skin.

481
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,580
<29-3,House>对75岁的人来说 未免太紧致了
<29-3,House>It's tight for a 75-year-old.

482
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,420
<29-4,Foreman>就凭一张入院照?
<29-4,Foreman>Based on his admission photo?

483
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,690
<29-4,Foreman>太主观了
<29-4,Foreman>Bit subjective.

484
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,420
<29-4,Foreman>高热表明有感染
<29-4,Foreman>Fever points to infection.

485
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,030
<29-4,Foreman>而且他的手指有结节
<29-4,Foreman>And now he's got nodules his fingers.

486
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,080
<29-4,Foreman>是芽生菌病
<29-4,Foreman>That's blastomycosis.

487
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,450
<29-5,House>就凭结节?
<29-5,House>Nodules?

488
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,860
<29-5,House>亏你还说我凭皮肤下结论主观呢
<29-5,House>And you're calling tight skin subjective?

489
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,810
<29-6,Chase>我同意Foreman
<29-6,Chase>I'm with foreman.

490
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,710
<29-6,Chase>如果是硬皮病做头部CT时会发现真菌球
<29-6,Chase>We would have seen fungus balls on the head ct.

491
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,260
<29-7,House>真菌病变可能被忽略了
<29-7,House>Fungal lesions can be missed.

492
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
<29-8,Cameron>我们可以做个检查确认
<29-8,Cameron>we could settle this with a test.

493
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,570
<29-8,Cameron>抗着丝点抗体指向硬皮病
<29-8,Cameron>Anticentromere antibodies would point to scleroderma.

494
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,890
<29-9,Foreman>只是指向 不能证实
<29-9,Foreman>Point to,not prove.

495
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,850
<29-9,Foreman>他的体温太高了
<29-9,Foreman>And his fever's too high.

496
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,930
<29-9,Foreman>必须马上着手治疗
<29-9,Foreman>We have to treat him now.

497
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,350
<29-10,House>如果治疗有误 只会加重病情
<29-10,House>We treat wrong,we could send this disease into overdrive.

498
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,940
<29-10,House>你也同意是硬皮病
<29-10,House>You're with me on the scleroderma.

499
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,850
<29-11,Cameron>是的 但我不关心这人死活
<29-11,Cameron>I guess.I just don't care enough about the patient

500
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,720
<29-11,Cameron>- 也不想费力气去说服任何人- 晓得了
<29-11,Cameron>-to waste my time trying to convince anyone. -We get it.

501
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,830
<29-12,House>你不喜欢这个人你不想插手这个病例
<29-12,House>You don't like the guy,you didn't want to work on this case.

502
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,280
<29-12,House>但你还呆在这里
<29-12,House>And yet you're still here.

503
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,440
<29-12,House>何不立场坚定些
<29-12,House>Why don't you take a stand?

504
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,260
<29-12,House>你要么帮忙 要么给我闭嘴
<29-12,House>Either do something about it or shut up.

505
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,500
<29-13,Cameron>照你说的芽生菌病治好了
<29-13,Cameron>Treat him for blasto if you want.

506
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,900
<29-14,House>我去找Cuddy
<29-14,House>I'll get cuddy.

507
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,450
<29-14,House>- 我可以说服她- 这不是民主选举
<29-14,House>I can convince her-- this isn't a democracy.

508
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,980
<29-14,House>我不管你找谁
<29-14,House>I don't care who you get.

509
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,670
<29-15,Foreman>至少目前为止 这还是我的部门
<29-15,Foreman>At least for right now,this is my department.

510
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,040
<29-15,Foreman>照芽生菌病治疗
<29-15,Foreman>We're treating him for blasto.

511
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,230
<29-15,Foreman>给他注射两性霉素B
<29-15,Foreman>Start him on amphotericin B.

512
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,760
<30-1,Dibala>如果你在我的静脉里注入气泡...
<30-1,Dibala>If you inject my I.V.With an air bubble...

513
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,920
<30-2,Cameron>你想干什么?
<30-2,Cameron>what are you doing?

514
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,580
<30-3,Dibala>会引发我的另一次心脏病
<30-3,Dibala>I will have another heart attack.

515
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,630
<30-3,Dibala>没人能发现
<30-3,Dibala>No one will know.

516
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,890
<30-4,Chase>放开她
<30-4,Chase>Let her go.

517
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,750
<30-5,Dibala>你对我的上校说我是个垂死老人 不能听我的
<30-5,Dibala>You tell my colonel I'm a sick,dying old man who can't be trusted.

518
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
<30-6,Cameron>我没有说...
<30-6,Cameron>I didn't say...

519
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,560
<30-7,Dibala>你先前做的 无异于塞给他一把枪让他架在我脑袋上
<30-7,Dibala>you were trying to put a gun in his hand and point it at my head.

520
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,510
<30-7,Dibala>但现在枪在你的手上
<30-7,Dibala>The gun is now in your hand.

521
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,040
<30-7,Dibala>两者有着本质 而不是道德上的区别
<30-7,Dibala>That is a practical difference,not a moral one.

522
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,750
<30-7,Dibala>如果你想我死 就开枪吧
<30-7,Dibala>If you want me dead,then pull the trigger.

523
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,570
<30-7,Dibala>但要自己动手 可没这么容易了
<30-7,Dibala>It is not so easy when you have to do it yourself.

524
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,270
<30-8,Chase>Allison
<30-8,Chase>Allison.

525
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,690
<30-9,Cameron>我想 我并不想你死
<30-9,Cameron>I guess I didn't want you dead.

526
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,320
<30-10,Chase>如果你敢再碰我妻子我就把你赶出去
<30-10,Chase>You touch my wife again,I'll kick your ass out into the street.

527
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,640
<30-10,Chase>我不管你是什么人
<30-10,Chase>I don't care who you are.

528
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,590
<30-11,Dibala>我帮了她一个忙
<30-11,Dibala>I did her a favor.

529
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,380
<30-11,Dibala>我让她看到了自己的本心
<30-11,Dibala>I showed her her true character.

530
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,410
<30-12,Chase>她人比你好得多
<30-12,Chase>She's a better person than you are.

531
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,610
<30-13,Dibala>她太软弱 无法践行自己的信仰
<30-13,Dibala>She is too weak to act on her beliefs.

532
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,540
<30-13,Dibala>但这不是她的错
<30-13,Dibala>But that is not her fault.

533
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,240
<30-13,Dibala>大部分人如此
<30-13,Dibala>Most everyone is.

534
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,140
<30-13,Dibala>包括我的顾问
<30-13,Dibala>Even my own advisors.

535
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,430
<30-13,Dibala>我的上校
<30-13,Dibala>My own colonel.

536
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,780
<30-13,Dibala>他们只会谈判 磋商 签署协议
<30-13,Dibala>All they do negotiate and debate and sign treaties.

537
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,490
<30-13,Dibala>摆出求和者姿态
<30-13,Dibala>They are appeasers.

538
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:42,990
<30-13,Dibala>- 要知道 我们此刻正被杀手 叛军--- 你指"蟑螂"?(独裁者对少数族裔的称谓)
<30-13,Dibala>And all the while,we are beset by assassins and traitors,the scum-- cockroaches?

539
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,640
<30-14,Chase>你会怎样对待他们?
<30-14,Chase>What are you going to do about them?

540
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,420
<30-15,Dibala>对你来说 敌人意味着什么?
<30-15,Dibala>What is an enemy to you?

541
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,820
<30-15,Dibala>垂涎你职位的年轻医师?
<30-15,Dibala>Some younger physician who covets your office?

542
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,320
<30-15,Dibala>在我的世界里 敌人便意味着威胁 流血和死亡
<30-15,Dibala>In my world,there are dangers and bloodshed and death.

543
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,610
<30-15,Dibala>这让你成长为一个男人
<30-15,Dibala>And that makes you a man.

544
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,590
<30-15,Dibala>男人应该敢于抉择
<30-15,Dibala>And men make choices.

545
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,830
<30-16,Chase>而你的抉择就是派遣一帮酒醉的狂热孩子
<30-16,Chase>And your choe is to send bands of drunk,

546
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,130
<30-16,Chase>去屠杀一整个民族?
<30-16,Chase>crazed children to massacre an entire people?

547
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,110
<30-17,Dibala>如果你不知道答案 就不要提出问题
<30-17,Dibala>Don't ask me questions you don't want to know the answer to.

548
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,380
<30-17,Dibala>我救了你的命
<30-17,Dibala>I saved your life.

549
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,230
<30-18,Dibala>我有权知道你会怎么--
<30-18,Dibala>I deserve to know what you're planning¡ª

550
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,040
<30-18,Dibala>为了保护我的国家 我不惜任何代价
<30-18,Dibala>whatever it takes to protect my country.

551
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,030
<31-1,Wilson>你闯入他家了?
<31-1,Wilson>You broke into his apartment?

552
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,740
<31-2,House>不算闯入
<31-2,House>I didn't break in.

553
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,160
<31-3,Wilson>真希望我能相信你
<31-3,Wilson>I wish I believed you.

554
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,860
<31-4,House>我可以补救
<31-4,House>I can fix this.

555
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,570
<31-5,Wilson>我已经做了
<31-5,Wilson>I already did.

556
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,950
<31-5,Wilson>他本来要去告你
<31-5,Wilson>He was going to press charges.

557
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,170
<31-5,Wilson>但是...
<31-5,Wilson>But...

558
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,150
<31-5,Wilson>我向他保证 你会搬走
<31-5,Wilson>I promised him you'd leave.

559
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,220
<31-6,House>你要赶我走?
<31-6,House>You're kicking me out?

560
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,870
<31-7,Wilson>我会向你的医生解释 但...
<31-7,Wilson>I'll explain it to your psychiatrist,but...

561
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,030
<31-7,Wilson>是的 你得搬到别处去
<31-7,Wilson>yeah.You got to go somewhere else.

562
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,990
<31-7,Wilson>House 我知道一旦捅出漏子你的所谓补救...
<31-7,Wilson>House,I know when things go wrong,usually you just double down

563
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,410
<31-7,Wilson>只会让事情加倍糟糕但这次会把你送进号子
<31-7,Wilson>and get more involved,but here you could go to jail.

564
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:16,540
<31-7,Wilson>我相信 你已经变了很多能够体会到我的良苦用心
<31-7,Wilson>And I truly believe that you've changed enough to know this is the right thing.

565
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,180
<32-1,Cameron>我们得抽个血样
<32-1,Cameron>We need a blood sample.

566
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,900
<32-1,Cameron>给他做抗着丝点抗体测试
<32-1,Cameron>We got to do the antictromere antibody test.

567
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,320
<32-1,Cameron>结果会证明House是对的
<32-1,Cameron>It'll show house is right.

568
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,720
<32-1,Cameron>是硬皮病
<32-1,Cameron>It's scleroderma.

569
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,010
<32-2,Chase>为什么你肯治他了?
<32-2,Chase>Why are you doing this now?

570
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,850
<32-3,Cameron>因为我不想杀死他
<32-3,Cameron>Because I didn't want to kill him.

571
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,720
<32-3,Cameron>你说的对
<32-3,Cameron>And you're right.

572
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,780
<32-3,Cameron>我必须用行动表明立场
<32-3,Cameron>I have to take a side.

573
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,230
<32-3,Cameron>所以我决定尽力挽救他的生命
<32-3,Cameron>So I'm going to do what I can to keep him alive.

574
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,350
<32-4,Chase>我去给你取血样
<32-4,Chase>I'll get you the blood.

575
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,740
<32-4,Chase>抗着丝点抗体测试呈阳性
<32-4,Chase>Positive for anticentromere antibodies.

576
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,830
<33-1,Cameron>我们得停用抗真菌素马上给他上类固醇
<33-1,Cameron>Better get him off the antifungals and onto steroids immediately.

577
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,920
<33-2,Foreman>我说过了 只是指向硬皮病
<33-2,Foreman>I told you before,this only points to scleroderma.

578
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,790
<33-2,Foreman>不能证实
<33-2,Foreman>It doesn't prove it.

579
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,380
<33-3,Chase>你打算忽略测试结果?
<33-3,Chase>You're just gonna ignore the test?

580
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,610
<33-4,Foreman>芽生菌病更为符合
<33-4,Foreman>Blasto still fits best.

581
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,720
<33-4,Foreman>虽然单凭这个无法确诊
<33-4,Foreman>I know it'sot conclusive,

582
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,920
<33-5,Cameron>- 但加上其它的症状--- 我主意已决
<33-5,Cameron>but when you put it with all the other evidence¡ªI've made my decision.

583
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,840
<33-7,Cameron>你告诉13 你开除她是不对的了吗?
<33-7,Cameron>Have you told thirteen you were wrong to fire her?

584
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,510
<33-8,Foreman>现在为什么要说这个?
<33-8,Foreman>What does that have to do with anything?

585
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,120
<33-9,Cameron>我们共事了很长时间我深知你是个理智的人
<33-9,Cameron>I've worked with you long enough to know you're reasonable.

586
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,060
<33-9,Cameron>能勇于承认错误
<33-9,Cameron>You can usually admit when you're wrong.

587
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,420
<33-9,Cameron>但在你内心深处
<33-9,Cameron>But there's some deep part of you,

588
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,650
<33-9,Cameron>一旦发现 你人生至关重要的一个决定是错误的
<33-9,Cameron>that when you find you're wrong about the most important decisions you've made,

589
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,840
<33-9,Cameron>你就会失去安全感 并对其他人筑起防线
<33-9,Cameron>you get insecure and you just retrench.

590
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,900
<33-9,Cameron>你想搞砸你的恋情没问题 这是你的权利
<33-9,Cameron>If you want to mess up your relationship,that's your right,

591
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,460
<33-9,Cameron>但搞砸诊断 我们的病人就会死
<33-9,Cameron>but you mess this up,our patient dies.

592
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,970
<33-10,Foreman>给他换类固醇
<33-10,Foreman>Switch him tsteroids.

593
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,710
<34-1,House>嗨 亲爱的
<34-1,House>Hi,honey.

594
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,630
<34-1,House>你今天过的如何?
<34-1,House>How was your day?

595
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,640
<34-1,House>早安
<34-1,House>Morning.

596
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,350
<34-2,House>首先 是我不好
<34-2,House>First of all,my bad.

597
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,670
<34-2,House>我最近经历了很多事
<34-2,House>I've gone through this whole thing recently.

598
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,880
<34-2,House>我不想闷场
<34-2,House>I don't want to bore you.

599
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,690
<34-2,House>长话短说: 我很想去改变一些东西
<34-2,House>Short version: I'm really trying to work on some stuff.

600
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,420
<34-2,House>这事对我来说是倒退了
<34-2,House>This is a definite setback.

601
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,920
<34-2,House>但公平点吧 你也有部分责任
<34-2,House>Although,in fairness,you really did make it tough.

602
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,500
<34-3,House>你失去的那只手有幻肢痛对吧?(被切除的肢体仍感觉疼痛)
<34-3,House>Phantom pain in your missing arm?

603
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,720
<34-3,House>你药箱里有五种不同的止痛药
<34-3,House>Five different kinds of painkiller in your medicine cabinet.

604
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,690
<34-3,House>你面前的神奇魔术箱就是专治这个的
<34-3,House>That's what this magic box of neurological trickery is for.

605
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,770
<34-4,House>面对一个绑架你的疯子你还是乖乖就范的好
<34-4,House>This would be a lot easier if you do what the crazy guy who tied you up says.

606
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,000
<34-4,House>把手伸进去
<34-4,House>Put your hand in there.

607
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,650
<34-4,House>把手伸进去
<34-4,House>Put your hand in there.

608
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,700
<34-4,House>看看吧
<34-4,House>Now look.

609
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,070
<34-4,House>镜像魔术
<34-4,House>It's mirror magic.

610
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,510
<34-4,House>你的手又回来了
<34-4,House>Your arm is back.

611
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,700
<34-4,House>现在同时握紧两只拳头
<34-4,House>Now clench both your fists at the same time.

612
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
<34-4,House>握紧
<34-4,House>Clench.

613
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,260
<34-4,House>用力握紧
<34-4,House>Real hard.

614
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:23,830
<34-4,House>如果你相信上帝祈祷这能管用吧
<34-4,House>If you believe in god,pray that this is gonna work.

615
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,520
<34-4,House>还可以顺便问问他为什么炸断你的手
<34-4,House>You might also want to ask him why he blew off your arm.

616
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,240
<34-4,House>好了么?
<34-4,House>Ready?

617
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,640
<34-5,Murphy>放开吧
<34-5,Murphy>Now let go.

618
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,500
<34-5,Murphy>噢 上帝啊
<34-5,Murphy>Oh,my god.

619
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,520
<34-5,Murphy>不痛了
<34-5,Murphy>It relaxed.

620
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,100
<34-5,Murphy>36年来 疼痛一直缠绕着我
<34-5,Murphy>For 36 years,I've been in pain.

621
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,400
<34-5,Murphy>现在终于消失了
<34-5,Murphy>And it's finally gone.

622
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,800
<34-5,Murphy>噢 上帝
<34-5,Murphy>Oh,my god.

623
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,730
<34-5,Murphy>谢谢你(镜箱疗法在临床上证实有效)
<34-5,Murphy>Thank you.

624
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,910
<35-1,Cameron>氧浓度下降到88
<35-1,Cameron>O2 sat's down to 88.

625
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,710
<35-2,Chase>进入总支气管
<35-2,Chase>Going through the main stem bronchus.

626
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,560
<35-2,Chase>进入右肺上叶
<35-2,Chase>Into the right upper lobe.

627
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,550
<35-2,Chase>请他们出去
<35-2,Chase>Get them out of here.

628
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,290
<35-3,Joseph>不!
<35-3,Joseph>No!

629
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,250
<35-4,Foreman>没事的
<35-4,Foreman>it's okay

630
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,320
<35-5,Cameron>出血点

631
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,080
<35-6,Chase>灼烧
<35-6,Chase>Cauterizing.

632
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,240
<35-7,Foreman>搞定了?

<35-8,Chase>是的
<35-8,Chase>Yeah.

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,020
<35-9,Foreman>拿电击板来!
<35-9,Foreman>Get the paddles!

635
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,560
<35-10,Chase>重新进入
<35-10,Chase>I'm going back in.

636
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,540
<35-11,Joseph>出什么事了?
<35-11,Joseph>What is happening?

637
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,680
<35-12,Foreman>他的肺部出血不止
<35-12,Foreman>he's bleeding into his lungs.

638
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,310
<35-13,Cameron>充电
<35-13,Cameron>Charging.

639
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,090
<35-14,Chase>另一出血点
<35-14,Chase>Another bleeder.

640
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,140
<35-14,Chase>我能搞定
<35-14,Chase>I can get it.

641
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,330
<35-15,Foreman>慢着
<35-15,Foreman>Hold on.

642
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,930
<35-15,Foreman>还有第三个
<35-15,Foreman>There's a third.

643
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,940
<35-16,Chase>天啊 到处都是
<35-16,Chase>God,there's a dozen.

644
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,760
<35-16,Chase>电击他
<35-16,Chase>Shock him.

645
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,140
<35-17,Cameron>让开
<35-17,Cameron>Clear.

646
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,820
<35-17,Cameron>充电 让开
<35-17,Cameron>charging.Clear.

647
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,630
<36-1,House>你想蜷作一团哭鼻子的话躺椅更舒服一点
<36-1,House>You want to curl up and cry,the lounge chair's a little more comfy.

648
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,080
<36-2,Foreman>我把药换了
<36-2,Foreman>I switched his meds.

649
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,260
<36-2,Foreman>我认为我错了于是停用了抗真菌素
<36-2,Foreman>I thought I was wrong,so I took him off the antifungals.

650
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,640
<36-2,Foreman>照你说的 给他上类固醇
<36-2,Foreman>Put him on steroids like you said.

651
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,980
<36-3,House>你知道这意味着什么
<36-3,House>You know what that means.

652
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,050
<36-4,Foreman>我改变主意得太晚
<36-4,Foreman>I was too late.

653
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,400
<36-4,Foreman>或者我一开始才是对的
<36-4,Foreman>Or I was right in the first place.

654
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:09,600
<36-5,House>那么说 你要么是因为对自己的诊断缺乏自信 害死了病人
<36-5,House>So either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion,

655
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,080
<36-5,House>要么是因为过分固执己见而害死了他
<36-5,House>or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion.

656
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,140
<36-5,House>如果你和我一样的话--顺说 的确有几分--
<36-5,House>If you're anything like me-- and,by the way,you are--

657
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,840
<36-5,House>你必须找出真相
<36-5,House>you need to know which.

658
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,570
<36-6,Foreman>他的尸体锁在太平间
<36-6,Foreman>He's under lock and key in the morgue.

659
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,570
<36-6,Foreman>他的政府要让自己的医生做尸检
<36-6,Foreman>His government wants their own doctors to do the autopsy.

660
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,990
<36-6,Foreman>他们明天就会把他运走
<36-6,Foreman>They're taking his body out tomorrow.

661
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,420
<36-7,House>我聘用你的其中一个原因
<36-7,House>There's a reason I hired you.

662
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,710
<36-7,House>就是你知道怎么跟锁头打交道
<36-7,House>You used to know what to do with a locked door.

663
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,940
<37-1,Foreman>我去了趟太平间想重做抗体检测
<37-1,Foreman>I went down to the morgue to rerun the antibodies test.

664
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,180
<37-2,Chase>我们做了两遍
<37-2,Chase>We ran it twice.

665
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,450
<37-3,Foreman>但我进不去
<37-3,Foreman>Turns out I couldn't get in.

666
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,480
<37-3,Foreman>荷枪实弹的警卫看守着
<37-3,Foreman>They had an armed guard.

667
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,690
<37-3,Foreman>但我看到了这个
<37-3,Foreman>But I saw this.

668
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,550
<37-3,Foreman>进入太平间的登记
<37-3,Foreman>It's a sign-in sheet from the morgue.

669
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
<37-3,Foreman>上面有你的签名
<37-3,Foreman>Your signature.

670
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,250
<37-3,Foreman>今早9:45
<37-3,Foreman>9:45 this morning.

671
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,010
<37-3,Foreman>正好是你们做检测之前
<37-3,Foreman>That's right before you guys ran the test.

672
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,670
<37-3,Foreman>你去那里干什么?
<37-3,Foreman>What were you doing there?

673
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,060
<37-4,Chase>跟进一个门诊病例
<37-4,Chase>Follow-up on a clinic case.

674
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,400
<37-5,Foreman>什么病例?
<37-5,Foreman>What case?

675
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,570
<37-6,Chase>你真觉得这重要吗--
<37-6,Chase>You think this is really important¡ª

676
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:21,190
<37-7,Foreman>太平间其中一个病人是死于硬皮病的70岁老妇
<37-7,Foreman>one of the patients in the morgue was a 70-year-old woman who had scleroderma.

677
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,580
<37-7,Foreman>如果你和Cameron取的是这位老妇的血样
<37-7,Foreman>You and cameron,if you took that woman's blood,

678
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,580
<37-7,Foreman>你们就能伪造检测结果导致我们采用错误疗法
<37-7,Foreman>you could have messed up the test results so we treated dibala for the wrong disease.

679
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,030
<37-8,Chase>Cameron和这事无关
<37-8,Chase>Cameron had nothing to do with it.

680
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,210
<37-9,Foreman>你这个混蛋
<37-9,Foreman>You son of a bitch.

681
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:40,030
<37-10,Chase>他要屠杀Sitibi人
<37-10,Chase>He was going to kill the sitibi.

682
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,220
<37-10,Chase>把他们赶尽杀绝
<37-10,Chase>Every last one of them.

683
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,400
<37-11,Foreman>我不管他要干什么
<37-11,Foreman>I don't care what he was going to do.

684
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,500
<37-11,Foreman>我只知道 他把性命交到了我们手上
<37-11,Foreman>He came to us and put his life in our hands.

685
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,540
<37-12,Chase>我们做的所有好事...
<37-12,Chase>All the good we've done...

686
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,210
<37-12,Chase>拯救的每一条生命...
<37-12,Chase>every life we've saved...

687
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:58,070
<37-12,Chase>如果他康复出院 死于他手的万千亡魂将会让从前的善举变得毫无意义
<37-12,Chase>it would have meant nothing if we just sent him off to kill hundreds of thousands of people.

688
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,190
<37-12,Chase>新闻上说了
<37-12,Chase>Look at the news.

689
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,130
<37-12,Chase>温和派力量开始占上风
<37-12,Chase>The moderates are taking over.
