<2-4,House>是，我想知道
<2-4,House>Yes. I would like to know,why she gets a secretary and I don't.

37
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,590
<2-5,James>我是她的助手，不是她的秘书,我是从Rutgers毕业的
<2-5,James>I'm her assistant, not her secretary.I graduated from Rutgers.

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,450
<2-6,House>嗯，我不知道他们有秘书学校
<2-6,House>Hmm. I didn't know,they had a secretarial school.

<2-6,House>''ka-ching''这个字对你有意义吗？,我要进去了
<2-6,House>Does the word ''ka-ching'',mean anything to you? I'm going in now.

<2-8,House>干嘛雇个男秘书？,JDate不称职吗？
<2-8,House>What's with hiring a male secretary?JDate not working out?

43
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,110
<2-9,Stacy>他挺可爱，小心点
<2-9,Stacy>He is cute. Be careful.

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,940
<2-10,House>她不象你，无法走进酒吧20分钟,就找到灵魂伴侣
<2-10,House>She's not like you.She can't just walk into a bar and,pick up her soul mate in twenty minutes.

45
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,610
<2-11,Stacy>我跟马克在一个募捐会遇上的，结果……
<2-11,Stacy>I met Mark at a fundraiser,that happened to be held at a...

<2-12,House>你跟我是在一个脱衣舞俱乐部认识的

<2-13,Stacy>你是我花的最不值的20块钱
<2-13,Stacy>You were the worst,two dollars I ever spent.

48
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,620
<2-13,Stacy>我们回头见
<2-13,Stacy>We'll catch up later.

00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,220
<2-14,Cuddy>史戴西，是豪斯，我知道你能应付
<2-14,Cuddy>Stacy, it's House.I know you can handle it.

50
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,640
<2-15,Stacy>没什么好应付的，显然他想跟你单谈
<2-15,Stacy>Nothing to handle. It's obvious,he wants to talk to you alone.

51
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,120
<2-16,Cuddy>如果你跟史戴西一起工作有问题,你该早说
<2-16,Cuddy>If you have a problem working,with Stacy you should have said so.

52
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,740
<2-17,House>我能干什么?
<2-17,House>What was I supposed to do?

53
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,470
<2-17,House>让她走？那很粗鲁
<2-17,House>Ask her to leave?That's just rude.

54
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,620
<2-17,House>死囚，我要那个病例
<2-17,House>Death row guy.I want the case.

55
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,180
<2-18,Cuddy>你怎么知道的?
<2-18,Cuddy>How do you even know about him?

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,050
<2-18,Cuddy>你没有医院主机的准入
<2-18,Cuddy>You don't have access,to the hospital's mainframe.

57
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,890
<2-19,House>对，可“舞裤”有
<2-19,House>No, but ''partypants'' does.

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,580
<2-20,Cuddy>你偷我的密码?
<2-20,Cuddy>You stole my password?

59
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,680
<2-21,House>不能算是偷，因为过于显而易见了
<2-21,House>Hardly counts as stealing;,it's a pretty obvious choice.

60
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,810
<2-22,Cuddy>我把死囚病例给了努洛医生
<2-22,Cuddy>Well, I have already assigned,Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.

61
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,250
<2-23,House>努洛？我不想说其他医生的坏话
<2-23,House>Nolo? Well, I don't want to say,anything bad about another doctor,

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,270
<2-23,House>尤其是个没用的醉鬼...
<2-23,House>especially a useless drunk...

63
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,000
<2-24,Cuddy>你止疼药成瘾
<2-24,Cuddy>You are addicted to pain pills.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,760
<2-25,House>但我不是没用，告诉努洛医生我接手了
<2-25,House>But I'm not useless.Tell Nolo I'm talking over.

65
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,150
<2-26,Cuddy>努洛医生是合格的心脏病专家
<2-26,Cuddy>Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,040
<2-27,House>哦，好啊，我肯定他会罗列普遍病因来解释,为什么这个家伙的心脏只泵气不泵血
<2-27,House>Oh, good. I'm sure he'll explore all the usual,options for why a guy's heart starts beating,so fast it pumps out air instead of blood.

67
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,010
<2-27,House>等等，没有普遍病因
<2-27,House>Wait a second...there are no usual options!

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,770
<2-28,Cuddy>你有多想要这个病例?
<2-28,Cuddy>How badly do you want this?

<2-29,House>I will give you,two more clinic hours this week.

70
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
<2-30,Cuddy>别太卖力了
<2-30,Cuddy>Don't bend over for the soap.

71
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,940
<3-1,Cameron>只是心脏，还是病人有其他抱怨?
<3-1,Cameron>Cameron: Just the heart, or,the patient have any other complaints?

72
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,920
<3-2,House>病人不跟任何人说话

<3-6,House>她让我去Mercer州立监狱的死牢，,我不知道
<3-6,House>She's got me going to,Mercer State Prison,Capital Sentences unit, I don't know.

78
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,150
<3-7,Foreman>没有浪费我们时间更好的途径了吗？
<3-7,Foreman>Aren't there better ways,to spend our time?

<3-10,House>肯定不是好人，可他没杀人啊
<3-10,House>Certainly not a good guy,but he didn't kill anybody.

85
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,670
<3-10,House>或许可以给抗生素，但不给核磁共振,你说呢?
<3-10,House>Maybe he can get antibiotics,but no MRIs. What about you?

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,020
<3-10,House>你拒绝给偷车贼什么医疗救助?
<3-10,House>What medical care should you,be denied for being a car thief?

<4-3,Warden>Too dangerous to,house him in the infirmary.

<6-1,Wilson>Wilson:,Did you redo the x-ray?

116
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,650
<6-2,Cameron>两次
<6-2,Cameron>Twice.

117
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,260
<6-3,Wilson>你不需要我督导
<6-3,Wilson>Well, you don't need a consult.

118
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,920
<6-3,Wilson>你知道诊断
<6-3,Wilson>You know the diagnosis.

119
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,330
<6-4,Cameron>她不过是咳嗽而已
<6-4,Cameron>All she has is a cough.

120
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,980
<7-1,House>指甲和嘴唇青紫，他缺氧
<7-1,House>Bluish tinge to the fingernails,lips... he's hypoxic.

121
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,300
<7-2,Warden>什么意思?
<7-2,Warden>What's that mean?

122
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,220
<7-3,House>他氧气不足
<7-3,House>He's not getting enough oxygen.

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,020
<7-3,House>你知道人们都说人没爱不能活?
<7-3,House>You know how people say,you can't live without love?

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,880
<7-3,House>氧气比那还重要
<7-3,House>Well, oxygen's,even more important.

125
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,160
<7-3,House>他肺部有积水，呼吸频率50...
<7-3,House>He's got fluid in his lungs,breathing rate of 50...

126
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,040
<7-3,House>他需要插肺管接呼吸机
<7-3,House>he needs to be intubated,and put on a respirator.

127
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,440
<7-4,Warden>没有呼吸机
<7-4,Warden>Don't have a respirator.

128
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,560
<7-5,House>一小时内接上，不然他死定了
<7-5,House>Better get one in about an hour,or you're gonna lose him.

129
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,230
<7-6,Warden>我会写申请的
<7-6,Warden>I'll make out a requisition.

130
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,070
<7-6,Warden>州政府已核准了他的死刑
<7-6,Warden>The state's already,sentenced this man to die.

131
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,900
<7-7,House>我觉得州政府会在意他的死法
<7-7,House>I think the state was,a tad more specific about ''how''.

132
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,750
<7-7,House>这是豪斯医生
<7-7,House>[on the phone],This is Dr. Gregory House.

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,680
<7-7,House>我需要一辆到Mercer州立监狱的救护车
<7-7,House>I need an ambulance to pick-up,at Mercer State Prison.

134
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,380
<7-8,Warden>没用的电话,我的人会在大门拦住他们
<7-8,Warden>Wasted call, my men,will stop them at the gate.

135
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,870
<7-8,Warden>一个死囚休想离开我的监狱
<7-8,Warden>No way a Death Row inmate,leaves my prison,

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,960
<7-8,Warden>至少不是从前门
<7-8,Warden>least not through the front doors.

137
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,390
<8-1,House>你干的挺快
<8-1,House>You work fast.

138
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,660
<8-2,Stacy>你也是
<8-2,Stacy>So do you.

139
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,810
<8-3,House>- 奇怪吗?- 对
<8-3,House>- Is that a shock?- Yeah.

140
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,730
<8-4,Stacy>容易，我曾说服我的职员找马法官
<8-4,Stacy>It was easy.Once I convinced the clerk,to take it to Judge Markem,

141
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,450
<8-4,Stacy>她是8项改善议案的受骗者
<8-4,Stacy>she's a sucker for,Eight Amendment arguments.

142
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,250
<8-5,House>别说了，我都有点兴奋了
<8-5,House>Stop, I'm getting turned on.

143
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,390
<8-6,Cuddy>豪斯
<8-6,Cuddy>House!

144
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,200
<8-7,House>只是顾问一下?
<8-7,House>Ruh-row!

146
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,590
<8-8,Cuddy>你指望我们为这家伙关闭正层楼么?
<8-8,Cuddy>You expect us to shut down,an entire floor for this guy?

147
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,980
<8-9,House>你做头了吗?
<8-9,House>Did you do something to your hair?

148
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,020
<8-10,Cuddy>史戴西?
<8-10,Cuddy>Stacy?

149
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,260
<8-11,Stacy>你说你已经搞定她了...
<8-11,Stacy>You said you cleared with her...

150
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,200
<8-12,House>拜托，你认识我多久了,还搞不清我什么时候在搞笑?
<8-12,House>Come on. You've known me,how long and still you can't tell,when I'm joshin' ya?

151
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,810
<8-13,Cuddy>把他送回监狱，现在
<8-13,Cuddy>Take him back to prison. Now.

152
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,540
<8-14,House>不行，讽刺的说，我现在已经被,你律师申请的法庭令给绑住了
<8-14,House>No, can't. Ironically,I'm bound by this court order,which your ace attorney got.

153
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,780
<8-14,House>我希望在把他运回去受死前,使他有好转
<8-14,House>I have to make him all better,before shipping him back,for the state to kill him.

154
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,940
<8-14,House>是我的原因，还是就是很怪异？
<8-14,House>Is it just me,or is that weird?

155
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,440
<8-14,House>无论如何，我们走路了
<8-14,House>Anyway, we're walking.

156
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,420
<9-1,House>有人把这个放我椅子上了
<9-1,House>Somebody left this on my chair.

157
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,850
<9-1,House>很聪明，因为这强迫我要么看病例,要么永远也别坐下
<9-1,House>It's clever. 'Cause it forces me,to either deal with the file,or never sit down again.

158
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,780
<9-2,Cameron>柯辛蒂，我跟他说你会见她
<9-2,Cameron>Cindy Kramer.I told her you'd see her.

159
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,980
<9-3,House>你不该那么告诉她
<9-3,House>You shouldn't have told her that.

160
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,090
<9-3,House>她得来硬鳞片细胞肺癌，顶多活6个月
<9-3,House>She's got metastatic squamous,cell lung cancer, six months, tops.

161
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,840
<9-4,Cameron>你都不看x光片吗?
<9-4,Cameron>Have you even looked at the x-ray?

162
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,860
<9-5,House>不，乱猜的，一个新游戏
<9-5,House>No, just guessing.It's a new game.

163
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,710
<9-5,House>如果错了，她就是个填充熊
<9-5,House>If it's wrong,she gets a stuffed bear.

164
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,050
<9-6,Cameron>X光片上的一点污迹并不非得是晚期啊
<9-6,Cameron>A spot on a x-ray doesn't,necessarily mean that she's terminal.

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
<9-7,House>我爱孩子，如此充满希望
<9-7,House>I love children.So filled with hope.

166
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
<9-8,Cameron>可能是肺炎，可能是增生
<9-8,Cameron>It could be pneumonia.It could be sarcodosis.

167
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,820
<9-9,House>如果不是她的另一个肺,有淋巴节肿大，可能
<9-9,House>Could be, if she didn't already have,swollen hilar lymph nodes,on the other lung.

168
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,510
<9-10,Cameron>难道我们不能,集体讨论另一个方案吗?
<9-10,Cameron>Could we at least,brainstorm for other ideas?

169
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,540
<9-10,Cameron>谢谢你
<9-10,Cameron>Thank you.

170
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,500
<9-10,Cameron>我仍希望是肺炎、增生
<9-10,Cameron>I still think it could be,pneumonia and sarcodosis,

171
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,300
<9-10,Cameron>但也需要排除肺结核
<9-10,Cameron>but we should,check for tuberculosis

172
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,730
<9-10,Cameron>也要排除心脏充血失败的可能
<9-10,Cameron>and definitely rule out,congestive heart failure.

173
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,500
<9-10,Cameron>五个死亡步骤
<9-10,Cameron>The five stages of dying.

174
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,560
<9-11,House>没错，我个人会认为这是年幼者的废话
<9-11,House>Exactly. Personally, I think,it's all just new-age crap,

175
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,990
<9-11,House>但见你热泪盈眶,小狗般无辜眼神
<9-11,House>but from your tear-filled,puppy-dog eyes

176
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,530
<9-11,House>我觉得我已经说的够了
<9-11,House>I think I've made my point.

177
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,580
<9-11,House>现在去告诉辛蒂，不管她叫什么,她快死了
<9-11,House>Now go tell Cindy,Whatever-her-name-is that she's dying.

178
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,870
<9-11,House>心动过速，肺水肿，疑似？
<9-11,House>Tachycardia,pulmonary edema, likely suspects?

179
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,620
<9-12,Cameron>死囚?
<9-12,Cameron>The Death Row guy?

180
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,370
<9-12,Cameron>你替代辛蒂病例的就是这个?
<9-12,Cameron>That's who you're working on,instead of Cindy?

181
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,650
<9-13,House>上帝，我得学着不随便动粗
<9-13,House>God, I've got to learn,not to beat around the bush.

182
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,650
<9-13,House>说到死，我的意思是无论我们做什么
<9-13,House>By dying, I mean,no matter what we do.

183
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,610
<9-13,House>很快，她就会死
<9-13,House>Very, very soon,she is going to be dead.

184
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,110
<9-13,House>还不够清楚吗?
<9-13,House>Is it still to subtle?

185
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,840
<9-14,Cameron>我发过誓不伤害
<9-14,Cameron>I took an oath to do no harm.

186
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,850
<9-15,House>对，可不是有人逼你签的
<9-15,House>Yeah, well, it's not like,they make you sign it or anything.

187
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,470
<9-16,Cameron>我们治好你的病人，他回去接受死刑
<9-16,Cameron>We cure your patient,he goes back to Death Row.

188
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
<9-16,Cameron>他回去死牢，他们要杀他
<9-16,Cameron>He goes back to,Death Row, they kill him!

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,060
<9-17,House>他呆在这，我们不给他治,他死了
<9-17,House>He stays here and,we don't treat him, he dies,

190
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,020
<9-17,House>我还是不给辛蒂什么的治
<9-17,House>and I still don't treat,Cindy Lou-Who.

191
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,480
<9-18,Foreman>我们可以继续这个了吗?
<9-18,Foreman>Can we get on with this?

192
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,070
<9-19,House>行，我就知道我能指望上你的支持
<9-19,House>Yeah, I knew I could count,on your help for your homie.

193
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,260
<9-20,Foreman>没错，我是黑人
<9-20,Foreman>Exactly, I'm black.

194
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,210
<9-20,Foreman>我同情由男人带大的城里人
<9-20,Foreman>I sympathize for guys,who grew up in the city,kept down by the man.

196
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,820
<9-21,House>有道理
<9-21,House>Makes sense to me.

197
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,020
<9-22,Foreman>都是废话,你不能因为自己杀人就怨社会
<9-22,Foreman>It's a bunch of crap.You can't blame society for the fact,that you chose to become a killer.

198
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,520
<9-22,Foreman>那家伙可能是海洛因成瘾,导致心动过速和肺水肿
<9-22,Foreman>The  guy's probably a heroin addict,which explains the tachycardia,which caused the pulmonary edema.

199
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,490
<9-23,Chase>一个死囚怎么能搞到海洛因?
<9-23,Chase>How does an inmate on Death Row,get his hands on heroin?

200
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,860
<9-24,Foreman>你说真的吗?
<9-24,Foreman>Are you serious?

201
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,290
<9-25,House>这人了解监狱
<9-25,House>The man knows prisons.

202
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,820
<9-25,House>等我们有游艇问题时会找你的
<9-25,House>When we've got a yachting question, we'll come to you.

203
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,360
<9-25,House>好，毒品，检验他的头发,血液，尿，操作
<9-25,House>Okay, drugs it is. Test his hair,blood, and urine, the works.

204
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,200
<10-1,Cameron>谢谢你们的支持
<10-1,Cameron>Thanks for getting my back.

205
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,400
<10-1,Cameron>我以为你们这些神学院的小子反对死刑呢
<10-1,Cameron>I thought you seminary boys,were against the death penalty.

206
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,950
<10-2,Chase>我离开神学院了
<10-2,Chase>I left the seminary.

207
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,080
<10-3,Cameron>以反对他们的最高刑罚?
<10-3,Cameron>Over their stance,on capital punishment?

208
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,030
<10-4,Chase>理论上我反对死刑
<10-4,Chase>I'm against,the death penalty in principle.

209
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,080
<10-4,Chase>但实际上，看杀人犯被处决给我带来的困扰,比我老板给我的要少
<10-4,Chase>In practice, however,watching a murder die causes me,a lot less grief than annoying my boss.

210
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,000
<10-5,Guard>你们进去前我们要检查
<10-5,Guard>Guard: We gotta,check you out before you go in.

211
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,980
<11-1,Cameron>司法部的调查证实量刑有人种依据
<11-1,Cameron>Department of Justice statistics,show that it's a racially,motivated form of punishment.

212
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,610
<11-1,Cameron>黑人被判死刑的几率比白人高10倍
<11-1,Cameron>Black defendants are,ten times more likely to get,a death sentence than whites.

213
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,620
<11-2,Foreman>那也不表示我们就得放弃死刑，对吧?
<11-2,Foreman>Doesn't mean we need to,get rid of the death penalty, do we?

214
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,020
<11-2,Foreman>我们只需要多杀白人就是了
<11-2,Foreman>It just means we need,to kill more white people.

215
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,300
<11-2,Foreman>没事的，你在医院,我们在照顾你
<11-2,Foreman>It's okay, you're in a hospital,we're taking care of you.

216
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,700
<11-2,Foreman>冷静，你将被注射两毫克的Atvan
<11-2,Foreman>Chase:,Stay calm, you're gonna be...push two milligrams Atvan!

217
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,280
<11-3,Clarence>水……
<11-3,Clarence>Water... water.

218
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,120
<12-1,House>口渴的细分是什么？
<12-1,House>What's the differential,for being thirsty?

219
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,000
<12-2,Chase>他有点脱水和失神
<12-2,Chase>He was just a little dehydrated,and out of his mind.

220
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,760
<12-2,Chase>我们给他吊了盐水，现在没事了
<12-2,Chase>We upped his saline drip,he's fine now.

221
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,170
<12-3,Foreman>血，尿检验结果返回没问题，,系统无鸦片痕迹
<12-3,Foreman>Blood and urine tests came back clean,no sign of opiates in his system.

222
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,140
<12-4,House>别那样做
<12-4,House>Don't do that.

223
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,440
<12-5,Cameron>怎么你有解释躯体,毒物反应阴性的豪斯理论吗?
<12-5,Cameron>What, you have some,House theory explaining,heroin use despite a negative test?

224
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,510
<12-6,House>没
<12-6,House>Nope.

225
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,290
<12-6,House>只是该是我往板上写
<12-6,House>Only I get to write on the board.

226
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,850
<12-6,House>那么不是毒品
<12-6,House>So it's not drugs.

227
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
<12-6,House>还有什么能导致心脏跑风?
<12-6,House>What else can cause,the heart to do wind sprints?

228
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,550
<12-6,House>血样检测返回了，有...
<12-6,House>Got the blood work back, any...

229
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,070
<12-6,House>不正常吗?
<12-6,House>...thing out of the ordinary?

230
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,530
<12-7,Chase>他的bi-carb低
<12-7,Chase>His bi-carb is low.

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
<12-8,House>对，但是哪一柱?
<12-8,House>Yeah, but which column?

232
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,930
<12-8,House>是心动过速的结果还是成因？
<12-8,House>Could be the result of the tachycardia,could be the cause?

233
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,750
<12-9,Cameron>是成因
<12-9,Cameron>It's the cause.

234
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,230
<12-10,House>为什么，因为你希望如此?
<12-10,House>Why, because you want it to be?

235
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,130
<12-10,House>让我们看看这个对你,另一个病人有什么帮助？
<12-10,House>Let's see how well that works,with your other patient.

236
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,480
<12-11,Cameron>我们在玩文字游戏
<12-11,Cameron>We're just talking semantics here.

237
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,840
<12-11,Cameron>我们该给他吊水然后送回去
<12-11,Cameron>We should put him,on a bi-carb drip and send him back.

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,730
<12-12,House>对，给他记数
<12-12,House>Right, buff his numbers.

239
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,010
<12-12,House>不必担心深层理由
<12-12,House>Don't bother trying to,figure out the underlying cause.

240
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,810
<12-12,House>我以为你关心病人
<12-12,House>I thought you cared about patients.

241
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,500
<12-13,Foreman>我们的工作不是确保他能抱孙子
<12-13,Foreman>Foreman:,Our job isn't to make sure,he can bounce his grandkids on his lap,

242
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,700
<12-13,Foreman>只是让他健康地回去受死
<12-13,Foreman>our job is to get him healthy enough,to go back to Death Row.

243
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,920
<12-13,Foreman>我们是要给他诊断
<12-13,Foreman>Our job is to diagnose him.

244
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,220
<12-13,Foreman>怎么了?
<12-13,Foreman>What?

245
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,070
<12-14,House>妈妈和爸爸吵架,不等于我们不再爱你们了
<12-14,House>Mommy and Daddy are having a little fight,it doesn't mean we stop loving you.

246
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,680
<12-14,House>现在，出去表演吧
<12-14,House>Now, go outside and play.

247
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,450
<12-14,House>给爸爸拿烟和血液雾化检验结果回来
<12-14,House>Get Daddy some smokes,and an arterial blood gas test.

248
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,350
<12-14,House>哇，真有进步
<12-14,House>Wow. That was impressive.

249
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,590
<12-14,House>好吧，我现在想的是什么数字?
<12-14,House>Okay, what number am I thinking of?

250
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,410
<12-15,Stacy>你是想害我丢饭碗吗?
<12-15,Stacy>Were you trying to get me fired?

251
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,990
<12-15,Stacy>如果你不想让我在这工作,干嘛不直说呢?
<12-15,Stacy>If you didn't want me working here,why didn't you just say so?

252
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,000
<12-16,House>我只是不想你在这工作，我的办公室
<12-16,House>I just don't want you,working here, in my office.

253
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,950
<12-16,House>楼里其他地方没事
<12-16,House>But anywhere else,in the building is fine.

254
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,680
<12-17,Stacy>- 这是个大医院,- 我是律师，你是混蛋
<12-17,Stacy>- It's a big hospital.- I'm a lawyer. You're a jerk.

255
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,890
<12-17,Stacy>彼此重叠
<12-17,Stacy>There's gonna to be some overlap.

256
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,540
<12-18,House>上帝，我希望那是个委婉的说法
<12-18,House>God, I hope that was a euphemism.

257
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,160
<12-19,Stacy>小地方让我不爽
<12-19,Stacy>Cuddy just reamed me.

258
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,550
<12-20,House>- 我希望能懂你意思,- 信任你
<12-20,House>- I hope that one means,what I think it means.- For trusting you!

259
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,710
<12-21,Stacy>她雇我时觉得她至少,找了个你不会上下其手的人
<12-21,Stacy>She figured when she hired me,she'd at least have someone,you couldn't walk all over.

260
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,930
<12-22,House>顺便说，数字是6
<12-22,House>The number was six,by the way.

261
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,620
<12-23,Stacy>我需要知道，我是否可以信任你?
<12-23,Stacy>I need to know,can I trust you?

262
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,390
<12-24,House>如果我不就卡蒂的事撒谎
<12-24,House>If I hadn't lied to you,about Cuddy's approval,

263
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,300
<12-24,House>我的病人会死
<12-24,House>my patient would be dead.

264
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,080
<12-24,House>太棒了
<12-24,House>Great.

265
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,620
<12-25,Stacy>现在我了解了,现在我们可以在一起工作了
<12-25,Stacy>Now I know.Now we can work together.

266
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,610
<13-1,Foreman>我要从你的股动脉抽一些血
<13-1,Foreman>I'm drawing some blood,from your femoral artery.

267
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,130
<13-3,Foreman>- 我的什么?- 经过你的腹股沟
<13-3,Foreman>- From my what?- Runs through your groin.

268
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,270
<13-4,Clarence>你以为你就拿那个戳进我的宝贝里吗?
<13-4,Clarence>You think you're gonna stick me,in the jewels with that?

269
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,830
<13-5,Foreman>非常靠近你的大腿
<13-5,Foreman>It's really closer to your thigh.

270
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,220
<13-5,Foreman>从技术上说，你的宝贝其实是个展示品
<13-5,Foreman>Technically, at this point,it seems like your jewels are,more for display purposes, anyway.

271
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,930
<13-6,Clarence>等等，给我点止疼药什么的
<13-6,Clarence>Hold up, hold up. Give me,some pain killers, or something.

272
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,990
<13-7,Foreman>象你这样的厉害角色不需要
<13-7,Foreman>Tough guy like you don't need 'em.

273
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,070
<13-8,Clarence>算了吧，把我麻翻了吧，伙计
<13-8,Clarence>Forget that, numb me up, man.

274
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,080
<13-8,Clarence>你有社团纹身?让我看看
<13-8,Clarence>You got some gang ink?Let me see that.

275
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,850
<13-9,Foreman>是土生美国人标记,意思是“生命的力量”
<13-9,Foreman>It's a Native American symbol.It means ''the force of life.''

276
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,020
<13-10,Clarence>那就是你告诉这帮白人,让你作医生的理由？
<13-10,Clarence>That's what you tell,all these white dudes,so they let you play doctor?

277
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,630
<13-11,Foreman>没错，把他们都骗了
<13-11,Foreman>Yep. Got 'em all fooled.

278
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,390
<13-12,Clarence>说真的，怎么一个象你这样的,黑帮能穿白大褂？
<13-12,Clarence>For real, how a brother like you go,from gang-banger to wearing a white coat?

279
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,090
<13-13,Foreman>一个象你这样的人又是怎么,把一个爱的女人头骨都凿进去了呢?
<13-13,Foreman>How's a guy like you go,from loving a woman,to punching her skull in?

280
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,480
<13-14,Clarence>那婊子出轨
<13-14,Clarence>Bitch stepped out.

281
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,920
<13-14,Clarence>Argh!
<13-14,Clarence>Argh!

282
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,860
<13-15,Foreman>很抱歉，看来我用的利多卡因不够
<13-15,Foreman>Sorry about that.Guess I didn't use enough lidocaine.

283
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,690
<14-1,Foreman>血液雾化指标出来了,pH值7.28，减量HCO3
<14-1,Foreman>Blood gas came back with,a pH of 7.28 and decreased HCO3.

284
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,310
<14-2,House>可以说明两件事
<14-2,House>Which means two things.

285
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,100
<14-2,House>最重要的，卡麦伦关于,bi-carb的说法错了
<14-2,House>Most importantly,Cameron was wrong about the bi-carb,

286
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,630
<14-2,House>稍轻的，我们有新症状了
<14-2,House>and less significantly,we have a new symptom.

287
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,360
<14-2,House>阴离子酸毒症
<14-2,House>Anion gap acidosis.

288
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,210
<14-2,House>谁胖? 来啊，,假装喜欢小狗
<14-2,House>Who's chubby? Come on,pretend he loves puppies.

289
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,950
<14-2,House>假装是人类，你们有什么?
<14-2,House>Pretend he's a human being.What've you got?

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,970
<14-3,Foreman>我觉得要重新考虑毒品
<14-3,Foreman>I think we should,reconsider drugs.

291
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,990
<14-4,Chase>已经测试阴性了
<14-4,Chase>He already tested negative.

292
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,610
<14-5,Foreman>所以我说重新考虑
<14-5,Foreman>That's why I said reconsider.

293
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,080
<14-5,Foreman>在少管所，我砍牛至当大麻卖
<14-5,Foreman>Back in juvie, I cut up,oregano and sold it as pot.

294
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,510
<14-6,Chase>你就是那么进医学院的吗?
<14-6,Chase>Is that how you put yourself,through med school?

295
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,210
<14-7,Foreman>如果卡麦伦说是海洛因，而其实是其他的?
<14-7,Foreman>What if Clarence thought,he was taking heroin,but it was something else?

296
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,850
<14-8,House>什么其他的能导致酸毒症?
<14-8,House>What ''something else'' could,lead to anion gap acidosis?

297
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,100
<14-9,Chase>Mudpiles.
<14-9,Chase>Mudpiles.

298
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,860
<14-10,House>嗯，你不需要申请
<14-10,House>Well,  you don't have to ask.

299
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,670
<14-10,House>回来前洗手就行了
<14-10,House>Just wash your hands,before you come back.

300

<14-11,Chase>甲醇，尿毒症，糖尿病...
<14-11,Chase>Methanol, uremia, diabetes...

<14-12,House>哇，那是记忆术，有道理
<14-12,House>Oh, it's a mnemonic.That makes sense, too.

302
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,700
<14-13,Cameron>三聚乙醛，乳酸，异烟肼...
<14-13,Cameron>Paraldehyde,INH, lactic acid...

303
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,970
<14-14,House>- 绕圈,- 异烟肼?
<14-14,House>- Rewind.- INH?

304
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,250
<14-16,House>没准
<14-16,House>Yahtzee!

305
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,520
<14-17,Foreman>治肺结核的药
<14-17,Foreman>Drugs for tuberculosis.

306

<14-18,Chase>1/4的监狱人口感染结核病
<14-18,Chase>Nearly a quarter of the prison,populationis infected with TB.

307
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,720
<14-19,House>向福满一样的聪明人把症状归入了海洛因
<14-19,House>Clever entrepreneur like Foreman here,chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.

308
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,250
<14-20,Cameron>异烟肼中毒可以解释所有症状
<14-20,Cameron>INH poisoning would,explain all the symptoms.

309
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,110
<14-21,House>谁愿意把脑袋伸到,监狱克拉伦的秘密藏货点去？
<14-21,House>Who wants to head over to the prison,and find Clarence's secret stash?

310
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,770
<14-23,House>- 好，我来.- 很好，就小蔡吧
<14-23,House>- Fine, I'll do it.- Great, Chase it is.

311
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,130
<14-24,Chase>我推测你糟践我是有理由的吧?
<14-24,Chase>I assume you have,a reason beyond wanting to,make me completely miserable?

312
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,760
<14-25,House>你的嘴更漂亮
<14-25,House>You've got a prettier mouth.

313
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,120
<14-25,House>同屋的人会更愿意向你开放
<14-25,House>Better chance the inmates,will open up to you.

317
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,870
<15-2,Wilson>这男人昏迷了
<15-2,Wilson>The man's in a coma.

318
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,630
<15-3,House>他不在意
<15-3,House>He didn't mind.

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,480
<15-4,Wilson>- 我问过了,- 你用饭盒压住他了
<15-4,Wilson>- I asked.- You're getting crumbs all over him.

320
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,450
<15-5,House>你说到底为什么他们,往昏迷病人屋里放电视?
<15-5,House>Why do you think they put TVs,in coma patients' rooms, anyway?

321
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,370
<15-6,Wilson>有人觉得他们听得见
<15-6,Wilson>Some people think,they can still hear.

322
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,380
<15-7,House>那就放收音机啊
<15-7,House>So leave them a radio.

323
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,050
<15-7,House>他的眼睛闭着，谁会觉得他能看见?
<15-7,House>His eyes are closed;,who thinks he can see?

324
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,520
<15-8,Wilson>你知道为什么人们友善对待他人?
<15-8,Wilson>You know why people,are nice to other people?

325
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,650
<15-9,House>哦，这个我知道，啊..
<15-9,House>Oh, I know this one. Ah...

326
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,470
<15-9,House>因为人们好，正直，关怀
<15-9,House>Because people are,good, decent and caring.

327
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,450
<15-9,House>不是那个，那么人胆小
<15-9,House>Either that, or people are cowards.

328
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,340
<15-9,House>如果我刻薄对你，你也会刻薄对我
<15-9,House>If I'm mean to you,you'll be mean to me.

329
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,500
<15-9,House>彼此毁灭
<15-9,House>Mutually assured destruction.

330
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,040
<15-10,Wilson>没错，你要吃这些薯片吗?
<15-10,Wilson>Exactly. You're gonna eat these chips?

331
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,340
<15-11,House>你要说重点吗?
<15-11,House>You gonna get to your point?

332
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,210
<15-12,Wilson>你需要人喜欢你
<15-12,Wilson>You need people to like you.

333
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,220
<15-13,House>我不在乎别人是否喜欢我
<15-13,House>I don't care if people like me.

334
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,950
<15-12,Wilson>是，但是你需要人喜欢你,因为你需要人
<15-12,Wilson>Yes. But you need people to like you,because you need people.

335
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,070
<15-14,Wilson>除非你认为下次你自己办法庭令
<15-14,Wilson>Unless you think you can get,the next court order yourself.

336
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,670
<15-14,Wilson>如果史戴西不信任你,你就没法用她
<15-14,Wilson>If Stacy can't trust you,you can't use her.

337
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,170
<15-14,Wilson>甚至是比她甩了她丈夫...
<15-14,Wilson>And that's not even dealing,with the greater agenda...

338
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,980
<15-14,Wilson>再次爱上你还重要的议程
<15-14,Wilson>of getting her to dump her husband,and fall in love with you all over again.

339
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,410
<15-15,House>我知道你是她的朋友，但是
<15-15,House>I know you're friends with her, but

340
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,500
<15-15,House>但是有个暗语是,兄弟重于女人，老兄
<15-15,House>there is a code.Bros before hos, man.

343
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,440
<15-15,House>- 废物,- 怎么了?
<15-15,House>[Pager beeps]

344
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
<15-16,Wilson>——废话——这是什么?
<15-16,Wilson>- Crap.- What is it?

345
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,220
<15-17,House>死囚要死了
<15-17,House>Death Row guy is dying.

346
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,500
<15-17,House>[有哔哔声,来自世界各地]
<15-17,House>[There are beeps,coming from all over]

347
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,520
<16-1,Foreman>心搏徐缓，心率掉到30,挺不了多久了
<16-1,Foreman>Bradycardia. His heart rate's,dropped to 30, it's not going,to hold that much longer.

348
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,870
<16-2,House>你是打算就这么拖死他,还是给他阿托品?
<16-2,House>Are you just waiting to call time of death,or are you gonna give him atropine?

349
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,310
<16-3,Foreman>暂时缓解?
<16-3,Foreman>Foreman:,Temporary fix?

350
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,850
<16-4,House>对，不管怎样，这些糖尿病,患者都是靠胰岛素过日子的
<16-4,House>Right. Anyway, those diabetics,are all hung up on insulin.

351
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,140
<16-4,House>再来点无妨
<16-4,House>They're just gonna,have to take more.

352
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,190
<16-5,Foreman>阿托品只能延长几小时而已
<16-5,Foreman>Atropine's only gonna,buy you a few hours!

353
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,180
<16-5,Foreman>我们都还不知道这家伙什么问题呢...
<16-5,Foreman>We don't even know,what's wrong with this guy...

354
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,870
<16-6,House>滚出去
<16-6,House>Just get out of here.

355
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,910
<16-6,House>[心率开始爬升]
<16-6,House>[Heart rate starts to climb]

357
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,930
<17-1,Chase>是小蔡
<17-1,Chase>[on cell],This is Chase.

358
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,190
<17-2,House>你已经打出供词了吗?
<17-2,House>Did you beat any confessions,out of anybody?

359
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,730
<17-3,Chase>我还没跟任何犯人谈话呢
<17-3,Chase>I haven't spoken to any inmates.

360
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,040
<17-4,House>难道没人干正事了吗?
<17-4,House>Does anybody do their jobs anymore?

361
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,030
<17-5,Chase>我确认克拉伦的性命不值得我冒险
<17-5,Chase>I've decided Clarence's life,isn't worth risking mine for.

362
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,760
<17-6,House>我欣赏你的坦白
<17-6,House>I appreciate your candor.

363
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,410
<17-6,House>你究竟去没去监狱，,还是在打马球?
<17-6,House>Did you even go to the prison,or are you just out playing polo?

364
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,650
<17-7,Chase>我在搜克拉伦的牢房
<17-7,Chase>I'm searching both Clarence's cells.

365
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,230
<17-7,Chase>我猜如果他用什么，那一定藏在牢房
<17-7,Chase>I figure, if he's on something,it's stashed somewhere.

366
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,740
<17-8,House>除非他用光了
<17-8,House>Unless he finished it.

367
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,460
<17-9,Chase>对，那多可惜阿
<17-9,Chase>Yeah, that'd be a shame.

368
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,850
<17-9,Chase>He could have shoved it anywhere,there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling,bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands,他肯定藏哪里了，天花板的信封,颜料瓶子，橡皮盒子
<17-9,Chase>He could have shoved it anywhere,there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling,bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands

369
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,300
<17-10,House>算了，回来吧
<17-10,House>Call it off.Come on back.

370
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,430
<18-1,Clarence>怎么了?
<18-1,Clarence>What's going on?

371
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,470
<18-1,Clarence>你快死了
<18-1,Clarence>You're dying.

372
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,670
<18-2,House>那该喝上最后一杯
<18-2,House>That deserves a last drink.

373
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,390
<18-3,Clarence>你不错
<18-3,Clarence>You're okay.

374
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,950
<18-4,House>谢谢，那意义重大
<18-4,House>Thanks. That means a lot.

375
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,820
<19-1,Cindy>所有测试都无法确诊吗?
<19-1,Cindy>All the tests have been inconclusive?

376
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,200
<19-2,Cameron>诊断是艺术多于科学的
<19-2,Cameron>Diagnostics is more of,an art than a science.

377
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,950
<19-3,Cindy>我现在该开始担心了吗?
<19-3,Cindy>Should I be worried right now?

378
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,210
<19-4,Cameron>我给全国顶尖诊断专家工作
<19-4,Cameron>I work for one of the top,diagnosticians in the country.

379
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,290
<19-4,Cameron>我们会尽力诊断的
<19-4,Cameron>We're pouring all of our,energy into figuring this out.

380
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,080
<19-4,Cameron>以为你们这些罪犯知道怎么喝酒
<19-4,Cameron>Thought you convicts,knew how to drink.

381
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,820
<19-4,Cameron>你至少少喝了三杯
<19-4,Cameron>You're at least three shots behind.

382
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,880
<20-1,House>现在你少喝了四杯
<20-1,House>Now you're four shots behind.

383
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,750
<20-2,Clarence>你最好把下一杯给我，要不杀了你
<20-2,Clarence>You better give me,the next one or I'll kill you.

384
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,640
<20-2,Clarence>豪斯...
<20-2,Clarence>House...

385
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,650
<20-3,Cameron>我在等检验结果，我...
<20-3,Cameron>[House laughing]

386
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,010
<20-3,Cameron>我只是在等待,等待检测结果,我是……
<20-3,Cameron>I was just waiting,for test results, I was...

387
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,920
<20-4,House>现在有点忙，正在喝酒
<20-4,House>Little busy right now.Getting my drink on.

388
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,350
<20-5,Cameron>不敢相信
<20-5,Cameron>Unbelievable.

389
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,760
<20-6,Clarence>那是我10年来看到最好的妞
<20-6,Clarence>Oof. That's the finest piece,I seen in ten years.

390
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,190
<20-7,House>我该上了她
<20-7,House>I could've hit that.

391
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,710
<20-8,Clarence>你没有
<20-8,Clarence>And you didn't.

392
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,190
<20-9,House>嗯
<20-9,House>Eh.

393
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,030
<20-10,Clarence>那你该是被关起来的
<20-10,Clarence>Then you're the one,that should be locked up.

394
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,130
<20-11,House>告诉我，我一直想知道
<20-11,House>Tell me something,I've been trying to figure this out.

395
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,840
<20-11,House>为什么一个...
<20-11,House>Why does a guy...

396
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,430
<20-11,House>死囚，忽然想轻生?
<20-11,House>...who's on Death Row,suddenly try to off himself?

397
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,950
<20-11,House>你知道你的把戏
<20-11,House>You know, you drank that copier fluid.

398
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,510
<20-11,House>并不真的象玩手腕上的,小刀那样迷惑人
<20-11,House>It's not as visually dramatic,as slitting your wrists,with a homemade shiv,

399
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,470
<20-11,House>但还是可以骗人的
<20-11,House>but it'll do the trick.

400
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,060
<20-12,Clarence>最初真的把我迷惑了
<20-12,Clarence>It just hit me all of a sudden.

401
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:50,700
<20-12,Clarence>就象，他们告诉我们什么时候吃,什么时候睡，什么时候走，所有的
<20-12,Clarence>It was like, they tell me,when to eat, when to sleep,when to walk, when to talk, everything.

402
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,100
<20-12,Clarence>我得能控制点什么，对吧?
<20-12,Clarence>I had to take control,of something, right?

403
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,760
<20-12,Clarence>什么时候你死
<20-12,Clarence>When you die,

404
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,370
<20-12,Clarence>我猜那就足够好了
<20-12,Clarence>I figured that was,as good as anything.

405
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,050
<20-13,House>那个想法就这么冒出来了,就那么简单
<20-13,House>And that thought just came to you.Just like that.

406
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,490
<20-14,Clarence>老兄，我告诉你，,23个小时...
<20-14,Clarence>Man, I told you.Twenty-three hours a...

407
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,340
<20-15,House>嗯，你看，这是好消息
<20-15,House>Mmm. Well, look.Here's the good news.

408
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,660
<20-15,House>你喝的东西含90%甲醇,
<20-15,House>The copier fluid you drank,contains about 90% methanol,

409
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,510
<20-15,House>毒性很大，你喝的足够自杀
<20-15,House>which is very poisonous,and you took more than,enough to kill yourself.

410
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,750
<20-15,House>坏消息是，你刚才喝的酒
<20-15,House>The bad news is,the alcohol you drank

411
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:42,430
<20-15,House>含等量乙醇，将汇合你身体里的蚁酸
<20-15,House>contains so much ethanol,that it's gonna bind with that,nasty formic acid raging through your body,

412
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,090
<20-15,House>然后你会尿出来，无害
<20-15,House>and you're just gonna,pee it out. Harmlessly.

413
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,790
<20-16,Clarence>老兄，你喝多了
<20-16,Clarence>Man, you are drunk.

414
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:58,590
<20-17,House>是的，我还救了你的命
<20-17,House>Yes, I am. I also saved your life.

415
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,830
<20-17,House>哈，至少现在是的
<20-17,House>Ha! At least for now.

417
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,950
<21-1,Stacy>早安
<21-1,Stacy>Morning!

418
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,900
<21-1,Stacy>你头疼吗?
<21-1,Stacy>Your head hurt?

419
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,510
<21-2,House>不疼，是你的声音刺耳
<21-2,House>No, you just have,a very grating voice.

420
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,270
<21-3,Stacy>你一直体重较轻
<21-3,Stacy>You always were a light weight.

421
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,850
<21-4,House>你干嘛跟我说话?
<21-4,House>Why are you talking to me?

422
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,360
<21-5,Stacy>我想让你痛苦这个原因可以吗?
<21-5,Stacy>Can't it be enough that,I want to cause you pain?

423
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,860
<21-5,Stacy>病人好了，你打算把他送回去?
<21-5,Stacy>The patient's okay now,you're going to send him back?

424
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,520
<21-6,House>完全对
<21-6,House>Absolutely.

425
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,740
<21-6,House>我能信任你吗?
<21-6,House>Can I trust you?

426
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,370
<21-7,Stacy>过去你是的
<21-7,Stacy>You used to.

427
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,510
<21-8,House>我还是觉得病人有问题，我要留下他
<21-8,House>I still think the patient's sick. I'm keeping him here.

428
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,590
<21-8,House>现在要么你做你的事稳住医院
<21-8,House>Now, either you can do your job,and keep the hospital informed, or

429
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,900
<21-8,House>或者是你帮我确保医院不知情,替我争取时间
<21-8,House>you can help me make sure,the hospital is not informed,and buy me some time.

430
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,480
<22-1,Chase>试过CT吗?
<22-1,Chase>Chase:,Have you done a CT?

431
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,760
<22-2,Cameron>试过?
<22-2,Cameron>Yeah, I have?

432
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,440
<22-3,Foreman>对照过吗?
<22-3,Foreman>Does it have contrast?

433
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,070
<22-4,House>该做的她都做了,就差告诉病人她要死了
<22-4,House>She's done everything she needs to do,except tell her patient that she's dying.

434
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,060
<22-4,House>我告诉过你，只有我可以使用记号笔
<22-4,House>I told you, only I get to,play with markers.

435
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,980
<22-4,House>我们的犯人有了新症状
<22-4,House>Our prisoner has a new symptom.

436
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,830
<22-5,Cameron>确诊前我不会告诉辛蒂她要死了
<22-5,Cameron>I'm not telling Cindy that she's dying,until the diagnosis is confirmed.

437
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,980
<22-6,House>而我不相信克拉伦,以自杀控制自己的生命
<22-6,House>I am not buying that,CLARENCE is trying to,take control of his life by suicide.

438
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,320
<22-7,Foreman>健康的人不自杀
<22-7,Foreman>Healthy people don't kill themselves.

439
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,090
<22-7,Foreman>健康的人也不杀别人
<22-7,Foreman>Healthy people don't kill other people.

440
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,430
<22-8,House>这家伙刚被一个30年没判死刑的州,驳回了上诉请求
<22-8,House>Guy just filed an appeal,in a state that hasn't actually,killed anybody in about 30 years.

441
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,590
<22-9,Chase>如果不是自杀呢?如果是个逃跑计划呢?
<22-9,Chase>What if it wasn't suicide?What if it was an escape plan?

442
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,370
<22-9,Chase>喝足量甲醇运往医院,再从这逃走?
<22-9,Chase>Drink enough methanol to,get transferred to a hospital,try to escape from here?

443
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,470
<22-10,House>出色，能解释所有的事,只是他是被症状逼到了这里
<22-10,House>Excellent. Explains everything,except the symptom that got him here.

444
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,190
<22-10,House>他的心脏在他喝假酒前就发疯了
<22-10,House>His heart went nuts,before he got stuck in that storage cell,and chugged a toner martini.

445
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,490
<22-10,House>我觉得他的头脑出问题了
<22-10,House>I think there's something,going on in his head.

446
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:05,540
<22-10,House>检查颅内损伤，脑部感染,免疫系统疾病，做CT,LP，全套检查
<22-10,House>Check for intracranial lesions,brain infections, autoimmune diseases...do a CT, LP, full workup.

447
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,670
<22-10,House>州政府付钱，我们来狂欢吧
<22-10,House>State's paying, so go nuts.

448
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,760
<23-1,Foreman>你哪来的这个疤痕?
<23-1,Foreman>Where'd you get these scars?

449
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,650
<23-2,Clarence>第一个月进来时被刺的,其后我保全了我的屁眼
<23-2,Clarence>I got shived my first month in.After I healed up I got my ass.

450
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,570
<23-2,Clarence>你们还觉得我有病吗?
<23-2,Clarence>You guys still think I'm sick?

451
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,400
<23-3,Foreman>没错
<23-3,Foreman>Obviously.

452
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,810
<23-4,Clarence>你干嘛在意?干嘛不就让我死算了?
<23-4,Clarence>Why you care?Why don't you just let me die?

453
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,090
<23-5,Foreman>我跟你不同
<23-5,Foreman>I'm different than you.

454
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,800
<23-6,Clarence>对，你象爱妈妈一样的爱我
<23-6,Clarence>Right, you love me,like your own mama.

455
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,700
<23-6,Clarence>那就是护士说我心脏快停时,你把她踢出去了
<23-6,Clarence>That's why the nurse says,you kicked her out,when my heart nearly stopped.

456
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,850
<23-7,Foreman>深呼吸
<23-7,Foreman>Take a deep breath.

457
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,730
<23-7,Foreman>家族有精神病史吗?
<23-7,Foreman>Any family history,of mental illness?

458
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:46,420
<23-8,Clarence>我一直听说我爸是疯子，,从没看见过他和妈妈，是药吗？
<23-8,Clarence>I always heard my pa was crazy;,I never met the man with,my mom, it was the drugs.

459
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,970
<23-9,Foreman>有兄弟姐妹吗?
<23-9,Foreman>Any siblings?

460
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,540
<23-10,Clarence>我有弟弟，几乎是我带大的
<23-10,Clarence>I got a brother,pretty much raised him on my own.

461
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,030
<23-11,Foreman>不错的故事
<23-11,Foreman>Inspirational story.

462
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,810
<23-11,Foreman>- 他也在苦窑里熬时间吗?- 嘿
<23-11,Foreman>- He doin' time, too?- Hey.

463
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,120
<23-12,Clarence>他是好孩子，别随便评价你不知道的事
<23-12,Clarence>He's a good kid.Don't go judgin' what you don't know.

464
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,830
<23-13,Foreman>他的健康如何?
<23-13,Foreman>How's his health?

465
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,720
<23-14,Clarence>我进去后就没听过他的消息
<23-14,Clarence>I haven't heard from him,since I went inside.

466
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,320
<23-14,Clarence>跟他一起16年，给他换该死的尿布
<23-14,Clarence>Spent 16 years with him,changed his damn diapers.

467
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:22,830
<23-14,Clarence>你能想像你的一生都随坏事而去吗?
<23-14,Clarence>Can you imagine your whole life,bein' about the worst thing you ever did?

468
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,190
<23-15,Foreman>你杀了四个人
<23-15,Foreman>You killed four people.

469
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,820
<23-15,Foreman>不知何故，做乳酪面包失去了意义
<23-15,Foreman>Somehow, making mac and cheese,just the way he want kind of,loses its significance.

470
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,620
<24-1,House>哦，不，你现在把,整个身体都扔我椅子上了
<24-1,House>Oh no. Now you've left,your entire body in my chair.

471
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,120
<24-1,House>这是你要什么的意思呢?
<24-1,House>What does that mean you want?

472
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
<24-2,Cameron>我需要你平等的注意力
<24-2,Cameron>I need a segmental,bronchoalveolar lavage.

473
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,080
<24-3,House>我把比对的CT结果带回来了
<24-3,House>I take it the CT,with contrast came back.

474
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,930
<24-5,House>- 不确定,- 活体切片会是的
<24-5,House>- They're not definitive.- Biopsy would be.

475
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,860
<24-6,Cameron>活体切片会侵入病毒而且不必要
<24-6,Cameron>Biopsy would be,invasive and unnecessary.

476
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,510
<24-7,House>但确定
<24-7,House>And definitive.

477
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,970
<24-7,House>但你不需要确诊，你想把错觉尽量持久
<24-7,House>But you don't want definitive,you want to hang on to your,delusions as long as you can.

478
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,980
<24-8,Cameron>灌洗可以证明不是癌症
<24-8,Cameron>A lavage could prove,it's not cancer.

479
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,550
<24-9,House>但你需要我的许可程序
<24-9,House>But you need me,to approve the procedure.

480
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,380
<24-9,House>尽管不够意思，但答案是不
<24-9,House>Must be a bitch.The answer is no.

481
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,860
<24-10,Cameron>为什么？因为是我?
<24-10,Cameron>Why? Because it's me?

482
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,940
<24-10,Cameron>我跟你过劲了
<24-10,Cameron>I'm over you.

483
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,790
<24-10,Cameron>我跳上了花车，我恨你，好吗？
<24-10,Cameron>I've jumped on the bandwagon.I hate you, okay?

484
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,650
<24-11,House>好，我们来治疗她吧
<24-11,House>Great. Let's treat her.

485
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,440
<24-11,House>什么啊?
<24-11,House>What is it?

486
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,110
<24-12,Cameron>你不帮辛蒂，但却被这点尘土迷惑？
<24-12,Cameron>You won't help Cindy but you're,obsessed with this piece of dirt!

487
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,050
<24-12,Cameron>你难道是想证明别人不重要，,只有你的迷惑最重要？
<24-12,Cameron>Are you just trying to prove that,who someone is doesn't matter,that all that matters is your stupid puzzle?

488
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:51,460
<24-12,Cameron>好吧，同样治疗吧，一个测试,是我全部要求
<24-12,Cameron>Fine. Treat them the same.That's all I'm asking. One test.

489
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,330
<24-13,House>哇，很出色
<24-13,House>Wow, that is remarkable.

490
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,590
<24-13,House>根据卖口香糖给小孩的人说,
<24-13,House>According to those,patchouli-oli selling new-agers,

491
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,210
<24-13,House>本该是晚期的病人
<24-13,House>it's supposed to be,the terminal patient,

492
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,550
<24-13,House>而你正经历死亡五步骤
<24-13,House>but you're going,through the five stages.

493
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,400
<24-13,House>你正顺滑地从愤怒过渡到讨价还价
<24-13,House>You just made a completely,seamless transition,from anger to bargaining.

494
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,010
<24-13,House>再完成两小时出诊,你可以得到一个程序
<24-13,House>Cover two more of my clinic hours,you can have your one procedure.

495
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,470
<25-1,Chase>没损伤，没动脉瘤
<25-1,Chase>No lesions, no aneurysms.

496
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,660
<25-1,Chase>很讽刺，但一个杀人犯的头脑,看上去挺正常的
<25-1,Chase>Ironically, the mind of a killer,looks completely normal.

497
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,240
<25-2,Foreman>如果有人让你描述我
<25-2,Foreman>If someone asks you,to describe me to them,

498
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,250
<25-2,Foreman>你第一告诉他们什么?
<25-2,Foreman>what's the first thing,you'd tell them?

499
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,280
<25-3,Chase>不可靠,你问什么?
<25-3,Chase>Insecure.What are you asking?

500
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,080
<25-4,Foreman>就象，你跟我初次约会？
<25-4,Foreman>Like, if you were setting me up,on a blind date.

501
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:51,580
<25-4,Foreman>你会象个姑娘介绍我，黑人,神经学医生，偷车的?
<25-4,Foreman>Would you describe me,to the girl as the black guy,a neurologist, car thief?

502
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,190
<25-5,Chase>那家伙触动你了吧?
<25-5,Chase>This guy's really,getting to you, isn't he?

503
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,470
<25-5,Chase>没有感染的迹象
<25-5,Chase>There's no sign of infection.

504
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,720
<25-5,Chase>得做活体切片了
<25-5,Chase>You're gonna have to do the biopsy.

505
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,250
<25-5,Chase>你的死囚还在这里
<25-5,Chase>Cuddy:,Your Death Row guy's still here!

506
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,840
<27-1,Cuddy>是，抱歉，得让他稳定
<27-1,Cuddy>Yeah, sorry.Just gotta get him stabilized.

507
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,120
<27-2,House>再留他几个小时就可以走了
<27-2,House>Probably keep him on fluids,for a few more hours, then off he goes.

508
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,720
<27-3,Cuddy>哦，是吗？,我以为你还认为他有病呢
<27-3,Cuddy>Oh yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring,that you still think he's sick.

509
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:52,640
<27-4,House>猜测需要推理,我猜测你没猜对
<27-4,House>Figuring requires deductive reasoning.I'm figuring that you did no figuring.

510
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,070
<27-4,House>史戴西出卖了我，对吧?
<27-4,House>Stacy just ratted me out, right?

511
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,760
<27-4,House>再不能有律师和当事人之间的信任了
<27-4,House>So much for attorney-client privledge.

512
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,200
<27-5,Cuddy>我是当事人，你个白痴,史戴西对这家医院负有责任
<27-5,Cuddy>I'm the client, you moron.Stacy has a duty to this hospital.

513
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,370
<27-7,Cuddy>- 对,- 我要把他送会监狱去
<27-7,Cuddy>- Right.- I'm sending him back to prison.

514
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,700
<27-8,House>哇 ，不行，法庭令
<27-8,House>Whoa, can't. Court order.

515
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,090
<27-9,Cuddy>法庭令说他得被公告健康
<27-9,Cuddy>Court order says he has to,be declared healthy.

516
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,300
<27-9,Cuddy>没指出由哪个医生公告
<27-9,Cuddy>Doesn't specify what doctor needs,to make that declaration.

518
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,870
<28-1,Cuddy>- 怎么了，克拉伦?- 我的肠子
<28-1,Cuddy>- What is it, Clarence?- My gut!

519
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,080
<28-3,Cuddy>你是否可以描述一下？,是刺痛还是跳着疼
<28-3,Cuddy>Would you describe it,as a shooting pain?A throbbing pain?

520
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,450
<28-3,Cuddy>还是因为你不想回监狱而假疼?
<28-3,Cuddy>Or maybe an imaginary pain,because you don't want to,go back to prison?

521
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,660
<28-4,House>哪里疼?
<28-4,House>Where does it hurt?

522
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,920
<28-5,Clarence>我的肠子，我觉得我被刺中了
<28-5,Clarence>My gut, I feel like,I'm getting stabbed!

523
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,720
<28-5,Clarence>他该知道，让我看看
<28-5,Clarence>[Screams again]

524
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,570
<28-6,House>嗯,他会知道。,让我看一看
<28-6,House>Well, he'd know.Let me take a look.

525
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,820
<28-7,Cuddy>哦，也就是说除了一个罪犯,所有人都说谎
<28-7,Cuddy>Oh, so everybody lies,except a convicted murderer.

526
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,840
<28-8,House>我不觉得他是装的，你呢医生?
<28-8,House>I don't think he's faking this stuff.What do you think, Doctor?

527
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,450
<28-8,House>[克拉伦斯尖叫,更多的强调]
<28-8,House>[Clarence screams,a lot more for emphasis.]

528
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,530
<29-1,Stacy>我没选择
<29-1,Stacy>I didn't have any choice.

529
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,450
<29-2,House>不，你得告诉卡蒂
<29-2,House>No, you had to tell Cuddy.

530
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,460
<29-2,House>她是你老板，我明白了
<29-2,House>She's your boss, I get it.

531
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,860
<29-2,House>希特勒也觉得他是造福全人类呢
<29-2,House>Hitler thought he was,doing the world a favor, too.

532
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,950
<29-3,Stacy>对，跟那个水平差不多
<29-3,Stacy>Yeah, pretty much,on that same level.

533
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,880
<29-4,House>甘地没因朋友要求就做海洋漫步
<29-4,House>Gandhi didn't march the sea,because his buddies asked him too,

534
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,970
<29-4,House>泡泡没把所有老师消灭因为他需要朋友
<29-4,House>Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers,because he wanted to make friends.

535
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,130
<29-5,Stacy>你现在不是在交朋友
<29-5,Stacy>You're not making,friends right now.

536
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,030
<29-6,House>我信任了你
<29-6,House>I trusted you.

537
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,590
<29-7,Stacy>我知道
<29-7,Stacy>I know.

538
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,990
<29-8,House>韦森是傻瓜，我是白痴
<29-8,House>Wilson's a fool.I'm an idiot.

539
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,500
<29-9,Stacy>我得做我认为对的事
<29-9,Stacy>I had to do,what I thought was right.

540
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,000
<29-10,House>那是每个人行事的准则
<29-10,House>It's the only reason,anyone does anything.

541
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,660
<30-1,Foreman>外科手术进展顺利,他们切除了近一尺的坏死肠子
<30-1,Foreman>The surgery went fine.They removed almost,a foot of necrotic bowel.

542
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,000
<30-1,Foreman>他们给他上了手铐送去康复了
<30-1,Foreman>They're shackling him,and taking him to recovery.

543
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,280
<30-2,House>我好奇
<30-2,House>I wonder.

544
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,820
<30-2,House>我好奇为什么克拉伦杀了第二个狱友
<30-2,House>I wonder why Clarence,killed that second inmate.

545
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
<30-3,Foreman>好吧，我来接,你说什么呢?
<30-3,Foreman>Fine, I'll bite.What the hell are you talking about?

546
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,280
<30-4,House>凡事皆有目的
<30-4,House>Everything we do,is dictated by motive.

547
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,870
<30-4,House>他干嘛杀他女友?
<30-4,House>Why did he kill his girlfriend?

548
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,040
<30-5,Foreman>因为他是疯子
<30-5,Foreman>Because he's a maniac!

549
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,920
<30-6,House>那是他给的原因么?
<30-6,House>Is that the reason he gave?

550
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,050
<30-7,Foreman>她骗他
<30-7,Foreman>She was cheating on him.

551
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,440
<30-8,House>嫉妒
<30-8,House>Jealousy.

552
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,580
<30-8,House>那使他进监狱,杀了第一号狱友，为什么?
<30-8,House>That gets him sent to prison,where he kills inmate number one. Why?

553
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,210
<30-9,Foreman>那家伙先袭击他
<30-9,Foreman>Guy attacked him first.

554
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,930
<30-10,House>复仇,其后杀了谁?
<30-10,House>Revenge.Who'd he killed after that?

555
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,260
<30-11,Chase>狱警
<30-11,Chase>Prison guard.

556
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,190
<30-12,House>他的档案满是虐待投诉
<30-12,House>Got a file full of abuse complaints.

557
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,720
<30-12,House>估计虐待克拉伦好几个月了
<30-12,House>Probably been kicking,Clarence's ass for months.

558
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,080
<30-13,Foreman>克拉伦是为民除害呢
<30-13,Foreman>Clarence is just ridding,the world of bad seeds.

559
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,660
<30-14,House>管它叫'报偿'.
<30-14,House>Call that one ''retribution''.

560
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,640
<30-14,House>然后杀了二号狱友
<30-14,House>Then he kills inmate number two.

561
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,220
<30-14,House>有人知道原因么?
<30-14,House>Anybody know why?

562
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,790
<30-14,House>没，里面没有
<30-14,House>Nuh-uh. It's not in there.

563
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,180
<31-1,Clarence>我突然需要一个理由了吗?
<31-1,Clarence>All of a sudden,I got to have a reason?

564
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,070
<31-2,House>那样不规则，医生热爱不规则
<31-2,House>It's an anomaly.Doctors love anomalies.

565
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,290
<31-2,House>x光有黑点，MRI有亮点……
<31-2,House>Dark spot on an x-ray,bright spot on an MRI....

566
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,510
<31-2,House>杀第二个狱友相当于,谋杀案中的尿里有血
<31-2,House>Killing that second inmate,is the homicidal equivalent,of blood in the urine.

567
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,050
<31-2,House>不恰当
<31-2,House>It doesn't fit.

568
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,410
<31-2,House>我对不恰当很感兴趣
<31-2,House>I'm interested in,things that don't fit.

569
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,940
<31-2,House>告诉我你做的理由
<31-2,House>Tell me why you did it.

570
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,060
<31-2,House>一个你吹嘘的受害者
<31-2,House>Your other victims,you were almost bragging about.

571
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,740
<31-2,House>这家伙有什么不同?
<31-2,House>What was different,about this guy?

572
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,610
<31-3,Clarence>发生在我在gen-pop的时候
<31-3,Clarence>It happened,when I was in gen-pop.

573
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,330
<31-3,Clarence>我在图书馆，看书
<31-3,Clarence>I was in the library, just readin',

574
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,180
<31-3,Clarence>我开始觉得很紧张
<31-3,Clarence>and I started feelin' real nervous.

575
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,880
<31-3,Clarence>这家伙盯着我，我可以感觉到他的眼睛
<31-3,Clarence>This guy was staring at me,I could feel his eyes.

576
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,590
<31-3,Clarence>象在我脖子上挖洞一样,让我发疯
<31-3,Clarence>Digging holes in the back of my neck,made me feel crazy.

577
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,450
<31-3,Clarence>我脸上汗如雨下
<31-3,Clarence>Sweat was pouring,down my face.

578
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,890
<31-3,Clarence>我能听到心跳声进入我的耳朵
<31-3,Clarence>I could hear my heartbeat,racing in my ears.

579
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,890
<31-3,Clarence>我朝着他发狂了
<31-3,Clarence>I just raged out on the dude.

580
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,080
<32-1,House>那么发狂如何细分?
<32-1,House>So what's the differential for raging out?

581
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,200
<32-2,Foreman>睾丸激素过剩，类固醇……
<32-2,Foreman>Excess testosterone, steroids...

582
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,440
<32-3,Chase>刺激...
<32-3,Chase>Adrenaline...

583
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,120
<32-4,House>准备给克拉伦做手术
<32-4,House>Prep Clarence for surgery.

584
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,390
<32-5,Foreman>跟大家分享吧
<32-5,Foreman>Care to share with the class.

585
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,410
<32-6,House>哦，拜托，我还得给你拼写出来吗？,嗜铬神经细胞瘤
<32-6,House>Oh, come on.Do I have to spell it out for you?Pheochromocytoma.

586
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,820
<32-6,House>其实，我不知道怎么拼
<32-6,House>Actually, I'm not sure how you spell it.

587
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,740
<32-6,House>可你自己说的，刺激
<32-6,House>But you said it yourself, adrenaline.

588
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,070
<32-6,House>嗜铬神经细胞瘤位于肾上腺管壁,随意释放大量物质
<32-6,House>Pheochomocytoma sits,on top of the adrenal gland,randomly spits out oodles of the stuff.

589
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,530
<32-6,House>精彩，解释很多事
<32-6,House>It's perfect, it explains everything.

590
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,550
<32-6,House>心动过速，肺水肿,血管收缩导致肠坏死
<32-6,House>The tachycardia, pulmonary edema,the vasoconstriction that cause,the necrotic bowel...[Elevator dings]

591
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,830
<32-7,Chase>甚至可以解释他扯烂床围栏的蛮力
<32-7,Chase>Even explains how he had,the strength to rip the rail off his bed.

592
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,170
<32-8,Foreman>但该症异常罕见
<32-8,Foreman>But pheo's extremely rare.

593
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,090
<32-9,House>我喜欢罕见，准备MRI，卡麦伦在哪里？
<32-9,House>I love rare. Set up an MRI.Where's Cameron?

594
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,830
<32-9,House>就象我不知道似的
<32-9,House>Like I don't know.

597
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,680
<33-1,Wilson>卡梅隆博士吗?我能借你请教吗?
<33-1,Wilson>Dr. Cameron?Could I borrow you for a consult?

598
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,130
<33-1,Wilson>甘苦滋味是肿瘤科的头等大事,我已获得所有活体切片结果了
<33-1,Wilson>Bittersweet thing about being,head of the oncology department,I get CCed in all the biopsy results.

599
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,630
<33-2,Cameron>对，我知道，她是晚期
<33-2,Cameron>Yeah, I know.She's terminal.

600
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,870
<33-3,Wilson>对，那么我就当你是在通知她呢?
<33-3,Wilson>Yeah. So I take it you were,in there informing her?

601
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,750
<33-4,Cameron>嗯，我还没那么做，我正...
<33-4,Cameron>Well, I...I hadn't exactly,gotten around to that, but I was just...

602
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,830
<33-5,Wilson>干嘛?交朋友吗?
<33-5,Wilson>Doing what?Making friends?

603
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,290
<33-6,Cameron>辛蒂离婚了，没孩子,没胞亲，父母双亡
<33-6,Cameron>Cindy's divorced.She doesn't have any kids,no siblings, both her parents are gone...

604
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,370
<33-7,Wilson>做她朋友不是你的工作
<33-7,Wilson>It's not your job,to be her friend.

605
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,540
<33-7,Wilson>你懂吗?那不值
<33-7,Wilson>Do you understand?And it's not worth it.

606
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,200
<33-7,Wilson>她最后的几天觉得好，而你,会难受好几年
<33-7,Wilson>She feels better her few final days,and you're not the same, maybe for years.

607
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,160
<33-8,Cameron>你觉得不值
<33-8,Cameron>You don't think it's worth it.

608
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,940
<33-9,Wilson>我知道不值
<33-9,Wilson>I know it's not worth it.

609
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,280
<33-10,Cameron>我丈夫...
<33-10,Cameron>My husband w...

610
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,070
<33-10,Cameron>我是在他被诊断为晚期癌症后遇到他的
<33-10,Cameron>I met him just after he was,diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

611
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,440
<33-10,Cameron>如果我没跟他结婚
<33-10,Cameron>If I hadn't married him,

612
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,090
<33-10,Cameron>他会孤独
<33-10,Cameron>he was alone.

613
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,440
<33-10,Cameron>当一个好人死的时候,该对世界有些影响
<33-10,Cameron>When a good person dies,there should be an impact on the world.

614
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,270
<33-10,Cameron>有人该注意到，有人该难过
<33-10,Cameron>Somebody should notice.Somebody should be upset.

615
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,250
<34-1,Clarence>嗜什么?
<34-1,Clarence>Pheo what?

616
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,990
<34-2,House>我都不记得了
<34-2,House>I don't even remember.

617
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,500
<34-2,House>是个卖弄地描述小瘤子的说法
<34-2,House>It's just a fancy way of saying,small, adrenaline-secreting tumor.

618
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,920
<34-2,House>对，这该说清楚了
<34-2,House>Yeah, that clarified it for you.

619
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,950
<34-2,House>你需要知道的就是如果我对了,我们可以解决了它
<34-2,House>All you need to know is,if I'm right, we can fix it.

620
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,600
<34-2,House>需要找到它,要做核磁共振
<34-2,House>Just need to find it.We need an MRI.

621
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,580
<34-2,House>对大部分人来说毫无痛苦
<34-2,House>It's completely painless for most people.

622
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,400
<34-3,Clarence>对我来说不是?
<34-3,Clarence>But not for me?

623
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,050
<34-4,House>我猜你是在监狱里做的这些纹身？
<34-4,House>I assume you got,those tattoos in prison.

624
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,390
<34-4,House>监狱纹身用的自制墨水含重金属
<34-4,House>Prison tats often contain,inks with heavy metals.

625
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,390
<34-4,House>核磁共振基本上是一块大型磁铁
<34-4,House>The MRI's basically a giant magnet.

626
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,290
<34-4,House>它会把那些重金属,从你的皮肤里吸出来
<34-4,House>It'd suck those metallic inks,right out of your skin.

628
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:29,150
<34-4,House>别动，要不还得再做
<34-4,House>Stop squirming.Don't make us do this again.

629
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,110
<35-1,House>大婴儿
<35-1,House>Big baby.

630
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,290
<35-2,Chase>还是看不到什么啊
<35-2,Chase>Still don't see anything.

631
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,370
<35-3,Clarence>关掉
<35-3,Clarence>Clarence: ,Turn it off!

632
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,550
<35-4,House>有个Waldo
<35-4,House>There's Waldo.

633
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,140
<35-4,House>找到了，克拉伦
<35-4,House>Found it, Clarence.

634
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,860
<35-5,Clarence>关掉，把这该死的东西关掉
<35-5,Clarence>Clarence:,Turn it off! Turn this damn thing off!

635
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,750
<35-6,House>把他关在里面直到你们找到为止
<35-6,House>Keep him in there,until you guys see it too.

636
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,330
<35-7,Foreman>狗日的
<35-7,Foreman>Son of a bitch.

637
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,870
<36-1,Foreman>看来他们把瘤子顺利拿出来了
<36-1,Foreman>Looks like they got,the pheo out successfully.

638
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,000
<36-1,Foreman>那么现在呢?
<36-1,Foreman>So what now?

639
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,710
<36-2,House>克拉伦要会死牢了
<36-2,House>Clarence goes back to Death Row.

640
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,130
<36-3,Foreman>就这样?
<36-3,Foreman>Just like that?

641
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,290
<36-4,House>他治好了
<36-4,House>He's cured.

642
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:22,750
<36-5,Foreman>肿瘤导致他难以抑制怒气,很明显直接导致他的最初谋杀
<36-5,Foreman>That tumor caused random shots of adrenaline,which obviously led to the rage attacks that,made him a murderer in the first place.

643
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,690
<36-6,House>以上帝之名，你对了
<36-6,House>By God, you're right!

644
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,220
<36-6,House>我们得找外科医生留着那个瘤子
<36-6,House>Let's call the surgeons,we've got to save that tumor.

645
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,510
<36-6,House>把它安置上证人席
<36-6,House>Put it on the witness stand.

646
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,630
<36-7,Foreman>我们可以为克拉伦的上诉作证
<36-7,Foreman>We could testify,at Clarence's appeal.

647
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,870
<36-8,House>你闻得见吗?
<36-8,House>[sniffs] You smell that?

648
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,120
<36-8,House>我觉得那是伪善的臭气
<36-8,House>I think that is the stink of hypocrisy.

649
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,930
<36-8,House>你没考虑,克拉伦的社会环境对他负有责任
<36-8,House>You wouldn't even consider the notion,that Clarence's social upbringing was,responsible for what he became,

650
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,040
<36-8,House>而你却要作证,把一切都归咎于一个小肿瘤
<36-8,House>but now you're sprinting to,the witness stand to blame,everything on a little tumor.

651
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,060
<36-9,Foreman>一个人的环境和,他的生物性是完全不同的
<36-9,Foreman>A person's upbringing and their biology,are completely different.

652
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,250
<36-10,House>是，你只战胜了一个
<36-10,House>Yeah. See, you only,overcame one of them.

653
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,280
<36-10,House>嗯，我们就算给克拉伦一个通行证吧?
<36-10,House>Well, let's just give,Clarence a free pass, hmmm?

654
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,800
<36-10,House>你会因此得罪所有该病症的患者
<36-10,House>Course, you're probably going to,piss off all those other pheo sufferers

655
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,730
<36-10,House>因为他们在努力克制自己的怒气而,成为律师,赛车手,甚至是医生
<36-10,House>who managed to control,their rage attacks and become lawyers,race car doctors, and even doctors.

656
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:11,330
<36-10,House>切除肿瘤可以中止胡乱杀人,却不能给他免罪
<36-10,House>Removing that tumor puts a stop,to those random shots adrenaline,but doesn't absolve him.

657
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,000
<36-11,Foreman>你希望他被处决吗?
<36-11,Foreman>You want him to be executed?

658
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,400
<36-12,House>我不是那么说的
<36-12,House>That's not what I'm saying.

659
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,080
<36-13,Foreman>有意见吗？
<36-13,Foreman>Got an opinion?

660
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,750
<36-13,Foreman>每个人都有意见
<36-13,Foreman>Everyone's got an opinion.

661
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:34,270
<36-15,Foreman>我，我想我会在克拉伦的上诉中作证
<36-15,Foreman>I, uh, I think I'm gonna testify,at Clarence's appeal.

662
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,280
<36-16,House>你可以做你认为对的事
<36-16,House>You'll do what you think is right.

667
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,210
<37-1,Cindy>我只是咳嗽而已
<37-1,Cindy>But it's just a cough.
