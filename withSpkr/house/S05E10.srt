<9-12,Foreman>He could've come up with siboabcanywhere else in the hospital.

242
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,000
<9-12,Foreman>你何必来跑来这里干扰我们治疗
<9-12,Foreman>You didn't need to comeabcdown here and screw with us.

<9-13,House>她的错误想法使他得出了正确诊断
<9-13,House>But her wrong idea led to his right one.

<10-1,Taub>我们认为 你以前的手术abc引起小肠细菌过度生长的症状
<10-1,Taub>We think your surgery might'veabccaused an infection called sibo.

246
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,060
<10-1,Taub>粪便化验可以帮我们确诊
<10-1,Taub>Stool tests will help us to confirm.

<10-4,Emmy>我没有劝说任何人不要做胃旁路手术
<10-4,Emmy>I don't tell anyone notabcto get gastric bypass.

253
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,560

<10-7,Taub>即使你快乐 也不是因为健康abc而是因为变漂亮了
<10-7,Taub>But if you are, being healthyabcdidn't do it. Being pretty did.

00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,790
<22-10,House>你是要打赌 还是病人又出状况了?
<22-10,House>Are you making book, or didabcsomething else happen to our patient?

445
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,120

<22-13,House>格林-巴利综合征说得通
<22-13,House>Guillain-barre fits.

451
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,570
<22-14,Foreman>病人没注意到初期症状abc因为她每天都肌肉酸痛
<22-14,Foreman>Patient didn't notice the initial symptoms becauseabcit's no different than how she feels every day.

452

<22-14,Foreman>她肌肉无力是全身瘫痪的前兆
<22-14,Foreman>Her muscle weakness is theabcprecursor to full paralysis.

<23-10,Cameron>冲她大吼可不是有效的疗法
<23-10,Cameron>Yelling at her is not goingabcto be an effective treatment.

464
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,100
<23-11,Kutner>她是装的 是想引起注意
<23-11,Kutner>She's faking. It's a cry for attention.

465
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,850
<23-13,Cameron>她的大脑可能都熄火了
<23-13,Cameron>her brain could be misfiring.

466

<23-14,DeeDee>是啊 罕见的神经障碍abc这比引人注意更有可能
<23-14,DeeDee>Right,a rare neurological disorder isabcfar more likely than a cry for attention.

467
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,200
<23-15,Kutner>我是说 这女人没什么要紧的症状
<23-15,Kutner>I mean,nothing about thisabcwoman screams "look at me."

<28-2,Kutner>Means it's not guillain-barre.

533
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,050
<28-3,Thirteen>就是说 不管是啥问题 都不出在大脑
<28-3,Thirteen>Which means whatever itabcis, it's now in her brain.

534
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,540
<28-4,House>你要去哪?

540
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,160
<28-8,House>减了两百磅就只是凑巧咯?
<28-8,House>So losing the 200 poundsabcwas just a coincidence?

541
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,180
<28-9,Taub>会不会是朊病毒病?
<28-9,Taub>What about a prion disease?

542
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,380
<28-10,House>要是她的大脑逐渐变得千疮百孔abc我们就无能为力了
<28-10,House>If her brain is slowly turning into aabcswiss cheese, there's not a lot we can do.

<28-13,Cuddy>做测试之前 不准你开这女人的脑
<28-13,Cuddy>You're not cutting into thisabcwoman's brain before you test.

546
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,400
<28-14,House>这就是个测试
<28-14,House>Thatisthe test.

547
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,420
<28-15,Cuddy>你不是想测试中枢神经系统淋巴瘤abc这是个很合理的诊断
<28-15,Cuddy>Not for cns lymphoma, which isabca perfectly legitimate diagnosis.

548
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,750
<28-15,Cuddy>可以用非侵入式方法测试
<28-15,Cuddy>One you can test for non-invasively.

549
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,110
<28-16,House>你明显对侵略性没什么意见
<28-16,House>You're obviously notabcopposed to being invasive.

550
