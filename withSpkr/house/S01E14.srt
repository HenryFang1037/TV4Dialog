00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,320
<1-1,Carly>幻灯片放在哪儿
<1-1,Carly>Where are those projections?

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,120
<1-6,Robin>要再做一次会前通气
<1-6,Robin>another pre-call.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,580
<1-7,Carly>已经通过气了  这算是"后"通气电话吗
<1-7,Carly>We did the pre-call. Is this the post pre-call call?

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,780
<1-8,Ben>董事会想了解进军亚洲市场的细节
<1-8,Ben>The board's gonna want specifics with the push into the Asian markets.

<1-9,Carly>Ben, there are no specifics about Asia.

<1-9,Carly>我们可是在凌晨3点才想出国际化计划的方案
<1-9,Carly>We came up with that as a Hail Mary at 3:00 in the morning...

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,090
<1-9,Carly>Hail Mary  万福玛丽传球
<1-9,Carly>[成功率低的孤注一掷的长距离传球]

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,160

<1-9,Carly>to placate the board about international.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,340
<1-10,Ben>卡莉  我只是给你提个醒
<1-10,Ben>Carly, I'm just giving you a heads-up about Asia.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,590
<1-11,Carly>没有进军亚洲市场的细节
<1-11,Carly>There is no Asia.

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,310
<1-10,Ben>让我们谈谈亚洲市场
<1-10,Ben>Let's talk about Asia.

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,550
<2-1,Carly>我们正在与里昂信贷接触
<2-1,Carly>We're in the preliminary stages

18
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,340
<2-1,Carly>欲与其结成战略伙伴
<2-1,Carly>of forming a strategic alliance with Credit Lyonnais.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,110
<2-1,Carly>3个月后  走上韩国街道
<2-1,Carly>Within three months, you won't

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,240
<2-1,Carly>广告牌或药妆店的橱窗里
<2-1,Carly>be able to walk four feet in Kangham, South Korea

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,110
<2-1,Carly>我们的靓丽模特
<2-1,Carly>without seeing one of our beautiful models

22
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,750
<2-1,Carly>会让您目不暇接
<2-1,Carly>smiling at you from billboards

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,160
<2-1,Carly>向你微笑  邀请你进店
<2-1,Carly>and drugstore windows, inviting you in.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,830
<2-2,Boardmember>卡莉  真是天大的好消息
<2-2,Boardmember>That's incredible news, Carly.

25
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,580
<2-2,Boardmember>我们期待了解些亚洲市场的情况
<2-2,Boardmember>We'd hoped to hear something about Asia.

26
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,700
<2-2,Boardmember>但没想到已经进行到这一步了
<2-2,Boardmember>Had no idea plans were so far along.

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,280
<2-3,Carly>要知道亚洲嘛  总是犹抱琵琶半遮面
<2-3,Carly>Well, you know Asia. Nothing's done until it's done.

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,830
<2-4,Boardmember>卡莉  我很好奇
<2-4,Boardmember>Carly, I was wondering,

29
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,110
<2-4,Boardmember>能谈谈
<2-4,Boardmember>could you walk us through what

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,220
<2-4,Boardmember>对亚洲其他地区的想法吗
<2-4,Boardmember>you were thinking for other Asian territories?

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,170
<2-5,Carly>当然  印度的女性人口超过5亿
<2-5,Carly>Absolutely. India has over half a billion women.

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,390
<2-5,Carly>她们的购买力使这个国家
<2-5,Carly>In terms of spending power,

33
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,450
<2-5,Carly>成为世界上最有潜力的单体市场
<2-5,Carly>it's the single largest potential market in the world.

34
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,790
<2-5,Carly>我们收购了一家当地公司以
<2-5,Carly>Um, we have retained a local firm

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,150
<2-5,Carly>减少文化差异
<2-5,Carly>to ensure that cultural differences are respected.

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,970
<2-5,Carly>不过  我今天无法
<2-5,Carly>Um, however, I can't go into

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,380
<2-5,Carly>向各位展示更多细节了
<2-5,Carly>the specifics of my plan with you until tomorrow.

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,810
<2-5,Carly>现在又有一个会要用这间会议室
<2-5,Carly>Right now I have a meeting and I need the room.

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,070
<2-6,Boardmember 2>我们的会议可才刚开始
<2-6,Boardmember 2>We were just getting started.

40
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,260
<2-7,Carly>我知道  我真心致歉
<2-7,Carly>I know and I do apologize.

41
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,250
<2-7,Carly>是临时决定的
<2-7,Carly>It's last minute,

42
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,810
<2-7,Carly>有3位国务院官员前来协商
<2-7,Carly>but the meeting is with three state

43
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,840
<2-7,Carly>打通进军中国市场的渠道
<2-7,Carly>department officials to smooth the way for China.

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,070
<2-8,Boardmember>中国市场吗  真是太好了
<2-8,Boardmember>China? This is just incredible.

45
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,930
<2-9,Carly>-再联络  -谢谢你
<2-9,Carly>- We'll be in touch. - Thank you.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,550
<2-11,Robin>-怎么了  -我需要看医生
<2-11,Robin>- What is it? - I need a doctor.

47
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,440
<2-12,Carly>我的腿动不了了
<2-12,Carly>I can't move my leg.

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,660
<3-1,House>32岁女性
<3-1,House>32-year-old female,

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,670
<3-1,House>右腿麻痹  伴有疼痛  说吧
<3-1,House>paralysis and severe pain in her right quad. Go.

50
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,990
<3-2,Foreman>她怎么找到你的
<3-2,Foreman>How'd she get to you?

51
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,110
<3-3,House>她是索妮欧化妆品公司的首席执行官
<3-3,House>She's the C.E.O. of Sonyo Cosmetics.

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,340
<3-3,House>3位助理和15位副总裁
<3-3,House>Three assistants and 15 v.P.'s checked out

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,270
<3-3,House>研究决定她的医生人选
<3-3,House>who should be treating her.

54
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,350
<3-3,House>最终选了谁  我  殊途同归啊
<3-3,House>Who da man? I da man. I always suspected.

55
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,690
<3-4,Cameron>豪斯医生  虽然可能性渺茫
<3-4,Cameron>Dr. House, I know the chances are very slim,

56
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,540
<3-4,Cameron>但我想你也意识到
<3-4,Cameron>but I'm sure you recognize...

57
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,940
<3-4,Cameron>她可能和你一样  腿部有血栓
<3-4,Cameron>that she may have what you had, a clot in her thigh.

58
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,860
<3-5,Chase>太扯了
<3-5,Chase>A bit of a long shot.

59
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,510
<3-6,Foreman>会不会是椎间盘突出
<3-6,Foreman>What about a disk herniation?

60
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,870
<3-7,Cameron>不会吧  艾瑞克
<3-7,Cameron>I don't know, Eric.

61
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,120
<3-7,Cameron>如果她是椎间盘突出
<3-7,Cameron>If her disk were herniated,

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,400
<3-7,Cameron>她会全身疼痛  不是吗
<3-7,Cameron>she'd present with pain elsewhere, wouldn't she?

63
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,250
<3-8,Foreman>-是的  我想是  -没错
<3-8,Foreman>- Yeah, I suppose. - You're right.

64
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,200
<3-9,Cameron>最有可能是血栓  对吗  罗伯特
<3-9,Cameron>A clot's also the most deadly, right, Robert?

65
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,970
<3-10,Chase>对  一旦血栓破裂  她会中风并死亡
<3-10,Chase>True. The clot breaks off, she could stroke and die.

66
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,410
<3-11,Cameron>豪斯医生  我认为他们的判断是正确的
<3-11,Cameron>Dr. House, I believe that they're right-

67
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,130
<3-12,House>-别说了  -怎么了
<3-12,House>- Stop talking. - What?

68
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,540
<3-13,Cameron>嚼了本谈判手册  是不是
<3-13,Cameron>You read one of those negotiating books, didn't you?

69
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,590
<3-14,House>《谈判力》  《赢得谈判50法》
<3-14,House>Getting to Yes. Fifty Ways to Win an Argument.

70
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,190
<3-14,House>《合伙人漫游指南》
<3-14,House>Hitchhiker's Guide to Being a Pal.

71
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,230
<3-14,House>5秒钟内
<3-14,House>In five seconds,

72
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,040
<3-14,House>你控制他们认同了你的观点
<3-14,House>you just manipulated these two into agreeing with your point of view.

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,850
<3-14,House>伙计们  这是弱势方谈判策略
<3-14,House>Fellas, this is known as soft positional bargaining.

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,010
<3-14,House>没用的
<3-14,House>It's not gonna work.

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,300
<3-15,Cameron>豪斯医生  那你的意思是她有
<3-15,Cameron>Dr. House, are you saying that she doesn't have a clot,

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,430
<3-15,Cameron>还是没有血栓呢
<3-15,Cameron>or are you saying that if she does have a clot,

77
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,030
<3-15,Cameron>不需要给她用血液稀释剂  做血管造影吗
<3-15,Cameron>she doesn't need blood thinners and an angiogram?

78
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,380
<3-16,House>奇斯  给她用血液稀释剂
<3-16,House>Chase, put her on blood thinners.

79
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,590
<3-16,House>做个血管造影
<3-16,House>Do an angiogram.

80
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,400
<3-16,House>如果结果呈阴性  做脊椎核磁共振成像
<3-16,House>When that comes back negative, M.R.I. The spine.

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,840
<3-16,House>如果是阳性  开刀做腿部组织活检
<3-16,House>If that's clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg.

82
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,720
<3-17,Cameron>这才对
<3-17,Cameron>Excellent suggestion.

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,580
<3-18,House>少读书  多看电视
<3-18,House>Read less, more TV.

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,410
<4-1,Cuddy>很少有个人捐赠
<4-1,Cuddy>It's rare for an individual to make a donation...

85
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,250
<4-1,Cuddy>可以对医院这样庞大复杂的机构
<4-1,Cuddy>significant enough to impact an

86
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,680
<4-1,Cuddy>有如此之影响
<4-1,Cuddy>organization as large and unwieldy as a hospital.

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,130
<4-1,Cuddy>同时  这笔捐赠有一个附加条件
<4-1,Cuddy>This donation does come with one string,

88
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,460
<4-1,Cuddy>捐赠者将成为董事长
<4-1,Cuddy>that he be made chairman of the board.

89
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,690
<4-1,Cuddy>我认为这是一个合理要求
<4-1,Cuddy>I think that's a reasonable request.

90
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,430
<4-1,Cuddy>他有权获知
<4-1,Cuddy>I think he should have the right to know

91
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,380
<4-1,Cuddy>我们如何使用他的1亿美元
<4-1,Cuddy>what it is we do with his $ 100 million.

92
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,060
<4-1,Cuddy>欢迎我们的新董事长
<4-1,Cuddy>Please welcome our new chairman of the board,

93
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,140
<4-1,Cuddy>爱德华·沃格勒
<4-1,Cuddy>Edward Vogler.

94
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,080
<4-2,Vogler>谢谢
<4-2,Vogler>Thank you.

95
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,990
<4-2,Vogler>我18岁那年
<4-2,Vogler>When I was 18,

96
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,660
<4-2,Vogler>我父亲借给我两万块作大学学费
<4-2,Vogler>my dad loaned me $20,000 for a college tuition,

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,230
<4-2,Vogler>后来他才知道那是个错误
<4-2,Vogler>which he would have known was a mistake

98
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,180
<4-2,Vogler>因为我并没有上大学
<4-2,Vogler>had he known I wasn't actually in college.

99
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,310
<4-2,Vogler>我拿了他的钱
<4-2,Vogler>I took his money

100
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,750
<4-2,Vogler>投资于一个做小生意的朋友身上
<4-2,Vogler>and invested in a friend who had a little business.

101
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,740
<4-2,Vogler>当我父亲发现那笔钱的真实用处后
<4-2,Vogler>And when my dad found out what I had done with his money,

102
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,150
<4-2,Vogler>他就不怎么和我交流了
<4-2,Vogler>he and I didn't talk much after that.

103
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,010
<4-2,Vogler>但我朋友的生意做成了
<4-2,Vogler>But my friend's business took off,

104
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,400
<4-2,Vogler>我用获得的利润
<4-2,Vogler>and I used the profits from that

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,030
<4-2,Vogler>收购一家又一家公司
<4-2,Vogler>to buy another company and another.

106
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,670
<4-2,Vogler>我一定是很擅长做这个  眼光不错
<4-2,Vogler>And I must have been pretty good at it, had a good eye,

107
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,920
<4-2,Vogler>因为在我发觉之前
<4-2,Vogler>because before I knew it,

108
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,030
<4-2,Vogler>人们已经开始对我的公司报价了
<4-2,Vogler>people were making offers for my company.

109
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,910
<4-2,Vogler>大约1年前  我的公司上市
<4-2,Vogler>And about a year ago, I went public,

110
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,660
<4-2,Vogler>于是一夜之间  我身价十亿
<4-2,Vogler>and overnight I was worth a billion dollars.

111
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,670
<4-2,Vogler>所以  我回去看我父亲
<4-2,Vogler>So, I went to see my dad.

112
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,930
<4-2,Vogler>我承认  我想看到点儿什么
<4-2,Vogler>I'll admit. I wanted a little payback.

113
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,120
<4-2,Vogler>我想看他听到我成功了的表情
<4-2,Vogler>You know, kind of shove the win in his face.

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,960
<4-2,Vogler>于是  我回去了
<4-2,Vogler>So, I drove upstate,

115
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,300
<4-2,Vogler>坐在伴我长大的那个厨房里
<4-2,Vogler>and sat in the kitchen I grew up in,

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,570
<4-2,Vogler>他却没有反应
<4-2,Vogler>and, uh, he had no reaction.

117
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,510
<4-2,Vogler>不是他想那样  他甚至认不出我是谁
<4-2,Vogler>It wasn't his fault. He didn't even know who I was,

118
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,520
<4-2,Vogler>因为他的老年痴呆症恶化了
<4-2,Vogler>because his Alzheimer's had taken a turn for the worse,

119
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,320
<4-2,Vogler>用上最好的药和医护条件也无能为力
<4-2,Vogler>despite the best drugs and care out there.

120
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
<8-4,House>这也是我站在这里的原因
<8-4,House>And that is why I'm here.

121
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,930
<8-5,Cuddy>要是我对这家医院的捐赠
<8-5,Cuddy>What if my contribution to this hospital

122
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,140
<8-6,House>带来了癌症从无法治愈到有法可循的转变呢
<8-6,House>is the difference between no cure and a cure for cancer?

123
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,390
<4-2,Vogler>或是让
<4-2,Vogler>The difference between

124
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,460
<4-2,Vogler>一个35年来都认不出他妻子的男人
<4-2,Vogler>a man not recognizing his wife of 35 years

125
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,370
<4-2,Vogler>可以看着她妻子轻语
<4-2,Vogler>and being able to look at her and say,

126
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,770
<4-2,Vogler>"早安  亲爱的  我爱你"
<4-2,Vogler>"Good morning, honey. I love you."

127
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,190
<4-2,Vogler>只要有一种疾病还在伤害人类生命
<4-2,Vogler>If there's a disease out there killing people,

128
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,700
<4-2,Vogler>我就会给你一张空白支票去与之抗争
<4-2,Vogler>I am writing you a blank check to fight back.

129
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,650
<4-2,Vogler>一切  都会大为不同
<4-2,Vogler>So, things are going to change a lot.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,770
<5-1,Chase>你最好关掉手机
<5-1,Chase>We're gonna have to ask you for the cell phone.

131
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,880
<5-2,Carly>干你自己的活  少来烦我
<5-2,Carly>Do what you need to do. I'm okay.

132
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,130
<5-3,Chase>我可以肯定地告诉你
<5-3,Chase>I'm pretty sure

133
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,400
<5-3,Chase>X光机会毁掉你的手机
<5-3,Chase>my X-ray machine can take your phone in a fight.

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,070
<5-3,Chase>就像油煎一样
<5-3,Chase>It'll fry it.

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,990
<5-4,Carly>好吧
<5-4,Carly>Fine.

136
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,230
<5-5,Jenny >-她年龄多大  -32
<5-5,Jenny >- How old is she? - Thirty-two.

137
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,510
<5-7,Jenny>她这么年轻就当上了上市公司的首席执行官
<5-7,Jenny>Wow. And she's already the C.E.O. of a public company.

138
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,930
<5-8,Chase>她是个工作狂  好了  卡莉  别动
<5-8,Chase>She's a workaholic. Okay, Carly, hold still.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
<5-8,Chase>X光将会射过你的腿部
<5-8,Chase>The X-ray machine is gonna pass over your leg.

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,630
<5-9,Carly>好的
<5-9,Carly>Okay.

141
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,620
<5-10,Jenny>休假息时你都做些什么
<5-10,Jenny>What'd you do with your time off?

142
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,370
<5-11,Chase>去格施塔德滑雪
<5-11,Chase>Snowboarding in Gstaad.

143
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,340
<5-12,Jenny>是瑞士吧
<5-12,Jenny>Switzerland.

144
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,110
<5-13,Chase>你玩双板还是单板  你可以和我一起去
<5-13,Chase>Do you ski or board? You can come with if you like.

145
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,780
<5-14,Jenny>在周游世界之前
<5-14,Jenny>Maybe we should start with a drink

146
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,180
<5-14,Jenny>我们是不是该一起喝一杯
<5-14,Jenny>before we go around the world.

147
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,640
<5-15,Chase>你想和我喝一杯啊
<5-15,Chase>Oh, you wanna have a drink with me?

148
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,640
<5-15,Chase>很主动的  我喜欢
<5-15,Chase>Oh, very aggressive. I like that.

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,800
<6-1,Vogler>我想用做生意的方法管理这里
<6-1,Vogler>I wanna run this place like a business.

150
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,820
<6-2,Cuddy>怎么   在走廊里多放几个自动贩售机吗
<6-2,Cuddy>What, you want to put more vending machines in the hallway?

151
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,190
<6-2,Cuddy>或者赌博轮盘
<6-2,Cuddy>Maybe a roulette wheel?

152
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,340
<6-3,Vogler>不错的主意  但我是认真的
<6-3,Vogler>Nice one. But I'm serious.

153
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,990
<6-3,Vogler>你出售的产品是健康
<6-3,Vogler>The product that you're selling is good health.

154
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,410
<6-3,Vogler>这应该不难卖
<6-3,Vogler>It shouldn't be a tough sell.

155
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,170
<6-3,Vogler>要是你不想出售
<6-3,Vogler>If you don't wanna sell,

156
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,160
<6-3,Vogler>就意味着你不在乎人们能否得到你的产品
<6-3,Vogler>it means you don't care if people get your product.

157
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,470
<6-3,Vogler>你在乎消费者的健康吗
<6-3,Vogler>You care if people are healthy,

158
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,560
<6-3,Vogler>还是说你对自己的产品相当自信
<6-3,Vogler>or are you too proud for that?

159
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,990
<6-3,Vogler>那个人是谁
<6-3,Vogler>Who's that?

160
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,060
<6-4,Cuddy>是我们的众多医生中的一员
<6-4,Cuddy>Oh, that's just one of our doctors.

161
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,860
<6-5,Vogler>医生不是都要穿白大褂的吗
<6-5,Vogler>Aren't, uh, doctors supposed to wear lab coats?

162
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,970
<6-6,Cuddy>-他有点儿特别  -最受欢迎的人
<6-6,Cuddy>- He's different. - Everyone's buddy.

163
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,630
<6-9,Vogler>-不  不完全是  -那为什么他不穿
<6-9,Vogler>- No, not exactly. - Then why does he get away with it?

164
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,610
<6-10,Cuddy>只是一件外套而已  他是相当优秀的人才
<6-10,Cuddy>It's just a coat. He's very good.

165
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,290
<7-1,House>-说"啊 "  -啊
<7-1,House>- Say '"Ah." - Ah.

166
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,300
<7-3,House>再大声一点  就像要呕吐一样
<7-3,House>Now really belt it out, like you're gonna throw up.

167
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,580
<7-5,House>非常好
<7-5,House>Perfect.

168
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,700
<7-5,House>好了  这样就行了
<7-5,House>Okay, that's it.

169
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,030
<7-5,House>几天内我们就会知道
<7-5,House>We should know in a couple of days

170
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,650
<7-5,House>你儿子嗓子里长的是什么了
<7-5,House>what's growing in your son's throat.

171
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,800
<7-6,Ricky>在听吗
<7-6,Ricky>Hello?

172
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,850
<7-7,House>-他不能说话  -什么
<7-7,House>- He can't talk. - Excuse me?

173
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,870
<7-8,Ricky>-他做过个膝盖手术  -然后呢
<7-8,Ricky>- He had knee surgery. - Right?

174
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,440
<7-10,Ricky>大概一年前他做了手术  然后就不能说话了
<7-10,Ricky>About a year ago, and then he couldn't talk.

175
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,240
<7-11,House>对  没错  手术后他就不能说话
<7-11,House>Right. Yeah, well, that happens.

176
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,200
<7-11,House>要知道  在离声带那么"近"的地方做手术
<7-11,House>You know, it's very dangerous

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,480
<7-11,House>是很危险的
<7-11,House>operating so close to the vocal cords.

178
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,830
<7-11,House>好了  我们会把你儿子的细胞送去化验室
<7-11,House>Okay. Well, we'll send your kid's culture to the lab

179
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,830
<7-11,House>之后会有人联系你们
<7-11,House>and somebody will call you.

180
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,490
<7-13,House>只是想看看你爸爸的反应  有点怪
<7-13,House>Just wanted to see if your dad, you know- Bizarre.

181
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,660
<8-1,Cuddy>你要穿上白大褂
<8-1,Cuddy>I need you to wear your lab coat.

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,160
<8-2,House>我要两天时间来和比你年轻得多的姑娘鬼混
<8-2,House>I need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you,

183
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,540
<8-2,House>也就你一半岁数的
<8-2,House>like half your age.

184
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,530
<8-3,Cuddy>穿上白大褂
<8-3,Cuddy>Wear the coat.

185
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,970
<8-4,House>老天  看来有人早上被狠狠地扇了一巴掌
<8-4,House>Man, oh, man, someone got spanked real good this morning.

186
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,430
<8-5,Cuddy>为了一个肯捐1亿用于癌症治疗的人
<8-5,Cuddy>A guy gives $100 million to cure cancer.

187
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,270
<8-5,Cuddy>我们只做一个很小的让步  穿上外套吧
<8-5,Cuddy>A pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.

188
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,730
<8-6,House>癌症治疗吗
<8-6,House>Cure cancer?

189
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,040
<8-6,House>现在医院不再忙着
<8-6,House>Is the hospital getting out

190
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,950
<8-6,House>治疗病人了吗
<8-6,House>of the dull business of treating patients?

191
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,320
<8-7,Cuddy>你知道他不是那样的
<8-7,Cuddy>You know that's not what he's doing.

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,660
<8-8,House>我很清楚他在干什么
<8-8,House>I know exactly what he's doing.

193
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,450
<8-8,House>他在利用我们做临床试验
<8-8,House>He's using us to run clinical trials.

194
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,140
<8-9,Cuddy>真可耻  用这么独特的方式救人
<8-9,Cuddy>Oh, shame on him, saving lives like that.

195
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,550
<8-9,Cuddy>这是不道德的
<8-9,Cuddy>It's unethical.

196
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,290
<8-10,House>你也要加入吗  我还以为咱们是一伙的
<8-10,House>Oh, are you coming in too? I thought I had you convinced.

197
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,000
<8-11,Cuddy>临床试验能拯救成千上万条生命
<8-11,Cuddy>Clinical trials save thousands of lives.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,230
<8-12,House>他这是把病人当小白鼠用
<8-12,House>He's using patients as guinea pigs.

199
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,190
<8-13,Cuddy>医药公司一直都这么做
<8-13,Cuddy>Pharmaceutical companies do that every day.

200
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,930
<8-14,House>原来我们这里是医药公司啊
<8-14,House>Are we a pharmaceutical company?

201
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,180
<8-14,House>这样做会把为了痊愈不顾一切的病人推向
<8-14,House>We're gonna wind up pressuring desperate patients...

202
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,110
<8-14,House>对他们不利的一端  而我们坐收渔翁之利
<8-14,House>into choices that are bad for them, good for us.

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,840
<8-14,House>这样做将会降低护理效果
<8-14,House>We're gonna compromise patient care.

204
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,520
<8-15,Cuddy>我在跟哪个该死的说话呢
<8-15,Cuddy>Who the hell am I talking to?

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,860
<8-15,Cuddy>你怎么突然关心起道德缺失了
<8-15,Cuddy>Suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you?

206
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,540
<8-16,House>有意思的是你突然不在乎道德缺失了
<8-16,House>What's interesting is it suddenly doesn't bother you.

207
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,210
<8-17,Cuddy>就是说  如果你忽略道德问题  救了一个病人
<8-17,Cuddy>So, if you ignore ethics to save one person

208
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:21,980
<8-17,Cuddy>就令人钦佩
<8-17,Cuddy>it's admirable,

209
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,310
<8-17,Cuddy>但如果你这么做救了一千人  就是混蛋
<8-17,Cuddy>but if you do it to save a thousand, you're a bastard.

210
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,410
<8-17,Cuddy>他只是升级你的游戏规则而已
<8-17,Cuddy>All he's done is taken your game and gone pro.

211
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,510
<8-18,House>他不仅会干掉病人
<8-18,House>He's not gonna kill a few patients.

212
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,350
<8-18,House>还会毁掉这家医院的
<8-18,House>He's gonna kill this hospital.

213
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,180
<8-19,Cuddy>他花了3秒钟打量你
<8-19,Cuddy>It took him three seconds to size you up.

214
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,720
<8-19,Cuddy>惊喜啊  他竟然不喜欢你
<8-19,Cuddy>And surprise, he doesn't like you.

215
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,360
<8-19,Cuddy>穿上那该死的白大褂
<8-19,Cuddy>Wear the damn coat.

216
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,220
<8-19,Cuddy>你好  我是  福曼医生
<8-19,Cuddy>Hello. I'm, uh, Dr. Foreman.

217
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,570
<9-1,Foreman>豪斯医生的同事
<9-1,Foreman>I work with Dr. House.

218
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,530
<9-1,Foreman>我们的初步化验显示你没什么问题
<9-1,Foreman>Our initial tests say you're fine.

219
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,790
<9-1,Foreman>我们认为你的血栓自行消失了
<9-1,Foreman>We think you had a clot, but it resolved on its own.

220
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,590
<9-1,Foreman>所以观察一夜确认一下
<9-1,Foreman>So, we're gonna keep you overnight to be safe,

221
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,180
<9-1,Foreman>明天就可以回家了
<9-1,Foreman>and you can go back home tomorrow...

222
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,490
<9-1,Foreman>或者回去继续工作
<9-1,Foreman>or back to work.

223
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,620
<9-1,Foreman>你还好吗
<9-1,Foreman>Hey, are you okay?

224
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,750
<9-1,Foreman>快进来  需要给她静脉注射吗啡  赶快
<9-1,Foreman>Get in here! I need a line in her. I.V. Morphine, stat!

225
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,680
<10-1,Chase>搞明白新董事长想干什么吗
<10-1,Chase>You get any read on the new chairman of the board?

226
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,290
<10-2,Foreman>当然  他占了你的车位
<10-2,Foreman>Yeah, he took your parking space.

227
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,490
<10-3,Cameron>这可未必是坏消息
<10-3,Cameron>It's not necessarily bad news.

228
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,600
<10-4,Foreman>你看过重播的《盖里甘的岛》吗[电视剧名]
<10-4,Foreman>Do you ever watch Gilligan's Island reruns...

229
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,260
<10-4,Foreman>难道你真的认为
<10-4,Foreman>and really, really think

230
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,640
<10-4,Foreman>他们这次能逃出岛去吗
<10-4,Foreman>they're gonna get off the island this time?

231
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,040
<10-5,Cameron>我们还是做自我介绍好了  这又不伤人
<10-5,Cameron>We should introduce ourselves. It couldn't hurt.

232
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,520
<10-6,House>给他烤个蛋糕吧
<10-6,House>Make him a Bundt cake.

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,740
<10-6,House>疼痛评分达到10的病人
<10-6,House>A patient hit a 10 on the pain scale.

234
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,030
<10-6,House>怎么解释这个问题
<10-6,House>What would explain that?

235
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,860
<10-7,Chase>腿部没有血栓  血管造影显示没有血栓
<10-7,Chase>There was no clot in her leg. The angio was totally clean.

236
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,550
<10-8,House>那肌肉活检的结果呢
<10-8,House>What about the muscle biopsy?

237
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,260
<10-9,Chase>排除了神经源性异常和肌原性异常
<10-9,Chase>No neurogenic or myopathic abnormalities.

238
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,880
<10-10,Foreman>毛线虫病的结果也是阴性
<10-10,Foreman>She was also negative for trichinosis.

239
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,430
<10-10,Foreman>也不是弓形虫病和结节性多动脉炎
<10-10,Foreman>No toxoplasmosis or polyarteritis nodosa.

240
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,270
<10-11,Cameron>罗伯特  她的沉降率是多少
<10-11,Cameron>Robert, what was her sedimentation rate?

241
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,240
<10-12,Chase>正常  艾莉森
<10-12,Chase>Normal, Allison.

242
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,020
<10-12,Chase>所以  没有炎症  也没有免疫反应
<10-12,Chase>Therefore, no inflammation, no immunologic response.

243
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,790
<10-13,Cameron>介意告诉我具体数字吗
<10-13,Cameron>Do you mind sharing that number with me?

244
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,550
<10-14,Chase>15  艾莉森
<10-14,Chase>Fifteen, Allison.

245
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,170
<10-15,Cameron>-你在嘲笑我吗  -哪有  艾莉森
<10-15,Cameron>- Are you mocking me? - Duh, Allison.

246
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,050
<10-16,Foreman>我只是建议从多个角度进行考虑
<10-16,Foreman>I'm just suggesting we look outside the box.

247
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,570
<10-17,Cameron>如果她的沉降率升高了呢
<10-17,Cameron>What if her sed rate is elevated?

248
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,310
<10-18,Chase>好吧  那让我们好好换角度考虑
<10-18,Chase>Well, let's go further outside the box.

249
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,240
<10-18,Chase>假设血管造影曾经显示有血栓
<10-18,Chase>Let's say the angio revealed a clot.

250
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
<10-18,Chase>后来我们治好了血栓
<10-18,Chase>And then let's say we treated that clot,

251
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,620
<10-18,Chase>而现在她感觉好多了
<10-18,Chase>and now she's all better

252
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,120
<10-18,Chase>还就我装作这样感谢我
<10-18,Chase>and personally thanked me by performing-

253
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,060
<10-19,Cameron>我的埃丽莎姨妈住在费城
<10-19,Cameron>My Aunt Elyssa lives in Philadelphia.

254
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,980
<10-20,House>到讲故事的时间了  我来讲讲我爸
<10-20,House>Oh, it's story time. Let me get my "Baba."

255
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,930
<10-21,Cameron>她的正常体温是华氏96.2度
<10-21,Cameron>Her normal temperature is 96.2,

256
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,960
<10-21,Cameron>而不是像你我这样的98.6
<10-21,Cameron>not 98.6 like you and me.

257
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,730
<10-21,Cameron>如果她的体温到了华氏98.6度
<10-21,Cameron>If her temperature were 98.6,

258
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,880
<10-21,Cameron>就说明她发烧了
<10-21,Cameron>she'd have a fever.

259
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,840
<10-21,Cameron>我想知道你是否认为
<10-21,Cameron>I'm just wondering if you think

260
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,190
<10-21,Cameron>我们应该把相同的理论用于卡莉的沉降率上
<10-21,Cameron>we could apply the same logic to Carly's sed rate.

261
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,380
<10-22,House>荒谬
<10-22,House>It's absurd.

262
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,590
<10-22,House>我喜欢这个主意
<10-22,House>I love it.

263
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,620
<10-23,Cameron>如果对卡莉来说  15比正常数值要高
<10-23,Cameron>If 15 is high for Carly,

264
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,220
<10-23,Cameron>那她就有炎症
<10-23,Cameron>then she has inflammation.

265
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,790
<10-24,House>也就有可能是癌症  我去找威尔森
<10-24,House>Which could, in turn, mean cancer. I'll talk to Wilson.

266
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,320
<10-24,House>下次  跳过埃丽莎姨妈那段
<10-24,House>Next time, skip Aunt Elyssa.

267
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,260
<11-1,Wilson>恐怕你说的是原发性骨癌
<11-1,Wilson>You're probably talking about a primary bone cancer.

268
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,790
<11-1,Wilson>这种病很难发现
<11-1,Wilson>It could be tricky to detect.

269
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,220
<11-1,Wilson>我们需要给她做个骨扫描
<11-1,Wilson>We'll need a bone scan.

270
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,940
<11-2,House>这就是我为什么来找你这个肿瘤学家
<11-2,House>That's why I'm talking to an oncologist.

271
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,660
<11-3,Wilson>是啊  除了部门会议和预算报告
<11-3,Wilson>Sure. I've nothing better to do

272
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,860
<11-3,Wilson>我没什么事可做
<11-3,Wilson>besides departmental meetings and budget reports.

273
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,480
<11-3,Wilson>新官上任三把火啊  董事局的  知道吗
<11-3,Wilson>New chairman of the board, you know.

274
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,870
<11-4,House>我可没听说
<11-4,House>Oh, I hadn't heard.

275
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,540
<11-5,Wilson>-没错  临床试验论  -道德缺失
<11-5,Wilson>- Right. Clinical trials. - Completely unethical.

276
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,600
<11-6,House>还有一个针对你的凶兆
<11-6,House>And a very bad omen for you.

277
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,600
<11-7,Wilson>研究治愈非洲锥虫病的经费
<11-7,Wilson>There's not much money in curing

278
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,030
<11-7,Wilson>减少了
<11-7,Wilson>African sleeping sickness.

279
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,640
<11-8,House>错了  我看过市面上所有的恐怖片
<11-8,House>No. I have seen every scary movie ever made.

280
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,190
<11-8,House>一对6岁的双胞胎站在满是血的电梯前
<11-8,House>Six-year-old twins in front of an elevator of blood.

281
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,520
<11-8,House>男童合唱  这些才是凶兆呢
<11-8,House>Boys' choirs. Those are bad omens.

282
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,990
<11-8,House>还有更俗的  亿万富翁想和女人上床
<11-8,House>This is much more mundane. A billionaire wants to get laid.

283
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,090
<11-9,Wilson>亿万富翁买电影厂是为了女人
<11-9,Wilson>Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid.

284
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,850
<11-9,Wilson>买医院是为了声誉
<11-9,Wilson>They buy hospitals to get respect.

285
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,170
<11-10,House>-那为什么他们要个好声誉  -找女人上床
<11-10,House>- And the reason you want respect? - To get laid.

286
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,510
<11-11,Wilson>好的  那么  让我们像亿万富翁一样思考
<11-11,Wilson>Okay then. Just gotta think like a billionaire.

287
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,090
<11-12,House>想想看  有个巨大又可怕的改变发生了
<11-12,House>Let's see. There'll be big, scary changes

288
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,530
<11-12,House>然后  富翁说 "卡梅隆医生
<11-12,House>and then, "Oh, Dr. Cameron,

289
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,600
<11-12,House>我们在我的G5私人飞机上
<11-12,House>we should have dinner

290
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,610
<11-12,House>一边吃晚餐一边讨论一下你的未来吧"
<11-12,House>to discuss your future on my G5 private jet."

291
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,840
<11-13,Wilson>行了吧  你知道这里给你的条件有多好
<11-13,Wilson>Come on. You know how good you have it here.

292
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,210
<11-14,House>是  是  我就是大佬  头儿  教父
<11-14,House>Yes, I'm the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy.

293
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,760
<11-15,Wilson>只在这里  你能仅对你感兴趣的病案挑三拣四
<11-15,Wilson>You do the cases you wanna do when you wanna do them.

294
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520
<11-15,Wilson>-其他地方可没这特权  -放轻松
<11-15,Wilson>- You're not gonna have that anywhere else. - Relax.

295
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,770
<11-16,House>我经历过这家医院三次易主了
<11-16,House>I've been through three regime changes in this hospital.

296
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,200
<11-16,House>每一次都会遇到一样的问题
<11-16,House>Every time same story.

297
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,780
<11-17,Wilson>我就说一句  低调
<11-17,Wilson>Just keep your head down. That's all I'm saying.

298
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,410
<11-17,Wilson>-还有穿上白大褂  -那东西让我浑身发痒
<11-17,Wilson>- And put on your coat. - It itches.

299
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,120
<11-18,House>那你会不会帮我做骨扫描啊
<11-18,House>So, you gonna do this bone scan for me, or what?

300
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,030
<11-19,Wilson>我做
<11-19,Wilson>Yes.

301
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,800
<12-1,House>辛普森医生  听说了吗  新老板
<12-1,House>Dr. Simpson, did you hear? New management.

302
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,540
<12-1,House>我正在考虑转到整形外科来
<12-1,House>I'm thinking of switching to orthopedics.

303
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,700
<12-1,House>你们现在按摩一次挣多少
<12-1,House>How much do you guys get for a massage now?

304
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,660
<12-1,House>在没干好的情况下
<12-1,House>Without the happy ending.

305
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,810
<12-2,Simpson>豪斯医生  你想要干什么
<12-2,Simpson>Dr. House, what do you want?

306
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,050
<12-3,House>你还记得一个叫范德米尔的家伙吗
<12-3,House>Do you remember a guy named Van Der Meer?

307
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,290
<12-3,House>他有点内向  你修好了他的 A.C.L
<12-3,House>Not a big talker. You fixed his A.C.L.

308
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,020
<12-4,Simpson>没有  至少我的医疗事故责任险没告诉我
<12-4,Simpson>No, not according to my medical malpractice premiums.

309
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,450
<12-5,House>手术中有低血压症状出现吗
<12-5,House>Didn't get hypotensive during surgery?

310

<12-5,House>中风  或者神经连接性降低
<12-5,House>No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?

311
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,970
<12-6,Simpson>怎么  你现在掺和进来了吗
<12-6,Simpson>What, you're gonna get involved now?

312
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,030
<12-7,House>我没有掺合进来
<12-7,House>I'm not involved.

313
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,900
<12-7,House>有个家伙带他儿子来门诊了
<12-7,House>A guy brought his son into the clinic.

314
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,310
<12-8,Simpson>我可没碰他儿子
<12-8,Simpson>I didn't touch the son.

315
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,240
<12-8,Simpson>我一点责任都没有
<12-8,Simpson>I'm not taking any responsibility there.

316
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,070
<12-9,House>他儿子很好  好得闭不上嘴
<12-9,House>The son's fine. Can't shut him up.

317
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,320
<12-9,House>父亲没有表现出脑皮层或者言语中枢病症吗
<12-9,House>Dad show any symptoms of cortical disease? Wernicke's?

318
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,430
<12-10,Simpson>没有  什么都没有
<12-10,Simpson>No. Nothing.

319
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,420
<12-10,Simpson>因为什么也没发现  所以我们这样处理
<12-10,Simpson>That's why we settled because we couldn't find anything.

320
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,370
<12-10,Simpson>那家伙为此得到了一百万美元
<12-10,Simpson>The guy got over a million dollars.

321
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,730
<12-10,Simpson>别告诉我他还在抱怨
<12-10,Simpson>Don't tell me he's complaining.

322
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,390
<12-11,House>他连嘘声都发不出
<12-11,House>He's not saying boo.

323
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,390
<13-1,Robin>您父亲想知道
<13-1,Robin>Your father wants to know

324
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,610
<13-1,Robin>您何时结束旅行回家
<13-1,Robin>when you'll be back from your trip.

325
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,600
<13-2,Carly>回复邮件告诉他  旅行时间超出了预计
<13-2,Carly>E-mail back it's taking longer than I thought.

326
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,870
<13-2,Carly>没有必要让他见到我这个样子
<13-2,Carly>He doesn't need to see me like this.

327
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,140
<13-3,Robin>和您兄弟说吗
<13-3,Robin>What about your brother?

328
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,860
<13-4,Carly>不要说
<13-4,Carly>No.

332
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,590
<13-8,Carly>这家医院有两个威尔森医生
<13-8,Carly>There are two Dr. Wilsons in this hospital,

333
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,970
<13-8,Carly>一个是眼科医生  一个是肿瘤科医生
<13-8,Carly>one in ophthalmology and one in cancer.

334
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,690
<13-8,Carly>我的眼睛没问题
<13-8,Carly>My eyes are fine,

335
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,330
<13-8,Carly>所以我猜你是来告诉我  我得了癌症
<13-8,Carly>so I'm guessing you're here to tell me that I have cancer.

336
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,820
<13-9,Wilson>你没有骨癌
<13-9,Wilson>There is no cancer in your bone.

337
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,330
<13-10,Carly>你也没有笑容
<13-10,Carly>You're not smiling.

338
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,690
<13-11,Wilson>有一种东西叫做牵涉性疼痛
<13-11,Wilson>There's something called referred pain.

339
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,590
<13-11,Wilson>可能是你身体的某部位有癌症
<13-11,Wilson>You could have cancer in one part of your body...

340
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,910
<13-11,Wilson>但在其他部位产生症状
<13-11,Wilson>that presents in another.

341
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,580
<13-11,Wilson>根据年龄和家族病史
<13-11,Wilson>Given your age and your family history,

342
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,320
<13-11,Wilson>我想你的结肠有些问题
<13-11,Wilson>I'm thinking your colon.

343
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,780
<13-11,Wilson>太好了
<13-11,Wilson>Great.

344
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,710
<13-12,Carly>我妈妈去世时我在哥伦比亚  现在报应来了
<13-12,Carly>I was at Columbia when my mom died. Now there's a blast.

345
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,480
<13-12,Carly>那些清理出的呕吐物  都来找我了
<13-12,Carly>Cleaning up her vomit, and then running to my econ final.

346
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,700
<13-12,Carly>你看
<13-12,Carly>Look.

347
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,230
<13-12,Carly>要是我没几天  你就给我点儿药
<13-12,Carly>If I'm a short-timer, give me drugs.

348
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,880
<13-12,Carly>我要回去工作  死在我的岗位上
<13-12,Carly>I'll go back to work. I'll die there.

349
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,160
<13-13,Wilson>我们可以通过一个快速检查得知
<13-13,Wilson>Whoa. There's a very quick test to see

350
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,260
<13-13,Wilson>你是否患有结肠癌  做个结肠镜检查
<13-13,Wilson>if you even have it- a colonoscopy.

351
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,020
<13-14,Carly>我知道那个检查怎么做
<13-14,Carly>I know how you do that test.

352
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,450
<13-15,Wilson>如果你患有结肠癌  我们有治疗方案
<13-15,Wilson>If you have colon cancer, we can treat it.

353
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,230
<13-15,Wilson>现在还是早期
<13-15,Wilson>It's early.

354
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,610
<13-16,Carly>他们也是这样和我妈妈说的
<13-16,Carly>That's what they told my mom.

355
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,260
<13-16,Carly>然后6个月后她就去世了
<13-16,Carly>She was dead six months later.

356
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,200
<13-17,Wilson>你很聪明  却做了个不明智的决定
<13-17,Wilson>You're a smart person about to make a very bad decision.

357
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,610
<13-17,Wilson>癌症治疗在这12年中有很大发展
<13-17,Wilson>You know, cancer treatment's come a long way in 12 years,

358
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,640
<13-17,Wilson>但如果你现在不做检查...
<13-17,Wilson>but if you don't do this now...

359
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,940
<13-18,Carly>我不想让别人那样看我
<13-18,Carly>I don't wanna be looked at.

360
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,440
<13-19,Wilson>还有别的方法
<13-19,Wilson>There is another way.

361
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,760
<13-19,Wilson>可以做个虚拟结肠镜检查
<13-19,Wilson>We could do a virtual colonoscopy.

362
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,180
<13-19,Wilson>大致上来讲  就是给你的结肠做一个CT
<13-19,Wilson>Basically, we do a C. T. Scan of your colon.

363
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,460
<13-19,Wilson>是非侵入性的
<13-19,Wilson>It's noninvasive.

364
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,420
<13-19,Wilson>但价格昂贵  我想这对你来讲不成问题
<13-19,Wilson>But it's very expensive. I'm assuming that's not a problem.

365
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,430
<13-19,Wilson>快同意吧
<13-19,Wilson>Say yes.

366
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,150
<13-19,Wilson>范德米尔先生
<13-19,Wilson>Mr. Van Der Meer.

367
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,870
<13-19,Wilson>什么
<13-19,Wilson>What?

369
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,820
<14-1,House>放轻松  瑞奇会"没事"的
<14-1,House>Relax. Ricky's gonna be just "Finkf."

370
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,600
<14-1,House>他得了脓毒性咽喉炎
<14-1,House>Strep throat.

371
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,610
<14-1,House>这是张抗生素处方
<14-1,House>Here's a prescription for an antibiotic.

372
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,450
<14-1,House>过段时间他就会好了
<14-1,House>He should be all better in a few days.

373
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,400
<14-1,House>只不过  有点痛
<14-1,House>Although, this might sting a little.

374
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,470
<14-1,House>我盼望着与你早日相见
<14-1,House>I wanna see you again real soon.

375
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,930
<14-1,House>虚拟结肠镜检查显示没有任何问题
<14-1,House>Virtual colonoscopy was clean.

376
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,200
<15-1,Wilson>她没有患结肠癌
<15-1,Wilson>No colon cancer.

377
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,390
<15-2,House>怎么不做我们常规的老式结肠镜检查
<15-2,House>What happened to our regular, old-fashioned colonoscopy?

378
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,180
<15-3,Wilson>做了那么多检查让她不舒服
<15-3,Wilson>She was uncomfortable doing any more tests.

379
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,790
<15-3,Wilson>我不得不说服她做这个
<15-3,Wilson>I had to convince her to do that one.

380
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,040
<15-4,House>你经常遇到这样的状况吗
<15-4,House>Do you get that often?

381
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,650
<15-4,House>女性患者宁愿死也不愿意让你看到裸体
<15-4,House>Women would rather die than get naked with you?

382
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,290
<15-5,Wilson>她很害怕
<15-5,Wilson>She's scared.

383
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,810
<15-6,House>她不怕检查  是怕让她难堪的检查
<15-6,House>But not of tests. Just embarrassing ones.

384
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,050
<15-7,Wilson>是啊
<15-7,Wilson>Yeah.

385
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,850
<16-1,House>不是炎症
<16-1,House>It's not an inflammatory process.

386
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,130
<16-1,House>不是血块  因为奇斯的血管造影说不是
<16-1,House>It's not a clot, because Chase's angio says so.

387
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,710
<16-1,House>也不是癌症  因为她的骨头一点问题没有
<16-1,House>And it's not cancer, because her tush is perfect.

388
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,910
<16-1,House>还有谁能讲个埃丽莎姨妈的奇特事件
<16-1,House>Anybody else got an Aunt Elyssa with weird stuff?

389
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,810
<16-2,Cameron>或许我们应该查查...
<16-2,Cameron>Maybe it's worth looking into-

390
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,820
<16-3,House>我记得你说卡莉的血管造影是正常的
<16-3,House>I thought you said Carly's angio was clean.

391
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,250
<16-4,Chase>当时是正常的
<16-4,Chase>It was clean.

392
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,730
<16-5,House>你们看得出问题所在吗
<16-5,House>You guys see the problem here?

393
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,530
<16-6,Foreman>没有任何反常迹象
<16-6,Foreman>There's no indication of any abnormalities.

394
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,040
<16-6,Foreman>没有病变  没有骨质增生  没有...
<16-6,Foreman>No lesions, no spurs, no mastis...

395
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,450
<16-7,House>她的脚趾长得有问题  向后伸
<16-7,House>Her toes are screwed up. They're backwards.

396
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,870
<16-7,House>你们知道要做多少次手术
<16-7,House>You guys know how much surgery

397
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,440
<16-7,House>才能把它们扳回来吗
<16-7,House>it's gonna take to swap 'em back?

398
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,220
<16-8,Chase>你在说什么
<16-8,Chase>What are you talking about?

399
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,880
<16-9,House>好吧  要不就是她确实有两只左脚
<16-9,House>Well, either she literally has two left feet,

400
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,840
<16-9,House>要不就是你的血管造影做错脚了
<16-9,House>or you angioed the wrong leg.

401
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,990
<16-10,Chase>不可能  不可能是...
<16-10,Chase>That's impossible. It can't be...

402
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,830
<16-11,House>或者是珍妮弄错了
<16-11,House>Or maybe it was Jenny.

403
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,750
<16-11,House>为什么是住院实习医生签的放射报告
<16-11,House>How come some resident signed this radiology report?

404
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,750
<16-11,House>你当时不在吗
<16-11,House>Were you even in the room?

405
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,730
<16-12,Chase>-我去重做她的血管造影  -你什么都别做
<16-12,Chase>- I'll redo her angio- - You'll do nothing!

406
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,810
<16-13,House>福曼  你去做血管造影
<16-13,House>Foreman, you do the angiogram.

407
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,090
<16-14,Chase>我居然做错了
<16-14,Chase>I can't believe I did that.

408
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,020
<17-1,Carly>为什么我们要重做血管造影
<17-1,Carly>Why do we have to redo the angiogram?

409
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,390
<17-2,Foreman>-第一次造影结果里有阴影  -阴影
<17-2,Foreman>- There was a shadow on the first test result. - Shadow?

410
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,060
<17-3,Carly>阴影意味着可能是血块  对吗
<17-3,Carly>A shadow means there could be a blood clot, right?

411
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,960
<17-3,Carly>我读过《康的当代疗法》
<17-3,Carly>I read Conn's Current Therapy.

412
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
<17-4,Foreman>那的确是一部引人入胜的著作
<17-4,Foreman>A real page-turner.

413
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,910
<17-4,Foreman>不过不是那类阴影
<17-4,Foreman>No, it wasn't that kind of shadow.

414
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,570
<17-5,Carly>-我的胸疼  -是注射的追踪剂的副作用
<17-5,Carly>- My chest hurts. - It's from the tracer I injected.

415
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,210
<17-6,Foreman>可能还会恶心
<17-6,Foreman>You might also get a little nauseous

416
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,920
<17-6,Foreman>或闻到金属味  都是正常反应
<17-6,Foreman>or have a metallic taste. All normal.

417
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,770
<17-7,Carly>我经常跑步  不应该有这样的感觉
<17-7,Carly>I'm a runner. I shouldn't feel like this.

418
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,830
<17-8,Foreman>卡莉  我正在检查你的器官  而且...
<17-8,Foreman>Carly, I'm looking at your vitals right now and...

419
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,950
<17-9,Carly>-喘不上气了  -卡莉
<17-9,Carly>- I can't breathe. - Carly?

420
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,980
<17-10,Foreman>胸
<17-10,Foreman>My chest.

421
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,380
<17-11,Carly>胸
<17-11,Carly>My chest.

422
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,640
<17-12,Foreman>呼吸停止  呼叫求助
<17-12,Foreman>Respiratory arrest. Call code.

423
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,450
<17-12,Foreman>-怎么了  -她要憋死了
<17-12,Foreman>- What do you got? - She's drowning.

425
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,110
<18-1,Cameron>福曼做了胸腔穿刺
<18-1,Cameron>Foreman did a thoracentesis

426
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,460
<18-1,Cameron>来排出她肺部的积液
<18-1,Cameron>to drain the fluid from her lungs.

427
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,220
<18-1,Cameron>她现在情况稳定  他们把积液送去实验室了
<18-1,Cameron>She's stable. They sent the fluid to the lab.

428
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,620
<18-1,Cameron>几小时内就会有结果
<18-1,Cameron>It'll be back in a few hours.

429
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,930
<18-1,Cameron>你可以放心  奇斯的错误没有对她造成伤害
<18-1,Cameron>You'll be happy to know Chase's mistake didn't cost her.

430
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,730
<18-1,Cameron>血管造影结果显示没有血块
<18-1,Cameron>Angio revealed no clot.

431
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,780
<18-2,House>我很庆幸
<18-2,House>I'm thrilled.

437
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,920
<18-2,House>好吧  你看  你就是太固执
<18-2,House>Okay, see, now you're just being stubborn.

438
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,330
<19-1,Wilson>天冷了  这是个穿白大褂的完美理由吧
<19-1,Wilson>It's cold. It's a perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat.

439
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,290
<19-2,House>卡莉需要做心脏移植
<19-2,House>Carly needs a heart transplant.

440
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,650
<19-3,Wilson>胸腔穿刺的积液化验结果说的
<19-3,Wilson>Thoracentesis revealed a transudate?

441
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,540
<19-4,House>我还没有拿到结果
<19-4,House>I haven't gotten it back yet.

442
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,350
<19-5,Wilson>她的放射性核素扫描射血分数
<19-5,Wilson>Her MUGA scan, what was the ejection fraction?

443
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,980
<19-5,Wilson>或许你可以用外科手术治疗
<19-5,Wilson>Maybe you could treat it surgically.

444
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,220
<19-6,House>我没有做放射性核素扫描
<19-6,House>I haven't done the MUGA.

445
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,590
<19-7,Wilson>那你怎么知道她需要做心脏移植
<19-7,Wilson>How do you know she needs a heart transplant?

446
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,340
<19-8,House>我今天得到了灵性的指引
<19-8,House>I got my aura read today.

447
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,520
<19-8,House>它告诉我我身边的某人心碎了
<19-8,House>It said someone close to me had a broken heart.

448
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,650
<19-9,Wilson>什么时候开始我和你要用密码说话
<19-9,Wilson>Since when do I need the secret pass code to talk to you?

449
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,500
<19-10,House>我什么都不能告诉你  这是职业责任问题
<19-10,House>I can't tell you anything. Professional responsibility.

450
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,050
<19-11,Wilson>就好像你在乎过这个似的
<19-11,Wilson>Like that matters to you.

451
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,540
<19-12,House>不是我的职业责任  是你的
<19-12,House>Not my professional responsibility, yours.

452
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,670
<19-12,House>新政权下  你也得小心过日子
<19-12,House>New regime. You gotta keep your head down too.

453
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,600
<19-13,Wilson>这真是好主意
<19-13,Wilson>Now that's good thinking,

454
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,330
<19-13,Wilson>因为我要在你说完话后
<19-13,Wilson>because I was gonna go right to Cuddy...

455
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,120
<19-13,Wilson>直接去找卡迪出卖你
<19-13,Wilson>and rat you out as soon as you were done talking.

456
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,680
<19-14,House>我不是说你想那么做  而是说那是你的责任
<19-14,House>I'm not saying you want to. I'm saying you'd be obligated to.

457
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,060
<19-15,Wilson>因为我在董事会有一席之地吗
<19-15,Wilson>Because of my position on the board?

458
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,610
<19-15,Wilson>还因为我在移植委员会有一席之地
<19-15,Wilson>Because of my position on the transplant committee?

459
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,070
<19-15,Wilson>你这么做总得有个理由  你得告诉我
<19-15,Wilson>Hey, you brought this up for a reason. You need to talk to me.

460
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,060
<19-16,House>我不能
<19-16,House>I can't.

461
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,790
<19-17,Wilson>你确定你做的事情是正确的
<19-17,Wilson>You sure you're doing the right thing?

462
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,280
<19-18,House>我已经有了几个相当合理化的原因
<19-18,House>I've come up with a few really great rationalizations.

463
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,660
<19-19,Chase>抱歉打断你们  我们有个麻烦
<19-19,Chase>Sorry to interrupt. We have a problem.

464
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,350
<19-19,Chase>胸腔穿刺的结果出来了
<19-19,Chase>Thoracentesis revealed a transudate.

465
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,060
<19-20,Cameron>我们多确认了一下
<19-20,Cameron>We did an echo.

466
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,480
<19-20,Cameron>她现在是严重充血性心力衰竭
<19-20,Cameron>She's in severe congestive heart failure.

467
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,210
<19-20,Cameron>她需要做心脏移植
<19-20,Cameron>She needs a heart transplant.

468
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,310
<19-20,Cameron>需要马上把她列入等待名单
<19-20,Cameron>We'll get her on the list immediately.

469
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,050
<19-21,House>她已经在名单上了
<19-21,House>She's already on the list.

470
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,620
<20-1,Cuddy>进来
<20-1,Cuddy>Come in.

471
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,350
<20-2,Vogler>谢谢
<20-2,Vogler>Thanks.

472
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,620
<20-2,Vogler>什么是医学诊断科
<20-2,Vogler>What is a department of Diagnostic Medicine?

473
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,120
<20-3,Cuddy>那是豪斯医生的科室
<20-3,Cuddy>That's Dr. House's department.

474
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,940
<20-3,Cuddy>他们专攻其他医生解决不了的病案
<20-3,Cuddy>They deal with cases that other doctors can't figure out.

475
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,370
<20-4,Vogler>那可是个财政上的黑洞
<20-4,Vogler>It's a financial black hole.

476
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,110
<20-4,Vogler>这个科室每年花费3百万美元
<20-4,Vogler>The department costs us three million a year...

477
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,700
<20-4,Vogler>每周才医治一名病人
<20-4,Vogler>to treat one patient a week.

478
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,200
<20-5,Cuddy>他每周救一名病人
<20-5,Cuddy>He saves one patient per week.

479
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,250
<20-6,Vogler>其他人怎么办
<20-6,Vogler>What about everyone else?

480
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,770
<20-6,Vogler>他的部门不是要寻找乳癌的治疗之道
<20-6,Vogler>His department's not going to find the cure for breast cancer.

481
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,930
<20-7,Cuddy>或许不是  但是...
<20-7,Cuddy>Uh, maybe not, but...

482
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,010
<20-8,Vogler>你在和豪斯上床吗
<20-8,Vogler>Are you sleeping with House?

483
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,100
<20-9,Cuddy>什么  没有
<20-9,Cuddy>What? No.

484
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,040
<20-10,Vogler>但你其实上过了  不是吗
<20-10,Vogler>But you did. Right?

485
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,190
<20-10,Vogler>在很久以前吗
<20-10,Vogler>A long time ago?

486
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,000
<20-11,Cuddy>这是一个极不合适的问题
<20-11,Cuddy>That's an incredibly inappropriate question.

487
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,960
<20-12,Vogler>如果你的判断被先前或现在的关系影响
<20-12,Vogler>If your judgment is compromised by a prior or current relationship,

488
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,490
<20-12,Vogler>那就是我的事了
<20-12,Vogler>that is my business.

489
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,070
<20-13,Cuddy>我尊敬他  你知道这一点就够了
<20-13,Cuddy>I respect him. That is all you need to know.

490
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,570
<20-14,Vogler>他还是没穿白大褂
<20-14,Vogler>He's still not wearing the coat.

491
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,270
<20-15,Cuddy>这件事  我和他说...
<20-15,Cuddy>Well, I told him...

492
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,170
<20-16,Vogler>我相信你说过了
<20-16,Vogler>I'm sure you did.

493
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,310
<20-16,Vogler>但他还是没有穿
<20-16,Vogler>And yet he's not wearing it.

494
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,600
<20-16,Vogler>我只是想知道这是他的回应
<20-16,Vogler>I'm just wondering if that's a reflection on him...

495
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,850
<20-16,Vogler>还是你的
<20-16,Vogler>or on you.

496
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,050
<20-16,Vogler>你是豪斯医生
<20-16,Vogler>You're Dr. House.

497
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,770
<21-1,Carly>我在网上找到一张你出席某个会议的照片
<21-1,Carly>I found a picture online of you at a conference.

498
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,080
<21-2,House>你需要做心脏移植
<21-2,House>You need a heart transplant.

499
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,330
<21-3,Carly>-我经常跑步  在外工作  -你自虐
<21-3,Carly>- I run. I work out... - You cut yourself.

500
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,460
<21-4,House>可能是某种仪式化的行为
<21-4,House>Probably highly ritualized.

501
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,870
<21-4,House>你一边重复放莎拉·克劳克兰的歌
<21-4,House>You play the same Sarah McLachlan song

502
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,080
<21-4,House>一边自虐
<21-4,House>over and over while you do it.

503
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,270
<21-4,House>或许这种方法比抗抑郁药更有效
<21-4,House>Probably works better than antidepressants.

504
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,660
<21-5,Carly>我不明白是怎么...
<21-5,Carly>I don't understand how that...

505
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,750
<21-6,House>你是严重暴食症患者  你自己催吐
<21-6,House>You're a high-powered bulimic. You make yourself throw up.

506
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,350
<21-6,House>你必须找到一种最有效的方法催吐
<21-6,House>You had to find the most efficient way to vomit

507
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,030
<21-6,House>同时不能暴露出暴食症的蛛丝马迹
<21-6,House>without revealing the telltale signs of bulimia,

508
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,590
<21-6,House>对一位首席执行官来说  这是相当不合体的
<21-6,House>which is all, ooh, very unseemly for a C.E.O.

509
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,490
<21-6,House>所以  你找到了一种常见的
<21-6,House>So, you found a common

510
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,200
<21-6,House>对付意外中毒的解药来催吐
<21-6,House>antidote to accidental poisoning to do the job-

511
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,210
<21-6,House>吐根糖浆
<21-6,House>Ipecac.

512
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,120
<21-6,House>要是你的孩子刚吞下去一瓶阿司匹林
<21-6,House>Which is great if your kid's just swallowed

513
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,540
<21-6,House>这是个良方
<21-6,House>a bottle of aspirin,

514
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,930
<21-6,House>但是  要是用它成为习惯  就会相当糟糕
<21-6,House>but really, really bad if it's a habit.

515
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,050
<21-6,House>它会引起肌肉损伤
<21-6,House>It causes muscle damage.

516
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,810
<21-6,House>腿部的疼痛
<21-6,House>It caused the pain in your leg.

517
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,440
<21-6,House>还会毁掉你的心脏
<21-6,House>And destroyed your heart.

518
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,460
<21-7,Carly>你多久催吐一次
<21-7,Carly>How often do you do it?

519
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,210
<21-7,Carly>1周3次
<21-7,Carly>Three times a week.

520
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,020
<21-8,House>一小时内  移植委员会将会召开
<21-8,House>In about an hour, there's gonna be

521
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,010
<21-8,House>一个紧急会议
<21-8,House>an emergency meeting of the transplant committee...

522
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,890
<21-8,House>来讨论把你排在等待名单的位置
<21-8,House>to discuss where you fall on the list

523
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,260
<21-8,House>有没有心脏可以移植给你
<21-8,House>should a new heart become available.

524
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,650
<21-8,House>问题是  我必须告诉委员会你有暴食症
<21-8,House>Problem is, I am required to tell the committee about your bulimia.

525
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,560
<21-8,House>这是个严重的精神问题
<21-8,House>It's a major psychiatric condition.

526
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,460
<21-8,House>级别直逼自杀
<21-8,House>Ranks right up there with suicidal.

527
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,200
<21-8,House>这会让你负担一个糟糕的风险
<21-8,House>Makes you a very bad risk.

528
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,650
<21-9,Carly>所以  你是来这里告诉我
<21-9,Carly>So, you're here to tell me

529
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,910
<21-9,Carly>我只有几个小时可活了
<21-9,Carly>I have just a few hours to live?

530
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,400
<21-10,House>除非我对委员会说谎
<21-10,House>Unless I lie to the committee.

531
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,160
<21-10,House>但一旦他们发现  我就会丢掉我的行医执照
<21-10,House>But if they find out, I lose my medical license.

532
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,210
<21-10,House>这是个向我行贿的好机会
<21-10,House>This would be a very good time to offer me a bribe.

533
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,720
<21-10,House>你知道的  就是你的生命价值多少
<21-10,House>You know, how much is your life worth?

534
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,690
<21-10,House>你的工作价值多少
<21-10,House>How much is my job worth?

535
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,580
<21-11,Carly>为什么你要这么对我  你想要什么
<21-11,Carly>Why are you here doing this to me? What do you want?

536
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,180
<21-12,House>我想知道什么是对的
<21-12,House>I wanna know what's right.

537
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,040
<21-13,Carly>我值不值得救
<21-13,Carly>Am I worth it?

538
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,540
<21-13,Carly>你认为我很可怜
<21-13,Carly>You think I'm pathetic.

539
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,960
<21-13,Carly>有份不错的工作  拥有一切
<21-13,Carly>Has a good job. Everything in the world.

540
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,650
<21-13,Carly>只是不喜欢她自己的样子
<21-13,Carly>But she just doesn't like the way that she looks.

541
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,220
<21-14,House>别耍花样了
<21-14,House>Oh, stop hiding!

542
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,300
<21-14,House>我在问你  你是想活还是想死
<21-14,House>I'm asking you if you wanna live or die?

543
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,450
<21-14,House>你连这个都不知道吗
<21-14,House>You can't even say that.

544
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,270
<21-15,Carly>你想让我做什么  哭吗
<21-15,Carly>What do you want me to do? Cry?

545
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,150
<21-15,Carly>对
<21-15,Carly>Yes.

546
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,320
<21-16,House>我想让你告诉我
<21-16,House>I want you to tell me that

547
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,310
<21-16,House>你很在乎你的生命  因为我看不出来
<21-16,House>your life is important to you, because I don't know.

548
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,350
<21-16,House>因为现在讨论的是
<21-16,House>Because that's what's on the table right now-

549
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,990
<21-16,House>你的生命
<21-16,House>your life.

550
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,400
<21-17,Carly>我不想死
<21-17,Carly>I don't wanna die.

551
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,370
<21-17,Carly>我不想
<21-17,Carly>I don't.

552
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,810
<21-17,Carly>这位32岁女性病人经我的下属确认
<21-17,Carly>This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff...

553
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,770
<21-17,Carly>病因是右腿瘫痪疼痛
<21-17,Carly>because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh.

554
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,130
<21-17,Carly>病人情况迅速恶化
<21-17,Carly>The patient rapidly deteriorated

555
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,950
<21-17,Carly>而现在处于严重充血性心力衰竭中
<21-17,Carly>and now has severe congestive heart failure.

556
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,600
<22-1,House>升压剂和血管舒张剂
<22-1,House>Pressors and vasodilators

557
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,550
<22-1,House>也已经不能改善她的情况
<22-1,House>have not improved her condition whatsoever.

558
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,120
<22-1,House>肺功能测试显示用力呼气量超过3000ml
<22-1,House>Pulmonary function tests show an F.E.C. of over three liters,

559
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,760
<22-1,House>1秒用力呼气量达到预计的90%
<22-1,House>with F.E.V. -1 of at least 90% of predicted...

560
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,420
<22-1,House>维持F.E.D./F.E.C.比率
<22-1,House>and preserved F.E.D./F.E.C. Ratio

561
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,620
<22-1,House>和一氧化碳弥散量
<22-1,House>and preserved D.L.C.O. as well.

562
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,910
<22-1,House>放射性核素活动血管扫描结果提示射血分数为19％
<22-1,House>Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19%

563
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,810
<22-1,House>无局部心室壁运动异常
<22-1,House>with no focal wall motion abnormalities.

564
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,610
<22-1,House>冠状动脉造影提示
<22-1,House>Heart catheterization revealed clean left,

566
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,010
<22-1,House>随后活检表明
<22-1,House>And a subsequent biopsy revealed

567
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,560
<22-1,House>她有不可逆转的心肌病
<22-1,House>irreversible cardiomyopathy.

568
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,330
<21-11,Carly>这就是我们在此讨论的原因
<21-11,Carly>Which is why we're here.

569
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,120
<22-2,Cuddy>豪斯医生  我对你的时间和日期记录很疑惑
<22-2,Cuddy>Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused by your time and date stamps.

570
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,940
<22-2,Cuddy>记录显示在检查之前
<22-2,Cuddy>It appears that you put Carly

571
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,120
<22-2,Cuddy>你就把卡莉列入了移植名单
<22-2,Cuddy>on the transplant list before you did these tests.

572
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,830
<22-3,House>直觉
<22-3,House>I had a hunch.

573
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,290
<22-4,Cuddy>你从来都没有直觉  你只是知道事实
<22-4,Cuddy>You don't have hunches. You know.

574
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,510
<22-5,House>看  要是检查结果不同
<22-5,House>Look, if the tests had come back differently,

575
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,140
<22-5,House>显然我会把她从名单上去掉
<22-5,House>obviously I would have taken her off the list.

576
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,230
<22-5,House>但就长远来看...
<22-5,House>But on the long shot...

577
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,560
<22-5,House>就长远来看我当时的判断是正确的
<22-5,House>On the long shot that I was right,

00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
<22-5,House>我不想浪费时间
<22-5,House>I didn't want to waste time.

00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
<23-11,House>我的病人要得到心脏了
<23-11,House>My patient's getting a heart.

<24-2,Foreman>我会解雇你  再见

615
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,510
<24-4,Foreman>那就从你的双腿间
<24-4,Foreman>So stick your head between

616
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,150

<24-5,Chase>其实  我喜欢这里
<24-5,Chase>Well, I like it here.

618
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,590
<24-5,Chase>你们不认为这事有点奇怪吗
<24-5,Chase>You guys don't think it's weird

619
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,880
<24-5,Chase>豪斯在我们做心脏检查前
<24-5,Chase>House knew the patient needed a heart transplant...

620
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,550
<24-5,Chase>就知道病人需要心脏移植
<24-5,Chase>before we did any heart tests?

621
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,980
<24-6,Cameron>他是豪斯  他就知道
<24-6,Cameron>That's House. He knows things.

622
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,740
<24-7,Chase>但通常他会当着我们的面说
<24-7,Chase>But usually he's putting it in our face.

623
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,060
<24-7,Chase>炫耀他有多聪明
<24-7,Chase>Telling us how cleverly he figured it out.

624
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,540
<24-7,Chase>这次却什么都没有  只说是他的直觉
<24-7,Chase>This time nothing. Just had a hunch.

625
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,760
<24-8,Foreman>是挺奇怪
<24-8,Foreman>That is weird.

626
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,530
<24-8,Foreman>把那个出血分支灼烧消毒
<24-8,Foreman>Cauterize that one bleeder.

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,330
<25-1,Surgeon>好的  准备好接收捐赠心脏

<25-1,Surgeon>他们刚刚停止了卡莉的心脏机能
<25-1,Surgeon>They just stopped Carly's heart,

630
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,850
<25-1,Surgeon>还有你的哑病人...
<25-1,Surgeon>and your dumb patient...

631
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,730
<26-1,Cameron>他们全都是笨蛋
<26-1,Cameron>They're all...

632
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,000
<26-2,House>哦对  是那个不能说话的啊
<26-2,House>Oh, the guy who can't talk.

633
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,570
<26-3,Cameron>范德米尔先生
<26-3,Cameron>Mr. Van Der Meer.

634
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,930
<26-3,Cameron>预约来见你
<26-3,Cameron>He's scheduled an appointment to see you.

635
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,510
<26-4,House>很好
<26-4,House>Oh, goody.

636
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,760
<26-5,Cameron>我想让你知道
<26-5,Cameron>I wanted you to know

637
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,300
<26-5,Cameron>奇斯担心你会解雇他
<26-5,Cameron>Chase is worried you're going to fire him.

638
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,840
<26-6,House>因为失误丢掉生命就够糟了
<26-6,House>It's bad enough that screw-ups cost lives.

639
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,650
<26-6,House>现在我们有个沃格勒  失误会丢掉工作
<26-6,House>Now we've got Vogler, screw-ups cost jobs.

640
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,560
<26-6,House>我希望奇斯害怕
<26-6,House>I want Chase scared.

641
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,990
<26-6,House>我想让他竭尽所能去保住他的工作
<26-6,House>I want him doing everything he can to protect his job.

642
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,730
<26-7,Cameron>豪斯医生  换位思考一下
<26-7,Cameron>Dr. House, if you were in his position,

643
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,220
<26-7,Cameron>难道你不会因为有人安慰你而表现的更好吗...
<26-7,Cameron>wouldn't you be more likely to perform well if you were reassured...

644
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,640
<26-8,House>你能不能别看那些书了  为什么你要这么做
<26-8,House>Oh, will you stop it with the book? Why are you doing this?

645
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,990
<26-9,Cameron>我没做什么
<26-9,Cameron>I'm not doing anything.

646
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,600
<26-10,House>你在操纵每个人
<26-10,House>You're manipulating everyone.

647
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,060
<26-11,Cameron>人们...  忽略我
<26-11,Cameron>People... dismiss me.

648
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,900
<26-11,Cameron>因为我是女性  因为我漂亮
<26-11,Cameron>Because I'm a woman. Because I'm pretty.

649
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,720
<26-11,Cameron>因为...  我不争强好斗
<26-11,Cameron>Because... I'm not aggressive.

650
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,890
<26-11,Cameron>我的意见不应该因为
<26-11,Cameron>My opinions shouldn't be rejected

651
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,290
<26-11,Cameron>人们不喜欢我就被驳回
<26-11,Cameron>just because people don't like me.

<27-2,Robin>- Is that good or bad? - It depends.

660
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,100
<27-3,House>要么是手术进展顺利  要么就突然停止了
<27-3,House>Either surgery went really well, or it ended really abruptly.

661

<27-4,Surgeon>理论上  她会比我们都长寿
<27-4,Surgeon>Textbook. She'll outlive us all.

666
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
<28-1,House>当你做手术的时候  你被插了管子
<28-1,House>When you had your surgery, you were intubated.

667
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,280
<28-1,House>外科医生把管子插入你的喉咙
<28-1,House>The surgeon stuck a tube down your throat.

668
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,580
<28-1,House>现在  虽然以前从没发生过
<28-1,House>Now, it never happens and it's never caught,

669
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,440
<28-1,House>但还是发生了

<28-1,House>我用肉毒杆菌治疗了痉挛性失声
<28-1,House>I treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox.

672
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,480
<28-1,House>讽刺的是  这种物质
<28-1,House>Ironically, a substance

673
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,260
<28-1,House>能拉紧你脸上的每一个角落
<28-1,House>that tightens every other corner of your face.

674
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,910
<28-1,House>却会放松你的舌头
<28-1,House>It actually loosens the tongue.

<28-1,House>你不一定要说话  这是我们的小秘密
<28-1,House>You don't have to say anything. It can be our little secret.

679
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,820
<28-1,House>如果你能说话  眨两下眼
<28-1,House>If you can talk, blink twice.

680
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,840
<28-1,House>但你不那么做
<28-1,House>But you're not going to,

681
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,210
<28-1,House>因为你不想丧失和辛普森医生
<28-1,House>because you think you won't be entitled

682
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,230
<28-1,House>庭外和解那笔钱
<28-1,House>to the money you won in the settlement with Simpson.

<28-1,House>我会保守秘密
<28-1,House>Mum's the word.

687
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,770
<29-3,House>我知道心脏病专家已经给了你一些指导
<29-3,House>I know the cardiologist has given you some guidelines,

688

<29-3,House>一个服药时间表  和一个严格的饮食要求
<29-3,House>a schedule of medication and a strict diet.

689
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,980
<29-3,House>正是某位饮食失调的人所需要的
<29-3,House>Just what somebody with an eating disorder needs.

690
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,520
<29-3,House>所以我想我得让你开始实施了
<29-3,House>So I thought I'd get you started.

691
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,340
<29-3,House>卡耐基餐馆的炸鸡
<29-3,House>Fried chicken from the Carnegie Deli.

692
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,250
<29-4,Carly>-你这是开玩笑  -没错
<29-4,Carly>- You're kidding. - Yeah.

693
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,740
<29-5,House>其实  我是从楼下买的
<29-5,House>Actually, I got it downstairs.

694
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,860
<29-6,Carly>为什么帮我
<29-6,Carly>Why did you fight for me?

695
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,740
<29-6,Carly>你冒了很大风险  而且并不怎么了解我
<29-6,Carly>You risked so much, and you hardly know me.

696
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,370
<29-7,House>你是我的病人
<29-7,House>You're my patient.

697
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,030
<29-7,House>别搞砸了
<29-7,House>Don't screw it up.

698
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,490
<30-1,House>爱死这段了
<30-1,House>Love this part!

699
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,130
<30-1,House>好吧  被他毁了
<30-1,House>Okay. He ruined it.

700
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,990
<30-2,Vogler>只是想打断一下来个自我介绍
<30-2,Vogler>Just wanted to stop by and introduce myself.

701
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,810
<30-2,Vogler>我是爱德华·沃格勒  新任董事长
<30-2,Vogler>I'm Edward Vogler, new chairman of the board.

702
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,240
<30-2,Vogler>这样来讲  我猜我成了你的老板
<30-2,Vogler>In a way, I guess that makes me your boss.

703
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,830
<30-3,House>对于白大褂的事情  我很抱歉
<30-3,House>I am sorry about the lab coat thing.

704
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,420
<30-3,House>我的干洗店把它毁了
<30-3,House>My dry cleaners just destroyed it.

705
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,570
<30-4,Vogler>这是我第一次参加心脏移植委员会会议
<30-4,Vogler>That was my very first heart transplant committee meeting.

706
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,290
<30-4,Vogler>非常令人激动
<30-4,Vogler>Very exciting.

707
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,740
<30-5,House>相信我  六旗主题公园更令人激动
<30-5,House>Trust me, Six Flags- way more exciting.

708
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,500
<30-6,Vogler>你的病人有你这样热情的医生相当幸运
<30-6,Vogler>Your patient's very lucky to have such a passionate doctor.

709
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,420
<30-6,Vogler>为他坚信的事而奋斗
<30-6,Vogler>Stands up for what he believes in.

710
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
<30-7,House>你说的真好
<30-7,House>Sweet of you to say.

711
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,540
<30-8,Vogler>是啊  但恐怕你被骗了
<30-8,Vogler>Yeah. Afraid you've been duped though.

712
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,310
<30-8,Vogler>护士从病人的包里发现了这个
<30-8,Vogler>The nurse found this in the patient's purse.

713
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,860
<30-9,House>天哪  要是我早知道就好了
<30-9,House>Oh, my. If only I'd known.

714
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,920
<30-10,Vogler>做医生不容易吧  拥有所有的权力
<30-10,Vogler>Tough being a doctor, having all that power.

715
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,910
<30-10,Vogler>拥有扮演上帝的权力
<30-10,Vogler>The power to play God.

716
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,410
<30-11,House>是啊  我不嫉妒移植委员会
<30-11,House>Yes. I don't envy the transplant committee

717
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,250
<30-11,House>的职责
<30-11,House>their responsibility.

718
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,200
<30-11,House>他们多半是被迫杀死那个可怜姑娘的
<30-11,House>They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl.

719
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,270
<30-11,House>我可不确定我能那么做
<30-11,House>I'm not sure I could have done that.

720
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,830
<30-12,Vogler>我可不认为这是游戏  豪斯医生
<30-12,Vogler>This is not a game to me, Dr. House.

721
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,880
<30-13,House>没错  这更像是我们在跳舞
<30-13,House>No. It's actually more like we're dancing right now.

722
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,870
<30-13,House>那我们直截了当吧  你不喜欢我
<30-13,House>So let's get to the point. You don't like me.

723
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,450
<30-13,House>我也非常确信我不喜欢你
<30-13,House>I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna like you.

724
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,780
<30-13,House>不是针对你个人
<30-13,House>It's nothing personal.

725
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,780
<30-13,House>我谁都不喜欢
<30-13,House>I don't like anybody.

726
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,380
<30-13,House>但这些都无所谓  不是吗
<30-13,House>But none of that really matters, does it?

727
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,230
<30-13,House>因为你得到了钱  而我得到聘用
<30-13,House>Because you've got money, and I've got tenure.

728
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,070
<30-13,House>你需要全体董事会同意才能开除我
<30-13,House>You need full board approval to get rid of me.

729
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,570
<30-13,House>我有卡迪的支持
<30-13,House>I've got Cuddy.

730
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,790
<30-14,Vogler>-是啊  -还有威尔森
<30-14,Vogler>- Right. - And Wilson.

731
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,300
<30-15,House>那么  在我们还得拴在一起的日子里
<30-15,House>So, as long as we're stuck with each other,

732
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,990
<30-15,House>我们还是忽视对方存在比较好
<30-15,House>we might as well ignore each other.

733
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,500
<30-15,House>我原来没想要这么戏剧化的效果
<30-15,House>That wasn't nearly as dramatic as I was hoping.

734
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,470
<30-16,Vogler>我想了想聘用的事情  觉得你是对的
<30-16,Vogler>I looked into that tenure thing, and you're right.

735
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,140
<30-16,Vogler>其实对我来说
<30-16,Vogler>It's actually easier for me

736
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,000
<30-16,Vogler>开除个像卡迪或者威尔森那样的成员
<30-16,Vogler>to get rid of a board member like Cuddy or Wilson...

737
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,490
<30-16,Vogler>比开除个医生要简单的多
<30-16,Vogler>than to get rid of a doctor.

738
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,000
<30-16,Vogler>很有趣  是不是
<30-16,Vogler>That's interesting, isn't it?
