<7-1,Cameron>and he still can't balance himself.

120

<7-2,Taub>还要多少正常的检查结果abc才能证明他在诈病呢?
<7-2,Taub>How many normal test resul do we need toabcknow the patient's a granola-filled phony?

<9-5,Chase>- 你在避开我吗?abc- 没有啊
<9-5,Chase>- Are you avoiding me?abc- No.

146
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,800
<9-6,Cameron>让人疑惑的是你宁愿治疗转诊的呃逆患者
<9-6,Cameron>So I shouldn't beat all concerned that you'reabctreating another doctor's patient for hiccups

147
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,600
<9-7,Chase>也不愿和我去旅行abc我可是计划了一周
<9-7,Chase>instead of going on aabcvacationI spent a week planning.

148
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,030
<9-8,Cameron>在这病例上花较多时间是有原因的
<9-8,Cameron>There is a reason I need to stayabcwith this case a while longer,

<9-8,Cameron>但我不能告诉你
<9-8,Cameron>but I can't tell you what it is.

150
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,130
<9-9,Chase>所以你承认你骗了我abc还要求我信任你咯?
<9-9,Chase>So... you admit you lied to me. Andabcnow you're asking me to trust you?

<10-2,House>You can get back toabcyour shift at the E.R.

156
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,020
<10-2,House>但据急诊室所知abc你正在放假 不是吗?
<10-2,House>Except,as far as the E.R.Isabcconcerned,you're on vacation,right?

157
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,860
<10-3,Cameron>我把旅行延后了abc因为我关心这病人
<10-3,Cameron>I postponed a trip because I'mabcconcerned about the patient.

158
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,020
<10-4,House>这只能解释你为什么放Chase鸽子abc并参与鉴别诊断 解释不了你答应做测试
<10-4,House>Explains why you ditched chase and came toabcthe differentials,not why you ran the tests.

159
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,440
<10-5,Cameron>你让我做的
<10-5,Cameron>You told me to.

160

<10-6,House>嘿 你该不会还在迷恋我吧?
<10-6,House>Hey,you don't stillabchave the hots for me,do you?

<10-8,House>Yeah,you're gonna nurse us back toabcspiritual and mental oneness.

166
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,180
<10-8,House>这番对话发生在一星期前才有意义
<10-8,House>That would make sense if we were havingabcthis conversation a week ago.

167
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,080
<10-9,Cameron>我知道你在想什么--abc你以为我想回来工作
<10-9,Cameron>Think what you want--abcthat I'm here to get a job,

168
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,530
<10-9,Cameron>以为我把你当小宝宝哄着
<10-9,Cameron>that I'm here to wrapabcyou in swaddling clothes.

169
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,960
<10-10,House>问题是 我没这么想abc因为两者都说不通
<10-10,House>The problem is,I think neither.abcBecause neither makes sense.

170
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,470
<10-10,House>唯一说得通的是...没有
<10-10,House>The only thing that does... doesn't.

171
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,720

<10-12,House>照她说的做
<10-12,House>What she said.

173
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,570
<10-13,Thirteen>脑子可以联系两者
<10-13,Thirteen>Brain would connect the two.

174
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,890
<10-14,House>有可能 假如Cameron还没abc给他做头部CT的话
<10-14,House>It could,if cameronabchadn't already ct'd his head.

<10-14,House>和她男友的日程表一样空虚
<10-14,House>Empty as her boyfriend's calendar.

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,900
<10-15,Taub>这和Chase有什么关系?
<10-15,Taub>What does this have to do with chase?

177
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,000
<10-17,House>- 没有abc- 现在说不准
<10-17,House>- Nothing.abc- Not sure yet.

<10-18,Cameron>病人正在发动一场abc讨伐商品花卉的圣战
<10-18,Cameron>Patient is on a jihad againstabccommercial flowers.

179

<10-19,Foreman>没有肠胃问题 没有唾沫分泌过多
<10-19,Foreman>No G.I. Problems,no hyper-salivation.

181
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,910
<10-20,Taub>可能和他的抵抗行动无关
<10-20,Taub>It's possible it's notabcconnected to a protest.

182
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,660
<10-20,Taub>CT查不出多发性硬化症abc他姓Swenson
<10-20,Taub>M.S.Wouldn't show on theabcct,and his name's swenson.

183

<10-20,Taub>斯堪的纳维亚人的后裔abc更易患上多发性硬化症
<10-20,Taub>Scandinavians have anabcincreased susceptibility to M.S.

184
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,870
<10-21,House>这理论比说他装病强
<10-21,House>Better theory than he's faking it.

185
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,290
<10-21,House>北欧木屐汉的推测胜出abc做脊髓穿刺确认多发性硬化症
<10-21,House>The clogs have it. Do aabclumbar puncture to confirm M.S.

186

<10-22,Thirteen>我们继续坐一边绕大拇指好了
<10-22,Thirteen>I guess we'll justabccontinue to twiddle our thumbs.

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,730
<10-23,House>真希望你这话另有所指
<10-23,House>God,I hope that's a euphemism.

188
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,810
<10-24,Cameron>病人不停呃逆 我怎么做脊髓穿刺?
<10-24,Cameron>How am I supposed to do a lumbar punctureabcon a patient with intractable hiccups?

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,940
<10-25,House>我在想你这句话在暗指什么
<10-25,House>I'm trying to figure outabcwhat that could be a euphemism for.

190
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,340
<11-2,Foreman>自个儿想办法去
<11-2,Foreman>You'll find a way.

191
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,680
<11-1,Cameron>你帮我做检查 不怕House迁怒于你?
<11-1,Cameron>You're not worried house is gonna beabcpissed you're helping me do the test?

192
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,520
<11-2,Foreman>他让你想办法 这不就是了
<11-2,Foreman>He said find a way,and you did.

193
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,170
<11-3,Cameron>House最近怎么样?
<11-3,Cameron>How do you think house is doing?

<11-6,Foreman>虽然Kutner的死使House深受打击abc但这对他不是问题
<11-6,Foreman>Even if house was messed up byabckutner's suicide,it wouldn't matter.

197

<11-6,Foreman>他向来认为生命是一个abc肮脏 残酷 漫长的过程
<11-6,Foreman>He already thinks life isabcnasty,brutish,and long.

198
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,760
<11-6,Foreman>痛苦反而有助他的诊断
<11-6,Foreman>And misery helps his diagnostic skills.

199
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,270
<11-6,Foreman>你很清楚这一点 那么...
<11-6,Foreman>All of which you know,so...

<11-8,Foreman>权当多一个有胆色的帮手abc和我一同对抗House
<11-8,Foreman>I could use someone else with theabcstones to stand up to house.

203
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,500
<11-8,Foreman>但你必须知道 这会毁了你和Chase的关系
<11-8,Foreman>But you've gotta know it's gonnaabcblow up your relationship with chase.

204
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
<11-9,Cameron>我只不过推迟了一个三天的旅行
<11-9,Cameron>All I did was postpone a three-day trip.

205
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,180
<11-10,Foreman>离开Chase 来到House身边
<11-10,Foreman>With chase,to be with house.

206

<11-11,Cameron>- 你要干什么?abc- 去拿静脉注射的氯丙嗪
<11-11,Cameron>- What are you doing?abc- Ordering I.V.Chlorpromazine.

207
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,110
<11-12,Foreman>可能是神经性问题导致abc这么做会使其精神状况恶化
<11-12,Foreman>This could still be neurological.abcYou could cloud his mental status.

208
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,550
<11-13,Cameron>你想把针扎准 还是光说不练?
<11-13,Cameron>You wanna get the needle inabchis spine or you wanna talk?

209
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,430
<12-1,Chase>你和House谈过填补Kutner空缺没?
<12-1,Chase>You and house been talking aboutabcfilling kutner's slot?

210
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,820
<12-2,Cuddy>是的 我们刚参加完葬礼 就去了人力资源部
<12-2,Cuddy>Yeah,we went straight from theabcfuneral to human resources.

<12-2,Cuddy>你想回去他的医疗小组?
<12-2,Cuddy>You interested inabcgetting back on the team?

212
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,570
<12-3,Chase>我只想知道Cameron有没这意思
<12-3,Chase>I'm interested in knowing ifabccameron's interested.

213
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,250
<12-3,Chase>她正为House的病人做检查
<12-3,Chase>She's been running allabcthe tests for house's case.

214
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,500
<12-4,Cuddy>她什么也没和我说
<12-4,Cuddy>Well,she hasn't said anything to me.

215
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,230
<12-4,Cuddy>我猜 大概是转介病人的医生abc让她多关注些
<12-4,Cuddy>But I guess,uh,the referring doctorabcmight have asked her to keep an eye on him.

216
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,450
<12-5,Chase>你觉得Cameron爱House吗?
<12-5,Chase>Do you think cameron's inabclove with house?

217
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,750
<12-6,Cuddy>这是个荒唐的问题 她爱的是你
<12-6,Cuddy>That is a ridiculous question.abcShe's in love with you.

<23-18,House>You ask a question,I rule out twoabcpossibilities,and you're satisfied?

438
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,830
<23-18,House>就是说你不想要答案
<23-18,House>That means you don't want an answer.

439
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,660
<23-18,House>你只想确认不是哪个答案
<23-18,House>You just wanted to knowabcthere wasn't a particular answer.

<23-19,Husband>This isn't a medical crisis,is it?

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,960
<23-20,House>算是 有太多种性病 我无法确定
<23-20,House>Could be. A lot ofabcstds hang in the balance.

<23-20,House>说到足够了吧?
<23-20,House>Any chance I could just leave it at that?

446

<23-20,House>才不 假球菌毛囊炎

<23-20,House>你肯定有泡过 不过不是和你丈夫
<23-20,House>which you obviously use,butabcnot with your husband.

449
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,810
<23-20,House>我努力想帮你遮掩来着
<23-20,House>Tried to help a sister out.

<24-1,Foreman>骨细胞易辨认
<24-1,Foreman>Bone cells were well differentiated.

452
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,870
<24-1,Foreman>无异常结构证明不是癌
<24-1,Foreman>No dysplasia means no cancer.

<24-3,Foreman>- 这是好事 是吗?abc- 希望如此
<24-3,Foreman>- That's good,isn't it?abc- We hope so.

454
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,740
<24-3,Foreman>也意味着我们依旧不知道abc是什么导致骨折
<24-3,Foreman>Although it also means we stillabchave no idea what caused the break.

<24-3,Foreman>- 感觉如何?abc- 很痛
<24-3,Foreman>- How does it feel?abc- It hurts.

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,880
<24-5,Franni>应该这样?
<24-5,Franni>Is it supposed to look like that?

457
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,320
<24-6,Foreman>不 可能是术后出血
<24-6,Foreman>No,but it's probably just residualabcbleeding from the surgery.

458
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,870
<24-6,Foreman>应该可以...
<24-6,Foreman>We should be able to...

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,830
<25-1,House>只能是癌了
<25-1,House>Means it's gotta be cancer.

462
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,380
<25-2,Foreman>可能 但事实不是 活检阴性
<25-2,Foreman>It's gotta be,except it'sabcnot. The biopsy was negative.

463
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,450
<25-3,House>活检可能错 症状不会
<25-3,House>Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can't.

464
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,450
<25-4,Thirteen>都指向癌症 但找不到就不能用放疗
<25-4,Thirteen>All signs point to cancer,but youabccan't blast a cancer you can't find.

465
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,440
<25-5,House>当然能 让他准备全身放疗
<25-5,House>Sure you can. Prep himabcfor total body irradiation.

466
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,700
<25-6,Taub>你知道这是疯子才干的
<25-6,Taub>You do realize that's insane.

467
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,910
<25-7,House>除非你认为癌聪明地藏在他体外
<25-7,House>Not unlessyou think the cancer'sabccleverly hiding outside his body.

468
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,510
<25-8,Thirteen>类固醇已经弱化了他的免疫系统
<25-8,Thirteen>Steroids already weakenedabchis immune system.

469
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,230
<25-8,Thirteen>大剂量放射在杀死癌细胞前会先杀死他
<25-8,Thirteen>That much radiation'll killabchim before it kills the cancer.

470
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,330
<25-9,Foreman>如果没有 也很可能被我们制造出来
<25-9,Foreman>And if he doesn'tabchave cancer,we could cause one,

471
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,160
<25-9,Foreman>或是一并摧毁他的免疫系统
<25-9,Foreman>or destroy his immune system altogether.

472
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,710
<25-9,Foreman>这人可能因脚趾甲受感染而死
<25-9,Foreman>The guy could die fromabcan infected toe nail.

473
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,220
<25-10,House>那就什么都不做 让他死了?
<25-10,House>Y'd rather do nhing,justabclet him die on his own?

474
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,850
<25-11,Taub>我则情愿让癌症恶化
<25-11,Taub>I'd rather make his cancer worse.

475
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,020
<25-11,Taub>用胰岛素样生长因子 促肿瘤生长
<25-11,Taub>Give him insulin-like growthabcfactor,make any tumor or malignancy grow.

476
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,800
<25-12,Thirteen>长大到我们能发现为止
<25-12,Thirteen>Grows big enough,we can find it.

477
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,470
<25-12,Thirteen>这是火上浇油
<25-12,Thirteen>That's like pouring gasoline on a fire.

478
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,860
<25-12,Thirteen>至少全身放疗还算是治疗
<25-12,Thirteen>At least total body irradiation'sabcan actual treatment.

479
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,890
<25-13,House>他的主意更好 去干吧
<25-13,House>His idea is better. Pour away.

480
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,520
<26-1,House>我的法力掉了
<26-1,House>I lost my mojo.

481
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,620
<26-2,Wilson>你倒回去找了吗?
<26-2,Wilson>Have you retraced your steps?

482
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,250
<26-2,Wilson>清洁工在洗衣服前掏过口袋了吗--
<26-2,Wilson>Does your cleaning lady checkabcyour pockets before--

483
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,950
<26-3,House>我弄不清Kutner寻死的原因abc对Cameron也猜测错了
<26-3,House>I was clueless about kutner.abcI was wrong about cameron.

484
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,520
<26-3,House>Taub刚说的主意 我早该先想到的
<26-3,House>Taub just came up with an idea thatabcI should have seen long before he did.

485
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,150
<26-4,Wilson>Kutner的事没人能预料
<26-4,Wilson>No one saw anything coming with kutner.

486
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,870
<26-4,Wilson>你也不常见到Cameron
<26-4,Wilson>You hardly ever see cameron anymore.

487
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,680
<26-4,Wilson>你雇Taub的目的就是让他abc在你没主意时突发奇想
<26-4,Wilson>And you hired taub to come up with ideasabcthat you wouldn't have come up with.

488
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,190
<26-5,House>我不知道你为何吃胡萝卜
<26-5,House>And I have no ideawhyabcyou're eating carrots.

489
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,290
<26-6,Wilson>好啊
<26-6,Wilson>Good.

490
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,530
<26-7,House>我脑子坏了 你却说"好"?
<26-7,House>I'm losing my mind. Allabcyou got to say is "good"?

491
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,450
<26-8,Wilson>House 一个受你指导 与你共事两年
<26-8,Wilson>House,a guy you worked with forabctwo years,who you mentored

492
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,110
<26-8,Wilson>或许还是你关心的人 突然扣扳机自杀了
<26-8,Wilson>and,yes,possibly even caredabcabout,just blew his brains out.

493
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,850
<26-8,Wilson>你找不到原因 找不到意义abc有时候其实根本就没有
<26-8,Wilson>You can't find the reason,can't find theabcmeaning in it,because sometimes there isn't any.

494
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,630
<26-8,Wilson>有时候...事情就这样了
<26-8,Wilson>Sometimes... this is all there is.

495
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,800
<26-8,Wilson>你是该失落
<26-8,Wilson>You should be losing it.

496
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,720
<26-8,Wilson>这种境况下 你还神采飞扬才不正常
<26-8,Wilson>You'd be crazy not to be off your game.

497
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,100
<26-8,Wilson>法力就在你失落它的地方
<26-8,Wilson>But your mojo is right where you left it.

498
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,590
<26-8,Wilson>只要... 继续玩下去 我走了
<26-8,Wilson>Just... keep playingabcwith it. I gotta go.

499
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,120
<26-8,Wilson>要吃自己拿
<26-8,Wilson>Help yourself.

500
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,510
<27-1,Taub>我知道这是痛苦的过程
<27-1,Taub>I know this is a tough process.

501
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,020

<27-4,Franni>No,it's not gonna be okay.abcYou're growing his cancer.

505
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,950
<27-5,Doug>这不是医生的错
<27-5,Doug>This isn't the doctors' fault.

506
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,590
<27-5,Doug>我自愿暴露在糟糕的环境中
<27-5,Doug>I've exposed myself toabca lot of bad stuff.

<28-7,Chase>你没告诉我本质
<28-7,Chase>And you're not telling me what it is.
