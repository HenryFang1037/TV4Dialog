81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,390
<2-19,Foreman>可能是毒品导致的脑血管痉挛

82
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,790

<2-42,Wilson>所以我就是父母之一 但我不能养他
<2-42,Wilson>So I'm, like,the other parent.,But I can't take him.

113
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,290
<2-42,Wilson>酒店不允许养狗 再说我一直都在这儿
<2-42,Wilson>My hotel doesn't allow dogs.,Besides,I'm always here.

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,490
<2-43,House>我邀请Cuddy礼拜四去看一场戏剧
<2-43,House>I asked cuddy to a play thursday.

115
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,190
<2-44,Wilson>噢 你...好吧
<2-44,Wilson>Oh, you--okay.

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,690
<2-45,House>她说她没空
<2-45,House>She said she was busy.

117
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,290
<2-46,Wilson>而你不相信她 所以你买通了清洁工
<2-46,Wilson>And you didn't believe her,,so you bribed a janitor,

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,890
<2-46,Wilson>侵入她的电脑 检查她的预约...
<2-46,Wilson>broke into her computer,,checked her appointments--

119
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,490
<2-47,House>我是试探着问她的
<2-47,House>I asked her as a test.

120
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,690
<2-48,Wilson>如果她答应了你会知道什么?
<2-48,Wilson>What would you have learned,if she'd said yes?

121
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,190
<2-49,House>会明白奴役盲从
<2-49,House>A lot about bondage.

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,190
<2-49,House>她对我没空 对你却有空
<2-49,House>She's busy for me,,but not for you.

123
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,790
<2-49,House>她对戏剧本身没兴趣 她对你有兴趣
<2-49,House>E's not interested in the play qua play,,she's interested in you.

124
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,890
<2-50,Wilson>不 我不要再次困在你的神经旋风里
<2-50,Wilson>No, I'm not getting sucked into the vortex,of your insanity again.

125
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,590
<2-50,Wilson>不要在课上给我传字条,不要让我邀请她去舞会
<2-50,Wilson>Don't pass me notes in class,,don't tell me to ask her to the prom.

126
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,290
<2-51,House>你没法把她当成普通朋友,你在勾引她
<2-51,House>You cannot see her socially.,You're leading her on.

127
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,290
<2-52,Wilson>我会考虑的..,在我带她去看Hockney作品展之后
<2-52,Wilson>I'll consider that,after I take her,to the hockney exhibit.

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,790
<2-52,Wilson>在礼拜四 明白了吧 她的确没空
<2-52,Wilson>On thursday.See, she is busy.

129
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,690
<2-52,Wilson>这不是约会
<2-52,Wilson>It's not a date.

130
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,290
<2-52,Wilson>她很享受戏剧 我很享受于她能享受
<2-52,Wilson>She enjoyed the play.,I enjoyed her enjoying the play.

131

<2-52,Wilson>她工作的很辛苦 能让她放松一下也好
<2-52,Wilson>The woman works hard.It's nice,to see her relax.

132
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,490
<2-53,House>这享受来享受去的 是出于博爱?
<2-53,House>So all this enjoying,is an act of charity?

133
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,990
<2-54,Wilson>我都留着收据退税呢
<2-54,Wilson>I'm keeping the receipts for tax purposes.

134
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,990
<2-55,House>不能做愚蠢决定的生活还有什么意思?
<2-55,House>What's life without the ability,to make stupid choices?

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,690
<2-55,House>她需要她的自由意志
<2-55,House>She needs her free will.

136

<2-55,House>在她不能决定是否要呼吸前 找出病因
<2-55,House>Find out why her brain froze before she,can't decide to take her next breath.

137

<2-55,House>你去找毒素 你做气泡分析
<2-55,House>You find the toxins,you run the bubble study.

138
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,490
<2-55,House>什么都不会找到 但我需要霸占办公室
<2-55,House>You won't find anything,,but I'll get the office to myself.

<3-6,Foreman>你不必过来的
<3-6,Foreman>You didn't have to come.

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,390
<3-6,Foreman>你已经八年没回家了
<3-6,Foreman>You haven't been home in eight years.

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,090
<3-6,Foreman>她应当见见你...
<3-6,Foreman>She should see you...

155
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,790
<3-7,Foreman>在她忘记你是谁之前
<3-7,Foreman>while she still knows who you are.

<3-7,Foreman>爸爸 我和她讲过电话了
<3-7,Foreman>Dad, I've talked to her on the phone.

<4-1,Chase>So what's up with your dad?,Didn't know he was gonna be in town?

160
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,690
<4-2,Foreman>不知道
<4-2,Foreman>No.

161
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,490
<4-3,Chase>这么老的建筑物到处都可能有毒素发散
<4-3,Chase>A building this old,,there could be toxic exposure anywhere.

<4-4,Foreman>Or it could be drugs.

164
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,290
<4-5,Chase>我以为我们已经排除...
<4-5,Chase>I thought we ruled out--

165
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,390
<4-5,Chase>清白的毒素筛检说明毒品没有导致T.I.A.
<4-5,Chase>clean tox-screen means,drugs didn't cause the T.I.A.

166
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,390
<4-6,Foreman>毒品可能和毒素结合在了一起

<4-6,Foreman>毒品被排除体外后 毒素留下了
<4-6,Foreman>The drugs wash out of her system,,the toxins stick around.

169
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,590
<4-7,Chase>接触毒素有无数种方式
<4-7,Chase>Exposure could come about any number of ways.

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,790
<4-7,Chase>不能假设是使用了毒品
<4-7,Chase>There's no reason to assume it was,through drug use.

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,290
<4-8,Foreman>那是肯定 除非找到了用过的吸管
<4-8,Foreman>Absolutely,except for the crack pipe.

<5-6,Cuddy>我喜欢艺术 我接受新事物 有错吗?
<5-6,Cuddy>I like art.I'm open to new things.,What's the problem?

182
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,490
<5-7,House>你宁愿去画廊看不存在的情色画
<5-7,House>You're going to a gallery to see venezuel,an pictures that don't exist,

<5-8,Cuddy>One minute I'm mushing along with,the huskies,as usual,

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,790
<5-8,Cuddy>突然之间 全球变暖
<5-8,Cuddy>and suddenly it's global warming.

187
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,090
<5-8,Cuddy>你看到别人从沙盒里捡了一个玩具
<5-8,Cuddy>You think you saw somebody else,pick up a toy from the sandbox,

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,890
<5-9,House>所以你拒绝我?
<5-9,House>Is that why you said no?

190
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,190
<5-10,Cuddy>也许我只是要个朋友,而我觉得Wilson是个安全的选择
<5-10,Cuddy>Maybe I just want a friend,,and I thought wilson was a safe choice.

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,490
<5-11,House>我不安全 酷

<6-4,Foreman>That's why I brought the picture for you.

208
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,890
<5-10,Cuddy>我记得你小的时候
<5-10,Cuddy>I remember when you were little,

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,190
<5-12,Cuddy>因为你知道虽然开头弄不懂
<5-12,Cuddy>because you knew even though,it made no sense then,

<5-13,House>到学年末 你就全部搞懂了

<6-4,Foreman>所以你把照片带来了?
<6-4,Foreman>That's why you brought the picture?

<5-7,House>你习惯向前看 瞧下自己能走多远
<5-7,House>You wanted to look ahead,to see how far you'd go.

214

<5-7,House>现在你长大了
<5-7,House>Now you're a grown man,

<5-7,House>I thought you might like to look back,to see how far you've come.

216
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,390
<7-1,Lupe>一切都豁然开朗了 是不是?
<7-1,Lupe>It all makes sense now,doesn't it?

<7-2,Foreman>- 这不是我的,- 在你橱里找到的

<7-3,Lupe>这是我过去一个室友的
<7-3,Lupe>It belongs to this guy who used,to live with me.

219
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,290
<7-4,Foreman>你最好告诉他他有砷中毒
<7-4,Foreman>You might want to let him know,he's got arsenic poisoning.

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,890
<7-4,Foreman>我们需要他的头发检查一下中毒程度
<7-4,Foreman>We should get a sample of his hair,so we can see the extent--

221
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,090
<7-5,Lupe>但是我不--我不嗑药的

<8-1,Lupe>你肯定不是砷中毒引起的
<8-1,Lupe>Are you sure it isn't from the arsenic?

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,190
<8-1,Lupe>Foreman医生说我中毒了
<8-1,Lupe>Dr. Foreman said I was poisoned.

225
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,390
<8-2,Cameron>你的头发里只有极少量的砷
<8-2,Cameron>Your hair showed only a trace amount.

226
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,190
<8-2,Cameron>不足以对肺造成如此程度的损伤,现在你要保持不动
<8-2,Cameron>Not enough to damage your lungs like this.,We need you to stay still now.

227
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,690
<8-3,Chase>从肺尖开始有六毫米切口
<8-3,Chase>Six-millimeter cuts starting at the apices.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,390

<8-4,Cameron>我绝无意和你约会
<8-4,Cameron>I have no intention of going out with you,

231
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,990
<8-4,Cameron>和你做爱 任何工作以外的事都不行
<8-4,Cameron>of having sex with you--of doing anything,with you except work.

<8-5,Chase>没必要大惊小怪的,我只想跟你提一下来着
<8-5,Chase>We don't have to makea big deal about it.,I just thought I'd let you know.

<8-5,Chase>我觉得周二是个提起话题的好日子
<8-5,Chase>I've decided tuesdays would be a good day,to do that.

<8-6,Cameron>你不是突然间爱上我
<8-6,Cameron>You did not suddenly fall in love with me.

<8-6,Cameron>你是在找寻某些东西 而我恰好--
<8-6,Cameron>You were looking for something,,and I happened to be--

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,690
<8-7,Chase>没必要纠缠这个话题
<8-7,Chase>No need to go on about it.

238
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,690
<8-7,Chase>全面扫描肺底部
<8-7,Chase>I'm dancing through the lung bases.

<8-11,Chase>我不对你强求什么
<8-11,Chase>Look, I'm not demanding anything from you.

242

<8-11,Chase>我没有尾随到你家里,不报期望
<8-11,Chase>I'm not following you home.,I've got no expectations.

243
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,290
<8-11,Chase>每周一次礼貌的提醒不能算是骚扰吧
<8-11,Chase>A gentle, polite reminder once a week,is hardly stalking.

244
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,390
<8-11,Chase>肺舌外有肿块
<8-11,Chase>There's a mass...just outside the lingular.

<9-1,Chase>活检显示血管壁内存有白细胞
<9-1,Chase>Biopsy shows there are white blood cells,in the walls of the blood vessels.

<9-2,House>They're not supposed to get past the bouncers.

247
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,190
<9-3,Cameron>肯定是自体免疫病 淋巴之类的问题
<9-3,Cameron>It's gotta be autoimmune--,something lymphocytic.

248
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,190
<9-3,Cameron>白细胞攻击躯体自身
<9-3,Cameron>The white blood cells are attacking,her own body.

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,090
<9-4,House>剩下的问题就是哪种自体免疫病?
<9-4,House>Only question is what kind of autoimmune?

<9-6,House>- 是哪一种无关紧要,- 是哪一种很有关系
<9-6,House>- It doesn't matter what kind.,- It always matters what kind.

254
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,590
<9-9,Foreman>肯定是巨细胞动脉炎,给她用类固醇
<9-9,Foreman>It's gotta be giant cell arteritis.,I'll start her on steroids.

255
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,190
<9-9,Foreman>如果影响到了小血管,肯定是狼疮性血管炎
<9-9,Foreman>It's affecting the smaller blood vessels.,Gotta be lupusvasculitis.

00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,990
<10-9,Bonnie>全花岗岩台面
<10-9,Bonnie>All-granite countertops.

274
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,590
<10-10,House>既然那时候我没留心,和他约会感觉如何?
<10-10,House>Since I wasn't paying attention back then,,what was it like dating him?

<11-1,Cuddy>- 这是Hockney作品展?,- 不知怎么回事?
<11-1,Cuddy>- So this is hockney?,- No.I don't know what happened.

<11-4,Wilson>好吧 我的错
<11-4,Wilson>Okay, my bad.

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,190
<11-4,Wilson>这不是个适合约会的地方
<11-4,Wilson>This is not somewhere I'd bring someone,on a date.

281
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,190
<11-4,Wilson>明显这也不是约会
<11-4,Wilson>N-not that this is a date,obviously.

282
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,790
<11-4,Wilson>我刚才在想...
<11-4,Wilson>I was just thinking...

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,490
<11-4,Wilson>他现阶段正在创作一些风景画
<11-4,Wilson>he's doing landscapes on multiple canvases now,

284
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,490
<11-4,Wilson>带有宁静的意味 而你一直这么忙
<11-4,Wilson>and they're kinda peaceful.,And you're always so busy.

285
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,390
<11-5,Cuddy>我想以前从没看过你尴尬的样子
<11-5,Cuddy>I don't think I've ever,seen you embarrassed before.

286
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,990
<11-5,Cuddy>哦 那本来就不是约会
<11-5,Cuddy>oh, it was never a date.

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,390
<12-1,Bonnie>我刚结束一段糟糕的恋情,他说我们可以出去 作为朋友
<12-1,Bonnie>I was coming off a bad relationship,,and he said we could go out as friends.

288
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,690
<12-1,Bonnie>就是看看戏 去博物馆
<12-1,Bonnie>You know, just go see plays,,go to a museum.

290
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,390
<12-2,House>所以他说不是约会 但过后骗你上床
<12-2,House>So he'd say it's not a date,,but then he'd jump you.

291
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,890
<12-3,Bonnie>哦 不 他是认真的
<12-3,Bonnie>Oh, no, he meant it.

<12-4,House>- Did you just compare wilson to a tampon?,- No.

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,990
<12-5,Bonnie>所以我骗他上床了

<12-5,Bonnie>卧室在那头

<13-1,Cuddy>这样子没可能不对大肠造成损伤
<13-1,Cuddy>There is no way that won't cause damage,to the large intestine.

<13-2,Wilson>- 这是单车打气筒?,- 就是啊
<13-2,Wilson>- Is that a bicycle pump?,- That's what I'm saying.

302
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
<13-4,Bonnie>好像走入一个难以脱身的陷阱
<13-4,Bonnie>It's like walking into a sticky trap.

303
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,890
<13-4,Bonnie>一旦你是关注的焦点 会上瘾的
<13-4,Bonnie>Once you're the focus of all that attention,,it's addictive.

<13-6,Bonnie>情感上的事情让你深陷其中
<13-6,Bonnie>It's the emotional stuff that really sucks you in.

309
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,490
<13-6,Bonnie>但那时 你已无法自拔
<13-6,Bonnie>But by then,you're hooked.

<13-6,Bonnie>你能不能劝他照顾狗狗?
<13-6,Bonnie>Hey,do you think that you could talk to him,about taking the dog?

313
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,790
<13-7,House>就是说如果在两情相悦前你们就上床了
<13-7,House>So you're saying if you'd actually had sex,before you connected emotionally,

314
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,490
<13-7,House>你会容易解脱
<13-7,House>you'd have gotten over him.

<13-8,Bonnie>是啊 怪怪的 对么?
<13-8,Bonnie>Oh, yeah.It seems weird, right?

321
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,290
<14-2,Lupe>那不是我的吸管

<14-3,Foreman>你说过了 你感到疲劳了?
<14-3,Foreman>You told me.Are you tired?

<14-4,Lupe>我只是用它吸过几次
<14-4,Lupe>I just took a hit off it a couple times.

<14-4,Lupe>小乐一下又有何妨?
<14-4,Lupe>What's wrong with having a little fun?

<14-6,Lupe>你不喜欢我 是不是?
<14-6,Lupe>You don't like me,though, do you?

327
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,690

<16-12,Foreman>A lot of things can cause pain.

438
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,590
<16-13,House>有多痛?
<16-13,House>How much pain?

439
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,590
<16-14,Cameron>疼痛过于强烈
<16-14,Cameron>Too much.

440
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,990
<16-15,Foreman>这不是癌症 也不是自体免疫病
<16-15,Foreman>It's not cancer.It's not autoimmune.

441
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,490
<16-15,Foreman>是感染 而我们破坏了她的免疫系统
<16-15,Foreman>It's an infection,and we fried her immune system.

442
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,190
<16-16,Chase>但她没有高烧 腰椎穿刺没问题
<16-16,Chase>but she had no fever, lp was clear.

443
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,390
<16-17,House>做个回波检测 确认是否感染了心脏
<16-17,House>Do an echo to confirm it's in the heart.

444
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,090
<16-17,House>然后我会告诉病人 我们害死了她
<16-17,House>And then I'll tell our patient,that we just killed her.

445
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,790
<16-18,Foreman>我去告诉她
<16-18,Foreman>I'll tell her.

446
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,190
<16-19,Bonnie>你一直没回我电话
<16-19,Bonnie>You haven't been returning my phone calls.

447
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,590
<16-20,House>- 我很忙,- 好吧
<16-20,House>- I'm busy.,- Well--

448
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,890
<16-21,Bonnie>如果今天下午你能抽出半小时
<16-21,Bonnie>but if you have half an hour,a little later this afternoon,

449
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,290
<16-21,Bonnie>离这里十分钟路程有套公寓
<16-21,Bonnie>I just found this unit,ten minutes from here.

450
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,990
<16-21,Bonnie>还没供应出售
<16-21,Bonnie>It hasn't been on the market yet.

451
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,090
<16-22,House>我不想买公寓
<16-22,House>I'm off the market for condos.

452
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,590
<16-23,Bonnie>James说对了?
<16-23,Bonnie>James was right?

453
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,190
<16-23,Bonnie>我想做你的生意根本是痴人说梦
<16-23,Bonnie>I never had the teeniest chance,of selling you anything.

454
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,490
<16-24,House>他当然说得对
<16-24,House>Of course he was right.

455
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,290
<16-24,House>就算你们离婚了,Wilson还是不停给你好建议
<16-24,House>Wilson doesn't stop giving good advice,just 'cause you're divorced.

456
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,790
<16-24,House>他情不自禁要跟前妻们友好相处
<16-24,House>He's compulsive about remaining on good terms,with his exes.

457
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,990
<16-25,Bonnie>想知道为什么我给狗取名Hector吗?
<16-25,Bonnie>Do you want to know why I named that dog hector?

458
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,090
<16-26,House>不想 保持神秘吧
<16-26,House>No, let's keep it a mystery.

459
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,690
<16-27,Bonnie>他还是幼犬的时候 脾气就超坏
<16-27,Bonnie>Because even when he was a puppy,,he was the worst-tempered dog we'd ever seen.

460
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,490
<16-27,Bonnie>他进行过入室训练
<16-27,Bonnie>He was supposed to be house trained.

461
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,990
<16-27,Bonnie>可每天早上还是在地毯上撒尿
<16-27,Bonnie>He'd pee on the carpet every morning.

462
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,890
<16-27,Bonnie>有人来 他啃他们的脚脖子
<16-27,Bonnie>When we had people over,,he had to nip at their ankles.

463
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,390
<16-27,Bonnie>"Hector尿地毯"的字母重新组合,就变成了Greg House医生
<16-27,Bonnie>"Hector does go rug"is an anagram,for dr. Greg house.

464
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,790
<16-27,Bonnie>我新婚时对你就这样恨之入骨
<16-27,Bonnie>That's how early in the marriage I resented you.

465
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,390
<16-28,House>我白送你们一套餐具了
<16-28,House>Did I ever waste money on that place setting.

466
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,690
<16-29,Bonnie>至少James伤害我后 会心怀内疚
<16-29,Bonnie>James at least had the decency,feel guilty when he hurt me.

467
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,190
<16-30,House>但我没伤害你
<16-30,House>Whereas I didn't hurt you.

468
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,690
<16-30,House>我都没娶你 明智地避免了这样的时刻
<16-30,House>I didn't even marry you,cleverly hoping,to avoid moments like this one.

469
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,690
<16-31,Bonnie>你总是需要他 他也总是支持你
<16-31,Bonnie>You always needed him,,and he was always there for you!

470
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,590
<16-32,House>你再对我喊 就得和我做爱补偿
<16-32,House>If you keep yelling,,I think you'll owe me sex.

471
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,490
<16-33,Bonnie>你知道他妻子在家里等他 可你满不在乎
<16-33,Bonnie>You knew he had a wife waiting at home--,you didn't care.

472
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,690
<16-33,Bonnie>不是说你破坏了这段婚姻,可你袖手旁观
<16-33,Bonnie>I'm not saying you broke up the marriage,,but you didn't help.

473
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,990
<16-34,House>首先 "Hector尿地毯"这个组合用的很烂
<16-34,House>First, "hector does go rug" is a lame anagram.

474
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,690
<16-34,House>想对Gregory House更好地进行重组吗?,"超级自负 对不起"
<16-34,House>You want a better one for gregory house?,"Huge ego, sorry."

475
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,490
<16-34,House>其次 换个行业吧
<16-34,House>Second, find a new career.

476
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,290
<16-34,House>如果让别人决定日程安排,就永远别想卖掉东西
<16-34,House>You're never gonna sell anybody,if you let them control the agenda.

477
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,590
<16-34,House>再者 我没欠你任何东西 我不是Wilson
<16-34,House>Third, I don't owe you anything--,I'm not wilson.

478
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,990
<16-34,House>我可不会为了讨好你而去买房子
<16-34,House>I'm not gonna buy a condo just to,make you feel better.

479
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,790
<17-1,Wilson>- 你还好吗?,- 是的
<17-1,Wilson>- you okay?,- Yeah.

480
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,190
<17-2,Foreman>告诉我该怎么做
<17-2,Foreman>Tell me how to do this.

481
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,490
<17-2,Foreman>House说人们感谢你...
<17-2,Foreman>House says people thank you after--

482
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,990
<17-3,Wilson>没有模式可循
<17-3,Wilson>it's not typical.

483
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,290
<17-4,Foreman>我害死了这个女人
<17-4,Foreman>I already killed this woman.

484
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,590
<17-4,Foreman>现在我能做的就是别再犯错
<17-4,Foreman>All I can do now is not make any more mistakes.

485
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,690
<17-5,Wilson>首先 别以为你可以将伤害减到最低
<17-5,Wilson>First of all,stop thinking,you can minimize the hurt.

486
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,490
<17-5,Wilson>很多人都害怕死亡
<17-5,Wilson>A lot of people are afraid of the word "dying."

487
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,190
<17-5,Wilson>如果你为此过于谨慎 她就无法理解你
<17-5,Wilson>If you pussyfoot around it,,she is not gonna read your mind.

488
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,290
<17-6,Foreman>- 好吧,- 不 不是
<17-6,Foreman>- Okay.,- No, it's not.

489
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,690
<17-7,Wilson>你看着她时 会自然而然地想转变话题
<17-7,Wilson>When you look in her face,,you're gonna feel the instinct to temporize.

490
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,190
<17-7,Wilson>- 克服它,- 好的
<17-7,Wilson>- Crush it.,- Yeah.

491
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,890
<17-8,Foreman>然后等 给她时间接受这个消息
<17-8,Foreman>Then wait.Give her time to process the news.

492
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,490
<17-9,Wilson>让她知道你会陪伴她经历一切
<17-9,Wilson>Let her know you'll be with her,through all of it.

493
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,590
<17-9,Wilson>等到她不愿再想 目光重新与你相遇
<17-9,Wilson>Wait till she's done thinking,,till she meets your eyes again.

494
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,890
<17-9,Wilson>然后 当时机合适 碰触她
<17-9,Wilson>Then, if you feel it's appropriate,,you can touch her.

495
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,490
<17-9,Wilson>也许像这样握着她手臂
<17-9,Wilson>Maybe put your hand on her arm like this.

496
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,390
<17-9,Wilson>让她知道还有人跟她心手相连
<17-9,Wilson>Let her know she's still connected,to another human being.

497
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,290
<17-10,Foreman>你这办法很科学
<17-10,Foreman>You've got this down to a science.

498
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,790
<17-11,Wilson>你吓坏了
<17-11,Wilson>You're freaking out.

499
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,990
<17-12,Foreman>- 我告诉你了,- 满足她的需要
<17-12,Foreman>- I told you--,- give her what she needs.

500
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,990
<17-13,Wilson>她不需要一个因为做出错误决定
<17-13,Wilson>What she doesn't need is a doctor,who's not there with her

501
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,790
<17-13,Wilson>而弃她不顾的医生
<17-13,Wilson>because he made the wrong call.

502
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,690
<17-13,Wilson>你吓坏了 你理应如此
<17-13,Wilson>You are freaking out.,You should be freaking out.

503
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,290
<17-15,Wilson>我不会让她看出来的
<17-15,Wilson>I won't let her see it.

504
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,490
<17-15,Wilson>让她看出来吧
<17-15,Wilson>Let her see it.

505
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,090
<18-1,Lupe>怎么不戴面罩?
<18-1,Lupe>Hey.How come no mask?

506
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,390
<18-2,Foreman>我们认为...你受到了感染
<18-2,Foreman>We think...you have an infection.

507
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,590
<18-3,Lupe>放射治疗没用吗?
<18-3,Lupe>Didn't the radiation work?

508
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,090
<18-4,Foreman>它没有起到预想的作用
<18-4,Foreman>It didn't do what it was supposed to do.

509
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,890
<18-4,Foreman>你要死了
<18-4,Foreman>You're dying.

510
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,990
<18-5,Lupe>你是说 情况很严重 某天我会...
<18-5,Lupe>What--you mean, like,things are bad,,and someday I'm gonna--

511
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,490
<18-5,Lupe>还有多少时间?
<18-5,Lupe>how much time?

512
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,590
<18-5,Lupe>还有多少时间?
<18-5,Lupe>How much time?

513
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,590
<18-6,Foreman>- 不能确定,- 一年?
<18-6,Foreman>- We can't know exactly.,- A year?

514
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,990
<18-7,Lupe>- 不到一年?,- 不到24小时
<18-7,Lupe>- Less than a year?,- Less than 24 hours.

515
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,890
<18-8,Foreman>我不明白
<18-8,Foreman>I don't understand.

516
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,400
<18-9,Lupe>为什么告诉我这个 吓唬我?
<18-9,Lupe>Why are you saying this to,me?You trying to scare me?

517
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,700
<18-9,Lupe>- 你为什么这么做?,- 对不起 这是事实
<18-9,Lupe>-Why would you do that?,-I'm sorry, it's true.

518
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,200
<18-11,Lupe>这癌症这么厉害?,昨天你还认为我有机会
<18-11,Lupe>How bad is this cancer?,Yesterday you thought I had a chance.

519
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,400
<18-12,Foreman>你得的不是癌症
<18-12,Foreman>You don't have cancer.

520
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,200
<18-12,Foreman>你受到了感染
<18-12,Foreman>You came in with an infection.

521
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
<18-13,Lupe>- 我们没有查出来,- 什么感染?
<18-13,Lupe>-We didn't catch it.,-What kind of infection?

522
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,600
<18-13,Lupe>这不重要
<18-13,Lupe>Doesn't matter.

523
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
<18-14,Foreman>放射治疗是最坏的措施
<18-14,Foreman>The radiation was the worst,thing we could've done.

524
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,000
<18-14,Foreman>破坏了你身体的抵抗能力
<18-14,Foreman>We destroyed the part of your,body that was fighting it off.

525
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,600
<18-14,Foreman>感染已经扩散到心脏了
<18-14,Foreman>It spread to your heart.

526
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
<18-15,Lupe>那给我吃药吧
<18-15,Lupe>Then give me drugs.

527
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,900
<18-15,Lupe>有治疗感染的药物
<18-15,Lupe>They have drugs for infections.

528
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
<18-16,Foreman>抗生素要结合免疫系统才能生效
<18-16,Foreman>Antibiotics work with the immune system.

529
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,600
<18-16,Foreman>但放射治疗瓦解了你的免疫系统
<18-16,Foreman>But your immune system is,nonexistent because of the radiation.

530
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,000
<18-17,Lupe>如果是心脏问题 那就给我一个新的心脏
<18-17,Lupe>If it's my heart,you can get me a new heart.

531
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,200
<18-17,Lupe>- 一直都有人接受心脏移植,- 这也无补于事
<18-17,Lupe>-People have heart transplants all the time.,-It wouldn't help.

532
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,000
<18-17,Lupe>你全身都受到了感染
<18-17,Lupe>The infection is everywhere.

533
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,100
<18-18,Foreman>已经回天乏力了
<18-18,Foreman>There's nothing anybody can do.

534
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
<18-18,Foreman>对不起
<18-18,Foreman>I'm so sorry.

535
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,900
<18-18,Foreman>我们通知了你的祖父母
<18-18,Foreman>We've called your grandparents.

536
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,300
<18-19,Lupe>别碰我!
<18-19,Lupe>Get the hell away from me!

537
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,600
<18-19,Lupe>滚出去 滚出去!
<18-19,Lupe>Get out!Get out!

538
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,100
<19-1,Cameron>你大概骨折了
<19-1,Cameron>I think it's broken.

539
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,900
<19-2,Foreman>没能戏剧化地解决一切
<19-2,Foreman>Nothing like a melodramatic,gesture to solve everything.

540
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,300
<19-3,Cameron>我们也错了 类固醇治不好她
<19-3,Cameron>We were wrong too.,Steroids wouldn't have helped her.

541
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,300
<19-4,Foreman>我不是没帮她,实际是我置她于死地
<19-4,Foreman>I didn't not help her.,I actually pulled the trigger.

542
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,500
<19-5,Cameron>现在你也无能为力了
<19-5,Cameron>There's nothing left for you to do.

543
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,400
<19-6,Foreman>- 你可以回家...,- 你不过想宽慰我
<19-6,Foreman>-One of us could go home with--,-you're trying to make me feel better.

544
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,700
<19-7,Cameron>没错
<19-7,Cameron>Yeah.

545
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
<19-7,Cameron>我害死了一个女人
<19-7,Cameron>I killed a woman.

546
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,400
<19-8,Foreman>难道你不觉得至少,我该有一刻感觉一团糟吗?
<19-8,Foreman>Don't you think it's appropriate that I,feel like crap for at least a little while?

547
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
<20-3,Foreman>这帮不了她
<20-3,Foreman>It won't help her.

<19-11,Cameron>- 他在哪儿?,- 去重症病房了

<20-2,House>准备做抽吸

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,600
<20-2,House>我们还不知道什么感染...
<20-2,House>We still don't know what infection--

552
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,600
<20-3,Foreman>- 这对她没用,- 这不会伤害她
<20-3,Foreman>-it's not gonna help her.,-It's not gonna hurt her.

<20-4,House>好吧 会伤害她
<20-4,House>Well, it is gonna hurt her,

555
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,700
<20-6,House>只要几分钟 脓肿取样 再加上...
<20-6,House>It's just gonna take a few minutes.,Grab a piece of an abscess,some pus--

556
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
<20-7,Foreman>你真的对此漠不关心
<20-7,Foreman>you really don't care.

557
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,800
<20-8,House>你对她的死因真的漠不关心
<20-8,House>You really don't care why she's gonna be dead.

558
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,200
<20-9,Foreman>- 她要死了 是因为...,- 什么?!
<20-9,Foreman>-She's gonna be dead because--,-What?!

559
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,200
<20-10,House>到底哪儿搞砸了 遗漏了什么?
<20-10,House>What did we screw up,what did we miss?

560
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,400
<20-10,House>我得知道
<20-10,House>I need to know.

561
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
<20-11,Foreman>你得等
<20-11,Foreman>You'll have to wait.

562
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,700
<20-11,Foreman>把她转移回她的病房
<20-11,Foreman>We're moving her back to her room.

563

<20-12,Nurse>做过全身放射治疗的病人得呆在重症病房
<20-12,Nurse>Patients who've had total body,radiation have to stay in icu.

564
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,600
<20-13,Foreman>重症病房帮不了她
<20-13,Foreman>Icu isn't gonna help her.

565
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
<20-13,Foreman>至少给她点私人空间
<20-13,Foreman>Let's give her some privacy.

566
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,300
<20-14,Lupe>你想干嘛?
<20-14,Lupe>What do you want?

<20-14,Lupe>想看看我是否按时死亡?
<20-14,Lupe>Want to see if I'm dying on schedule?

568
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,400
<20-14,Lupe>还是你想我说 没关系 我原谅你了?
<20-14,Lupe>Or do you want me to tell you,it's all right--I'm okay with it?

569
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,600
<20-15,Foreman>希望你原谅我
<20-15,Foreman>I'd like your forgiveness.

570
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
<20-15,Foreman>虽然我并不指望你的原谅
<20-15,Foreman>I don't expect it.

571
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,000
<20-16,Lupe>很好 这可不像你在超市推车撞到我
<20-16,Lupe>Good, 'cause this isn't like you ran,your cart into mine at the supermarket.

572
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,800

<20-17,Foreman>如果他们不能及时赶来
<20-17,Foreman>If they don't make it on time,

575

<20-17,Foreman>你有什么话要我转达给他们吗?
<20-17,Foreman>is there anything you would like me to tell them?

576
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,300
<20-18,Lupe>我从不了解他们
<20-18,Lupe>I never really knew them.

577
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,300
<20-19,Foreman>想让我给你朋友打电话吗?
<20-19,Foreman>You got any friends you want me to call?

578
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
<20-20,Lupe>现在是深夜
<20-20,Lupe>It's the middle of the night.

579
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,400
<20-20,Lupe>他们可不是那种肯帮你翻身
<20-20,Lupe>They're not the kind of friends,you ask to help you move,

580
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,800
<20-20,Lupe>不介意看着你死
<20-20,Lupe>never mind watch you die.

581
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,400
<20-20,Lupe>我还有很多事没做
<20-20,Lupe>I never did much.

582
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,400
<20-20,Lupe>身后没有留下一男半女
<20-20,Lupe>No kid to leave behind.

583
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,600
<20-20,Lupe>当我死时 世界依然如故
<20-20,Lupe>When I go, the world's not gonna be any different.

584
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,100
<20-20,Lupe>对你也算是个慰藉 对吧?
<20-20,Lupe>Kind of a relief for you, huh?

585
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,300
<20-21,Foreman>关于我...你说对了
<20-21,Foreman>You were right...about me.

586
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,800
<20-22,Lupe>是吗 哪次?
<20-22,Lupe>Yeah, which time?

587
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,000
<20-23,Foreman>我...
<20-23,Foreman>I, uh--

588
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,500
<20-23,Foreman>我对你有成见
<20-23,Foreman>I had a problem with you.

589
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,500
<20-23,Foreman>但你也有说错的地方
<20-23,Foreman>But you were wrong too.

590
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,100
<20-23,Foreman>我做过糟糕的决定
<20-23,Foreman>I've made some bad decisions.

591
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,200
<20-23,Foreman>偷车 抢劫
<20-23,Foreman>Stole cars,robbed houses.

592
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,700
<20-24,Lupe>害死人
<20-24,Lupe>Killed a woman.

593
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,800
<20-25,Foreman>但后来我有了改过自新的机会
<20-25,Foreman>But then I got another chance.

594
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,100
<20-25,Foreman>我离开家上了大学
<20-25,Foreman>I left home,went to college,

595
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,200
<20-25,Foreman>走进一个截然不同的世界
<20-25,Foreman>entered a whole other world.

596
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,700
<20-25,Foreman>可我无法摆脱的某一部分总是在想
<20-25,Foreman>But some part of me I can't,get rid of always thinks

597
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,300
<20-25,Foreman>如果我不是最聪明的 不拿第一名
<20-25,Foreman>if I'm not the smartest,if I'm not the first,

598
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,100
<20-25,Foreman>不管我去哪里 人们都会想我不属于这里
<20-25,Foreman>everywhere i go,they'll figure,out I'm not supposed to be here.

599
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,400
<20-25,Foreman>他们会把我送回去
<20-25,Foreman>They'll send me back.

600
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,100
<20-26,Lupe>你知道这种事不会发生
<20-26,Lupe>You know that's not gonna happen.

601
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,600
<20-26,Lupe>你闯出去了
<20-26,Lupe>You're out.

602
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
<20-27,Foreman>我永远离不开那里
<20-27,Foreman>I'll never be out of there.

603
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,600
<20-27,Foreman>我念大学的最后一个圣诞节回家时
<20-27,Foreman>When I came home that last,christmas I was in college,

604
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,000
<20-27,Foreman>感觉房子小得容不下我
<20-27,Foreman>it was like the rooms felt so small.

605
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,300
<20-27,Foreman>我感到窒息
<20-27,Foreman>I was suffocating.

606
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,500
<20-27,Foreman>可当我在门口告别时
<20-27,Foreman>But when I was standing on,the stoop saying good-bye,

607
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,100
<20-27,Foreman>妈妈张开手臂抱住我
<20-27,Foreman>my mom put her arms around me.

608
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,900
<20-27,Foreman>那是
<20-27,Foreman>That was--

609
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,200
<20-27,Foreman>那是我最后一次感觉如此自在温暖
<20-27,Foreman>that was the last timeI ever felt at home.

610
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,500
<20-27,Foreman>我拉开你跟我的距离
<20-27,Foreman>I only put distance...between you and me

611
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
<20-27,Foreman>因为我知道我们之间没有距离
<20-27,Foreman>because I know there isn't any.

612
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,800
<20-27,Foreman>关于我你也说得对
<20-27,Foreman>You were right about me too.

613
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,500
<20-28,Lupe>针对我这类人的体制的那些言论
<20-28,Lupe>That stuff about the system,being against people like me.

614
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,900
<20-28,Lupe>我知道全是胡话
<20-28,Lupe>I know it's crap.

615

<20-28,Lupe>我是说 这没错
<20-28,Lupe>I mean, it's true,

616
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,700
<20-28,Lupe>可也是胡话
<20-28,Lupe>but it's also crap.

617
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,600
<20-28,Lupe>我没有准备好再试一次
<20-28,Lupe>I just wasn't ready to try again.

618
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,500
<20-28,Lupe>可我总觉得我还年轻
<20-28,Lupe>But I always thought I was young,

619

<23-2,House>or give alms to the poor.

658
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,500
<23-2,House>随便选个能带给你慰藉的方式
<23-2,House>Whatever ritual comforts you.

659
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,300
<23-3,Foreman>我害死了她
<23-3,Foreman>I killed her.

660
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
<23-4,House>我也有份
<23-4,House>Yeah, me too.

661
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,700
<23-5,Foreman>这不是说"哦 我早该想到"
<23-5,Foreman>This wasn't,"oh, I should have,thought of that idea sooner."

662
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,100
<23-5,Foreman>这不是简单的用药失误
<23-5,Foreman>This wasn't messing up a dosage.

663
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,500
<23-5,Foreman>我们看着疾病象火车一样冲向某人
<23-5,Foreman>We see a disease rushing,down on someone like a train,

664
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
<23-5,Foreman>却不能每次都把他们拉出来
<23-5,Foreman>we can't always get them out of the way.

665
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,600
<23-5,Foreman>事情不是这样的
<23-5,Foreman>This wasn't that.

666
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
<23-5,Foreman>不是
<23-5,Foreman>No.

667
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,600
<23-6,House>你会再犯的
<23-6,House>And you'll do it again.

668
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,300
<23-6,House>对许多医生而言
<23-6,House>For a lot of doctors,

669
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,300
<23-6,House>一生只犯错一次
<23-6,House>this would be a once in a lifetime mistake.

670
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
<23-6,House>但我们不像这些医生
<23-6,House>But we're not a lot of doctors.

671
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,100
<23-6,House>我们救过的病人 比平凡医生多得多
<23-6,House>We must've saved more patients,than the guy down the street.

672
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,500
<23-6,House>可有一小部分病人 他能用常规方法拯救
<23-6,House>But a few of the ones that he'd save,by doing what everyone else does,

673
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
<23-6,House>我们会失败
<23-6,House>we will lose.

674
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,800
<23-7,Foreman>所以你要给我讲数据
<23-7,Foreman>So you're giving me numbers.

675
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,100
<23-8,House>因为数据不会撒谎
<23-8,House>'Cause they don't lie.

676
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,100
<23-8,House>我无法原谅你 Foreman
<23-8,House>I can't forgive you,foreman...

677
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,600
<23-8,House>因为没什么需要原谅的
<23-8,House>because there's nothing to forgive.

678
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,200
<24-1,Wilson>你跟他说了什么?
<24-1,Wilson>what did you tell him?

679
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,200
<24-2,House>无需内疚
<24-2,House>That guilt is irrelevant.

680
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,000
<24-3,Wilson>- 去吃点东西吗?,- 不行
<24-3,Wilson>-You want to get something to eat?,-Can't.

681
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,300
<24-4,House>家里还有条狗在等着
<24-4,House>Got a dog waiting at home.

682
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,600
<24-4,House>怎么了?
<24-4,House>What's wrong?

683
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,900
<24-4,House>我干了坏事 妈妈
<24-4,House>I did something bad, mom.

684
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,700
<25-1,Foreman>- 我伤害了别人,- 这不是你的错
<25-1,Foreman>-I hurt somebody.,-It wasn't your fault.

685
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,900
<25-1,Foreman>- 是我的错,- 那么我原谅你
<25-1,Foreman>-It was.,-Then I forgive you.

686
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,800
<25-2,Foreman>我原谅你
<25-2,Foreman>I forgive you.

687
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,100
<25-2,Foreman>从你的脸庞我可以看出来...
<25-2,Foreman>I can see from your face...

688
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,600
<25-3,Foreman>你永远不会故意伤害别人
<25-3,Foreman>you'd never hurt anybody on purpose.

689
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,900
<25-3,Foreman>知道我是谁吗 妈妈?
<25-3,Foreman>Do you know who I am, mom?

690
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,900
<25-3,Foreman>是Eric
<25-3,Foreman>It's eric.

691
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,800
<25-3,Foreman>当然
<25-3,Foreman>Of course.

692
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,100
<25-3,Foreman>我大儿子也叫Eric
<25-3,Foreman>*'s boy's name is eric.
