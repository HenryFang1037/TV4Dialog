39
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,860
<3-3,ROBIN>在找她的猫
<3-3,ROBIN>looking for her cat.

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,330
<3-4,WILSON>最近撞到过脑袋吗?

<3-5,FRAN>没有
<3-5,FRAN>No.

42
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,200
<3-6,WILSON>这是抗运动病贴片吗?,(防止运动异常引起的神经系统失调)
<3-6,WILSON>Is this a motion sickness patch?

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,890
<3-7,FRAN>我一定忘了把它取下来

<3-8,WILSON>东莨菪碱(镇静剂)可以引起头昏眼花
<3-8,WILSON>Scopolamine can cause,dizziness and blurred vision.

47
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,110
<3-8,WILSON>你跌倒的时候一定脑袋撞地
<3-8,WILSON>You probably hit your head,when you fell

48
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,490
<3-8,WILSON>所以会失去知觉
<3-8,WILSON>and that caused the blackout.

49
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,670
<4-1,ROBIN>我以为贴片是为了预防不适
<4-1,ROBIN>I thought those patches were supposed,to prevent you from getting sick.

50
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,270
<4-2,WILSON>药物皆有副作用

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,770
<4-2,WILSON>确保她安然无恙
<4-2,WILSON>for the next few hours,to make sure she's okay.

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,110
<4-5,ROBIN>这很重要吗?
<4-5,ROBIN>Is it important?

56
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,870
<4-6,WILSON>只是不希望人们出院后一个人待着
<4-6,WILSON>We just don't like people to be alone,after they leave here.

696
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,170
<36-7,HOUSE>由于蠢 他太快升上水面
<36-7,HOUSE>and like an idiot,,he surfaced too quickly.

697
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,470
<36-7,HOUSE>由于非常非常蠢

<36-7,HOUSE>他登上升至海平面上8000尺高的飞机
<36-7,HOUSE>he boarded a flight which is pressurized,to 8,000 feet above sea level.

699

<36-7,HOUSE>低气压让他生命垂危,(减压过急 本溶于血液的氮气形成气泡)
<36-7,HOUSE>Low pressure is killing him.

700

<37-1,CHASE>不幸的是除虫工人不知道
<37-1,CHASE>Unfortunately the exterminator,didn't know that,

705
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,270
<37-1,CHASE>所以隔壁熏虫的时候
<37-1,CHASE>so when they fumigated next door,

706
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,070
<37-1,CHASE>有毒气体顺着旧管道 到了你的房子里
<37-1,CHASE>the poison gas flowed through,the old pipe and into your house.

707
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,270
<37-2,WILSON>东莨菪碱贴片掩盖了毒性
<37-2,WILSON>the scopolamine patch was,masking the effects of the poison.

708

<37-2,WILSON>你需要留院观察几天
<37-2,WILSON>You'll have to stay here,for a few more days,

709
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,870
<37-2,WILSON>之后应该就没什么事了
<37-2,WILSON>but after that you should be fine.

<37-5,FRAN>我以为这是对我离开的惩罚
<37-5,FRAN>I thought I was being,punished for going away,but

<38-6,HOUSE>你的大脑唆使身体出现皮疹 畏光和呕吐
<38-6,HOUSE>Your mind convinced your body to,get a rash,photophobia,and vomit.
