00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
<2-6,Naomi>是子痫前期吗
<2-6,Naomi>It's preeclampsia, isn't it?

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,110
<2-6,Naomi>我会流产  对吗

<5-4,Chase>那又能怎么样
<5-4,Chase>What would that have achieved?

120
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,930
<5-4,Chase>难道他能跳进时间机器
<5-4,Chase>Was he gonna jump into his time machine

121
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,070
<5-4,Chase>回到过去弥补一切吗
<5-4,Chase>and fix everything?

122
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,690
<5-5,Foreman>假如你家狗拉在地板上了
<5-5,Foreman>When a dog dumps on the floor,

123
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,820
<5-5,Foreman>你会去拍拍它的头吗
<5-5,Foreman>do you pat its head?

124
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,760
<5-5,Foreman>不  你会用报纸狠抽它
<5-5,Foreman>No. You smack it in the nose with a newspaper.

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,970
<5-6,Chase>狗知错就改  豪斯可不会
<5-6,Chase>Dogs can learn things. House can't.

126
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,170
<5-7,Foreman>-懦夫  -幼稚
<5-7,Foreman>- Coward. - Child.

127
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,520
<5-8,Chase>嘿  你们好
<5-8,Chase>Hey, there.

128
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,780
<5-9,Foreman>我带同事来帮忙检查
<5-9,Foreman>I, uh, brought my colleague along to help out.

129
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,510
<5-10,Chase>你们好  我是奇斯医生
<5-10,Chase>Hi. I'm Dr. Chase.

130
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,500
<5-11,Naomi>你好
<5-11,Naomi>Hi.

131
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,800
<6-1,Chase>超声图像看来正常
<6-1,Chase>Well, ultrasound looks good.

132
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,420
<6-1,Chase>没有胎儿窘迫迹象
<6-1,Chase>No sign of fetal distress.

133
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,090
<6-2,Naomi>那不是子痫前期
<6-2,Naomi>So it's not preeclampsia?

134
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,440
<6-3,Chase>还是有可能的  但至少目前没有恶化
<6-3,Chase>Well, it still could be, but it hasn't progressed at least.

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,810
<6-3,Chase>请你平躺休息  我们要监测孩子的状况
<6-3,Chase>We're gonna put you on bed rest and monitor the baby.

136
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,730
<6-4,Naomi>好的
<6-4,Naomi>Okay.

137
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,230
<6-5,Chase>同时要给你补充一些钾和镁
<6-5,Chase>We'll give you some potassium and magnesium as well.

138
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,930
<6-5,Chase>现在就给她持续输液
<6-5,Chase>We should keep the fluids running for now...

139
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,560
<6-5,Chase>一个小时后再来检查
<6-5,Chase>and check her again in an hour

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,590
<6-5,Chase>-万一出现有胎儿窘迫再说  -亲爱的
<6-5,Chase>- unless there are signs of fetal distress. - Honey?

141
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,630
<6-6,Sean>她噎到了
<6-6,Sean>She's choking!

142
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,820
<6-7,Foreman>身体前倾
<6-7,Foreman>Lean forward.

143
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,820
<6-9,Foreman>-她怎么了  -可能是有些肌无力
<6-9,Foreman>- Is she all right? - Probably just some muscle weakness.

144
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,990
<6-10,Sean>-什么叫"可能"  -内奥米  张嘴
<6-10,Sean>- What do you mean "Probably"? - Naomi, open up.

145
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,920
<6-11,Foreman>人吃东西都会噎到的  可能没什么
<6-11,Foreman>People choke. It could be nothing.

146
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,460
<6-12,Chase>你还好吗
<6-12,Chase>You all right?

147
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,700
<6-13,Naomi>我不能  我不能吞咽了
<6-13,Naomi>I can't-- I can't-- I can't even swallow.

148
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,520
<7-1,Joel>她经常生病
<7-1,Joel>She gets sick a lot.

149
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,340
<7-1,Joel>就像这样  这次感冒突然就变得很严重
<7-1,Joel>Like this-- this cold got really bad all of a sudden.

150
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,620
<7-1,Joel>还发烧
<7-1,Joel>And the fever--

151
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,050
<7-1,Joel>嘘  没事的
<7-1,Joel>Shh. It's okay.

152
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,350
<7-2,House>不是感冒  是肺炎
<7-2,House>It's not a cold. It's pneumonia.

153
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,410
<7-3,Rachel>肺炎
<7-3,Rachel>Pneumonia?

154
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,290
<7-4,House>别紧张  肺炎只是她的第二大问题
<7-4,House>Relax. Pneumonia's her second biggest problem.

155
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,550
<7-4,House>她的体重本来重于25%的同龄儿
<7-4,House>She has gone from the 25th weight percentile

156
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,180
<7-4,House>结果一个月内成了最轻的那3%
<7-4,House>to the third in one month.

157
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,130
<7-4,House>我不是婴儿方面专家
<7-4,House>I'm not a baby expert,

158
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,890
<7-4,House>但我肯定婴儿不应该缩小
<7-4,House>but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to shrink.

159
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
<7-5,Rachel>在她停止母乳喂养后
<7-5,Rachel>Well, there's this diet we put her on

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,220
<7-5,Rachel>我们给她规定了饮食
<7-5,Rachel>when she stopped breast-feeding.

161
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,000
<7-6,Joel>是健康的方式  生食  我们是素食者
<7-6,Joel>But it's healthy. Um, raw food. We're vegans.

162
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,170
<7-6,Joel>杏仁牛奶  豆腐  蔬菜
<7-6,Joel>Almond milk, tofu, uh, vegetables.

163
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,320
<7-6,Joel>生食
<7-6,Joel>Raw food.

164
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,840
<7-7,House>要是祖先们会生火就好了
<7-7,House>If only her ancestors had mastered the secret of fire.

165
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,830
<7-7,House>婴孩需要脂肪  蛋白质  热量
<7-7,House>Babies need fat, proteins, calories.

166
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,210
<7-7,House>其次才是豆芽和纤维
<7-7,House>Less important, sprouts and hemp.

167
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,080
<7-7,House>让孩子受饿可不好
<7-7,House>Starving babies is bad--

168
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,480
<7-7,House>在一些国家甚至犯法的
<7-7,House>and illegal in many cultures.

169
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,110
<7-7,House>帮她办住院手续吧
<7-7,House>I'm having her admitted.

170
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,620
<7-8,Rachel>她会好起来吗
<7-8,Rachel>Is she gonna be all right?

171
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,150
<7-9,House>用抗生素治疗肺炎
<7-9,House>Antibiotics for the pneumonia,

172
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,730
<7-9,House>静脉营养疗法恢复她的体重
<7-9,House>I.V. feeding to get the weight up.

173
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,860
<7-9,House>别担心  静脉注射的是素食
<7-9,House>Don't worry. It's a vegan I.V.

174
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,990
<8-1,Chase>成像显示无任何血管炎迹象
<8-1,Chase>Don't see any signs of vasculitis.

175
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,780
<8-1,Chase>奇怪
<8-1,Chase>Odd.

176
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,780
<8-1,Chase>你不是什么事情总是对的嘛
<8-1,Chase>Since you're always right about everything.

177
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,910
<8-2,Foreman>也许是不同的自身免疫症
<8-2,Foreman>Could be a different autoimmunity.

178
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,730
<8-2,Foreman>或者驳倒我
<8-2,Foreman>Or you could bite me.

179
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,340
<8-3,Naomi>哦  不
<8-3,Naomi>Oh, no.

180
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,560
<8-4,Chase>内奥米  你还好吗
<8-4,Chase>Naomi, you okay?

181
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,190
<8-5,Naomi>不好  我不能  我肚子好疼
<8-5,Naomi>No. I can't-- I'm getting cramps.

182
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,410
<8-7,Naomi>-厉害吗  -是的  就好像要流产
<8-7,Naomi>- Strong? - Oh. Yeah. Feels like my miscarriage.

183
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,670
<8-8,Chase>-停下  -要早产了
<8-8,Chase>- Stop. - Preterm labor.

184
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,160
<8-9,Naomi>他还太小  肯定活不下来的
<8-9,Naomi>He's too little. He won't survive.

185
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,860
<8-10,Foreman>-她已经服过镁了  -注射间羟舒喘宁
<8-10,Foreman>- She's on magnesium already.  - Fluids and terbutaline then.

186
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,530
<8-11,Chase>我们得给你服一些药  好吗
<8-11,Chase>We're gonna give you some medicine,okay?

187
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,170
<8-11,Chase>-阻止你的分娩  -好的
<8-11,Chase>- Try to stop your labor. - Okay.

188
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,550
<8-11,Chase>好的
<8-11,Chase>Okay.

189
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,230
<9-1,House>你在这儿啊  我到处找你
<9-1,House>There you are. Been looking everywhere for you.

190
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,600
<9-1,House>哦  对了
<9-1,House>Uh, listen,

191
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,270
<9-1,House>你说过如果我不对你的新药好好评价的话
<9-1,House>you said that I had to cut one of my people...

192
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,580
<9-1,House>我就得开除一个人
<9-1,House>if I didn't give that speech about your drug.

193
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,260
<9-1,House>凭良心说吧
<9-1,House>And, uh, in fairness to your point of view,

194
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,440
<9-1,House>我的评论真不合你意
<9-1,House>my speech really wasn't the one you had in mind

195
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,910
<9-1,House>所以我开了卡梅隆
<9-1,House>so I've cut Cameron.

196
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,090
<9-3,House>现在你我两清了吧
<9-3,House>Now we're all squared away, right?

197
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,710
<9-2,Vogler>明天早上  我希望看到你
<9-2,Vogler>In the morning, I expect you...

198
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,260
<9-2,Vogler>拿着你的辞职信到我办公室来
<9-2,Vogler>in my office with your letter of resignation...

199
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,510
<9-2,Vogler>并且准备公开道歉
<9-2,Vogler>and plans for a public apology,

200
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,710
<9-2,Vogler>否则我会彻底打垮你
<9-2,Vogler>otherwise I'll destroy you.

201
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,290
<9-3,House>所以你是说我们还没扯平
<9-3,House>So, that's a no on us being squared away?

202
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,230
<10-1,Chase>她也许能捱到胎儿足月
<10-1,Chase>She might make it to full term.

203
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,820
<10-1,Chase>宫缩次数正在减少而且不那么明显了
<10-1,Chase>Contractions are less frequent and not well organized.

204
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,570
<10-2,Foreman>真高兴看见你回到这里
<10-2,Foreman>Great to see you back in the office.

205
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,310
<10-2,Foreman>沃格勒找到你了吧
<10-2,Foreman>I guess Vogler found you?

206
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,000
<10-3,House>是啊  我们和气地聊了一会儿
<10-3,House>Yeah. We had a nice little chat.

207
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,670
<10-3,House>我真应该留下卡梅隆
<10-3,House>I really should have kept Cameron.

208
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,410
<10-3,House>她知道糖放在哪儿
<10-3,House>She knew where to find the sugar.

209
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,440
<10-4,Chase>就是我说的  子痫前期
<10-4,Chase>It's what I said: preeclampsia.

210
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,630
<10-4,Chase>她躺在造影机里有点紧张
<10-4,Chase>A little stress from the M.R.A.,

211
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,090
<10-4,Chase>所以造成早产
<10-4,Chase>she pops right into labor.

212
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,890
<10-6,Foreman>会不会是肌无力
<10-6,Foreman>What about the myasthenia?

213
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,540
<10-7,Chase>算了  她看上去没那么虚弱
<10-7,Chase>Come on. She didn't seem that weak.

214
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,190
<10-8,Foreman>可她确实噎住了  甚至无法吞咽
<10-8,Foreman>She choked. She couldn't even swallow.

215
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,660
<10-9,House>-什么东西把她噎住了  -吃的东西
<10-9,House>- What did she choke on? - Her food.

216
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,750
<10-10,Foreman>但是肌无力不是子痫前期的症状
<10-10,Foreman>But muscle weakness isn't a symptom of preeclampsia.

217
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,040
<10-11,House>-什么吃的东西  -一点熟梨片
<10-11,House>- What kind of food? - A little bit of cooked pear.

218
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,530
<10-12,Foreman>无关紧要  她就是身体虚弱了点
<10-12,Foreman>Doesn't matter. Shows weakness.

219
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,120
<10-13,House>嫩滑的梨片就能把她噎住了
<10-13,House>She choked on soft, wet pear?

220
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,160
<10-13,House>吃梨还要吐骨头吗
<10-13,House>Did she forget to take the bones out?

221
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,120
<10-13,House>她也太无力了吧
<10-13,House>That's way past muscle weakness.

222
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,890
<10-13,House>有没有给她做内窥镜检查
<10-13,House>Did you do an upper endoscopy?

223
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,140
<10-14,Chase>你觉得她食管里有东西堵着
<10-14,Chase>You think there's something obstructing her esophagus?

224
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,350
<10-15,Wilson>-我们得谈谈  -唔  我们得谈谈了
<10-15,Wilson>- We gotta talk. - Ooh. We gotta talk.

225
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
<10-16,House>还有  检查她的眼睑
<10-16,House>And check her eyelids.

226
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,780
<10-17,Foreman>检查眼睑
<10-17,Foreman>Check her eyelids?

227
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,680
<11-1,Wilson>今天董事会要开特别会议
<11-1,Wilson>Special board meeting today.

228
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,040
<11-1,Wilson>只有一个议题  你
<11-1,Wilson>Only one item on the agenda: you.

229
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,100
<11-2,House>会上多吃点百吉饼  谁也动不了我
<11-2,House>Enjoy the bagels. I'm untouchable.

230
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,000
<11-3,Wilson>你厉害
<11-3,Wilson>Right.

231
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,490
<11-4,House>任何撤销我任期的表决必须全票通过才能生效
<11-4,House>Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous.

232
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,360
<11-4,House>我有你保我  说不定还有卡迪
<11-4,House>I've got you and maybe even Cuddy.

233
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,400
<11-5,Wilson>是啊  这就能摆平他了
<11-5,Wilson>Well, that settles it.

234
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,920
<11-5,Wilson>无情的企业狙击手先生[公司蓄意收购者]
<11-5,Wilson>Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider...

235
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,620
<11-5,Wilson>会被我们击溃  跑回家
<11-5,Wilson>will be totally stymied, go home,

236
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,500
<11-5,Wilson>蜷缩在地板上  淹没在泪海中
<11-5,Wilson>curl up on the floor of his shower and weep.

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,170
<11-6,House>他能怎么办  我是签了合同的
<11-6,House>What can he do? I got a contract.

238
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,020
<11-7,Wilson>你的合同写没写付多少薪水给你的团队
<11-7,Wilson>Does it say how much your team is paid,

239
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,650
<11-7,Wilson>你的停车位在哪里
<11-7,Wilson>where you parking space is,

240
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,700
<11-7,Wilson>你的车是不是该塞满马粪
<11-7,Wilson>if your car should be filled with horse manure?

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,090
<11-7,Wilson>沃格勒是个聪明人
<11-7,Wilson>Vogler's smart.

242
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,380
<11-7,Wilson>他肯定已经想好怎么对付你了
<11-7,Wilson>He's got some plan to get you.

243
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,560
<11-8,House>会对我用糖衣炮弹吗
<11-8,House>Does it involve candy?

244
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,370
<11-8,House>因为我对巧克力毫无免疫力
<11-8,House>'Cause I'm a sucker for chocolates.

245
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,300
<12-2,Rachel>-她好多了  -感谢上帝
<12-2,Rachel>- She's doing better. - Oh, thank God.

246
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,670
<12-3,House>准确来讲  要感谢亚历山大·弗莱明
<12-3,House>Technically, Alexander Fleming.

247
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,520
<12-3,House>他发明了抗生素
<12-3,House>He developed antibiotics.

248
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
<12-3,House>肺炎已经控制住了
<12-3,House>Pneumonia's under control.

249
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,440
<12-3,House>从现在起  给她吃人吃的东西  可以吗
<12-3,House>From now on, what say you go with human food, okay?

250
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,890
<12-4,Joel>-绝对  向上帝发誓  -这次你找对人了
<12-4,Joel>- Absolutely. Swear to God. - This time, that's your guy.

251
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,770
<12-6,Rachel>是瑞秋和乔·卡普兰吗
<12-6,Rachel>Rachel and Joel Kaplan?

252
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,110
<12-7,Officer>-是的  -你们被捕了
<12-7,Officer>- Yes? - You're under arrest.

253
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,500
<12-7,Officer>-你们有权保持沉默  -我们犯什么法了
<12-7,Officer>- You have the right to remain silent. - What did we do?

254
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,520
<12-8,Joel>你们被指控迫害儿童
<12-8,Joel>You're being charged with child endangerment.

255
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,630
<12-9,Rachel>什么  怎么回事
<12-9,Rachel>What? How?

256
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,090
<12-9,Rachel>让你们的孩子挨饿  我是社会福利部的
<12-9,Rachel>Starving your kid. I'm from Social Services.

257
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,990
<12-9,Rachel>现在起你们的孩子由我们照顾
<12-9,Rachel>We're taking responsibility for your baby.

258
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,550
<13-1,House>这就是沃格勒击垮我的手段吗
<13-1,House>This is how Vogler's gonna destroy me?

259
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,430
<13-2,Cuddy>他干什么了  给你的拐棍儿抹油
<13-2,Cuddy>What did he do? Grease your cane?

260
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,130
<13-3,House>他找人抓走了我的病人
<13-3,House>He had my patients arrested.

261
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,320
<13-3,House>错了  不是他  是我
<13-3,House>Uh, no. He didn't. I did.

262
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,660
<13-4,Cuddy>护士们为那孩子担心  给我打来了电话
<13-4,Cuddy>The nurses were concerned, and they called me.

263
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,370
<13-4,Cuddy>明明有虐待的迹象
<13-4,Cuddy>There was evidence of abuse.

264
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,350
<13-4,Cuddy>却不上报社会福利部  你这是在冒法律风险
<13-4,Cuddy>You took a big legal risk by not calling Social Services.

265
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,300
<13-5,House>那对父母又不是虐待狂  就是白痴了点
<13-5,House>Those parents are not abusive. They're idiots.

266
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
<13-6,Cuddy>哟  那还真是松了一口气
<13-6,Cuddy>Oh, well, that's certainly a relief.

267
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,770
<13-8,Cuddy>-这件事该由我作主  -你做错了
<13-8,Cuddy>- It was my call. - You made the wrong one.

268
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,580
<13-9,House>你知道吗  最近出了本"昆斯林新传"
<13-9,House>You know, there's a new biography of Quisling.

269
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,580
<13-9,House>Quisling[二战时挪威政治家  曾与纳粹合作
<13-9,House>卖国贼的代名词]

270
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,670
<13-9,House>我想你会喜欢的
<13-9,House>I think you might like it.

271
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,370
<13-10,Cuddy>当然  那是谁
<13-10,Cuddy>Sure. No idea who that is.

272
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,990
<13-11,House>是个挪威人  二战时期做了卖国贼
<13-11,House>Uh, Norwegian guy, World War II, traitor.

273
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,620
<13-11,House>跟你解释这个都灭了我的火
<13-11,House>The fact that I have to explain this takes the edge off my flow.

274
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,770
<13-12,Cuddy>我是在保护你
<13-12,Cuddy>I was protecting you.

275
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,380
<13-13,House>保护我什么  警察根本不会抓我
<13-13,House>From what? Cops aren't gonna bust me.

276
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,800
<13-13,House>纪律委员会顶多警告一下我
<13-13,House>Disciplinary Committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.

277
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,120
<13-14,Cuddy>于是沃格勒就有理由开了你
<13-14,Cuddy>And Vogler has an excuse to get rid of you.

278
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,010
<13-15,House>欲加之罪  何患无辞
<13-15,House>If I don't give him one, he makes one up.

279
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,970
<13-16,Cuddy>沃格勒一个人只有一票
<13-16,Cuddy>Vogler's just one vote.

280
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,190
<13-16,Cuddy>他要想办法说服其他11个董事
<13-16,Cuddy>He's gotta convince the other 11 of us.

281
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,280
<13-16,Cuddy>我只是在阻止你让这事变得超级简单
<13-16,Cuddy>I'm just trying to stop you from making that extra easy.

282
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,650
<13-16,Cuddy>[查尔斯医生  请回电4541]
<13-16,Cuddy>Dr. Charles, dial 4541.

283
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,240
<14-1,Foreman>肖恩  你妻子的眼睑看起来
<14-1,Foreman>Sean, do your wife's eyelids

284
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,880
<14-1,Foreman>跟平时有什么不一样吗
<14-1,Foreman>look any different than usual?

285
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,440
<14-2,Sean>好像一边有点下垂
<14-2,Sean>Uh, maybe one is drooping a little bit,

286
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,700
<14-2,Sean>但是  她很累了  所以说...
<14-2,Sean>but, you know, she's tired, so--

287
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,780
<14-3,Chase>内奥米  请你张开嘴
<14-3,Chase>Naomi, can you open your mouth for me and,

288
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,380
<14-3,Chase>头向后仰
<14-3,Chase>um, tilt your head back?

289
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,240
<14-3,Chase>这会有点不舒服
<14-3,Chase>This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.

290
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,190
<14-3,Chase>果然  有肿胀阻塞了食道
<14-3,Chase>Yeah. There's swelling, indenting the esophagus.

291
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,590
<14-4,Sean>所以她才会被噎住的吗
<14-4,Sean>Is that why she choked?

292
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,030
<14-5,Foreman>需要照个X光片
<14-5,Foreman>We'll need to do an X-ray.

293
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,040
<14-6,Naomi>什么  不行  我的孩子
<14-6,Naomi>What? No. The baby.

294
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,130
<14-6,Naomi>你说过我不能照X光
<14-6,Naomi>You said no X-rays.

295
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,200
<14-7,Foreman>必须得照
<14-7,Foreman>It's important.

296
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,060
<15-1,Wilson>她的右肺叶上部
<15-1,Wilson>She has a three-centimeter mass...

297
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,960
<15-1,Wilson>有一块三厘米大小的阴影
<15-1,Wilson>in her right upper lobe.

298
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,310
<15-2,Foreman>-可能是肉芽肿  -不是
<15-2,Foreman>- Maybe it's a granuloma. - No.

299
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,130
<15-3,House>没有钙化
<15-3,House>There's no calcification.

300
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,720
<15-3,House>是小细胞肺癌
<15-3,House>It's small-cell lung cancer.

301
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,240
<16-1,Wilson>肿瘤开始压迫你的食道了
<16-1,Wilson>The tumor's starting to press against your esophagus.

302
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,770
<16-1,Wilson>癌细胞还没有转移
<16-1,Wilson>It hasn't metastasized,

303
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,850
<16-1,Wilson>但是已经扩散到肺部其它地方
<16-1,Wilson>but it has spread to other parts of your lung,

304
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,280
<16-1,Wilson>所以我们没法手术
<16-1,Wilson>so we can't operate.

305
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,130
<16-2,Sean>等等  这讲不通啊
<16-2,Sean>Wait. That doesn't make sense.

306
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,940
<16-2,Sean>她之前  还有肾衰和脑部的问题
<16-2,Sean>She had, uh, kidney failure and brain problems.

307
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,820
<16-3,Wilson>一些癌症病人会出现
<16-3,Wilson>Some cancer patients get

308
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,450
<16-3,Wilson>叫作副肿瘤综合征的情况
<16-3,Wilson>what are called paraneoplastic syndromes.

309
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,550
<16-3,Wilson>你的体内产生抗体抗击癌细胞
<16-3,Wilson>You were making antibodies to fight the tumor.

310
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,930
<16-3,Wilson>但是它们转而攻击其它细胞
<16-3,Wilson>They got sidetracked and attacked other cells.

311
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,520
<16-3,Wilson>先是你的大脑  然后是肝  肾
<16-3,Wilson>Your brain first. Then your liver, kidneys.

312
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
<16-3,Wilson>甚至是控制你眼睑的神经
<16-3,Wilson>Even the nerves that control your eyelids.

313
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,980
<16-3,Wilson>这个叫兰伯特-伊顿综合征
<16-3,Wilson>That's called Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

314
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,180
<16-3,Wilson>我们由此想到肿瘤在肺里
<16-3,Wilson>It told us the tumor was in the lungs.

315
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,460
<16-4,Naomi>有多糟
<16-4,Naomi>How bad is it?

316
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,430
<16-5,Wilson>小细胞肺癌是肺癌中恶变最快的
<16-5,Wilson>Small-cell is the most aggressive kind of lung cancer.

317
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,150
<16-5,Wilson>五年存活率只有百分之十到十五
<16-5,Wilson>The five-year survival rate is only about 10% to 15%.

318
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,640
<16-5,Wilson>所以我们必须
<16-5,Wilson>Which is why we have to

319
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,680
<16-5,Wilson>马上对你进行化疗和放疗
<16-5,Wilson>start you on chemo and radiation right away.

320
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,520
<16-6,Naomi>放疗  我的孩子怎么办
<16-6,Naomi>Radiation? What about the baby?

321
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,790
<16-7,Wilson>开始治疗之前需要给你剖腹产
<16-7,Wilson>You'll need a C-section before you can start the treatment.

322
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,790
<16-7,Wilson>我可以为你安排明天一早做手术
<16-7,Wilson>I can get you in first thing tomorrow morning.

323
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,150
<16-8,Naomi>我孩子活下来的希望有多大
<16-8,Naomi>What are the chances my baby will survive?

324
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,850
<16-9,Wilson>很乐观
<16-9,Wilson>Pretty good.

325
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,810
<16-9,Wilson>现在二十八周了  应该有百分之八十
<16-9,Wilson>Twenty-eight weeks, so about 80%.

326
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,460
<16-10,Naomi>不  等等  也就是说有两成可能会死
<16-10,Naomi>No, wait. That's one-in-five chance he'll die?

327
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,740
<16-11,Wilson>我真的不建议你再等下去
<16-11,Wilson>I really wouldn't advise waiting.

328
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,840
<16-12,Sean>内奥米  你必须马上开始治疗
<16-12,Sean>Naomi, you gotta start this treatment right away

329
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,450
<16-13,Naomi>如果我再等等会怎么样
<16-13,Naomi>What happens if I wait?

330
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,430
<16-13,Naomi>二十九周
<16-13,Naomi>Well, 29 weeks,

331
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,720
<16-14,Wilson>存活率会接近百分之九十
<16-14,Wilson>the survival rate is closer to 90%.

332
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,200
<16-15,Naomi>-那我现在不做放疗  -可你会死的...
<16-15,Naomi>- I'm not doing the radiation. - But you'll die if--

333
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,610
<16-17,Naomi>听我说  你也看到了  我肯定活不成
<16-17,Naomi>Listen. You know the chances. They're nothing.

334
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,930
<16-17,Naomi>但是再多等几周就能保住孩子
<16-17,Naomi>But a few more weeks will save the baby.

335
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,780
<16-18,Sean>听着  你现在心里很难过
<16-18,Sean>Listen. You're depressed right now,

336
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,340
<16-18,Sean>头脑不够清醒  所以...
<16-18,Sean>and you're not thinking right, so--

337
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,970
<16-20,Sean>能不能请你  请你劝劝她吧
<16-20,Sean>Could you j-- Tell her, please.

338
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,780
<16-21,Wilson>这种癌症扩散非常快
<16-21,Wilson>This cancer moves quick.

339
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
<16-21,Wilson>到了中期你就只能活两到四个月了
<16-21,Wilson>The median survival's two to four months.

340
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,430
<16-21,Wilson>如果你推迟治疗  哪怕是一周...
<16-21,Wilson>If you postpone-- even for a week--

341
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,540
<16-22,Naomi>对不起  亲爱的
<16-22,Naomi>I'm sorry, honey.

342
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,960
<17-1,Vogler>众所周知
<17-1,Vogler>As most of you know,

343
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
<17-1,Vogler>格利高里·豪斯最近发表了一番关于我的言论
<17-1,Vogler>Gregory House recently gave a speech about me.

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,410
<17-1,Vogler>本着礼尚往来的精神
<17-1,Vogler>I'd like to return the favor.

345
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,300
<17-2,Wilson>-抱歉  -威尔森医生
<17-2,Wilson>- Sorry. - Dr. Wilson.

346
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,650
<17-3,Vogler>我是希望你会错过这次会议
<17-3,Vogler>I was hoping you were gonna miss this one.

347
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,350
<17-3,Vogler>一个人行为体现其人格
<17-3,Vogler>A man is the sum of his actions.

348
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,030
<17-3,Vogler>下面是豪斯医生的若干行为
<17-3,Vogler>Here are a few of Dr. House's.

349
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,380
<17-3,Vogler>他曾违反放弃抢救协议
<17-3,Vogler>He violated a D.N.R.

350
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,450
<17-3,Vogler>并被指控伤害他人
<17-3,Vogler>and was charged with assault.

351
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,110
<17-3,Vogler>他把白蚁带进了手术室
<17-3,Vogler>He brought a termite into the O.R.

352
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,000
<17-3,Vogler>与外科医生发生争吵
<17-3,Vogler>and spat on a surgeon.

353
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,070
<17-3,Vogler>他接受了病人送的名车
<17-3,Vogler>He accepted a Corvette from a patient

354
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,480
<17-3,Vogler>而此人已知是新泽西州黑手党成员
<17-3,Vogler>who was a known member of the New Jersey Mafia.

355
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,850
<17-4,Vogler>-爱德  我说...  -是爱德华
<17-4,Vogler>- Ed, look-- - Edward.

356
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,300
<17-4,Vogler>爱德华
<17-4,Vogler>Edward.

357
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,300
<17-4,Vogler>如果你探查任意一个人的职业生涯
<17-4,Vogler>You look at anyone's career,

358
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,370
<17-5,Vogler>你都能发现一些事情是...
<17-5,Vogler>you can find things that are--

359
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,190
<17-5,Vogler>这些只是他前三个月的罪状
<17-5,Vogler>These are the last three months.

360
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,270
<17-5,Vogler>他个人所遭到的投诉
<17-5,Vogler>He's personally had more complaints

361
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,960
<17-5,Vogler>比这家医院任何一个部门都要多
<17-5,Vogler>filed against him than any department in this hospital.

362
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,180
<17-6,Wilson>没错  他这人是一团糟  是惹人生厌
<17-6,Wilson>Okay. He's screwed-up. He's miserable.

363
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,000
<17-6,Wilson>也许他应该去重新读读职业道德规范
<17-6,Wilson>And he should probably reread the ethics code,

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
<17-6,Wilson>但这就是他的方式  他救了几百条人命
<17-6,Wilson>but it works for him. He's saved hundreds of lives.

365
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,660
<17-7,Vogler>他嗜药成瘾  不仅以此为荣
<17-7,Vogler>He is a drug addict who flaunts his addiction

366
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,940
<17-7,Vogler>还拒绝治疗
<17-7,Vogler>and refuses to get treatment.

367
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,770
<17-7,Vogler>他是本院的耻辱  令我们蒙羞
<17-7,Vogler>He is a disgrace and an embarrassment to this hospital.

368
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,660
<17-7,Vogler>我本可继续  但这么讲下去有失身份  所以
<17-7,Vogler>I'd go on, but it gets kind of mean, so--

369
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,580
<17-7,Vogler>我简单说
<17-7,Vogler>I'm gonna keep this simple.

370
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,280
<17-7,Vogler>豪斯走还是我走
<17-7,Vogler>House goes or I go.

371
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,780
<17-8,Cuddy>不要公私不分
<17-8,Cuddy>You shouldn't personalize this.

372
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,400
<17-9,Vogler>我说的"我"  是指我的亿万美金
<17-9,Vogler>And by "I", I mean my hundred million dollars.

373
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,600
<17-9,Vogler>这叫公私不分吗
<17-9,Vogler>How's that for personalizing?

374
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,200
<17-10,Cuddy>你给我们钱是有所为的
<17-10,Cuddy>You gave us that money for a reason.

375
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,370
<17-10,Cuddy>你真的愿意因为一个医生
<17-10,Cuddy>Are you really willing to throw it all away

376
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,700
<17-10,Cuddy>而放弃你的初衷吗
<17-10,Cuddy>because of one doctor?

377
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,990
<17-11,Vogler>豪斯是医疗保健业的一个反面教材
<17-11,Vogler>Gregory House is a symboy of everything wrong with the health care industry.

378
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,740
<17-11,Vogler>浪费  不服从上级
<17-11,Vogler>Waste. Insubordination.

379
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,110
<17-11,Vogler>医生们个个趾高气昂  自以为王
<17-11,Vogler>Doctors preening like they're kings,

380
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,500
<17-11,Vogler>医院俨然成了他们的私人封地
<17-11,Vogler>and the hospital is their own private fiefdom.

381
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,480
<17-11,Vogler>医疗保健业是一桩生意
<17-11,Vogler>Health care is a business.

382
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,990
<17-11,Vogler>我要把它经营得像个样子
<17-11,Vogler>I'm gonna run it like one.

383
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,270
<17-11,Vogler>现在我提议将格利高里·豪斯医生撤职
<17-11,Vogler>I here by move to revoke the tenure of Dr. Gregory House...

384
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,910
<17-11,Vogler>并终止其与本院的雇佣关系
<17-11,Vogler>and terminate his employment at this hospital,

385
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,780
<17-11,Vogler>即刻生效
<17-11,Vogler>effective immediately.

386
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,540
<17-12,Female Doctor>我们是不是应该先讨论一下
<17-12,Female Doctor>Don't you think we should discuss this?

387
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,610
<17-13,Vogler>我们刚刚讨论过了
<17-13,Vogler>We just did.

388
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,280
<17-14,Cuddy>我们需要时间...
<17-14,Cuddy>We need time--

389
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,380
<17-15,Vogler>现在公开表决  是否都赞成
<17-15,Vogler>The vote is on the table. All in favor?

390
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,610
<17-15,Vogler>-威尔森医生  -反对
<17-15,Vogler>- Dr. Wilson. - Opposed.

391
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,810
<17-17,Vogler>提案未通过
<17-17,Vogler>The motion is defeated.

392
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,290
<17-17,Vogler>威尔森医生  请你离开会议室  好吗
<17-17,Vogler>Dr. Wilson, would you mind leaving the room, please?

393
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,620
<17-19,Vogler>-你说什么  -我们要进行另一项表决
<17-19,Vogler>- Excuse me? - We're going to take another vote.

394
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,030
<17-20,Wilson>首先  你不能通过驱赶我出去
<17-20,Wilson>Well, first of all, you can't void my vote

395
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,970
<17-20,Wilson>来剥夺我投票的权利
<17-20,Wilson>by making me stand in the hallway.

396
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,400
<17-20,Wilson>其次  你应该查一查议事程序
<17-20,Wilson>And second, you should check the by laws.

397
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
<17-20,Wilson>你需要先发通知  然后至少一个工作日之后
<17-20,Wilson>You need notice and at least one business day

398
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,950
<17-20,Wilson>才能重新考虑同一项提议
<17-20,Wilson>before you can reconsider any matter.

399
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,220
<17-21,Vogler>我们将要表决的是不同的提议
<17-21,Vogler>We're voting on a different matter,

400
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,090
<17-21,Vogler>你有利益冲突  需要回避
<17-21,Vogler>which you are conflicted out of.

401
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,930
<17-22,Wilson>我怎么会有利益冲突
<17-22,Wilson>How can I be conflicted?

402
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,020
<17-23,Vogler>投票将决定是否开除詹姆斯·威尔森医生
<17-23,Vogler>This vote is whether to dismiss Dr. James Wilson.

403
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,570
<18-1,Chase>内奥米拒绝剖腹产
<18-1,Chase>Naomi is refusing to have the C-section.

404
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,860
<18-1,Chase>她活命的机率不容乐观
<18-1,Chase>Her odds aren't good enough.

405
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,480
<18-2,House>这夫妻两真没用  威尔森在哪儿
<18-2,House>They do suck. Where's Wilson?

406
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,250
<18-3,Foreman>呼他两次了
<18-3,Foreman>Paged him twice.

407
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,250
<18-4,Chase>她知道自己活不成  还要这么做
<18-4,Chase>She does this, she knows she's gonna die.

408
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,760
<18-5,Foreman>她是想救她的孩子
<18-5,Foreman>She's saving her child.

409
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,470
<18-5,Foreman>卡梅隆在的话会告诉你们
<18-5,Foreman>Cameron would point out

410
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,490
<18-5,Foreman>人类多么有牺牲精神
<18-5,Foreman>that people are capable of sacrifice.

411
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,360
<18-6,House>卡梅隆可不在这儿
<18-6,House>Cameron isn't here.

412
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,160
<18-7,Foreman>刚好证明了她的观点
<18-7,Foreman>Perhaps proving her point.

413
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,530
<18-8,House>你觉得这女人的决定理智吗
<18-8,House>You think this woman is making a rational decision?

414
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,450
<18-9,Foreman>我相信人可以战胜自己的本能
<18-9,Foreman>I think people can overcome their baser drives.

415
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,450
<18-10,House>这种人稀罕的可怜
<18-10,House>Pretty damn rarely.

416
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,330
<18-10,House>而且这次不是  这是纯生物性的
<18-10,House>And not this time. This is purely biological.

417
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,450
<18-10,House>从进化的角度看
<18-10,House>In evolutionary terms,

418
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,670
<18-10,House>生下一代比较重要
<18-10,House>the needs of the next generation are more important.

419
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,660
<18-11,Chase>你觉得她做了正确的决定
<18-11,Chase>You're saying she's making the right call?

420
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,480
<18-12,House>达尔文觉得  我不
<18-12,House>Darwin is. I'm not.

421
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,870
<18-12,House>下一代不关我的事
<18-12,House>The next generation is not my patient.

422
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,420
<18-12,House>我们要提高妈妈的生存几率
<18-12,House>We have to raise the odds for Mommy.

423
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,740
<18-12,House>威尔森跑哪去了  他可是肿瘤专家
<18-12,House>Where the hell is Wilson? He's the oncologist.

424
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,480
<18-13,Foreman>好主意  治愈癌症
<18-13,Foreman>Good plan. Cure cancer.

425
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,640
<18-13,Foreman>我真奇怪怎么以前没人想到
<18-13,Foreman>I'm surprised no one ever thought of that before.

426
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,550
<19-1,Rachel>他在那儿
<19-1,Rachel>There he is.

427
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,310
<19-1,Rachel>豪斯医生
<19-1,Rachel>Dr. House.

428
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,810
<19-2,House>-你们越狱了吗  -保释了
<19-2,House>- You guys bust out? - We made bail.

429
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,460
<19-3,Joel>他们不让我们见宝宝
<19-3,Joel>They won't let us in our baby's room.

430
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,790
<19-4,House>不可思议啊
<19-4,House>Weird.

431
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,560
<19-4,House>他们正琢磨着你俩是不是想杀了孩子
<19-4,House>You think they'd let you take her home

432
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,630
<19-4,House>你说人家还会让你们带她回家吗
<19-4,House>while they figured out if you tried to kill her.

433
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,630
<19-5,Joel>我们是合格的父母  她一饿我们就喂她
<19-5,Joel>We're good parents. We fed her whenever she was hungry.

434
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,930
<19-6,Rachel>大餐  我们不知道那食谱那么糟糕
<19-6,Rachel>Big meals. We had no idea that diet was so bad.

435
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,940
<19-7,Joel>营养专家说那里面有她需要的所有东西
<19-7,Joel>The nutritionist said it had everything she needed.

436
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,370
<19-8,House>听着  在你所谓的健康食品店里
<19-8,House>Listen. The kid who stacks the free-range grapefruit in

437
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,340
<19-8,House>摆放有机柚子的小子可不是营养专家
<19-8,House>your health food store is not a nutritionist.

438
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,890
<19-9,Rachel>可我叔叔真的是
<19-9,Rachel>But my uncle is.

439
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,870
<19-9,Rachel>他大学学的就是这个
<19-9,Rachel>He went to college and everything.

442
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,240
<19-12,House>没开玩笑
<19-12,House>Seriously?

443
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,790
<19-11,Joel>奥利弗·卡普兰
<19-11,Joel>Olive Kaplan.

444
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,330
<19-12,House>检查有没有脓肿或是隐性感染  对
<19-12,House>Look for abscesses or occult infections. Yeah.

445
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,970
<19-12,House>拜拜
<19-12,House>Bye-bye.

446
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,080
<20-1,House>找你有事  沃格勒对临床试验一头的劲
<20-1,House>Listen. Vogler's all about clinical trials.

<20-1,House>医院快被他的试验噎死了
<20-1,House>The hospital's chock full of them.

448
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,440
<20-1,House>其中肯定有什么是关小细胞肺癌的
<20-1,House>There's gotta be something for small-cell lung cancer.

449
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,580
<20-1,House>你做什么
<20-1,House>What are you doing?

450
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,480
<20-2,Wilson>我被解雇了
<20-2,Wilson>I got sacked.

451
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,180
<20-3,House>你和卡迪调情了吗
<20-3,House>Did you make a pass at Cuddy?

452
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,790
<20-3,House>不是告诉过你吗  她只对我有性趣
<20-3,House>I told you. She only has thighs for me.

453
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,450
<20-4,Wilson>我投票留下你
<20-4,Wilson>I voted to keep you.

454
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,740
<20-5,House>所以他是在除掉每个想我留下的
<20-5,House>So he's getting rid of every board member

455
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,320
<20-5,House>董事会成员
<20-5,House>who votes to keep me around.

456
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,380
<20-6,Wilson>是啊  每一个
<20-6,Wilson>Yeah. Every one of us.

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,240
<20-7,House>-只有你一个  -对
<20-7,House>- Just you? - Yep.

458
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,200
<20-8,Wilson>你只是离开董事会  对吧
<20-8,Wilson>But you're only off the board, right?

459
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,020
<20-9,House>他们不可能一致通过开除你
<20-9,House>They couldn't have gotten unanimous approval for you.

460
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,000
<20-10,Wilson>肿瘤科的布朗投了反对票  卡迪也是
<20-10,Wilson>Brown from oncology voted no. So did Cuddy,

461
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,470
<20-10,Wilson>加上泰勒和百威
<20-10,Wilson>Taylor and Peavey.

462
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,580
<20-11,House>恩  这么看你只是离开董事会
<20-11,House>Oh, so you're off the board.

463
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,760
<20-11,House>有什么呀
<20-11,House>Big deal.

464
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,510
<20-11,House>星期三晚上解放了可以打保龄
<20-11,House>Frees up Wednesday nights for bowling.

465
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,470
<20-11,House>你还是个医生嘛
<20-11,House>You're still a doctor.

466
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,490
<20-12,Wilson>是啊  被开除太棒了都能上名人录了
<20-12,Wilson>Yeah. Getting dumped looks great in Who's Who.

467
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,880
<20-12,Wilson>沃格勒让我主动辞职
<20-12,Wilson>Vogler gave me the option of resigning.

468
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,100
<20-12,Wilson>我接受了
<20-12,Wilson>And I took it.

469
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,450
<20-13,House>-他可真够大方  -我没有孩子
<20-13,House>- Big of him. - I got no kids.

470
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,650
<20-14,Wilson>我的婚姻就是个悲剧
<20-14,Wilson>My marriages sucks.

471
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,470
<20-14,Wilson>我仅有的两样有意义的东西
<20-14,Wilson>I only had two things that worked for me.

472
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,630
<20-14,Wilson>就是这个工作和这份该死的友谊
<20-14,Wilson>This job and this stupid screwed-up friendship,

473
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,790
<20-14,Wilson>结果这两样你都满不在乎
<20-14,Wilson>and neither mattered enough to you

474
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,410
<20-14,Wilson>让你做一次无聊的演讲都不行
<20-14,Wilson>to give one lousy speech.

475
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,630
<20-14,Wilson>我在乎
<20-14,Wilson>They matter.

476
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,700
<20-15,House>-如果能重来...  -你还会这么做
<20-15,House>- If I could do it all again - You'd do the same thing.

477
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,270
<20-16,Wilson>算了...你也快要走了
<20-16,Wilson>Well, you'll be gone soon too.

478
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,800
<20-17,House>那临床试验的事
<20-17,House>Those clinical trials?

479
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,700
<20-18,Wilson>我会打电话问问
<20-18,Wilson>I'll make some calls.

480
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,090
<20-19,House>谢谢
<20-19,House>Thanks.

481
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,720
<21-1,Cuddy>这  这不是癌症
<21-1,Cuddy>It's-- It's not cancer.

482
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,850
<21-2,Patient>不会要我命吗
<21-2,Patient>It's not gonna kill me?

483
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,090
<21-3,Cuddy>只是痔疮
<21-3,Cuddy>It's hemorrhoids.

484
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,980
<21-4,Patient>可那么多血  我觉得肯定不正常
<21-4,Patient>But all that blood-- I mean, that can't be right.

485
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,380
<21-5,Cuddy>看起来严重而已
<21-5,Cuddy>Looks worse than it is.

486
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,100
<21-6,House>-谢谢你保护我  -能等会吗
<21-6,House>- Nice job of protecting me. - Can this wait?

487
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,130
<21-7,Cuddy>他的屁股可以等
<21-7,Cuddy>His ass can wait.

488
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,190
<21-8,House>你为了保住我开除威尔森
<21-8,House>You save my job by sacking Wilson?

489
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,140
<21-9,Cuddy>一开口就乱嚷嚷
<21-9,Cuddy>What did you think would happen

490
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,570
<21-9,Cuddy>当时你脑子里在想什么
<21-9,Cuddy>when you made that speech?

491
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,020
<21-9,Cuddy>以为随便发顿脾气
<21-9,Cuddy>That you would just pout for a little while

492
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,480
<21-9,Cuddy>我们都会原谅你的吗
<21-9,Cuddy>and we'd all forgive you?

493
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,330
<21-9,Cuddy>他是出钱的老板  哪个像你这样招惹他
<21-9,Cuddy>You don't spit on the man that signs your paycheck.

494
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,960
<21-9,Cuddy>首先是卡梅隆  接着是威尔森
<21-9,Cuddy>First Cameron, then Wilson.

495
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,210
<21-9,Cuddy>下一个就是你  穿上你的裤子
<21-9,Cuddy>You're next. Pull your pants up.

496
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,510
<21-10,House>难道都是因为钱
<21-10,House>So it's about the money.

497
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,850
<21-10,House>当然是因为钱
<21-10,House>Of course it's about the money.

498
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,320
<21-11,Cuddy>沃格勒出的钱
<21-11,Cuddy>The money Vogler gave,

499
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
<21-11,Cuddy>他本可以拿去买几架喷气飞机
<21-11,Cuddy>he could have bought a few jets,

500
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,390
<21-11,Cuddy>或者一支棒球队
<21-11,Cuddy>maybe a baseball team.

501
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,880
<21-11,Cuddy>或者存进大通银行坐收利息
<21-11,Cuddy>Or just stuck it in Chase Manhattan and collected interest.

502
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,870
<21-11,Cuddy>但他选择给我们买仪器  做试验
<21-11,Cuddy>But he gave it to us to buy equipment, to do research.

503
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,950
<21-11,Cuddy>你是个好医生
<21-11,Cuddy>You are a great doctor, House,

504
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,220
<21-11,Cuddy>可你不值一亿美金
<21-11,Cuddy>but you are not worth a hundred million dollars.

505
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,520
<22-1,House>我们做了肿瘤细胞DNA测序
<22-1,House>We've sequenced the D.N.A. Of the tumor cells.

506
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,100
<22-1,House>P53基因的第55位密码子发生突变
<22-1,House>P53 gene mutation at codon 55.

507
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,610
<22-1,House>她的情况完全符合你的实验条件
<22-1,House>She's perfect for your trial.

508
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,380
<22-2,Prather>有难度  她的癌症已经很晚期了
<22-2,Prather>Hmm. She's pretty far advanced.

509
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,900
<22-3,House>你想要简单的话  你选错行了
<22-3,House>Well, you want easy cases, you picked the wrong specialty.

510
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,430
<22-4,Prather>-病人其它身体条件好吗  -相当不错
<22-4,Prather>- Otherwise in good health? - Excellent.

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,860
<22-7,House>-她什么时候能开始  -下周三或周四
<22-7,House>- When can she start? - Middle of next week.

512
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,350
<22-8,Prather>癌细胞已经在第三期了
<22-8,Prather>Cancer's already stage III.

513
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,580
<22-9,House>-快没时间了  -两天之后开始
<22-9,House>- It'd be a waste of time. - She can start in two days.

514
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,110
<23-1,Foreman>她两天之后不能参与试验  她怀孕了
<23-1,Foreman>She can't start in two days. She's pregnant.

515
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,800
<23-2,House>过两天她就不怀孕了
<23-2,House>She won't be in two days.

516
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,590
<23-2,House>我预约了剖腹产
<23-2,House>I've scheduled a C-section.

517
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,240
<23-3,Chase>那她也要再等一个月
<23-3,Chase>She'd still have to wait a month.

518
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,610
<23-3,Chase>大手术后三十天内
<23-3,Chase>You can't take part in any trial

519
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,840
<23-3,Chase>不能参与任何临床试验
<23-3,Chase>for at least 30 days after major surgery.

520
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,140
<23-4,House>好吧  那绝对是个手术  不过大小嘛
<23-4,House>Well, it's definitely surgery, but major?

521
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,120
<23-5,Foreman>-这不是你说了算的  -还是
<23-5,Foreman>- It's not your call. - Again,

522
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,640
<23-6,House>理解不同而已
<23-6,House>question of interpretation.

523
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,870
<23-7,Chase>你现在开始欺骗医生了
<23-7,Chase>You're scamming a doctor? Now?

524
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,210
<23-7,Chase>拜托  沃格勒正在四处寻找解雇你的借口
<23-7,Chase>Come on. Vogler's looking for any excuse to can you.

525
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,180
<23-8,House>噢  估计他已经找到一大袋了
<23-8,House>Oh, I think he's got a big bag of those already.

526
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,470
<23-9,Foreman>规例不是要和你作对才定的
<23-9,Foreman>These regulations aren't just here to annoy you.

527
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,880
<23-9,Foreman>你那么做对病人有危险
<23-9,Foreman>Doing this is dangerous to the patient.

528
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,130
<23-10,House>放心  我一定会告诉她的
<23-10,House>Well, I'll be sure and let her know that.

529
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,000
<23-10,House>跟我一起来吗
<23-10,House>Care to join me?

530
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,420
<24-1,House>血管生成抑制剂
<24-1,House>Angiogenesis inhibitors

531
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,300
<24-1,House>可以阻止肿瘤生成新的血管
<24-1,House>prevent the tumors from creating blood vessels.

532
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,350
<24-1,House>没有血液供应  肿瘤会饿死
<24-1,House>Without blood, the tumor starves.

533
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,460
<24-2,Sean>-听起来不错  -孩子呢
<24-2,Sean>- That sounds great.- What about the baby?

534
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,720
<24-4,House>这种治疗对孩子是致命的
<24-4,House>The treatment would be fatal to the baby.

535
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,280
<24-4,House>我给你预约了今天下午的剖腹产
<24-4,House>I've scheduled a C-section for this afternoon.

536
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,350
<24-4,House>不要
<24-4,House>No.

537
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,780
<24-4,House>这种方法目前还在试验阶段
<24-4,House>It's in the trial phase right now,

538
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,660
<24-4,House>不过迄今在超过30%的癌症患者得到缓解
<24-4,House>but so far complete remission in more than 30% of subjects.

539
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,810
<24-5,Naomi>我告诉过福曼医生我不做剖腹产
<24-5,Naomi>I told Dr. Foreman I didn't want a C-section.

540
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,130
<24-6,House>到时你活下来的几率
<24-6,House>When your chances of living

541
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,990
<24-6,House>会不到现在的三分之一
<24-6,House>were less than a third of what they are now.

542
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,140
<24-7,Naomi>如果孩子早产  那么
<24-7,Naomi>Well, if the baby's premature, then

543
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,380
<24-8,House>我们医院儿科
<24-8,House>Our Pediatrics Department

544
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,380
<24-8,House>有本州最先进的新生儿加护病房
<24-8,House>has the best neonatal I.C.U. in the state.

545
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,660
<24-9,Naomi>不  他的肺  他的大脑  他没准备好
<24-9,Naomi>No. His lungs. His brain. He's not ready.

546
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,490
<24-10,Sean>但他会没事的
<24-10,Sean>And he could be fine.

547
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,010
<24-11,Naomi>你不懂抚养一个生病的孩子的艰辛
<24-11,Naomi>You don't know what it's like raising a sick child.

548
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,410
<24-12,Sean>孩子的存活几率比你的大多了
<24-12,Sean>His odds are much better than yours are.

549
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,190
<24-12,Sean>起码让他们试试看
<24-12,Sean>You have to let them at least try this.

550
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,590
<24-12,Sean>-劝劝她  -好的
<24-12,Sean>- Talk to her. - Okay.

551
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,320
<24-12,Sean>离开房间
<24-12,Sean>Leave the room.

552
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,400
<24-13,House>好的
<24-13,House>Okay.

553
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,940
<24-13,House>你服用奥昔布宁多久了
<24-13,House>How long have you been taking oxybutynin?

554
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,420
<24-14,Naomi>大概从20岁开始
<24-14,Naomi>Uh, since I was about 20.

555
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,300
<24-15,House>你这个年纪的女性小便失禁很少见
<24-15,House>Incontinence is pretty uncommon in a woman of your age.

556
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,940
<24-15,House>20岁小便失禁就更神奇了
<24-15,House>It's even more bizarre in a woman in her 20s.

557
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,490
<24-16,Naomi>我想在健康方面
<24-16,Naomi>I guess I haven't had the best luck

558
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,810
<24-16,Naomi>我总能中头彩
<24-16,Naomi>when it comes to my health.

559
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,600
<24-17,House>看来是的
<24-17,House>Seems that way.

560
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,970
<24-17,House>你刚才对你丈夫说
<24-17,House>You said to your husband,

561
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,510
<24-17,House>"你不懂抚养一个生病的孩子的艰辛"
<24-17,House>"You don't know what it's like raising a sick child".

562
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,030
<24-17,House>而不是  "你不懂得会是怎样的"
<24-17,House>You didn't say, "You don't know what it would be like".

563
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,530
<24-17,House>这不是你的第一个孩子  对吧
<24-17,House>This is not your first child, is it?

564
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,840
<24-17,House>而他不知情
<24-17,House>And he doesn't know.

565
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,730
<24-18,Naomi>那时我18岁
<24-18,Naomi>I was 18.

566
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,620
<24-18,Naomi>我怀孕了  结婚了
<24-18,Naomi>I got pregnant, got married.

567
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,700
<24-18,Naomi>我有了世上最美丽的小女孩  格蕾丝
<24-18,Naomi>I had the most beautiful little girl. Grace.

568
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,550
<24-18,Naomi>她得了婴儿型亚历山大病
<24-18,Naomi>She had infantile Alexander's disease.

569
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,730
<24-19,House>很抱歉
<24-19,House>I'm sorry.

570
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,750
<24-20,Naomi>两年里我们看着她慢慢死去
<24-20,Naomi>Two years we watched her die.

571
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,400
<24-20,Naomi>我丈夫...我前夫是个
<24-20,Naomi>My husband was a-- Uh, my first husband was a--

572
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,380
<24-20,Naomi>很好的男人
<24-20,Naomi>a great guy,

573
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,040
<24-20,Naomi>但那之后我甚至没法面对他
<24-20,Naomi>but after that I couldn't even look at him

574
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,460
<24-20,Naomi>一看他我就想起女儿
<24-20,Naomi>without thinking of her.

575
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,010
<24-20,Naomi>我离开了他
<24-20,Naomi>I left him.

576
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,620
<24-20,Naomi>离开了我的工作  离开了一切
<24-20,Naomi>I left my job. I left everything.

577
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,960
<24-21,House>很感人的故事
<24-21,House>Very moving story.

578
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,730
<24-21,House>难怪你这么自私
<24-21,House>Explains why you're being so selfish.

579
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,110
<24-22,Naomi>我愿意为我丈夫去死
<24-22,Naomi>I'm willing to die to protect my husband.

580
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,780
<24-23,House>因为那是你想要的
<24-23,House>Because it's what you want.

581
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,800
<24-23,House>你的丈夫想要的是你活下去
<24-23,House>Your husband wants you to live.

582
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,930
<24-24,Naomi>当然  他不理解
<24-24,Naomi>Well, he doesn't understand

583
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,940
<24-25,House>谁能理解
<24-25,House>Oh, who the hell does?

584
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,270
<24-25,House>悲剧总在上演
<24-25,House>Tragedies happen.

585
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,280
<24-25,House>如果你觉得接下来几周里
<24-25,House>If you think that turning yourself

586
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,700
<24-25,House>把自己变成个一次性育儿器
<24-25,House>into a disposable incubator for a few weeks

587
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,660
<24-25,House>就能保护你的宝宝
<24-25,House>is gonna protect your baby

588
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,870
<24-25,House>远离这个世界的烦恼
<24-25,House>from all the crap in this world,

<24-25,House>go ahead. Die happy.

590
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,780
<24-25,House>我才不管自己找死的人
<24-25,House>I got no problem with people killing themselves.

591
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,490
<24-25,House>但别觉得那么做你会是个英雄
<24-25,House>But don't think it makes you a hero.

592
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,640
<24-26,Naomi>好吧
<24-26,Naomi>Okay.

593
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,210
<24-27,House>你今天下午4点剖腹产
<24-27,House>You're scheduled for 4:00 p.M.

594
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,930
<25-1,Lim>是  我是林医生
<25-1,Lim>Yes. This is Dr. Lim.

595
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,010
<25-2,Anesthesiologist>从10开始倒数
<25-2,Anesthesiologist>Count down from 10.

596
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,960
<25-2,Anesthesiologist>好的
<25-2,Anesthesiologist>Okay.

597
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,500
<25-3,Naomi>十
<25-3,Naomi>Ten,

598
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,480
<25-3,Naomi>九
<25-3,Naomi>nine,

599
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,210
<25-3,Naomi>八...
<25-3,Naomi>eight

600
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,860
<25-3,Naomi>托盘准备好了
<25-3,Naomi>Tray setup.

601
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,010
<25-4,Sean>好像有点快  她还好吧
<25-4,Sean>That seemed kind of fast. Is she all right?

602
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,150
<25-5,Anesthesiologist>她很好
<25-5,Anesthesiologist>She's fine.

603
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,140
<25-6,Lim>叫醒她  沃格勒的电话  手术取消
<25-6,Lim>Wake her up. That was Vogler. Surgery is off.

604
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,720
<26-1,House>嘿  你会害死她
<26-1,House>Hey! You're killing her!

605
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,300
<26-2,Vogler>是吗  手术后才五分钟
<26-2,Vogler>Really? I thought you were the one trying

606
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,660
<26-2,Vogler>就给她做药物实验  是你想要她的命吧
<26-2,Vogler>to ram her into a drug trial five minutes after surgery.

607
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,130
<26-3,House>她知道危险性  她是完全知情的
<26-3,House>She knows the risk. She was fully informed.

608
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,800
<26-4,Vogler>但做实验的人肯定不知情
<26-4,Vogler>Well, the guy running the study sure wasn't.

609
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,210
<26-5,House>不是他的命  不由他做主
<26-5,House>Not his life. Not his call.

610
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,860
<26-6,Vogler>-他的实验  他做主  -是啊
<26-6,Vogler>- His study, his call. - Right.

611
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,530
<26-7,House>她若死了  实验数据就不好
<26-7,House>So she kicks off, his numbers look bad.

612
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,630
<26-8,Vogler>数据不好  实验就效果就差
<26-8,Vogler>The numbers look bad, the study looks bad.

613
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,580
<26-9,House>还要费你很多钱是吗
<26-9,House>Which would cost you money!

614
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,010
<26-10,Vogler>还妨碍了一个救生办法的问世
<26-10,Vogler>And keep a lifesaving protocol off the market.

615
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,720
<26-11,House>一条命  只是数据上的一个点
<26-11,House>One person! One blip in the data!

616
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,240
<26-12,Vogler>知道食品药物管理局吗  他们就盯着坏点
<26-12,Vogler>Ever heard of the F.D.A.? They eat blips for breakfast.

617
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,020
<26-12,Vogler>不能因一个人而害了千万条命
<26-12,Vogler>One person should never endanger thousands.

618
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,440
<26-13,House>多谢你这个救世主来挽救众生
<26-13,House>Well, thank God you were here to save all those lives!

619
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,360
<26-14,Vogler>今晚将再开董事会
<26-14,Vogler>The board's meeting again this evening.

620
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,860
<26-14,Vogler>你为何不舒服的坐着  玩玩掌上游戏
<26-14,Vogler>Why don't you settle down, play some Game Boy?

621
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,250
<26-14,Vogler>再看看肥皂剧
<26-14,Vogler>Why don't you watch your soap?

622
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,270
<26-14,Vogler>听说这集今天要炒掉那个帅哥医生
<26-14,Vogler>I hear they're firing the handsome doctor today.

623
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,880
<26-14,Vogler>兄弟  那可是场好戏
<26-14,Vogler>Boy, that should be a good one.

624
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,640
<27-1,Sean>不论如何  若做了剖腹产
<27-1,Sean>If we had the C-section anyway,

625
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,080
<27-1,Sean>她还是可以进行实验性治疗  对吧
<27-1,Sean>she could still do the experimental treatment, right?

626
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,380
<27-1,Sean>-我们只需等一个月  -假若
<27-1,Sean>- We'd just have to wait 30 days. - Assuming

627
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,810
<27-2,Chase>负责实验的医生没有愤怒到拒绝接收她
<27-2,Chase>the doctor running the trial isn't too pissed off to let her in.

628
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,270
<27-3,Naomi>还得我撑得住才行
<27-3,Naomi>And assuming I'm even healthy enough to--

629
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,950
<27-3,Naomi>亲爱的
<27-3,Naomi>Honey.

630
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,920
<27-4,Sean>你还好吧
<27-4,Sean>Are you okay?

631
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,390
<27-5,Chase>血氧下降到80  挺住  内奥米
<27-5,Chase>Sats are dropping down to the 80s. Stay with us, Naomi.

632
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,640
<27-7,Chase>-怎么回事  -请你离开病房
<27-7,Chase>- What's going on? - We need you to leave the room.

633
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,480
<27-8,Foreman>呼吸窘迫
<27-8,Foreman>Respiratory distress.

634
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,970
<27-9,Sean>能告诉我怎么回事吗
<27-9,Sean>Could you tell me what's going on?

635
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,200
<27-10,Chase>我们正在努力查找
<27-10,Chase>We're trying to find out.

636
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,430
<27-11,Foreman>-这里  -还在跳动
<27-11,Foreman>- Here.  - Still kicking.

637
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,920
<27-12,Chase>急性肺水肿
<27-12,Chase>Flash pulmonary edema?

638
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,290
<27-13,Foreman>肺野透亮  找到了
<27-13,Foreman>Lungs are clear. Here it is.

639
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,210
<27-15,Foreman>-肺水肿  -得马上送手术室
<27-15,Foreman>- Pulmonary embolus. - Gotta get her to an O.R.

640
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,340
<28-1,Sean>-立刻  赶紧  -发生什么事了
<28-1,Sean>- Now. Right away.  - Uh, what happened?

641
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,300
<28-2,Foreman>是血栓
<28-2,Foreman>It's an embolism-a blood clot.

642
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,460
<28-2,Foreman>肺癌常见症
<28-2,Foreman>Fairly common with lung cancer.

643
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,920
<28-2,Foreman>不是完全性癌栓堵塞
<28-2,Foreman>It's not a full saddle embolism.

644
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,470
<28-2,Foreman>血液还能流通
<28-2,Foreman>So blood's still trickling through.

645
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,260
<28-2,Foreman>我们已经让她有了点呼吸
<28-2,Foreman>We've been able to get Naomi breathing a little,

646
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,530
<28-2,Foreman>但还得除掉血栓
<28-2,Foreman>but we need to remove the clot,

647
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,860
<28-2,Foreman>需要你同意治疗
<28-2,Foreman>and we need you to approve the treatment.

648
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,080
<28-3,Sean>当然
<28-3,Sean>Of course.

649
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,390
<28-3,Sean>不管你们要做什么  做就是了
<28-3,Sean>Whatever you have to do, just do it.

650
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,610
<28-4,Foreman>没那么简单
<28-4,Foreman>It's not that simple.

651
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,010
<28-4,Foreman>对婴儿来说最好是马上做剖腹产
<28-4,Foreman>The best course for the baby would be an immediate C-section.

652
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,710
<28-4,Foreman>拖得越久
<28-4,Foreman>The longer we postpone,

653
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,720
<28-4,Foreman>他的脑部由于缺氧而受损的可就越大
<28-4,Foreman>the greater chance he'll have brain damage from lack of oxygen.

654
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,880
<28-5,Sean>行  那就做吧
<28-5,Sean>Fine. Just do it.

655
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,530
<28-6,Foreman>问题是
<28-6,Foreman>Here's the problem.

656
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,570
<28-6,Foreman>剖腹产对内奥米会非常危险
<28-6,Foreman>The C-section would be very very dangerous for Naomi.

657
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,540
<28-7,Sean>有多危险
<28-7,Sean>Dangerous like--

658
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,950
<28-8,Foreman>就她目前的状况
<28-8,Foreman>In her current condition,

659
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,390
<28-8,Foreman>很可能会丧命
<28-8,Foreman>there's a real chance she won't survive.

660
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,480
<28-8,Foreman>抱歉
<28-8,Foreman>I'm sorry.

661
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,260
<28-8,Foreman>你妻子已经昏迷  需要你来做决定
<28-8,Foreman>Your wife's unconscious. We need you to make a decision.

662
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,880
<28-9,Sean>我只要她活着
<28-9,Sean>I just want her to live.

663
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,720
<28-9,Sean>不做剖腹产
<28-9,Sean>No C-section.

664
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,760
<29-1,Foreman>血氧还在下降  得给她打溶栓酶
<29-1,Foreman>Sats are still way down. We gotta push the streptokinase.

665
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,260
<29-2,Chase>太危险了  就算血栓被溶解
<29-2,Chase>Too risky. Even if it dissolves the clot,

666
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,110
<29-2,Chase>她还是可能会出血
<29-2,Chase>she could still bleed out--

667
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,730
<29-3,Foreman>她的血液循环动力受到影响
<29-3,Foreman>She's hemodynamically compromised.

668
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,050
<29-4,Chase>那对婴儿不好
<29-4,Chase>It's not good for the baby.

669
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,300
<29-5,Foreman>孩子父亲不在乎
<29-5,Foreman>Dad doesn't care.

670
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,460
<29-6,Chase>注射造影剂250，000个单位
<29-6,Chase>Bolusing 250,000 units.

671
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,940
<29-7,Foreman>血压在下降
<29-7,Foreman>B.P.'s dropping.

672
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,390
<29-8,Chase>-加压  -没时间了  必须吸出血栓
<29-8,Chase>- Pressors.  - Don't have time. We've gotta suck it out.

673
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,830
<29-9,Foreman>心缩压80
<29-9,Foreman>Systolic B.P.'s 80.

674
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,730
<29-9,Foreman>血压稳定了
<29-9,Foreman>B.P.'s stabilizing.

675
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,010
<29-9,Foreman>血氧量上升
<29-9,Foreman>O2 sats rising.

676
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,820
<29-10,House>-清除血栓了吗  -是的
<29-10,House>- Did you get the clot? - I think so.

677
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,200
<29-11,Chase>她的状况稳定了
<29-11,Chase>She's stabilized.

678
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,620
<29-12,House>她的血氧在那个阶段持续了多久
<29-12,House>How long was her oxygen at that level?

679
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,950
<29-13,Chase>-大概10分钟  -大脑功能有没受损
<29-13,Chase>- About 10 minutes. - Brain function compromised?

680
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,220
<29-14,House>应该没有  但我们会
<29-14,House>Shouldn't be, but we'll--

681
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,250
<29-15,Chase>血压在下降  加大多巴胺的剂量
<29-15,Chase>B.P.'s dropping. Up the dopamine.

682
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,970
<29-15,Chase>没反应  到多少了
<29-15,Chase>She's not responding. How much?

683
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,150
<29-16,Foreman>30微克了
<29-16,Foreman>Up to 30 micrograms.

684
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,350
<29-17,Chase>难道是败血吗

<29-23,Sean>那会要了她的命  是吧
<29-23,Sean>That's gonna kill her, right?

697
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,590
<29-25,Sean>我不同意
<29-25,Sean>I can't do that.

698
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,330
<29-26,House>她还是会死
<29-26,House>She's dying either way.

703
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,350
<29-30,House>但做这个决定很简单

<29-31,Sean>I can't do

706
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,090
<29-32,House>你做了这个决定  能改变两件事
<29-32,House>You make this call, only two things change.

707
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,140
<29-32,House>第一  没错  你会为害了你妻子而内疚
<29-32,House>One, yeah, you feel guilty for killing your wife.

708
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,200
<29-32,House>但第二  你们的孩子能活下来
<29-32,House>Two, your baby lives.

<30-15,Chase>还是没呼吸  需要插管
<30-15,Chase>Still not breathing. We've gotta intubate.

724

725
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,410
<30-15,Chase>谢谢
<30-15,Chase>Thank you.

726
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,590
<31-1,Cuddy>-董事会我已经迟到了  -我们得谈谈
<31-1,Cuddy>- I'm late for the board meeting.  - We need to talk.

727
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,660
<31-3,Cuddy>-我不想听  -是有关一个病人的
<31-3,Cuddy>- I don't want to hear it.  - It's about a patient.

728
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,860
<31-5,Cuddy>那个孕妇
<31-5,Cuddy>The pregnant woman?

729
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,420
<31-5,Cuddy>她不能参与实验
<31-5,Cuddy>She wasn't qualified for that trial.

730
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,240
<31-5,Cuddy>-我不会道歉的  -我不是说她
<31-5,Cuddy>- And I'm not gonna apologize - I'm not talking about her.

731
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,200
<31-6,House>在这个节骨眼上
<31-6,House>At this point,

732
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,790
<31-6,House>我最好还是把精力放在那些还活着的病人上
<31-6,House>I think it's best if I concentrate on patients who are still alive.

733
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,090
<31-6,House>肺气肿  她大出血  只救了她儿子
<31-6,House>Pulmonary embolism. She bled out. Saved her son.

734
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,750
<31-6,House>这是奥利弗·卡普兰的CT
<31-6,House>This is Olive Kaplan's C.T. scan

735
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,880
<31-6,House>那个可怜的小婴儿
<31-6,House>The incredible shrinking baby.

736
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,740
<31-7,Cuddy>她的胸腺
<31-7,Cuddy>Her thymus gland.

737
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,380
<31-8,House>先天性胸腺发育不全综合症  是遗传的
<31-8,House>DiGeorge syndrome. It's genetic.

738
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,130
<31-8,House>导致胸腺萎缩得几乎没了
<31-8,House>Caused the gland to wither to nothing.

739
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,470
<31-9,Cuddy>-所以她才不能增重  -是的
<31-9,Cuddy>- This is why she couldn't gain weight.  - Yeah.

740
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,580
<31-10,House>我会给警察和社会福利部门打电话
<31-10,House>I'll call the police and Social Services

741
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,400
<31-11,Cuddy>撤回所有控诉
<31-11,Cuddy>and have all the charges withdrawn.

742
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,770
<31-12,House>我开了检查单子去确认  等结果出来
<31-12,House>I've sent a test down to confirm. When it comes back,

743
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,700
<31-12,House>你就给奥利弗做免疫球蛋白替代治疗
<31-12,House>you should start Olive on immunoglobulin replacement.

744
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
<31-13,Cuddy>你不自己做吗
<31-13,Cuddy>You're not gonna do it?

745
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,020
<31-14,House>我想到时我已不在这里了
<31-14,House>Well, I assume I won't be here.

746
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,750
<32-1,Foreman>你儿子很好
<32-1,Foreman>Your boy is doing good.

748
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,790
<32-1,Foreman>一样的理由
<32-1,Foreman>Same reasons.

749
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,980
<33-1,Vogler>同意开除格利高里·豪斯的
<33-1,Vogler>All those in favor of dismissing Gregory House,

750
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,300
<33-1,Vogler>请举手
<33-1,Vogler>raise a hand.

751
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,560
<33-1,Vogler>卡迪医生
<33-1,Vogler>Dr. Cuddy,

752
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,620
<33-1,Vogler>你得明白这是必然的
<33-1,Vogler>you realize this is going to happen.

753
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,550
<33-3,Vogler>-我做不到  -你不能弃权
<33-3,Vogler>- I can't do it.  - You can't abstain.

754
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,370
<33-4,Cuddy>不是弃权  我是反对
<33-4,Cuddy>I'm not abstaining. I'm voting no.

755
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
<33-5,Vogler>才一天你就改变主意啦
<33-5,Vogler>You've changed your mind since yesterday?

756
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,160
<33-5,Vogler>他做了什么
<33-5,Vogler>What did he do?

757
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,410
<33-5,Vogler>请你吃饭  送玫瑰给你
<33-5,Vogler>Buy you dinner and roses?

758
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,690
<33-5,Vogler>威胁要杀了你的狗
<33-5,Vogler>Threaten to drown your dog?

759
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,190
<33-6,Cuddy>-他尽到了职责  -是啊
<33-6,Cuddy>- He did his job.  - Right.

760
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,070
<33-7,Vogler>他又救了一条生命
<33-7,Vogler>He saved another life.

761
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,580
<33-9,Vogler>-也许  -他真厉害
<33-9,Vogler>- Maybe. - Good for him.

762
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,150
<33-9,Vogler>真伟大  但不能说明问题
<33-9,Vogler>It's great. It's not the point.

763
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,320
<33-10,Cuddy>那是我们的工作
<33-10,Cuddy>It's what we do.

764
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,650
<33-11,Vogler>如果不用担心某个疯子会
<33-11,Vogler>And you could do it a lot better

765
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,990
<33-11,Vogler>在医院四处乱晃且不听命于任何人
<33-11,Vogler>if you didn't have to worry about some madman...

766
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,740
<33-11,Vogler>你可以做的更好
<33-11,Vogler>running around the hospital accountable to no one.

767
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,240
<33-12,Cuddy>但那不是你给我们的选择
<33-12,Cuddy>But that's not the choice you're giving us.

768
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,010
<33-13,Vogler>豪斯不会服从于任何人
<33-13,Vogler>House won't listen to anyone.

769
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,010
<33-14,Cuddy>你也一样是独断专行
<33-14,Cuddy>And you're not accountable to anybody either.

770
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,350
<33-14,Cuddy>因为你觉得我们归你所有
<33-14,Cuddy>Because you think you own us.

771
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,670
<33-15,Vogler>我提议立即开除丽莎·卡迪医生
<33-15,Vogler>I move for the immediate dismissal of Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

772
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,430
<33-15,Vogler>她只是情绪低落  我们都是
<33-15,Vogler>She's upset. We all are.

773
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,800
<33-16,Cuddy>你为什么要牺牲自己的事业来保全他
<33-16,Cuddy>Why would you risk your career to save him?

774
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,130
<33-16,Cuddy>如果你们觉得豪斯应该离开
<33-16,Cuddy>If you think House deserves to go,

775
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,320
<33-16,Cuddy>觉得我应该离开
<33-16,Cuddy>if you think I deserve to go,

776
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,560
<33-16,Cuddy>威尔森应该离开  尽管举手就是了
<33-16,Cuddy>Wilson deserved to go, then vote yes.

777
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,020
<33-16,Cuddy>但若你们是出于
<33-16,Cuddy>But if you're doing this because

778
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,330
<33-16,Cuddy>害怕失去他的钱而赞同他
<33-16,Cuddy>you are afraid of losing his money, then he's right.

779
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,790
<33-16,Cuddy>那你们真是归他所有
<33-16,Cuddy>He does own you.

780
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,130
<33-16,Cuddy>你们还有选择权
<33-16,Cuddy>You have a choice.

781
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,830
<33-16,Cuddy>这可能是你们最后一个选择权
<33-16,Cuddy>Maybe the last real one you'll have here.

782
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,210
<34-1,House>卡迪是个天才
<34-1,House>Cuddy is a genius.

783
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,520
<34-1,House>说服了四个人放弃
<34-1,House>Convincing four people to give up

784
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,980
<34-1,House>一大笔钱来保住我们的饭碗
<34-1,House>a fortune to save our sorry asses.

785
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,400
<34-1,House>-卡迪医生  伟大的女英雄
<34-1,House>- Dr. Cuddy, the man of the hour.

786
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,620
<34-2,Cuddy>你们在做什么
<34-2,Cuddy>What are you doing?

787
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,360
<34-2,Cuddy>喝酒啊
<34-2,Cuddy>We're drinking.

788
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,310
<34-3,House>这不是很明显吗
<34-3,House>I would have thought that was pretty obvious.

789
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,770
<34-4,Cuddy>庆祝伟大的胜利  救了你
<34-4,Cuddy>To the great champion. Saved you,

790
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,010
<34-4,Cuddy>救了威尔森  救了整个团队
<34-4,Cuddy>saved Wilson-- saved the whole team.

791
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,450
<34-4,Cuddy>当然  如果你能好好和别人相处的话
<34-4,Cuddy>Of course none of them would have needed saving

792
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,470
<34-4,Cuddy>这一切都可以避免
<34-4,Cuddy>if you could actually get along with another human being.

793
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,060
<34-5,House>多谢  扫兴女王
<34-5,House>Thank you, Miss Buzz Kill.

794
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,300
<34-6,Cuddy>你只不过花了我们一亿美元嘛
<34-6,Cuddy>Well, you only cost us a hundred million dollars.

795
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,900
<34-6,Cuddy>本可以用来救几条命
<34-6,Cuddy>Could have saved some lives,

796
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,660
<34-6,Cuddy>提供几份工作  帮助一些人
<34-6,Cuddy>could have made a few jobs, helped a few people-- yippee.

797
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,250
<34-7,House>你还是选择让他走
