<14-3,Kutner>Or the hardship'llabcbring 'em closer together.

223
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,260
<14-3,Kutner>没准会邀几个女伴和Foreman分享
<14-3,Kutner>She'll invite friendsabcover for Foreman to share.

224
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,160
<14-3,Kutner>暖炉没有泄漏
<14-3,Kutner>No leaks in the heater.

225
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,170
<14-4,Taub>她不是色情狂
<14-4,Taub>she's not a nympho.

226
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,460
<14-4,Taub>她是双性恋abc她习惯了无需指引就能找到宝藏的爱人
<14-4,Taub>She's bisexual,which, by the way, means she'accustomedabcto partners who don't need a map to find the treasure.

227
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,670
<14-5,Taub>一氧化碳可能来自香烟
<14-5,Taub>C-o poisoning might haveabccome from these cigarettes.

228
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,770
<14-6,Kutner>除非他在玻璃罩里面吸
<14-6,Kutner>Not unless he wasabcsmoking them in a bell jar.

229
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,760
<14-6,Kutner>即使知道宝藏在哪abc没铲子还是挖不到
<14-6,Kutner>And even if you know where the treasure is, it canabcstill be pretty hard to dig it up without a shovel.

230
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,090
<14-7,Taub>铲子可以买
<14-7,Taub>You can buy a shovel.

231
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,280
<15-1,House>让我想想...
<15-1,House>Let's see...

232
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,210
<15-1,House>怎样才能阻止House去破坏abc我那虚伪的传统仪式呢?
<15-1,House>how do I keep house from ruining myabcprecious display of religious hypocrisy?

233
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,660
<15-1,House>有了 强迫他参加
<15-1,House>I know, I'll pressure him to attend,

234
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,350
<15-1,House>因为他不会做任何abc我指望他做的事
<15-1,House>knowing that he'll never agree toabcanythingI actually want him to do.

235
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,450
<15-2,Cuddy>我没强迫你 我只是邀请你
<15-2,Cuddy>I didn't pressure you. I invited you.

236
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,790
<15-2,Cuddy>再说尊重自己的宗教传统和虚伪无关
<15-2,Cuddy>And there's nothing hypocriticalabcabout recognizing your heritage.

237
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,340
<15-3,House>那你依犹太食谱吃饭 披四角巾abc屠宰小牛献祭了么?
<15-3,House>So you keeping kosher now, wearingabcfour-cornered garments, slaughtering heifers to the god ra?

238
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,300
<15-3,House>慢 这不是你们的传统么?
<15-3,House>Wait, is that one your people?

239
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,900
<15-3,House>要么做全套 要么一件不做abc还有C选项-- 你是骗子和伪君子
<15-3,House>Do it all, do nothing,or optionabc"c"-- you're a liar and a hypocrite.

240
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,490
<15-3,House>House...
<15-3,House>House...

241
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,130
<15-4,Cuddy>不管好坏 你都是我生命的一部分
<15-4,Cuddy>for better or for worse,youabcare a part of my life.

242
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,430
<15-4,Cuddy>这不是什么手段abc我发自内心地邀请你
<15-4,Cuddy>It isn't a ploy. It'sabca sincere invitation.

243
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,310
<15-4,Cuddy>我真的希望你能来
<15-4,Cuddy>I honestly want you to come.

244
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,820
<15-5,House>我无论如何也不会错过
<15-5,House>Wouldn't miss it for the world.

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,730
<15-6,Cuddy>我很高兴
<15-6,Cuddy>I'm glad.

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,700
<16-1,Cuddy>你这白痴
<16-1,Cuddy>You idiot.

247
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,190
<16-1,Cuddy>我正要松口气
<16-1,Cuddy>I was free and clear.

248
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,430
<16-1,Cuddy>现在他要来了 都是你的错
<16-1,Cuddy>Now he's coming,and it's your fault.

249
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,880
<16-2,Wilson>从何时起 你用谎言策略一流产abc就变成了我的错?
<16-2,Wilson>Since when have your failed attempts atabccommunication through lies become my fault?

250
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,360
<16-3,Cuddy>从你管不住嘴巴开始
<16-3,Cuddy>Since you forgot how toabckeep your mouth shut.

251
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,250
<16-3,Cuddy>你把事情搞砸了 你得负责搞定
<16-3,Cuddy>You messed it up, andabcnow you're gonna fix it.

252
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,700
<16-3,Cuddy>别告诉他是我指使的
<16-3,Cuddy>And you're gonna keep my name out of it.

253
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,930
<17-1,Kutner>他怎么样了?
<17-1,Kutner>how is he?

254
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,280
<17-2,Thirteen>很稳定 坏疽看来没有扩散
<17-2,Thirteen>Stable. Necrosis doesn'tabclook to be spreading.

255
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,130
<17-3,Kutner>我说的是Foreman
<17-3,Kutner>I was talking about Foreman.

256
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,030
<17-3,Kutner>他真的要走吗?
<17-3,Kutner>is he really gonna leave?

257
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,160
<17-4,Thirteen>这是人们被开除后的惯常做法
<17-4,Thirteen>That's usually what peopleabcdo when they get fired.

258
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,860
<17-5,Kutner>你为什么拿我出气?abc我只是关心他有什么打算
<17-5,Kutner>Why are you biting my head off? I wasabcjust wondering what he was gonna do.

259
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,600
<17-6,Thirteen>你说得对 对不起abc不是你的错
<17-6,Thirteen>You're right. I'm sorry.abcIt's not your fault.

260
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,220
<17-7,Taub>这也不是House的错
<17-7,Taub>It's not house's fault either.

261
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,610
<17-7,Taub>他给过你们机会 你们不要
<17-7,Taub>He gave you guys a chance,you blew it.

262
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,580
<17-8,Thirteen>他没有给我们机会abc他一来就发最后通牒
<17-8,Thirteen>Uh, he didn't give us aabcchance,he gave us an ultimatum.

263
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,720
<17-8,Thirteen>我本以为在这儿已经干了五年abc他会容许你犯一两个错
<17-8,Thirteen>I would've thought five years hereabcwould buy a mistake or two.

264
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,430
<17-9,Daniel>救我!
<17-9,Daniel>Help me!

265
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,230
<17-9,Daniel>救我!

266
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,630
<17-9,Daniel>我无法呼吸!abc像是有东西压在我胸口上!
<17-9,Daniel>I can't breathe! Feels like something's on my chest!

267
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,300
<17-10,Kutner>像是心脏病发作
<17-10,Kutner>Looks like a heart attack.

268
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,400
<18-1,Foreman>我想你已经知道了
<18-1,Foreman>I assume you've heard.

269
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,330
<18-2,Cuddy>我不能强迫他
<18-2,Cuddy>I can't override him.

270
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,270
<18-3,Foreman>我不是让你强迫他
<18-3,Foreman>I'm not asking you to override him.

271
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,960
<18-3,Foreman>我想让你写封推荐信
<18-3,Foreman>I'm asking for aabcletter of recommendation.

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,280
<18-4,Cuddy>Eric 现在的情况是...
<18-4,Cuddy>Eric, the reality here is...

273
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,450
<18-4,Cuddy>House有理由开除你
<18-4,Cuddy>house should've fired you.

274
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,750
<18-4,Cuddy>你伪造病历 置医院的名声不顾
<18-4,Cuddy>You falsified medical records, putabcthis hospital's reputation in jeopardy.

275
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,990
<18-4,Cuddy>你能保住执照已是万幸了
<18-4,Cuddy>You're lucky you still have a license.

276
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,350
<18-5,Foreman>但没有推荐信 我无法在别处找到好工作
<18-5,Foreman>I can't get a decent position at anotherabchospital without a recommendation.

277
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,060
<18-5,Foreman>对不起
<18-5,Foreman>I'm sorry.

278
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,420
<19-1,Taub>胸口的痛并非心绞痛abc心电图排除了心脏病发作
<19-1,Taub>Chest pain wasn't angina.abcEkg ruled out heart attack.

279
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,520
<19-2,House>那么 好消息是 没有心脏病发作
<19-2,House>So the good news is, heabcdidn't have a heart attack.

280
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,990
<19-2,House>坏消息是 我开除了唯一abc对心脏病有所了解的人
<19-2,House>The bad news is,I apparently fired the only guyabcwho actually knows what a heart attack looks like.

281
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,550
<19-2,House>这么说 这位不信上帝的上帝使者abc患上了不是心脏病的心脏病
<19-2,House>So the man of god who doesn't believe inabcgod had a heart attack that isn't a heart attack.

282
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,190
<19-2,House>谁敢说我挑病例不独具慧眼?
<19-2,House>Do I know how toabcpick awesome cases or what?

283
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,760
<19-2,House>可能是凝血紊乱
<19-2,House>could be a clotting disorder.

284
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,560
<19-3,Kutner>三个不同症状abc三个部位有凝块?
<19-3,Kutner>Three differentabcsymptoms,three different clots?

<19-4,House>我知道 这多酷啊
<19-4,House>I know. How cool is that?

286
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,310
<19-4,House>你们两个去做个血管造影
<19-4,House>You two do an angio.

287
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,990
<19-4,House>既然你无心工作abc何不去帮我买张彩票?
<19-4,House>You don't want to work, so why don'tabcyou just go get me a lottery ticket?

288
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,140
<19-4,House>他病得越厉害abc我就越是觉得运气来了
<19-4,House>The sicker he gets,the luckier I feel.

289
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,820
<19-5,Kutner>你要去哪里?
<19-5,Kutner>Where are you going?

290
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,650
<19-6,House>我还没向他作自我介绍呢
<19-6,House>I've been wanting to introduce myself.

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,410
<20-1,House>你真的是处男吗?
<20-1,House>Are you really a virgin?

292
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,540
<20-2,Daniel>你只需医治我 无需相信我
<20-2,Daniel>You have to treat me. Youabcdon't have to believe me.

293
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,270
<20-3,House>但治疗之前 我们先要进行诊断
<20-3,House>And before we treat you,weabchave to diagnose you.

294
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,720
<20-3,House>不知道你的话是否可信会造成阻碍
<20-3,House>Not knowing whether we can believeabcyou is making that difficult.

295
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,350
<20-4,Daniel>我说的每句话都是真的
<20-4,Daniel>Everything I've told you is true.

<20-5,House>你放弃你的信仰abc只因为一个孩子误会了?
<20-5,House>You lost your faith becauseabca teenager got confused?

297
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,870
<20-6,Daniel>还因为教会抛弃了我abc我的上帝也遗弃了我
<20-6,Daniel>And the church abandonedabcme,and my god forsook me,

298
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,670
<20-6,Daniel>我想不到一个理由abc为什么上帝会这么做
<20-6,Daniel>and I couldn't come up withabca rson why god would do that.

299
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,040
<20-7,Kutner>上帝赋予教会和孩子以自由意志
<20-7,Kutner>god gave the churchabcand the kid free will.

300
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,590
<20-7,Kutner>他们行使自由意志 伤害了你
<20-7,Kutner>Their exercise of thatabcfree will hurt you.

301
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,740
<20-7,Kutner>也就是说 你是上帝赐予abc人类权力的的受害者
<20-7,Kutner>Means you're just a victimabcof god's gift to mankind.

302
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,550
<20-8,Daniel>是 上帝想要生活有意义abc无自由意志的生活没有意义
<20-8,Daniel>Oh, yeah. God wants life to have meaning.abcLife's meaningless without free will.

303
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,350
<20-8,Daniel>有自由意志 就得受苦abc所以上帝要我们受苦
<20-8,Daniel>With free will, there's alwaysabcsuffering. So god wants suffering.

304
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,190
<20-8,Daniel>还没讲完这些论辩 我就厌倦了
<20-8,Daniel>I got tired of that argumentabcbefore I even finished saying it.

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,560
<25-1,House>谈到伪善和妓女 差不多等于你
<25-1,House>not you specifically--whoresabcand hypocrisy.

439
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,970
<25-1,House>你说得对
<25-1,House>You were right.

440
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,690
<25-2,Cuddy>我不想你去
<25-2,Cuddy>I don't want you there.

441
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,000
<25-2,Cuddy>那是充满爱和接纳的特殊时刻
<25-2,Cuddy>It's a special occasion filledabcwith love and acceptance,

442
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:12,540
<25-2,Cuddy>我最不想要的就是感到厌恶和轻蔑
<25-2,Cuddy>and the last thing I need is someone thereabcwho's filled with loathing and contempt.

443
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,970
<25-3,House>好吧
<25-3,House>Okay.

444
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,990
<25-4,Cuddy>就这样?
<25-4,Cuddy>That's it?

445
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,900
<25-4,Cuddy>你真不会来了?
<25-4,Cuddy>You're really not coming?

446
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,080
<25-5,House>我真不会来
<25-5,House>I'm really not coming.

447
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,090
<25-6,Cuddy>谢谢
<25-6,Cuddy>Thank you.

448
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,090
<25-7,House>不客气
<25-7,House>You're welcome.

449
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,900
<25-7,House>上帝 我感到自己长大了
<25-7,House>Gosh,I feel so grown up.

450
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,330
<26-1,Kutner>很明显他是在玩你 想看你是否认真
<26-1,Kutner>He's obviously just jerking youabcaround,wants to see if you're serious.

451
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,640
<26-1,Kutner>如果你坚持 我想他会让Foreman回来的
<26-1,Kutner>If you just stick it out,Iabcthink he'll bring Foreman back.

452
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,380
<26-2,Taub>我不认为 也许我错了 我想你们该分手
<26-2,Taub>I don't,and even if I'm wrong,Iabcthink you should still split up.

453
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,610
<26-2,Taub>你俩发现对方床上有另一个女人abc只是时间问题
<26-2,Taub>It's just a matter of time before one ofabcyou finds the other in bed with another woman.

454
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,620
<26-3,Kutner>这可真像是恋爱专家说的话
<26-3,Kutner>This coming from the relationship expert.

455
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,830
<26-4,Taub>维持12年了 还在继续
<26-4,Taub>12 years and counting.

456
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,290
<26-5,Thirteen>嘿 如果你都能保持那么久 别人也能
<26-5,Thirteen>Hey,if you can make it thatabclong,then anyone can.

457
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,000
<26-6,Taub>好笑的是说维持关系很容易的俩人abc都是单身
<26-6,Taub>Funny how the two people in the room whoabcthink relationships are easy are both single.

458
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,110
<26-7,Kutner>我不认为容易
<26-7,Kutner>I don't think they're easy.

459
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,480
<26-7,Kutner>这就是为何我说如果找到了好的abc就不应该放弃
<26-7,Kutner>That's why I think if you find somethingabcthat could be good,you should hang onto it.

460
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,890
<26-8,Taub>任何事都有好的一面
<26-8,Taub>Everything could be good.

461
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,400
<26-8,Taub>不管多小
<26-8,Taub>Very lite ever is.

462
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,560
<26-9,Thirteen>脾没问题 只有些不起眼的细菌
<26-9,Thirteen>His spleen is fine,justabcsome insignificant traces of minor bugs.

463
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,110
<26-9,Thirteen>没有能致病的因素
<26-9,Thirteen>Nothing that'd make him sick.

464
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,040
<26-10,Taub>什么细菌?
<26-10,Taub>Which minor bugs?

465
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,910
<27-1,House>为何当人们有了孩子就突然信教了?
<27-1,House>Why do people suddenlyabcfind religion when they have kids?

466
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,590
<27-2,Daniel>对未知的恐惧
<27-2,Daniel>Fear of the unknown.

467
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,170
<27-2,Daniel>信仰的基础
<27-2,Daniel>Cornerstone of faith.

468
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,600
<27-2,Daniel>这讲得通
<27-2,Daniel>I think it makes perfect sense.

469
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,950
<27-3,House>因为讲不通所以讲得通
<27-3,House>So it makes sense becauseabcit doesn't make sense.

470
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,730
<27-4,Daniel>事实上你为此困扰也讲不通
<27-4,Daniel>The fact that you're railing aboutabcit doesn't make a lot of sense.

471
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,660
<27-4,Daniel>你喜欢你老板 是吧?
<27-4,Daniel>You really got a thing for your boss,huh?

472
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,850
<27-5,House>我喜欢她的那地方
<27-5,House>I've got a thing for my boss's thing.

473
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,850
<27-5,House>实际上...她那地方也没什么好
<27-5,House>She doesn't have a thing...per se.

474
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,110
<27-5,House>我喜欢隐喻
<27-5,House>I'm big on metaphors.

475
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,050
<27-5,House>你呢?
<27-5,House>What about you?

476
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,230
<27-5,House>29年单身生活
<27-5,House>29 years of celibacy.

477
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,240
<27-5,House>是什么让你犹豫不决?
<27-5,House>What's holding you back now?

478
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,260
<27-6,Daniel>谁想和神父恋爱呢?
<27-6,Daniel>Who wants a relationship with a priest?

479
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,540
<27-7,House>谁又想恋爱呢?
<27-7,House>Who wants a relationship?

480
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,740
<27-8,Taub>House?
<27-8,Taub>House?

481
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,210
<27-9,Taub>是圣水
<27-9,Taub>It's the holy water.

482
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,580
<27-10,Thirteen>我们以为如果是感染abc一定是严重的
<27-10,Thirteen>We assumed if it was an infection,itabchad to be something big and nasty.

483
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,480
<27-11,Taub>但他有肺胞菌肺炎 这到处都存在的细菌abc本不会致病
<27-11,Taub>But he has pneumocystis,a harmless bugabcthat's everywhere and never makes anyone sick,

484
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,990
<27-11,Taub>除非免疫系统损坏了
<27-11,Taub>unless they have aabccompromised immune system.

485
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,120
<27-12,House>那神父尼采患有艾滋病
<27-12,House>So father nietzsche has aids.

486
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,130
<28-1,Daniel>不可能
<28-1,Daniel>impossible.

487
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,720
<28-1,Daniel>我从没输过血
<28-1,Daniel>I've never had a blood transfusion.

488
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,090
<28-1,Daniel>没静脉注射毒品
<28-1,Daniel>I've never done I.V.Drugs.

489
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,210
<28-1,Daniel>没做过爱
<28-1,Daniel>I've never had sex.

490
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,880
<28-2,Taub>那就证明看看 做个测试
<28-2,Taub>So prove it. Have an aids test.

491
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,450
<28-2,Taub>不
<28-2,Taub>No.

492
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,750
<28-3,Daniel>我知道我没有艾滋病
<28-3,Daniel>I know I don't have aids.

493
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,860
<28-4,Kutner>我们要知道了是什么病 才能治疗
<28-4,Kutner>We can't treat you untilabcwe know what it is.

494
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,430
<28-5,Daniel>阴性结果什么都不能证明
<28-5,Daniel>A negative result proves nothing.

495
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,730
<28-5,Daniel>万一是假阳性abc我将永远失去别人对我最后的信任
<28-5,Daniel>On the off chance it's a false positive,Iabcpermanently loseany credibility I have left.

496
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,890
<28-6,Taub>你刚刚已经失去了
<28-6,Taub>I'd say you just lost that.

497
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,950
<28-7,Daniel>我早就失去你的信任了吧
<28-7,Daniel>I'd say I lost that withabcyou a long time ago.

498
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,820
<29-1,Taub>我们得开始治疗艾滋
<29-1,Taub>we should start treatment for aids.

499
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,670
<29-2,Kutner>要先确认才行
<29-2,Kutner>we need to be sure.

500
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,480
<29-2,Kutner>抗艾滋病药物会毁了他的心 肝和肾的
<29-2,Kutner>The antiretrovirals could fryabchis heart,his liver,his kidneys.

501
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,750
<29-3,Taub>这个险我愿意冒
<29-3,Taub>I'm willing to take that chance.

502
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,370
<29-4,Kutner>你太大胆了
<29-4,Kutner>Big of you.

503
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,070
<29-5,Taub>我更担心那个被侵犯的小孩
<29-5,Taub>I'm more worried aboutabcthe kid he molested.

504
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,600
<29-5,Taub>我们应该找到他 让他接受检查
<29-5,Taub>We should be findingabchim and getting him tested.

505
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,780
<29-6,Kutner>他很可能已经检查过了
<29-6,Kutner>You don't think he already got tested?

506
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,400
<29-7,Taub>他也许已经检查了 可能还没有abc但我不愿冒这个险
<29-7,Taub>Maybe he did,maybe he didn't,butabcthat's a chance I'm not willing to take.

507
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,880
<29-8,Kutner>依照法律 我们不能向abc患者的性伴侣告知性病检测结果
<29-8,Kutner>Legally,we can't informabcsexual partners about stds.

508
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,730
<29-9,Taub>那不是什么久经江湖的老色鬼
<29-9,Taub>This isn't some middle-agedabcbarfly who likes it bareback.

509
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,250
<29-9,Taub>那只是个被侵犯的无辜的孩子
<29-9,Taub>This is an innocent kid who was molested.

510
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,050
<29-10,Kutner>你只想让那个牧师再次名声扫地abc然后被调走
<29-10,Kutner>You just want to rub the priest'sabcface in it,get him transferred again.

511
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,360
<29-11,Taub>天堂驱逐骗子 难道做错了
<29-11,Taub>Yeah,heaven forbid aabcdiddler has job issues.

512
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,350
<29-12,House>你会惹上官司
<29-12,House>And you get brought upon charges.

513
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,340
<29-12,House>这周我失去的医生够多了
<29-12,House>I've lost enough doctors this week.

514
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,500
<29-12,House>按艾滋病给予治疗
<29-12,House>Treat him for aids.

515
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,230
<30-1,Thirteen>我找到工作了
<30-1,Thirteen>I found a job.

516
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,870
<30-2,Foreman>我不知道你有找工作
<30-2,Foreman>I didn't know you were looking.

517
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,500
<30-3,Thirteen>Mercy医院的Eggers说周一就可以上班了
<30-3,Thirteen>Eggers at mercy says I can start monday.

518
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,010
<30-4,Foreman>你为什么...
<30-4,Foreman>Why wouldabcyou--

519
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,330
<30-5,Thirteen>House说如果我离开 你就可以回来
<30-5,Thirteen>house says if I go,you can come back.

520
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,110
<30-6,Foreman>现在还不到两天
<30-6,Foreman>It's been less than two days.

521
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,190
<30-6,Foreman>你这么快就对我失望了?
<30-6,Foreman>Give up on me that fast?

522
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,960
<30-6,Foreman>竟然背着我偷偷找工作?
<30-6,Foreman>You get a job behind my back?

523
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,510
<30-7,Thirteen>你似乎觉得我骗了你
<30-7,Thirteen>You're acting like I'm cheating on you.

524
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,980
<30-8,Foreman>我说过我会处理的
<30-8,Foreman>I said I would handle this.

525
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,690
<30-9,Thirteen>House早就知道你会这么想
<30-9,Thirteen>House knew you'd be like this.

526
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,870
<30-10,Foreman>我也觉得House比你更了解我
<30-10,Foreman>I guess house knowsabcme better than you do.

527
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,530
<30-10,Foreman>没有做两手准备真是太笨了
<30-10,Foreman>Too bad I don't go both ways.

528
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,710
<30-11,Thirteen>晚安
<30-11,Thirteen>Good night.

529
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,510
<31-1,Wilson>我真讨厌他们把蘑菇放在芝士下面
<31-1,Wilson>Don't you hate when they put theabcmushrooms underneath the cheese?

530
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,810
<31-2,House>你出席只是助纣为虐
<31-2,House>Your attendance isabcvalidating her hypocrisy.

531
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,050
<31-2,House>如果她邀请你参加宗教私刑礼abc你也会去吗?
<31-2,House>If she invited you to aabcceremonial lynching,would you go?

532
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,570
<31-3,Wilson>那就要看她准备了什么美食
<31-3,Wilson>It would depend on what she was serving.

533
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,890
<31-3,Wilson>所有人都是伪君子
<31-3,Wilson>Everyone's a hypocrite.

534
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,480
<31-3,Wilson>为何你就揪着Cuddy这一点不放呢?
<31-3,Wilson>Why are you suddenly so obsessed withabcCuddy's particular brand?

535
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,450
<31-4,House>只是找点话题
<31-4,House>Just making conversation.

536
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,260
<31-4,House>你更想讨论蘑菇和芝士吗
<31-4,House>Would you rather we go back toabctalking about mushrooms and cheese?

537
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,490
<31-5,Wilson>你才是伪君子
<31-5,Wilson>You're the hypocrite!

538
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,600
<31-5,Wilson>你想去
<31-5,Wilson>You want to go!

539
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,050
<31-5,Wilson>你也不讨厌那个孩子
<31-5,Wilson>You don't resent this baby.

540
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,330
<31-5,Wilson>你想参加
<31-5,Wilson>You want to be a part of it.

541
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,710
<31-6,House>是的 除非她已经16岁...在某些州
<31-6,House>Yes,but not until her 16thabcbirthday...in some states.

542
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,460
<31-7,Wilson>太荒谬了
<31-7,Wilson>This is ridiculous.

543
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,440
<31-7,Wilson>你们俩太般配了
<31-7,Wilson>You two deserve each other.

544
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,120
<31-7,Wilson>想去就去吧 然后表现得像样些
<31-7,Wilson>If you want to go,just goabcand act like a human being.

545
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,820
<31-8,House>哇 除了两点 你的建议妙极了
<31-8,House>Wow,solid advice,except for two things.

546
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,630
<31-8,House>我装得好像一点也不想去abc因为我真的不想去 还有...
<31-8,House>I'm acting like I don't want to goabcbecause I don't want to go,and...

547
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,760
<31-8,House>我真的不能装得像个人样
<31-8,House>I am incapable ofabcacting like a human being.

548
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,450
<32-1,Taub>Ryan?
<32-1,Taub>Ryan?

549
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,600

<35-1,Taub>it's not a new symptom.

611
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,400
<35-1,Taub>只是对艾滋病治疗的反应而已
<35-1,Taub>It's just a reaction to the aids meds.

612
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,730
<35-2,Kutner>病情恶化了
<35-2,Kutner>He reacted by getting worse.

613
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,720
<35-2,Kutner>意味着这不是艾滋病
<35-2,Kutner>Means it's not aids.

616
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,550
<35-5,House>我喜欢它的俗名"约伯综合症"
<35-5,House>I prefer the colloquialabcterm "job syndrome."

618
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,710
<35-6,Kutner>我们一开始就查过了

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,880
<35-6,Kutner>IgE抗体正常
<35-6,Kutner>Ige levels are normal.

<35-7,Thirteen>Cerebral microtumors could explainabcthe blindness and the hallucinations.

622
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,600
<35-8,Foreman>我们找不到肿瘤
<35-8,Foreman>We didn't find any tumors.

623
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
<35-9,Thirteen>所以我说的不是"肿瘤"
<35-9,Thirteen>That's why I didn't say "tumors."

624
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,860
<35-9,Thirteen>而是"微小肿瘤"
<35-9,Thirteen>I said "microtumors."

625
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,780
<35-10,Foreman>那么说你的解释是基于abc我们只是普通白痴 还没蠢到家?
<35-10,Foreman>So your explanation doesn't dependabcon us being major morons,just morons?

626
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,590
<35-11,Thirteen>我们应该做个基因检测
<35-11,Thirteen>We should start genetic testing.

<35-12,Foreman>耗时太长了
<35-12,Foreman>It takes too long.

628
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,250
<35-13,Thirteen>那直接开始治疗
<35-13,Thirteen>So we start treatment.

629
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,230
<35-14,Foreman>治疗就是动手术
<35-14,Foreman>Treatment is surgery.

631
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,140
<35-15,Thirteen>那你的立场是 不检测也不治疗?
<35-15,Thirteen>So your position is weabccan't test and we can't treat?

632
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,270
<35-16,Foreman>我的立场是你错了
<35-16,Foreman>My position is you're wrong.

664
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,390
<37-5,Wilson>就不会觉得参加仪式虚伪了
<37-5,Wilson>so you don't feel likeabca hypocrite for going.

665
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,470
<37-6,House>对不起
<37-6,House>Oh,sorry.

666
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,830
<37-6,House>继续
<37-6,House>Continue.

667
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:52,330
<37-7,Wilson>即使世上存在绝对的真理abc我们也无法得悉其全部
<37-7,Wilson>Okay,even if an absolute truthabcexists,we can't know all of it,

668
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,840
<37-7,Wilson>你不能因Cuddy承认这点而苛责她
<37-7,Wilson>and you can't condemnabcher for recognizing that.

669
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
<37-8,Wilson>你在排除症状?
<37-8,Wilson>Are you eliminating symptoms?

670
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,160
<37-9,House>我们无法得知一切
<37-9,House>We can know everything.

671
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,580
<37-10,Wilson>这是医学 不是形而上学
<37-10,Wilson>This is medicine not metaphysics.

672
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,760
<37-11,House>真理就是真理
<37-11,House>Truth is truth.

673
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,330
<37-11,House>这下符合了
<37-11,House>It fits.

674
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,130
<37-12,Wilson>这不符合
<37-12,Wilson>It doesn't fit.

675
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,390
<37-12,Wilson>你不能排除症状
<37-12,Wilson>You can't eliminate a symptom.

676
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,400
<37-13,House>如果不是症状就可以
<37-13,House>I can if it's nota symptom.

677
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,960
<37-14,Wilson>那是什么
<37-14,Wilson>Well,what is it?

678
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,000
<37-15,House>不是症状
<37-15,House>Not a symptom.

679
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,290
<38-1,House>你不会死
<38-1,House>You're not gonna die.

680
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,210
<38-1,House>你患了Wiskott-Aldrich综合症abc(湿疹血小板减少伴免疫缺陷综合症)
<38-1,House>You have wiskott-aldrich syndrome.

681
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:00,720
<38-1,House>它会削弱你的免疫系统abc使你出现所有艾滋病的症状
<38-1,House>It impairs your immune system,makes you susceptible toabcall the aids stuff without actually having aids.

682
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,210
<38-1,House>不是后天染上的
<38-1,House>And you didn't catch it.

683
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,570
<38-1,House>是与生俱来的
<38-1,House>You were born with it.

684
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,230
<38-1,House>上帝的又一件礼物
<38-1,House>Another gift from god.

685
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,650
<38-2,Daniel>你确定?
<38-2,Daniel>You sure?

686
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:14,580
<38-3,House>基因检测可以确定 但它解释了所有症状--abc脚趾脱落 胸痛 失明 皮疹
<38-3,House>Genetic test should confirm it,but it explainsabcall your symptoms-- toe,chest,eyes,skin.

687
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,240
<38-4,Daniel>那我的幻觉呢?
<38-4,Daniel>What about my hallucination?

688
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,120
<38-5,House>因为苏格兰威士忌
<38-5,House>Scotch explains that.

689
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,910
<38-6,Daniel>那么说 只是一个巧合
<38-6,Daniel>But that was just a coincidence.

690
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:31,230
<38-7,House>巧合时有发生
<38-7,House>Coincidences do happen.

691
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,500
<38-8,Daniel>但一开始 是这个巧合把我带到了医院
<38-8,Daniel>That coincidence is what brought meabcto you in the first place.

692
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,440
<38-9,House>你答应你不会归功于上帝
<38-9,House>You promised you wouldn't go there.

693
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:49,320
<38-10,Daniel>爱因斯坦说: "巧合是abc上帝匿名出现的方式"
<38-10,Daniel>Einstein said,"coincidence isabcgod's way of remaining anonymous."

694
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,410
<38-11,House>有个佛州的女人说: "看呐abc耶稣在我的芝士三文治上"
<38-11,House>A woman in florida said,"look,jesus isabcon my cheese sandwich."

695
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,970
<38-12,Daniel>你开始不想接这个病例
<38-12,Daniel>You didn't even want to take my case.

696
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,580
<38-12,Daniel>你根本不认为我有病
<38-12,Daniel>You didn't even think I was sick.

697
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,060
<38-13,House>我错了 并不能证实上帝存在
<38-13,House>The fact that I was wrongabcis not a proof of god.

698
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,980
<38-14,Daniel>我只是想弄明白abc我的生命怎么会在一天逆转?
<38-14,Daniel>I'm just trying to understand how my lifeabccould completely turn around in a single day.

699
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,780
<38-14,Daniel>别担心
<38-14,Daniel>Don't worry.

700
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,610
<38-15,House>你的生命很快会像以前那样糟糕
<38-15,House>Your life will go backabcto sucking soon enough.

701
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,500
<38-15,House>发生在你身上的一切abc都能得到合理解释
<38-15,House>Everything that happened toabcyou can be rationally explained.

702
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,870
<38-15,House>我知道
<38-15,House>I know.

703
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,100
<38-16,Daniel>只是...
<38-16,Daniel>It's just...

704
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,910
<38-16,Daniel>有太多的巧合了
<38-16,Daniel>that's a lot of coincidences.

705
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,490
<39-1,Cuddy>House对那个牧师的诊断是对的
<39-1,Cuddy>House was right about the priest.

706
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,440
<39-1,Cuddy>基因检测证实是Wiskott-Aldrich
<39-1,Cuddy>Genetic test confirmed itabcwas wiskott-aldrich.

707
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,790
<39-2,Cameron>而我差点就让他出院了
<39-2,Cameron>And I would've discharged him.

708
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,590
<39-3,Cuddy>所有人都会让他出院 包括House
<39-3,Cuddy>Everybody would've dischargedabchim,house included.

709
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,180
<39-3,Cuddy>他开始只是用这个病例拖延时间
<39-3,Cuddy>He only took that case as a stall.

710
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,240
<39-4,Cameron>不管怎样 这是个真正的病例abc而且他解决了
<39-4,Cameron>And yet it was a realabccase,and he solved it.

711
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:14,260
<39-5,Cuddy>但他破坏了自己的原则abc故意忽略已确定的症状
<39-5,Cuddy>But by violating his own principlesabcand ignoring the admitting symptoms.

712
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,060
<39-5,Cuddy>尽管他找到了病因
<39-5,Cuddy>Still he somehow got away with it.

713
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,030
<39-5,Cuddy>挽救了另一条生命
<39-5,Cuddy>Saved another life.

715
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,620
<39-6,Cameron>你应该告诉他
<39-6,Cameron>You should tell him.

<40-2,Cuddy>At least you haveabcshoes that cover your toes.
