00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,420
<1-2,Baby Shoes>如果手放在头上, 我爬不出来
<1-2,Baby Shoes>I can't climb out if my hands are on my head.

<1-3,Joe>就把手放在我可以看见的地方, 伙计

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,400
<1-5,Joe>抓住衣领把衬衫脱下来, 然后转过来
<1-5,Joe>Take your shirt off by your collar and turn around.

<2-1,Chase>啊...真好
<2-1,Chase>Aww...that's sweet.

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,310
<2-1,Chase>- 你爸爸很自豪. 你上了当地报纸了,- 因为我的文章
<2-1,Chase>Your dad's proud.You made the local paper.,--From my article.

23
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,790
<3-1,Cameron>消停一下吧
<3-1,Cameron>Give it a rest.

24

<3-2,Foreman>你看了他在补白写的东西了么?
<3-2,Foreman>You read what he wrote in the margin?

25

<3-3,Chase>"我的朋友拉撒路(圣经)睡去,但我能把他唤醒"
<3-3,Chase>"Our friend lazarus sleeps,but I go that i may wake him up."

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,300
<3-4,Foreman>他不是为我自豪, 他是为耶稣自豪
<3-4,Foreman>He's not proud of me.He's proud of jesus.

27
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,010
<3-4,Foreman>我做对的任何事, 都是上帝的功劳
<3-4,Foreman>Everything I do right is god's work.

28
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,110
<3-4,Foreman>我做错的任何事, 都是他妈我自己的错
<3-4,Foreman>Everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.

29
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,560
<3-5,House>有幽默感的警察
<3-5,House>Cop with a sense of humor.

30
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,430
<3-5,House>鉴别诊断
<3-5,House>Differential diagnosis.

31
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,260
<3-5,House>他还在急救室里, 血流不止
<3-5,House>Guy's in the E.R.,Bleeding on everybody.

32
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,170
<3-6,Foreman>磕药?
<3-6,Foreman>Drugs?

33
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,820
<3-7,Chase>他是个警察
<3-7,Chase>He's a cop.

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,500
<3-8,Foreman>说的好. 警察不会...磕药?
<3-8,Foreman>Good point.How about...drugs?

35
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,680
<3-9,House>毒品检测没有显示问题
<3-9,House>Tox screen was clean.

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,390
<3-9,House>他被一颗子弹击中了
<3-9,House>He did,however,get hit by a bullet.

37
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,100
<3-9,House>顺便提一下
<3-9,House>Just mentioning it.

38
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,050
<3-10,Cameron>他被人射击了?
<3-10,Cameron>He was shot?

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,190
<3-11,House>难不成子弹是被人扔过去的?
<3-11,House>No,somebody threw it at him.

40
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,230
<3-12,Chase>首先考虑外伤,子弹碎片弹进他的脑子
<3-12,Chase>I'm thinking trauma.He's got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.

41
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,200
<3-13,Foreman>照小脚丫子说,警察在中枪之前就一直在笑
<3-13,Foreman>According to baby shoes,the cop was laughing before he got shot.

42
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,970
<3-14,Cameron>小脚丫子?
<3-14,Cameron>Baby shoes?

43
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,890
<3-15,Foreman>- 朝他开枪的家伙, - 可靠的证人
<3-15,Foreman>--Guy who shot him.--Reliable witness.

44
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,720
<3-16,Cameron>他叫小脚丫子, 他能有多坏?
<3-16,Cameron>His name is baby shoes.How bad can he be?

45
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,410
<3-17,House>碎片在脑子里面待错地方,引发了欣快症
<3-17,House>Fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,960
<3-17,House>扩大搜索范围,查查咳嗽原因和浑浊的肺
<3-17,House>So let's expand the search.Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.

47
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,030
<3-18,Chase>- 为什么不在意心率加快?,- 因为他在休克中
<3-18,Chase>Why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate?--'Cause he's in shock.

48
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,580
<3-20,Chase>会不会他在中枪之前, 心率已经很快了?
<3-20,Chase>What if the heart was already fast before he got shot?

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,980
<3-21,Foreman>你指在追犯人之后?
<3-21,Foreman>You mean after the foot race?

50
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,940
<3-22,Chase>他有些眩晕, 表明供氧受到阻碍
<3-22,Chase>He's giddy.Indicates a blockage of oxygen.

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,270
<3-22,Chase>一氧化碳同时会使心率升高
<3-22,Chase>Carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,550
<3-22,Chase>还会导致咳嗽以及伤害神经功能
<3-22,Chase>and cause coughing and impair neurological functions.

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,410
<3-23,Cameron>他在户外一氧化碳中毒?
<3-23,Cameron>He got co poisoning outdoors?

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,630
<3-23,Cameron>是的
<3-23,Cameron>Yeah.

55
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,840
<3-24,House>因为那些混蛋没有签署京都议定书,(京都议定书旨在限制全球温室气体排放)
<3-24,House>All 'cause those bastards didn't ratify kyoto.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,430
<3-23,Cameron>或者他是在户内一氧化碳中毒
<3-23,Cameron>Or he got co poisoning indoors

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,920
<3-24,House>在没有吸入足量倒毙之前, 他到了户外
<3-24,House>and moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,900
<3-24,House>测一下他动脉一氧化碳含量,如果一氧化碳血红蛋白水平高过15%
<3-24,House>Test his arterial blood gas.If his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15%,

59
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,780
<3-24,House>就把他送进高压氧舱
<3-24,House>stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.

60
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,780
<3-24,House>你去检查警车的气体泄漏
<3-24,House>You go check the cop car for gas leaks or--

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,790
<3-25,Foreman>如果是警车出问题, 他的搭档也会病的
<3-25,Foreman>if it was the cop car,his partner would be sick.

62
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,870
<3-26,House>嗯, 也许她是病了,只不过她幽默感没那么强
<3-26,House>Well,maybe she is she just doesn't have as good a sense of humor.

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,100
<3-26,House>还有检查他的私人用车, 工作场所, 家里
<3-26,House>Also check his personal cars,work,home.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,990
<3-26,House>我会检查警察分局
<3-26,House>I'll check the precinct.

65
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,880
<4-1,Chase>血液测试证明你有轻度的一氧化碳中毒
<4-1,Chase>Blood tests confirm you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,760
<4-1,Chase>要送你去高压氧舱...
<4-1,Chase>We're putting you inside a high-pressure chamber to...

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,360
<4-1,Chase>你不是很在乎, 是么?
<4-1,Chase>You don't really care,do you?

68
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,920
<4-2,Cameron>你家附近有燃气供应站么?
<4-2,Cameron>Do you live near a gas supply?

69
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,540
<4-3,Joe>有, 我本人就是
<4-3,Joe>Uh,yeah,me.

70
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,090
<4-3,Joe>吃过一个巨型玉米卷饼之后
<4-3,Joe>After,like,a huge enchilada.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,580
<4-4,Chase>有没有把有毒物质放在家里?
<4-4,Chase>Anything toxic you have at your home?

72
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,650
<4-4,Chase>诸如油漆溶剂, 不卫生的?
<4-4,Chase>Any paint solvents,anything unhygienic?

73
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,400
<4-5,Joe>唔, 没有
<4-5,Joe>Uh,no.

74
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,570
<4-5,Joe>没有, 我家里保持得很干净
<4-5,Joe>No,I keep a pretty clean home.

75
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,360
<5-1,Cameron>如果呼吸困难, 你可以按这个钮
<5-1,Cameron>If you start having trouble breathing,you can press this button,

76
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,770
<5-1,Cameron>这个舱就会减压
<5-1,Cameron>and the chamber will decompress.

77
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,820
<5-2,Joe>像这样?
<5-2,Joe>Like this?

78
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,780
<5-3,Chase>不是现在. 是你有麻烦的时候
<5-3,Chase>Don't now.If you have trouble.

79
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,500
<5-4,Joe>啊, 它坏了
<5-4,Joe>Ah,it's broken.

80
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,720
<5-5,Chase>好吧, 如有你有麻烦, 我们替你按
<5-5,Chase>All right,well,if you have problems we'll push it for you.

81
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,190
<5-7,Cameron>肌肉痉挛
<5-7,Cameron>Muscle contracture.

82
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,450
<5-8,Chase>觉得有多痛?
<5-8,Chase>How bad does it hurt?

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,460
<5-9,Joe>不痛...一点不痛
<5-9,Joe>Not...not at all.

84
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,400
<5-9,Joe>看上去很吓人, 哈?
<5-9,Joe>Looks wild,though,huh?

85
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,100
<5-10,Chase>大脑供氧不足. 你正在丧失运动能力
<5-10,Chase>Your brain's not getting enough oxygen.You're losing motor function.

86
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,010
<5-10,Chase>必须马上开始
<5-10,Chase>We should start this right away.

87
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,750
<5-11,Joe>我应该害怕么?
<5-11,Joe>Should I be scared?

88
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,080
<5-12,Cameron>不, 可能在你待的地方有一氧化碳泄漏
<5-12,Cameron>No,you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place.

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,410
<5-12,Cameron>有人到那里去查了
<5-12,Cameron>We have a guy there checking things out.

90
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,690
<6-1,House>看起来没问题
<6-1,House>Sounds okay.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,300
<6-2,Female cop>煤气阀门怎么样?
<6-2,Female cop>How about the gas intake valve?

92
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,390
<6-3,House>没一点问题
<6-3,House>Looks great.

93
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,440
<6-4,Female cop>阀门在炉子间里
<6-4,Female cop>It's down in the furnace room.

94
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,090
<6-4,Female cop>设备没有问题
<6-4,Female cop>Your system's fine.

95
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,140
<6-5,House>如果有一氧化碳泄漏,半数的警员会病倒
<6-5,House>If you had a carbon monoxide leak,half the force would be sick.

96
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,950
<6-6,Female cop>那么你为什么来这里?
<6-6,Female cop>Then why are you here?

97
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,550
<6-7,House>我在想你是不是可以帮个忙
<6-7,House>I was wondering if you could do me a favor.

98
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,070
<6-8,House>唔. 我有...我是伤残人士
<6-8,House>Yeah.I've,uh...I've got a disability.

99
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,340
<6-9,Female cop>这些是超速罚单
<6-9,Female cop>These are speeding tickets.

100
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,720
<6-10,House>有很多急诊
<6-10,House>A lot of emergencies.

101
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,200
<6-10,House>他现在感觉好多了, 但是...世事难料
<6-10,House>He's feeling better now,but...you never know.

102
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,360
<6-11,Female cop>我想想办法
<6-11,Female cop>I'll see what we can do.

103
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,870
<6-12,House>你搭档的位子在哪里?
<6-12,House>Where's your partner sit?

104
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,040
<7-1,Foreman>他家就像是个污水池,但没什么值得一查
<7-1,Foreman>Place is a cesspool,but I don't think I need to test for anything.

105
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,450
<7-2,House>是的, 浪费时间
<7-2,House>Nope,waste of time.

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,310
<7-3,Foreman>你听说大麻的事了?
<7-3,Foreman>You know about the marijuana?

107
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,330
<7-4,House>高中我就听说过了
<7-4,House>I've heard rumors since junior high.

108
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,840
<7-5,Foreman>这个警察表现的很兴奋,因为他确实很兴奋
<7-5,Foreman>The cop's acting high because he is high.

109
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,590
<7-6,House>他得了-- 军团病,（军团菌科细菌导致肺炎）
<7-6,House>He's got--legionnaires' disease.

110
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,870
<7-6,House>Joe中枪是件好事
<7-6,House>It's a good thing joe got shot.

111
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,070
<7-6,House>不然整个警察局会被整垮,街上一片混乱
<7-6,House>The whole precinct would have got wiped out.Anarchy on the streets.

112
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,160
<7-7,Foreman>需要48小时来检测军团病
<7-7,Foreman>Takes 48 hours to test for legionnaire'S.

113
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,260
<7-8,House>如果症状符合,只需要两秒钟就可以看出来
<7-8,House>And only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit

114
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,440
<7-8,House>只要看看空调里腐臭的水
<7-8,House>while staring at the rancid,unchanged water of an ac unit.

115
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,240
<7-9,Foreman>大麻能解释碳氧血红蛋白,肺部阴影及兴奋过度
<7-9,Foreman>Marijuana explains the high carboxy,the cloudy lungs,and the happiness.

116
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,130
<7-10,House>大麻不能解释,为什么他入院以后情况变得更糟
<7-10,House>Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.

117
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,630
<7-10,House>为什么我们不能意见分歧?
<7-10,House>Why don't we agree to disagree?

118
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
<7-10,House>事实上, 还是承认吧, 你不愿同我意见一致
<7-10,House>Actually,why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me

119
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,550
<7-10,House>把他作为军团病治疗?,说了一大通, 但是...
<7-10,House>while treating him for legionnaire's?It's not as pithy,but...

120
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,650
<8-1,Joe>我感觉好多了, 药起作用了
<8-1,Joe>I feel a lot better.The meds are working.

<8-2,Foreman>做深呼吸
<8-2,Foreman>Take some deep breaths.

123
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,680
<8-3,Joe>你看起来很失望
<8-3,Joe>You seem disappointed.

124
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,620
<8-4,Foreman>我很高兴你感觉好多了
<8-4,Foreman>I'm glad you're feeling better.

125
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,330
<8-5,Joe>你对警察有意见?
<8-5,Joe>You got a problem with cops?

126
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,590
<8-6,Foreman>请别说话
<8-6,Foreman>Please don't talk.

127
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,920
<8-7,Joe>照我的经验来看,不喜欢警察的人总有个理由
<8-7,Joe>In my experience,people who just don't like cops have a reason--

128
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,590
<8-8,Foreman>我要你别讲话
<8-8,Foreman>I need you not to talk.

129
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,540
<8-8,Foreman>没有啰音
<8-8,Foreman>No rales.

130

<8-9,Chase>上部本来是阴影的...,我们昨天发现有渗出
<8-9,Chase>these clouded areas of the upperobes...they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.

131
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,780
<8-10,Joe>没有了?
<8-10,Joe>Not there anymore?

132
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,740
<8-11,Chase>正在清理干净,你得过军团菌肺炎
<8-11,Chase>They're clearing up.You had legionnaire'S.

133
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,410
<8-11,Chase>现在好了
<8-11,Chase>Now you don'T.

134
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,880
<8-12,Joe>那么你们没有,唔...在我家里找到什么东西?
<8-12,Joe>So you didn't,um...you didn't find anything at my place?

135
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,150
<8-13,Foreman>没有...医学相关的
<8-13,Foreman>Nothing...medically relevant.

136
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,390
<8-14,Joe>那么...没什么好担心的, 是吧?
<8-14,Joe>So there's,uh...there's nothing I need to worry about,then?

137
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,230
<8-15,Foreman>这次不必担心
<8-15,Foreman>Not this time.

138
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,560
<8-16,Chase>你在做什么?
<8-16,Chase>Whatcha doing?

139
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,710
<8-17,Foreman>我要让他了解病情
<8-17,Foreman>I want to make sure he sees what's involved.

140
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,910
<8-17,Foreman>我们发现病情相当严峻
<8-17,Foreman>What we found was fairly advanced.

141
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,800
<8-17,Foreman>阴影区域在这里, 还有这里
<8-17,Foreman>These cloudy areas here,and here.

<8-17,Foreman>你肺的这些部分运作失常
<8-17,Foreman>These parts of your lungs simply weren't functioning.

143
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,910
<8-18,Joe>现在没有问题了, 对么?
<8-18,Joe>They're okay now,right?

144
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,510
<8-18,Joe>现在一切都正常了?
<8-18,Joe>Everything's okay now?

145
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,800
<9-1,Joe>我很好
<9-1,Joe>I'm fine.

146
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,110
<9-2,Foreman>你失明了
<9-2,Foreman>You're blind.

147
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,520
<9-3,Joe>我撞到了东西. 并不是说我看不见了
<9-3,Joe>I bumped into something.That doesn't mean I can't see.

148
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,580
<9-4,Cameron>我知道这让人恐慌, 但你只认为--
<9-4,Cameron>I'm sure it's frightening,but you only think--

149
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,540
<9-5,Foreman>Cameron医生穿的是什么?
<9-5,Foreman>what's dr. Cameron wearing?

150

<9-6,Joe>深蓝色裤子, 白衬衫. 黑色的鞋
<9-6,Joe>Dark blue pants,white shirt.Black shoes.

151
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,560
<9-7,Foreman>差得不多, 除了裤子, 衬衫, 还有鞋子,你失明了
<9-7,Foreman>Ooh,almost.'Cept for the pants,shirt,and shoes.You're blind.

152
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,950
<10-1,Chase>他真的认为他看得见?
<10-1,Chase>he really thinks he can see?

153
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,350
<10-2,Foreman>他在器质上看的见,只是他的大脑不能处理了
<10-2,Foreman>He can physically see.His brain just can't process it.

154
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,050
<10-3,House>会不会是恶作剧?
<10-3,House>No chance this is a practical joke?

155
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,350
<10-4,Foreman>没可能
<10-4,Foreman>No way.

156

<10-4,Foreman>Anton失明表明两侧枕叶都受到了损伤
<10-4,Foreman>Anton's blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.

157
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,100
<10-5,Cameron>肯定是由于外伤所致
<10-5,Cameron>Must be from the trauma.

158
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,060
<10-6,House>子弹碎片刚刚好击中两片叶的同一处?
<10-6,House>Bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes?

159
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,450
<10-6,House>中风可能引起anton失明还有异常兴奋
<10-6,House>Stroke could cause anton's blindness and euphoria.

<10-6,House>使用肝素稀释血液,找到血块, 把它弄出来
<10-6,House>Start heparin to thin the blood,find the clot,and yank it out.

162
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,460
<10-7,Foreman>血块可能在可能在脊椎动脉两侧的上端
<10-7,Foreman>Clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertibral arteries.

163
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,960
<10-8,House>好极了. Chase...伸进手指,一直摸到你找到为止
<10-8,House>Great.Chase...stick your fingers in there,grope around till you find it.

164
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,740
<10-8,House>哦, 等等...当你把他变成植物人
<10-8,House>Oh,wait...when you turn him into a vegetable,

165
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,910
<10-8,House>就会有一场无关紧要的官司
<10-8,House>then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.

166
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,900
<10-8,House>知道怎么做更好么? ,反差核磁共振
<10-8,House>You know what would be better?Contrast mri.

167
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,270
<10-8,House>有设备吗?
<10-8,House>Do we have one of those?

168
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,630
<10-9,Chase>不能做MRI, 如果子弹碎片是导磁的
<10-9,Chase>You can't do an mri.If the bullet fragment's magnetic,

169
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,320
<10-9,Chase>会移位, 把他的大脑绞碎
<10-9,Chase>they'll move and rip his brain apart.

170
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,590
<10-10,House>嗯, 扔硬币决定吧
<10-10,House>Well,let's flip a coin.

171
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,490
<10-10,House>面朝上, 做MRI; 底朝上, 他就死
<10-10,House>Heads,mri;tails,he dies.

173
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,160
<10-11,Foreman>不会让子弹粉碎, 只会抓住子弹
<10-11,Foreman>that would shatter a bullet,they would just catch it.

174
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,420
<10-11,Foreman>所以, 子弹是自己碎散开的
<10-11,Foreman>So the bullet shattered on its own.

175
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,440
<10-11,Foreman>意味着小脚丫子使用的是,0.38口径中空弹头

176
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,810
<10-11,Foreman>很不幸, 这种子弹是导磁的
<10-11,Foreman>Which,unfortunately,are ferromagnetic.

177
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,860
<10-12,House>你知道这么多, 真的是太酷了
<10-12,House>It's just so cool that you know that.

<10-13,Cameron>可以做一个血管造影找到血块
<10-13,Cameron>We could do an angio to find the clotting.

179
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,080
<10-14,House>浪费时间, 头骨会造出太多伪迹,不会得到一个像样的图像
<10-14,House>Waste of time.The skull creates too much artifact.We'll never get a decent view.

180
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,570
<10-15,Chase>- 比不上mri ,- 而且浪费时间
<10-15,Chase>Next best thing to an mri.--And a waste of time.

181
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,050
<10-17,Foreman>- 血管造影有可能显示 ,- 天哪, 造反了!
<10-17,Foreman>Angio might show--oh,god,it's a coup!

182
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,060
<10-18,House>好吧! 去做你的血管造影
<10-18,House>Fine!Go do your angio.

183
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,480
<10-18,House>浪费完时间后, 我们停尸间见
<10-18,House>When you're do wasting your time,meet me down in the morgue.

185
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,990
<11-1,Cameron>一直通向你的大脑, 这样可以检测到血块
<11-1,Cameron>and up into your brain so we can check for clots.

186
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,310
<11-2,Foreman>整个手术中把这个盖上
<11-2,Foreman>Keep this on throughout the procedure.

187
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,190
<11-2,Foreman>除非大麻已经让你失去生育能力
<11-2,Foreman>Unless the pot's already made you sterile.

188
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,230
<11-3,Joe>我工作压力很大, 你不明白的
<11-3,Joe>I have a stressful job.You got no idea.

189
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,820
<11-4,Foreman>我见多了你这样的警察
<11-4,Foreman>I grew up with cops like you.

190
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,930
<11-4,Foreman>一分流氓, 九分的伪君子
<11-4,Foreman>One part bully,nine parts hypocrite.

191
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,540
<11-5,Cameron>你是怎么搞的?
<11-5,Cameron>what is wrong with you?

192
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,950
<11-6,Foreman>只是找些乐子
<11-6,Foreman>Just having some fun.

193
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,510
<11-7,Cameron>这个人病了而且很害怕
<11-7,Cameron>That man is sick and scared.

194
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,560
<11-8,Foreman>这个人是个不老实的警察
<11-8,Foreman>The man's a crooked cop.

195
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,290
<11-9,Cameron>也许你不应该再接手这个病例, foreman.
<11-9,Cameron>Maybe you should take yourself off the case,foreman.

196
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,420
<11-10,Foreman>不必喜欢某人才可以做他的医生
<11-10,Foreman>Don't have to like someone to be their doctor.

197
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,620
<11-10,Foreman>嘿, 感觉如何, 好伙计?
<11-10,Foreman>Hey,how you doing there,buddy?

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,040
<11-10,Foreman>就躺着别动, 马上会让你复原出院,好让你再把别人吓得屁滚尿流
<11-10,Foreman>Just sit still and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.

199
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,680
<11-10,Foreman>高兴了么?
<11-10,Foreman>Happy?

200
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,950
<12-1,House>血管造影告诉我们什么么?
<12-1,House>What did the angio tell us?

201
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,020
<12-2,Chase>你在找什么?
<12-2,Chase>What are you looking for?

202
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,980
<12-3,House>我给我妈打过电话, 她不接
<12-3,House>I called my mom.She didn't pick up.

203
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,200
<12-3,House>血管造影告诉我们什么?
<12-3,House>What did the angio tell us?

204
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,250
<12-4,Cameron>提示了foreman不应该再接手这个病例
<12-4,Cameron>That foreman should be off this case.

205
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,450
<12-4,Cameron>他是一个神经科专家
<12-4,Cameron>he's a neurologist.

206
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,460
<12-5,House>除非你认为病人的视神经在他的脾脏...
<12-5,House>Unless you think the patient's optic nerve is in his spleen...

207
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,910
<12-6,Cameron>他讨厌警察
<12-6,Cameron>he doesn't like cops.

208
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,510
<12-7,House>foreman, 警察是我们的朋友
<12-7,House>foreman,policemen are our friends.

209
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,440
<12-7,House>如果你和我购物时走散--
<12-7,House>If you and I ever get separated shopping--

210
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,380
<12-8,Foreman>我只是让他老实点
<12-8,Foreman>I was just busting the guy's chops.

211
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,320
<12-8,Foreman>- 明白了? ,- 只是让他老实点
<12-8,Foreman>See?--He was just busting the guy's chops.

212
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,830
<12-9,House>Foreman对于解决这个案例很关键
<12-9,House>Foreman is essential to solving this case.

213
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,040
<12-9,House>医学上讲, 血管造影告诉我们什么?
<12-9,House>Medically,what did the angio tell us?

214
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,990
<12-10,Chase>看起来是有一些血块,可能在威利斯环（脑动脉环）附近
<12-10,Chase>Appears to be some clotting,possibly around the circle of willis.

215
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,560
<12-10,Chase>基于症状的恶化, 血块正在增大
<12-10,Chase>Based on the progression of symptoms,the clot is growing.

216
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,630
<12-10,Chase>要切入--
<12-10,Chase>We need to cut into--

217
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,160
<12-11,House>"像是有血块",就像说"前方有交通堵塞"
<12-11,House>saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.

218
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,080
<12-11,House>是十辆车连环追尾?,抑或是慢吞吞的公车, 驶在中心道上
<12-11,House>Is it a 10-car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane?

219
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,070
<12-11,House>如果是慢公车, 是一辆血栓还是栓塞车?
<12-11,House>And if it is a bus,is it a thrombotic bus of an embolic bus?

220
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,460
<12-11,House>看来我把比喻搞的太隐讳了
<12-11,House>Think I pushed that metaphor too far.

221
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,670
<12-12,Foreman>血管造影无法提供确切信息
<12-12,Foreman>Angio can't tell us that kind of information.

222
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,420
<12-13,House>噢, 所以你承认这只是浪费时间
<12-13,House>Oh,so you're saying it's just a waste of time.

223
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,270
<12-14,Foreman>在不杀死他的情况下给出一定的信息
<12-14,Foreman>It gave us some information without killing him.

224
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,100
<12-15,House>你怎么知道MRI会杀了他?
<12-15,House>You don't know that an mri will kill him.

225
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,890
<12-16,Foreman>子弹以铁成分为主!
<12-16,Foreman>The bullets have a ferrous base!

226
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,760
<12-17,House>小铁片困在他的脑子里面, 不会跑到哪里去的
<12-17,House>Little tiny pieces trapped in his head.They're not going anywhere.

227
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,720
<12-18,Chase>也许值得用手术把碎片移除
<12-18,Chase>maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.

228
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,680
<12-19,House>外科手术不可行,病人正在使用抗凝血剂
<12-19,House>Surgeons say inoperable,or the patient's on blood thinners.

229
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,170
<12-19,House>除此之外, 倒是完美的计划
<12-19,House>Other than that,perfect planning.

230
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,650
<12-20,Cameron>你有更好的办法?
<12-20,Cameron>You got a better plan?

231
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,210
<12-20,Cameron>好的多
<12-20,Cameron>Much.

232
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,600
<12-21,House>子弹和小脚丫子给Joe的那枪一模一样
<12-21,House>Bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped joe with.

233
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,520
<12-21,House>来看看磁性有多大
<12-21,House>Let's see how magnetic it is.

234
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,300
<12-22,Attendant>有人听到一声--
<12-22,Attendant>Did anybody hear a--

235
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,050
<12-23,House>我给了他一枪. 他挂了
<12-23,House>I shot him.He's dead.

236
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,020
<13-1,Cameron>子弹分裂成四片碎片, 没有穿出的伤口
<13-1,Cameron>the bullet split into four fragments,no exit wounds.

237
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,560
<13-2,House>只用了一半的火药量
<13-2,House>Only used a half load of gunpowder.

238
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,080
<13-3,Cameron>拿x光片和mri比较是不准确的
<13-3,Cameron>We won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an mri.

239
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,830
<13-4,House>foreman有多不专业?
<13-4,House>How unprofessional was foreman?

240
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
<13-5,Foreman>和你一样. 他到场了
<13-5,Foreman>As him yourself.He's right here.

241
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,050
<13-6,Cameron>比平常的糟糕. 比你倒好些
<13-6,Cameron>worse than usual.Better than you.

242
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,650
<13-6,Cameron>他指责joe是一个坏警察
<13-6,Cameron>He berated joe for being a bad cop.

243
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,300
<13-7,House>指责还是羞辱?
<13-7,House>Berated or humiliated?

244
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,460
<13-8,Cameron>我不太肯定, 我没有随身带词典
<13-8,Cameron>I'm not sure.I didn't have my thesaurus with me.

245
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,590
<13-9,House>他似乎乐在其中
<13-9,House>One implies that he took pleasure in it.

246
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,700
<13-9,House>我想知道, 是被压抑的气恼, 还是轻佻
<13-9,House>I wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness.

247
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,130
<13-10,Foreman>你认为我得病了么?
<13-10,Foreman>You think I'm sick?

248
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,410
<13-11,House>我觉得正常的反应
<13-11,House>I think that an appropriate response

249
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,870
<13-11,House>看到老板对着尸体开枪, 不该咧嘴傻笑
<13-11,House>to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.

250
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,180
<13-12,Foreman>我烦透了你的神经质,并不能证明任何东西
<13-12,Foreman>But the fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.

251
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,830
<13-13,House>Foreman医生, Chase医生需要你的协助
<13-13,House>Dr. Foreman,dr. Chase requests your assistance.

252
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,300
<13-14,Cuddy>我想象不出你朝尸体开枪,有什么自圆其说的逆向逻辑
<13-14,Cuddy>I can't even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.

253
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,340
<13-15,House>嗯, 如果我朝活人开枪,不就需要多得多的文书工作了
<13-15,House>Well,if I'd shot a live person,there's a lot more paperwork.

254
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,020
<13-16,Cuddy>那么请你在守灵的时候站在棺材旁边
<13-16,Cuddy>Then it won't be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake

255
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,470
<13-16,Cuddy>并解释为什么癌症患者脑袋上有个子弹眼
<13-16,Cuddy>and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?

256
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,560
<13-17,House>这个人把他的身体捐献给了科学
<13-17,House>The man donated his body to science.

257
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,880
<13-17,House>好吧, 这是个悲剧,如果没有开枪, 他的尸体下一年会
<13-17,House>Yes,it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him,his body could have spent the next year

258
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,540
<13-17,House>留给一年级医学生开膛破肚了
<13-17,House>letting first-year med students use the carpool lane.

259
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,380
<13-18,Chase>放好了
<13-18,Chase>He's set.

260
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,350
<13-19,Cuddy>别开机器, house
<13-19,Cuddy>Do not turn that on,house.

261
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,940
<13-20,House>你生气是因为,我把一颗子弹放到他脑袋里面
<13-20,House>You're mad because I put a bullet in his head.

262
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,850
<13-20,House>最坏的结果是, 把子弹再取出来
<13-20,House>At worst,all I'm doing now is taking it out.

263
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,340
<14-1,House>我的错
<14-1,House>My bad.

264
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,060
<14-1,House>他们得, 嗯, 关掉磁体来修理
<14-1,House>They have to,uh,shut down the magnet to fix it.

265
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,200
<15-1,Chase>Mri至少两个星期不能用
<15-1,Chase>Mri is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.

266
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,040
<15-2,House>嗯, 没关系
<15-2,House>Well,it doesn't matter.

267
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,070
<15-2,House>很明显我们不能在这个病人身上用mri
<15-2,House>We obviously can't use it on this patient.

268
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,580
<15-3,Cameron>不能...医院里还有其他的,医生和病人需要用
<15-3,Cameron>no...but there are other doctors in this hospital,and other patients.

269
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,690
<15-4,House>这有助于解释,为什么买的起这些昂贵的设备
<15-4,House>That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment.

270
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,310
<15-4,House>我肯定我尽职了
<15-4,House>I'm sure i'm pulling my weight.

271
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,720
<15-5,Foreman>能不能什么都不做?
<15-5,Foreman>Is doing nothing an option?

272
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,290
<15-5,Foreman>只是说. 也许血块自己会分解掉
<15-5,Foreman>I'm just saying.Maybe the clot will break up on its own.

273
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,940
<15-5,Foreman>傻笑看起来已经消失了
<15-5,Foreman>The giddiness seems to have gone away.

274
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,430
<15-6,Chase>失明没有
<15-6,Chase>The blindness hasn'T.

275
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,860
<15-7,House>用回声波探测他的心脏
<15-7,House>Echo his heart.

276
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,180
<15-8,Cameron>找什么? 很明显问题是神经学上的
<15-8,Cameron>Looking for what?The problem is obviously neurological.

277
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,750
<15-9,House>血块是在他的大脑里面,血块的成因可能不是
<15-9,House>The clots are in his brain.The source of the clots may not be.

278
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,330
<15-9,House>做一个完整的心回波图
<15-9,House>Do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram.

279
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,600
<15-9,House>也许我们会走运,血块是从心脏那里来的
<15-9,House>Maybe we get lucky.Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.

280
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,280
<16-1,Chase>心脏没有问题
<16-1,Chase>heart's clean.

281
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,920
<16-2,Cameron>还能做什么?
<16-2,Cameron>Where else can we look?

282
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,590
<16-3,Chase>可以超声波检查他的腿,查找深度静脉血栓
<16-3,Chase>We could ultrasound his legs,look for a dvt.

283
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,600
<16-3,Chase>请向下移
<16-3,Chase>I need you to move over.

284
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,920
<16-3,Chase>Joe? 你还好吧?
<16-3,Chase>Joe?You okay?

285
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,590
<16-4,Chase>心动过速. 心率150, 还在上升
<16-4,Chase>Tachycardia.Heart rate 150 and rising.

286
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,030
<16-6,Cameron>他在大出血
<16-6,Cameron>He's bleeding out.

287
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,060
<16-7,Foreman>House降低了血液凝结度, 干得不错
<16-7,Foreman>House wanted to thin his blood.Sure did a good job.

288
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,560
<16-8,Cameron>血压轰击, 他要休克了
<16-8,Cameron>Bp's crashing.He's going into shock.

289
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,720
<16-9,Chase>颅内出血. 需要降低脑压
<16-9,Chase>Intracranial bleeding.We need to relieve the pressure.

290
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,240
<16-10,Cameron>需要一个外科小组
<16-10,Cameron>We need a surgical team.

291
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,480
<16-11,Cameron>Foreman, 出去!
<16-11,Cameron>Foreman,get out!

292
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,180
<16-12,Foreman>好么, 他完蛋了!
<16-12,Foreman>boy,is he screwed!

293
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,430
<16-12,Foreman>血液凝结,他是死. 血液抗凝, 他也是死
<16-12,Foreman>We clot his blood,he dies.We thin it,he dies.

294
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,530
<16-12,Foreman>只有我一个人发现这个好玩?
<16-12,Foreman>Am I the only one who finds this funny?

295
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,120
<16-13,Foreman>噢,天哪
<16-13,Foreman>Oh,man.

296
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,570
<17-1,Foreman>我没有病!
<17-1,Foreman>i'm not sick!

297
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,890
<17-2,House>你听说过有人颅内出血
<17-2,House>Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain

298
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,030
<17-2,House>结果需要在脑壳上钻一个洞来降压么,太逗了!
<17-2,House>and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure?Hilarious!

299
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,300
<17-3,Foreman>有人笑了, 就要死了吗? 太荒唐了
<17-3,Foreman>Someone laughs,they're dying?That's absurd.

300
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,640
<17-4,House>但不是好玩的
<17-4,House>But not funny.

301
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,220
<17-5,Foreman>如果我没病,你却把我和病源锁在一起
<17-5,Foreman>If I'm not sick,all you're doing is locking me up with the source.

302
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,590
<17-5,Foreman>我会被传染得病的, 你就能证明你是对的
<17-5,Foreman>I'll get sick,prove you right.

303
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,350
<17-6,House>如果你没有病, 这就不是传染性的.,没什么好担心的
<17-6,House>If you're not sick,it's not contagious.You've got nothing to worry about.

304
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,400
<17-6,House>如果你病了,你们两个就呆在那里,直到我们找出病因
<17-6,House>If you are sick,the two of you are staying in there until we find that why.

305
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,830
<17-6,House>所以你可能要和那头猪交朋友了
<17-6,House>So you might want to make friends with the pig.

306
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,310
<17-6,House>好消息是我又可以做mri了
<17-6,House>Good news is I can finally get my mri.

307
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,410
<17-6,House>不, 你不能!
<17-6,House>No,you can't!

308
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,280
<17-7,Foreman>你把机器搞当机了!
<17-7,Foreman>You blew up the machine!

309
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,210
<17-8,House>不是那台便携式的, 笑笑虎
<17-8,House>Not the portable one,chuckles.

310
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,020
<17-8,House>chase 和cameron 把它带过来,扫描你没有子弹穿孔的脑袋.
<17-8,House>Chase and cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

311
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,690
<17-9,Foreman>去-你去哪里?
<17-9,Foreman>Wh-where are you going?

312
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,130
<17-10,House>去办公室. 有活要干
<17-10,House>To the office.Got work to do.

313
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,540
<17-10,House>你吃饭
<17-10,House>Eat your meals.

314
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,000
<17-10,House>每半个小时测一下体温,还有服下我让你吃的药
<17-10,House>Take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take.

315
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,670
<17-11,Foreman>那现在我是一个普通病人了?
<17-11,Foreman>So I'm just a regular patient now?

316
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,200
<17-11,Foreman>不是
<17-11,Foreman>No.

317
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,680
<17-12,House>你有自个儿专用体温计
<17-12,House>You get your own thermometer.

318
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,960
<18-1,House>检查你们的血液
<18-1,House>Check your blood.

319
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,450
<18-1,House>谁的沉降率上升,就成为foreman的新室友
<18-1,House>Anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be foreman's new roomie.

320
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,350
<18-2,Cameron>他应该参与讨论
<18-2,Cameron>He should be a part of this.

321
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,450
<18-3,House>他是一个病人
<18-3,House>He's a patient.

322
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,130
<18-4,Cameron>- 他没有失去理智,- 他不客观
<18-4,Cameron>He's not irrational.--He's not objective.

323
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,610
<18-6,Cameron>他最有动力来诊断病情
<18-6,Cameron>He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.

324
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,530
<18-7,House>不错, 你和他连朋友都不是,何必要在乎?
<18-7,House>Right,you're not even friends with him.Why would you care?

325
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,140
<18-7,House>扣带回皮层, T2持续衰减
<18-7,House>There's an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex.

326
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,720
<18-8,Chase>有点...模糊
<18-8,Chase>Kind of...mushy.

327
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,830
<18-9,House>扣带回皮质区控制情感
<18-9,House>Cingulate cortex controls emotions.

328
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,200
<18-9,House>模糊解释了异常欣快,问题是, 什么导致了区域模糊?
<18-9,House>This mushy spot explains the euphoria.Question is,what's causing the mush?

329
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,990
<18-10,Cameron>你可能要问神经科专家的问题
<18-10,Cameron>Question you might want to ask a neurologist.

330
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,030
<18-10,Cameron>Foreman是一个自私的混球,但他是一个神经科专家
<18-10,Cameron>Foreman is a selfish jerk,but he's a neurologist,

331
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,720
<18-10,Cameron>这间屋子里唯一一个神经学家
<18-10,Cameron>and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.

332
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,510
<18-11,House>这就是为什么他不能在这里
<18-11,House>This is why he shouldn't be here.

333
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,600
<18-11,House>如果他在这里, 你就不会叫他混球
<18-11,House>You wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.

334
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,100
<18-11,House>他要是在这间屋子里,即使他说错了, 你只能守口如瓶
<18-11,House>If you think he screwed up at that apartnt,you'd keep it to yourself.

335
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,880
<18-12,Cameron>- 不, 我,- 唔, 我们永远不会知道
<18-12,Cameron>No,I--well,we'll never know.

336
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,420
<18-13,House>但只要他不在这里, 他就像其他病人一样
<18-13,House>But as long as he's not here,he's just like any other patient.

337
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,840
<18-13,House>我们可以随意处置他
<18-13,House>Which means we can dumpn him all we want.

338
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,380
<18-13,House>什么在吞噬这个自私的混蛋的大脑?
<18-13,House>What's eating the selfish jerk's brain?

339
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,870
<18-14,Chase>- 西尼罗河病毒还是东方型马脑炎,- 检查foreman的血液
<18-14,Chase>West nile or eastern equine encephalitis--test foreman's blood.

340
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,100
<18-15,House>鉴于他是唯一感染上的人
<18-15,House>Given that he's the only one who got it,

341
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,640
<18-15,House>人到人的传染性不大
<18-15,House>person-to-person transmission is

342
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,880
<18-15,House>可能 foreman在那家伙家中,染上了一些致命的毒物
<18-15,House>less likely than some sort of deadly toxin foreman picked up at the guy's home.

343
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,850
<18-15,House>谁要下个去?
<18-15,House>Who wants to go next?

344
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,780
<18-16,House>你准备牺牲自己,为了一个不把你当成朋友的人
<18-16,House>You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.

345
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,950
<18-17,Cameron>他只是一个病人, 对么?,这是工作
<18-17,Cameron>He's just a patient,right?It's the job.

346
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,630
<18-18,House>嘿...你哪里也不用去
<18-18,House>Hey...you don't have to go anywhere.

347
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,630
<18-18,House>Joe的公寓就在楼下的实验室里面
<18-18,House>Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab.

348
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,040
<18-18,House>Foreman带回来了每样东西的样品
<18-18,House>Foreman brought back samples of everything.

349
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,170
<18-19,Chase>这算什么, "谁要下一个去?"
<18-19,Chase>What was that,"who wants to go next?"

350
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,240
<18-19,Chase>一种...考验么?
<18-19,Chase>Some kind of...test?

351
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,070
<18-20,House>别担心. 你做出了正确的决定
<18-20,House>Don't worry.You made the right call.

352
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,730
<18-20,House>连Foreman都不知不觉地中了招
<18-20,House>Foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing.

353
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,430
<18-20,House>他比你精明多了
<18-20,House>He's way smarter than you are.

354
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,500
<19-1,Foreman>该死的 chase!
<19-1,Foreman>Damn,chase!

355
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,470
<19-1,Foreman>你技术太烂了
<19-1,Foreman>You suck at this.

356
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,510
<19-2,Chase>对不起 怪这身该死的衣服
<19-2,Chase>Sorry,it's this damn suit.

357
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,690
<19-3,Foreman>我自己能搞定 我会把它扔出去的
<19-3,Foreman>I can do it myself.And I'll throw that out.

358
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,820
<19-3,Foreman>核磁共振的结果是什么?
<19-3,Foreman>What'd the mri show?

359
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,730
<19-3,Foreman>我不能参加鉴别诊断,而且连结果都不能知道?
<19-3,Foreman>I can't be a part of the differential,and I can't even know what the differential is?

360
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,910
<19-3,Foreman>换别的病人你都可以说
<19-3,Foreman>You'd tell any other patient what you found out.

361
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,530
<19-4,Chase>核磁共振显示你的扣带皮层有损伤
<19-4,Chase>Mri showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex.

362
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,450
<19-5,Foreman>你怎么看?
<19-5,Foreman>What's the thinking?

363
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,650
<19-6,Chase>毒素首当其冲
<19-6,Chase>Toxins are in the lead.

364
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,310
<19-6,Chase>较低可能是病毒
<19-6,Chase>Viral's a distant second.

365
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,190
<19-7,Foreman>你是否认为那损伤有可能是脓肿?
<19-7,Foreman>Do you think the lesion could be an abscess?

366
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,270
<19-8,Chase>只是块小而软的部分 软过--
<19-8,Chase>It's just a small,soft area,more mush than--

367
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,740
<19-9,Foreman>脑室内层有炎症吗?
<19-9,Foreman>was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?

368
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,090
<19-10,Chase>越来越多的信息显示 是的
<19-10,Chase>There was an increased signal there,yeah.

369
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,410
<19-10,Chase>你怎么想?
<19-10,Chase>What are you thinking?

370
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,320
<19-11,Foreman>葡萄球菌感染
<19-11,Foreman>Staph infection.

371
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,660
<19-11,Foreman>毒素导致神经退变 退变导致损伤
<19-11,Foreman>Toxins lead to neurodegeneration,which causes the lesion.

372
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,840
<19-12,Chase>不会没有发烧症状
<19-12,Chase>Not without a fever.

373
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,330
<19-12,Chase>那个警察就发过烧
<19-12,Chase>The cop had a fever.

374
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,670
<19-13,Foreman>我可能马上就要发烧,或者是他直接传染给我
<19-13,Foreman>Mine could be coming.I could have got it directly from him,

375
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,530
<19-13,Foreman>或是通过他家的一块脏洗碗布
<19-13,Foreman>or a dirty dish towel at his place.

376
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,570
<19-13,Foreman>做omaya管埋入手术,将吗啉恶酮直接释放入大脑
<19-13,Foreman>Give us omaya reservoirs. Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.

377
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,810
<19-13,Foreman>就能治好我们
<19-13,Foreman>And we're cured.

378
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,610
<20-1,Cameron>甲苯 砷及铅的检测都是阴性
<20-1,Cameron>samples tested negative for toluene,arsenic,and lead.

379
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,720
<20-2,House>血液呢?
<20-2,House>what about the blood?

380
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,030
<20-3,Chase>对西尼罗河热和,流行性甲型脑炎病毒呈阴性
<20-3,Chase>Negative for west nile and eastern equine.

381
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,930
<20-4,Cameron>我们必须回到joe的公寓--
<20-4,Cameron>We have to go back to joe's apartment--

382
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,590
<20-5,House>不准去那个地方,直到我们清楚要找什么
<20-5,House>no one goes back to that place till we know what we're looking for.

383
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,640
<20-5,House>弄点警用胶带 将门窗封死
<20-5,House>Get some of that cop tape.Stick it over the doors and the windows.

384
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,490
<20-6,Cameron>我会做足保护措施,感染的机会应该极低
<20-6,Cameron>I'll take all the hazmat precautions.The chance of infection is next to nothing.

385
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,730
<20-7,House>我数学一向不太好
<20-7,House>I was never that great at math.

386
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,890
<20-7,House>但是极低还是大于零, 是吧?
<20-7,House>But next to nothing is...higher than nothing,right?

387
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,530
<20-8,Cameron>他得病不是你的错
<20-8,Cameron>It's not your fault he got sick.

388
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,570
<20-9,Chase>如果我们病了就是他的错了
<20-9,Chase>It would be his fault if we did.

389
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,850
<20-10,House>我们要直接取一个joe的脑样
<20-10,House>We should get a sample directly from joe's brain.

390
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,060
<20-11,Cameron>我们不能做活组织检验
<20-11,Cameron>We can't do a biopsy.

391
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,870
<20-11,Cameron>由于你给他服用肝素,所以出血造成了大面积水肿
<20-11,Cameron>There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.

392
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,130
<20-12,House>嗯 我想这不是追究责任的时候
<20-12,House>Well,I don't think this is the time to be pointing fingers.

393
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,870
<20-12,House>我没给foreman用肝素
<20-12,House>I didn't give foreman any.

394
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,350
<20-13,Chase>你想给foreman做脑组织活体检验?
<20-13,Chase>You want to give foreman a brain biopsy?

395
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,910
<20-14,House>说真的, 谁不想?
<20-14,House>Come on,really,who doesn't?

396
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,940
<20-15,Chase>或许这只是葡萄球菌感染造成的神经退变
<20-15,Chase>This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.

397
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,010
<20-16,House>没有发热症状? 不可能
<20-16,House>Without a fever?Not a chance.

398
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,250
<20-18,House>- Joe发过烧,- 他体内还有军团菌
<20-18,House>Joe had a fever. --He also had legionella.

399
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,310
<20-19,Chase>可能会引起脓肿
<20-19,Chase>The mush might be forming an abscess.

400
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,620
<20-19,Chase>再加上他脑室内层有炎症 这就说得通了
<20-19,Chase>And since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles,it makes sense.

401
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,280
<20-19,Chase>葡萄球菌释放毒素 导致神经退变,造成损伤
<20-19,Chase>The staph releases toxins,causes neurodegeneration,causes a lesion.

402
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,460
<20-20,House>这是在浪费时间
<20-20,House>This is a waste of time.

403
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,860
<20-21,Chase>我们应该将omaya管埋入foreman大脑,并开始启动抗--
<20-21,Chase>We should put an omaya reservoir in foreman's brain and start administering anti--

404
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,270
<20-22,House>如果我要和foreman理论,我或许也会直接找他
<20-22,House>if I'm gonna be arguing with foreman,I may as well do it directly.

405
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,400
<21-1,Foreman>克尼格征阴性
<21-1,Foreman>Kernig's sign,negative.

406
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,710
<21-1,Foreman>布鲁辛斯基征 单阳性
<21-1,Foreman>Brudzinski's sign,single positive.

407
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,730
<21-1,Foreman>病人joe luria 远端及近端手臂痉挛
<21-1,Foreman>Patient joe luria,distal and proximal arm contractures,

408
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,830
<21-1,Foreman>持续4秒
<21-1,Foreman>duration four seconds.

409
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,120
<21-2,House>葡萄球菌感染在皮肤上极为普遍
<21-2,House>Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.

410
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,780
<21-2,House>极为普遍?
<21-2,House>Most commonly?

411
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,340
<21-3,Foreman>你想把我当任何其他病人来治 就来吧
<21-3,Foreman>You wanna treat me like any other patient,do it.

412
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,070
<21-3,Foreman>但我知道姓house的人,从不用“极其普遍” 这个词
<21-3,Foreman>But the house I know never uses phrases like "most commonly."

413
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,920
<21-4,House>你不再笑了
<21-4,House>You're not laughing anymore.

414
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,310
<21-4,House>不
<21-4,House>No.

415
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,140
<21-5,Foreman>你认为这是好事?
<21-5,Foreman>Think that's a good thing?

416
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,380
<21-6,House>有点怀疑
<21-6,House>Sorta doubt it.

417
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:43,100
<21-6,House>葡萄球菌在到达你大脑前,会先进入你的心脏 肺 脾 肝 或肾
<21-6,House>Staph would be in your heart,lungs,spleen,liver,or kidneys before it gets to your brain.

418
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,420
<21-6,House>你的器官没有被感染,并非是葡萄球菌
<21-6,House>Your organs are clear.It's not staph.

419
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,850
<21-7,Foreman>感染可能只限于脑部脓肿
<21-7,Foreman>The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.

420
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,170
<21-8,House>你的核磁共振结果就应看得出来
<21-8,House>Which I would have seen in your mri.

421
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,730
<21-8,House>签个字 这样我才能取一块你的脑样
<21-8,House>Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.

422
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,340
<21-9,Foreman>让我看看核磁共振的结果
<21-9,Foreman>Let me see the mri.

423
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,540
<21-10,House>片子上没有显示脓肿
<21-10,House>There was no abscess on the image.

424
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,030
<21-11,Foreman>那就让我看看
<21-11,Foreman>Let me see it,then.

425
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,620
<21-12,House>我比较喜欢你笑嘻嘻的
<21-12,House>I liked you better when you were jolly.

426
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,560
<21-13,Foreman>这是一小时前的片子
<21-13,Foreman>Mri was taken over an hour ago.

427
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,160
<21-13,Foreman>柔软部分现在可能已经成了脓肿
<21-13,Foreman>That soft spot could now be an abscess.

428
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,870
<21-14,House>如果是葡萄球菌 你应该在发烧,但你没有!
<21-14,House>If it was staph,you'd have a fever.Which you don't!

429
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,250
<21-15,Foreman>101.6.
<21-15,Foreman>101.6.

430
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,610
<21-16,House>哪个笨蛋给你的?
<21-16,House>What idiot gave you that?

431
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,310
<21-17,Foreman>在我颅内埋入omaya管,就当葡萄球菌那么治
<21-17,Foreman>Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.

432
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,090
<22-1,Foreman>三角
<22-1,Foreman>triangle.

433
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,850
<22-2,Chase>这个呢?
<22-2,Chase>this one?

434
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,650
<22-3,Foreman>嗯 圆圈
<22-3,Foreman>Uh...circle.

435
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,020
<22-4,Chase>下一个
<22-4,Chase>Next.

436
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,880
<22-6,Chase>Foreman为什么不回答 有问题吗?
<22-6,Chase>Foreman,why aren't you answering?Is there a problem?

437
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,260
<22-7,Foreman>嗯 正...正方形
<22-7,Foreman>Uh,s-square.

438
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,880
<22-8,House>告诉我你的生日
<22-8,House>tell me your date of birth.

439
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,440
<22-9,Foreman>- 是house吗?,- 是的 下一个
<22-9,Foreman>Is that house?--yeah. Next.

440
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
<22-11,Foreman>还是正方形 他怎么在这儿?
<22-11,Foreman>A square again.Why is he here?

441
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,140
<22-12,House>因为我的神经专家正在接受手术
<22-12,House>Because my neurologist is having surgery.

442
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,930
<22-13,Foeman>我想我此刻只是个病人
<22-13,Foeman>Thought I was just another patient.

443
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,830
<22-14,House>你不相信那屁话 是吧?
<22-14,House>You didn't believe that crap,did you?

444
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,080
<22-14,House>生日
<22-14,House>Date of birth.

445
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,750
<22-15,Foreman>将omaya管埋植在顶叶里
<22-15,Foreman>The omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.

446
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,240
<22-15,Foreman>我的空间认知会受影响 而非我的记忆
<22-15,Foreman>My spatial recognition is the issue,not my memory.

447
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,350
<22-16,House>你在说omaya?
<22-16,House>Did you say omaya?

448
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,050
<22-16,House>我发誓你说的是活组织检测
<22-16,House>I could have sworn you said biopsy.

449
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,260
<22-16,House>嘿 我正在扰乱你的脑袋
<22-16,House>Hey,I'm just messing with your head.

450
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,310
<22-16,House>请说出你母亲婚前的名字
<22-16,House>Mother's maiden name,please.

451
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,850
<22-17,Foreman>别动我的颞叶, house
<22-17,Foreman>Get out of my temporal lobe,house.

452
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,430
<23-1,Joe>有人吗?
<23-1,Joe>Hello?

453
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,960
<23-1,Joe>醒了吗?
<23-1,Joe>Are you awake?

454
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,540
<23-1,Joe>他们说有人得了和我一样的病
<23-1,Joe>They told me somebody was sick like me.

455
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,480
<23-2,Foreman>我醒了
<23-2,Foreman>I'm up.

456
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,170
<23-3,Joe>你的声音...
<23-3,Joe>Your voice...

457
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,250
<23-3,Joe>你不是我的大夫吗?
<23-3,Joe>aren't you my doctor?

458
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,530
<23-4,Foreman>不再是了
<23-4,Foreman>Not anymore.

459
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,430
<23-5,Joe>你是那个不喜欢警察的家伙
<23-5,Joe>You're the guy who doesn't like cops.

460
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,330
<23-6,Foreman>是的
<23-6,Foreman>Yeah.

461
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,100
<23-7,Joe>你看得见吗?
<23-7,Joe>Can you see?

462
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,500
<23-8,Foreman>你看不到?
<23-8,Foreman>You can't?

463
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,630
<23-9,Joe>什么都看不到
<23-9,Joe>Not a thing.

464
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,940
<23-10,Foreman>你失明过一段时间
<23-10,Foreman>You've been blind a while.

465
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,880
<23-10,Foreman>现在你意识到这个事实了...
<23-10,Foreman>The fact that you're aware of it now...

466
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,470
<23-10,Foreman>可能是好的征兆
<23-10,Foreman>it could be a sign of improvement.

467
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,820
<23-11,Joe>很痛 不是吗?
<23-11,Joe>It hurts so much.Doesn't it?

468
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,230
<23-12,Foreman>我还好
<23-12,Foreman>I'm okay.

469
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,810
<23-13,Joe>就会痛的
<23-13,Joe>It's gonna hurt.

470
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,310
<23-13,Joe>我的吗啡快失效了
<23-13,Joe>The morphine barely takes the edge off.

471
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,270
<23-13,Joe>我快死了 是吗?
<23-13,Joe>I'm gonna die,aren't I?

472
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,680
<23-14,Foreman>你死 我亡 这都不会发生
<23-14,Foreman>You die,I die.It's not gonna happen.

473
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,680
<23-15,Joe>为什么不会?
<23-15,Joe>Why not?

474
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,290
<23-15,Joe>你太顽固了所以死不了?
<23-15,Joe>You're just too stubborn to die?

475
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,130
<23-16,Foreman>他们取了我的脑样
<23-16,Foreman>They took a piece of my brain.

476
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,710
<23-16,Foreman>不管我们得的是什么病...,他们都会找出来的
<23-16,Foreman>Whatever's wrong with us...they'll find.

477
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,340
<23-17,Joe>你相信祈祷吗?
<23-17,Joe>Do you believe in prayer?

478
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,160
<23-18,Foreman>并不真的相信
<23-18,Foreman>Not really.

479
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,060
<23-19,Joe>我也是
<23-19,Joe>Neither do I.

480
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,080
<23-19,Joe>我爸爸常祈祷
<23-19,Joe>My dad always prays.

481
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,410
<23-20,Foreman>我爸也是
<23-20,Foreman>So does mine.

482
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,000
<23-21,Joe>想试试吗?
<23-21,Joe>Do you wanna try it?

483
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,760
<23-21,Joe>试着祈祷?
<23-21,Joe>Try prayin'?

484
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,790
<23-22,Foreman>好吧
<23-22,Foreman>Okay.

485
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,660
<23-23,Wilson>他怎么样?
<23-23,Wilson>How is he?

486
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,560
<23-24,House>依然没得救
<23-24,House>Still dying.

487
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,310
<23-25,Wilson>看来你已经练就了另一门技术, 也不错
<23-25,Wilson>Well,you've almost mastered another skill,though.That's good.

488
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,450
<23-26,Chase>Foreman活检测的结果
<23-26,Chase>Foreman's biopsy results.

489
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,010
<23-26,Chase>没有发炎症状
<23-26,Chase>Non-specific signs of inflammation.

490
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,030
<23-27,House>就这些?
<23-27,House>That's it?

491
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,190
<23-28,Chase>我们还做了葡萄球菌化验 阴性,他甚至不是携带者
<23-28,Chase>We also swabbed for staph.Negative.He's not even a carrier.

492
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,610
<23-29,House>嗯 至少foreman也错了
<23-29,House>Well,at least foreman was wrong too.

493
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,310
<23-30,Wilson>是的 如此而已
<23-30,Wilson>Yeah,there's that.

494
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,750
<23-31,Cameron>我现在能去joe的公寓吗?
<23-31,Cameron>Can I go to joe's apartment now?

495
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,120
<23-31,Cameron>不
<23-31,Cameron>No.

496
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,460
<23-32,House>回实验室去
<23-32,House>Go back to the lab.

497
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,350
<23-32,House>重新检测foreman收集到的所有样本
<23-32,House>Start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.

498
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,260
<23-33,Chase>检测什么
<23-33,Chase>For what?

499
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,400
<23-33,Chase>一切
<23-33,Chase>Everything.

500
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,100
<23-34,House>细菌 毒素 真菌,一切喜爱侵食大脑的东西
<23-34,House>Bacteria,toxins,fungus.Anything that likes to feast on brain.

501
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,660
<23-35,Chase>那有上千种--
<23-35,Chase>That's thousands of--

502
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,990
<12-20,Cameron>最好快点
<12-20,Cameron>better hurry.

503
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,680
<23-36,House>Cameron换衣服,你去盯住foreman
<23-36,House>Cameron,suit up.You're gonna monitor foreman.

504
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,680
<23-36,House>他就会手痉挛 不久会陷入anton失明
<23-36,House>He's on to hand contractures.He'll be in anton's blindness soon.

505
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,320
<23-36,House>每小时检查一次 因为当他失明时,他将无法告诉我们
<23-36,House>Run hourly checks,because when he does go blind,he won't be able to tell us.

506
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,150
<23-36,House>用现有数据做一个时间表,这样就能知道他和joe发病的时间间隔
<23-36,House>We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is.

507
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,880
<23-37,House>你怎么还在这儿?
<23-37,House>Why are you still here?

508
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,540
<23-38,Wilson>你变谨慎了
<23-38,Wilson>You're being cautious.

509
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,220
<23-38,Wilson>你变得...像常人了
<23-38,Wilson>You're being...common.

510
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,950
<23-38,Wilson>当你不再说那些屁话--
<23-38,Wilson>When you don't give a crap about--

511
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,670
<23-39,House>你手下有谁从病人那里感染了癌症?
<23-39,House>how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?

512
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,330
<23-39,House>真发生这种事的时候说一声,到时我们再聊这话题
<23-39,House>Let me know when that happens.Then we can have this conversation.

513
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,610
<23-40,Wilson>不过是又一个病例 嗯?
<23-40,Wilson>It's just another case,huh?

514
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,650
<23-41,House>我敢打赌,你就算不做任何措施
<23-41,House>Gee,I bet you can even have unprotected sex

515
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,470
<23-41,House>和你的癌症病人发生性关系,也不会被传染什么病
<23-41,House>with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing.

516
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,710
<23-41,House>老兄 我希望做你个工作
<23-41,House>Boy,I wish I had your job.

517
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,990
<24-1,Cameron>活组织检测没有任何结论
<24-1,Cameron>Biopsy showed nothing.

518
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,220
<24-2,Foreman>怎么会没有? 你们切了一块我的脑
<24-2,Foreman>How can there be nothing?You cut out a piece of my brain.

519
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,060
<24-3,Cameron>没有丝毫个人恩怨,我们只是什么都没找到
<24-3,Cameron>It's nothing personal.We just didn't find anything.

520
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,300
<24-4,Foreman>看在上帝的份上,能不能给他加大吗啡的剂量
<24-4,Foreman>Can you up his morphine for god's sake?

521
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,430
<24-5,Cameron>已经是最大剂量了 每小时20毫克
<24-5,Cameron>He's already maxed out,20 milligrams per hour.

522
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,950
<24-6,Foreman>毒素检测呢?
<24-6,Foreman>What about toxins?

523
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,120
<24-7,Cameron>所有都是阴性
<24-7,Cameron>Everything was negative.

524
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,290
<24-8,Foreman>炉子上有个橱柜 你们检查过吗?
<24-8,Foreman>There was a cupboard above the stove.Did you see it?

525
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,330
<24-8,Foreman>我还没检查完所有的食物,但可能是李氏杆菌病
<24-8,Foreman>I didn't check all the food,but could be listeriosis.

526
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,010
<24-9,Cameron>我们没回去过 往右看
<24-9,Cameron>We didn't go back.Follow right.

527
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,060
<24-10,Foreman>谁去了?
<24-10,Foreman>Who did?

528
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,340
<24-11,Cameron>House说我们不应该去 太危险了
<24-11,Cameron>House said we shouldn't go.Too dangerous.

529
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,270
<24-12,Foreman>答案就在那公寓里 不去才真危险!
<24-12,Foreman>The answer's gotta be in that apartment.Not going is too dangerous!

530
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,220
<24-13,Cameron>对不起
<24-13,Cameron>I'm sorry.

531
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,140
<24-14,Foreman>你运气好
<24-14,Foreman>You're thankful.

532
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,650
<24-14,Foreman>如果house指派的是你而不是我,现在在这儿的就是你了
<24-14,Foreman>If house would have pointed at you instead of me,you'd be the one in here.

533
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,470
<24-15,Cameron>直视前方 能看见就告诉我--
<24-15,Cameron>Look straight forward,tell me when you can see--

534
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,830
<24-16,Foreman>回那儿是你的职责! 你是个医生!,哪里有疾病你就要去哪里
<24-16,Foreman>it's your job to go back!You're a doctor!You go where the disease is!

535
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,640
<24-17,Cameron>你看到光就告诉我
<24-17,Cameron>Say when you can see the light.

536
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,040
<24-18,Foreman>我就要死了,而你坐在这儿测我的反应速度?
<24-18,Foreman>I'm dying,and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?

537
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,450
<24-19,Cameron>你看到光请告诉我!
<24-19,Cameron>Tell me when you can see the light!

538
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,200
<24-20,Foreman>我视力没问题!
<24-20,Foreman>My vision's fine!

539
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,950
<25-1,Cameron>你左边的视野缩小了
<25-1,Cameron>Your left-side periphery is reduced.

540
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,940
<25-2,Foreman>这没什么 我证明给你看
<25-2,Foreman>It's fine,I'll prove it.

541
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,000
<25-3,Cameron>噢!够娘养的!
<25-3,Cameron>Ow! Son of a bitch!

542
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,690
<25-4,Foreman>现在你我一样了
<25-4,Foreman>Now we're both exposed.

543
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,850
<25-4,Foreman>你有两个选择
<25-4,Foreman>You got two choices.

544
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,420
<25-4,Foreman>你可以去告诉house刚发生的事,然后在这儿得到一个床位
<25-4,Foreman>You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here,

545
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,590
<25-4,Foreman>或者你回去趟那公寓...
<25-4,Foreman>or you can go back to that apartment...

546
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,950
<25-4,Foreman>去救我 救警察 还有你自己
<25-4,Foreman>you save me,the cop,and yourself.

547
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,220
<25-4,Foreman>不是sspe（罕见亚急性硬化性脑炎）,我查过你给joe注射过的疫苗 无一组相配
<25-4,Foreman>it's not sspe.I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.No batch matches.

548
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,010
<26-1,Chase>血液显示有柯萨奇病毒抗体吗?
<26-1,Chase>Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?

549
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,510
<26-2,Foreman>伙计们 能让他闭嘴吗?
<26-2,Foreman>Guys,could you please shut him up?

550
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,750
<26-3,Chase>他的吗啡用量超极限了
<26-3,Chase>He's over his limit on morphine.

551
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,890
<26-4,House>cameron去哪了?
<26-4,House>Where's cameron?

552
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,600
<26-5,Chase>她说有事要做 她说很快就回来
<26-5,Chase>She said she has some stuff to do.Said she'd be back soon.

553
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,950
<27-2,Chase>你在干什么?
<27-2,Chase>what are you doing?

554
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,250
<27-3,House>Foreman!
<27-3,House>Foreman!

555
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,230
<27-4,Joe>停下!我受不了了
<27-4,Joe>Stop!I can't take it!

556
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,670
<27-3,House>想象不断地被提醒...你即将承受的痛苦
<27-3,House>Imagine being constantly reminded of the...pain you're about to be in.

557
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,440
<27-4,Joe>我受不了了 停下! 停下! 停下 停下!
<27-4,Joe>I can't take it!Stop it! Stop it!Stop it,stop it.

558
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,740
<27-5,Chase>大静脉的吗啡进入他的颈动脉,会导致他心跳停止
<27-5,Chase>Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!

559
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,000
<27-6,House>也能减轻痛苦导致的心肌病
<27-6,House>So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.

560
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,140
<27-6,House>- 他不是被吗啡杀死就是被痛死,- 你容忍这样的行为?!
<27-6,House>Either the morphine kills him or the pain does. --You're condoning this?!

561
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,030
<27-8,House>我肯定不会进去阻止他
<27-8,House>I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.

562
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,500
<28-1,Foreman>这会让你好受些
<28-1,Foreman>That'll make you feel better.

563
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,610
<28-1,Foreman>Joe有新症状 痛觉过敏
<28-1,Foreman>Joe has a new symptom.Hyperalgesia.

564
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,390
<28-1,Foreman>感染已经扩散到大脑的痛觉神经
<28-1,Foreman>The infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.

565
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,590
<28-1,Foreman>停下来! 停下来!
<28-1,Foreman>Make it stop!Make it stop!

566
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,270
<28-1,Foreman>他的大脑告诉他他全身都处于痛苦当中
<28-1,Foreman>His brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain,

567
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,300
<28-1,Foreman>而由于其位置 止痛药不起作用
<28-1,Foreman>and because of the location,the painkillers do nothing.

568
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,190
<28-1,Foreman>换衣服 在痛感杀死他之前把他弄晕
<28-1,Foreman>Suit up.Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.

569
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,790
<28-1,Foreman>若他用香柏掩盖大麻的气味呢?
<28-1,Foreman>What if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?

570
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,650
<33-1,Foreman>出芽短梗霉菌能在那儿生长
<33-1,Foreman>Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.

571
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,460
<33-2,House>你发现雪松了吗?
<33-2,House>Did you find any cedarwood anywhere?

572
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,010
<33-3,Foreman>没有 但或许--,或许什么?
<33-3,Foreman>No,but maybe--maybe what?

573
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,450
<33-3,Foreman>或许有人回去一趟 再检查一遍?
<33-3,Foreman>Maybe somebody could go back,take a second look?

574
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,420
<33-4,House>为什么当你生命悬而未知时
<33-4,House>And why aren't you pissed off that cameron's playing hooky

575
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,960
<33-4,House>你没因为cameron擅离职守而恼怒?
<33-4,House>while your life hangs in the balance?

576
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,650
<34-1,House>为什么不再有人听我的话了?
<34-1,House>Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?

577
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,880
<34-2,Cameron>我认为你错了
<34-2,Cameron>I decided you were wrong.

578
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,250
<34-3,House>天 你是笨蛋
<34-3,House>God,you're weak.

579
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,190
<34-3,House>有人剽窃了你的论文...
<34-3,House>Guy steals your article...

580
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,580
<34-3,House>告诉你你不是他的朋友...
<34-3,House>tells you you're not his friend...

581
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,590
<34-3,House>而你仍想为他拿性命去冒险
<34-3,House>and you still want to risk your life for him.

582
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,070
<35-1,Cameron>Foreman拿用过的针扎了我一下
<35-1,Cameron>Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.

583
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,270
<35-3,Cameron>是的
<35-3,Cameron>Yeah.

584
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,700
<35-4,House>天 你真蠢 有人想杀你
<35-4,House>God,you're weak.Guy tried to kill you.

585
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,940
<35-4,House>如果是我第一件要做的事就是,把那一下扎回来 开枪打他
<35-4,House>First thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back.Shoot him.

586
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,010
<35-4,House>我抽屉里有把枪
<35-4,House>I've got a gun in my desk.

587
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,160
<35-4,House>最不想做的就是,跟自己的老板撒谎
<35-4,House>Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it

588
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,390
<35-4,House>然后顺着那个混蛋的心意
<35-4,House>and then give the bastard everything he wanted.

589
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,560
<35-5,Cameron>我来这儿不是为了foreman,是为了救我自己
<35-5,Cameron>I'm not here for foreman.I'm here to save myself.

590
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,040
<35-6,House>即使被针刺了,你受感染的机率也很低
<35-6,House>even with a needle stick,your chances of infection are pretty slim.

591
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,090
<35-6,House>所以你还穿防护服
<35-6,House>That's why you're wearing the suit.

592
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,070
<35-6,House>你想到这儿来
<35-6,House>You wanted to be here.

593
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,890
<35-6,House>他只不过给了你借口
<35-6,House>He just gave you the excuse.

594
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,990
<35-6,House>那小子要怎么做才能让你恨他?
<35-6,House>What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?

595
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,150
<36-1,House>把袋子给我
<36-1,House>Give me the bag.

596
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,210
<36-2,Cameron>- 发霉的洗碗布,- 再做一次葡萄球菌测试
<36-2,Cameron>Mildewed dish towel.--To retest for staph.

597
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,680
<36-3,House>那是什么 老鼠的排泄物?
<36-3,House>What is that,mouse droppings?

598
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,040
<36-4,Cameron>仓鼠的排泄物 可能携带蛔虫,可以解释失明
<36-4,Cameron>Hamster droppings.Could carry toxocara.Explain the blindness.

599
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,650
<36-5,House>那看着像炉渣的东西呢
<36-5,House>Now,that I recognize as oven crud.

600
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,160
<36-6,Cameron>可能是带有旋毛虫的肉 可以解释高烧
<36-6,Cameron>Could be meat with trichinella.Would explain the high fever.

601
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,210
<36-7,House>黑麦面包上有什么?
<36-7,House>What's with rye bread?

602
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,890
<36-8,Cameron>霉变可能导致麦角中毒,这可以解释痉挛
<36-8,Cameron>Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning,which would explain the contractures.

603
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,270
<36-9,House>- 有三块,- 所以?
<36-9,House>There are three loaves.--So?

604
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,810
<36-11,House>你要再进去一次
<36-11,House>You're going back in there.

605
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,310
<37-1,House>靠外带皮萨过活的人,不会买三块黑面包
<37-1,House>Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.

606
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,510
<37-1,House>那未免也想得太远了
<37-1,House>That's looking too far into the future.

607
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,240
<37-1,House>除非那不是拿来自己吃的
<37-1,House>Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.

608
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,560
<37-1,House>你到屋顶了吗?
<37-1,House>You on the roof yet?

609
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,240
<37-1,House>是的 在上面了 没看到任何鸟
<37-1,House>Yeah,I'm here. I don't see any birds.

610
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,300
<37-1,House>吹口哨或什么的
<37-1,House>Whistle or something.

611
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,900
<39-1,Cameron>招招鸟什么的
<39-1,Cameron>Do that come hither thing.

612
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,220
<39-2,House>他们来得很快因为这是它们的行为模式
<39-2,House>they came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.

613
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,720
<39-2,House>Joe一直喂它们
<39-2,House>Joe's been feeding them.

614
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,420
<39-2,House>现在往下看 看到鸽粪了吗?
<39-2,House>Now look down.You see a river of pigeon turd?

615
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,920
<39-3,Cameron>嗯... 没有 几乎什么都没有
<39-3,Cameron>Uh...no.There's barely any.

616
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,940
<39-4,House>不奇怪 因为它便宜
<39-4,House>It's not weird,it's cheap.

617
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,270
<39-4,House>Joe是个投机取巧的人
<39-4,House>Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.

618
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,820
<39-4,House>没准还从邻居家偷有线电视
<39-4,House>Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.

619
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,630
<40-1,House>为什么就不能从“长翅膀的老鼠”,那儿偷肥料?
<40-1,House>Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?

620
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,140
<40-1,House>你看到铁铲或簸箕了吗?
<40-1,House>You see a shovel or a dustpan?

621
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,650
<40-2,Cameron>嗯 找到一个刮刀 看起来是用过的
<40-2,Cameron>Mmm,found a scraper.Looks used.

622
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,010
<40-2,Cameron>在一个小桶上
<40-2,Cameron>Sitting on a bucket.

623
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:42,780
<40-3,House>桶里全是鸽屎,新型隐球菌绝佳的繁殖地
<40-3,House>Bucket full of pigeon crap.Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.

624
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,640
<40-3,House>是啊
<40-3,House>Yep.

625
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,560
<40-5,House>真菌通过蝶窦进入大脑
<40-5,House>Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus,

626
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,270
<40-5,House>在那儿造成三重威胁 欣快 失明,及无法控制的疼痛
<40-5,House>where it dances its triple threat of happiness,blindness,and intractable pain.

627
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,040
<40-5,House>希望这次经历让我们的警察得到教训
<40-5,House>Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.

628
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,250
<40-5,House>种大麻的时候别不舍得下本钱,我在屋里等你
<40-5,House>Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.See you back home.

629
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,750
<40-6,Foreman>我去过那儿
<40-6,Foreman>I was there.

630
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,690
<40-6,Foreman>我应该早就发现的
<40-6,Foreman>I should have found it.

631
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,030
<40-7,Chase>是啊 你本可以为我们节省很多时间
<40-7,Chase>Yeah,you could have saved us a lot of time.

632
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,410
<40-8,Foreman>给我准备两性霉素B和氟胞嘧啶
<40-8,Foreman>Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.

633
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,370
<40-8,Foreman>我们同时开始治疗
<40-8,Foreman>I'll start us both.

634
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,600
<40-9,Chase>我在等实验室确认,house那儿还没有消息
<40-9,Chase>I was waiting for lab confirmation.Haven't heard from house yet.

635
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,760
<40-10,Foreman>看他的脑电图
<40-10,Foreman>Look at his eeg.

636
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,210
<40-10,Foreman>自从我们把他弄晕后,θ波越来越强
<40-10,Foreman>Theta band's been increasing steadily since--since we put him under.

637
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,780
<40-10,Foreman>他昏迷却依然处在疼痛中
<40-10,Foreman>Guy's unconscious,but still in pain.

638
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,900
<40-11,Chase>那个波可以有很多种解释
<40-11,Chase>Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.

639
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,440
<40-12,Foreman>其中之一就是疼痛
<40-12,Foreman>One of which is pain.

640
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,030
<40-12,Foreman>他不叫了让我们觉得舒服多了,他未必舒服
<40-12,Foreman>The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better,not necessarily him.

641
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,020
<40-13,Foreman>Chase, cameron怎么样?
<40-13,Foreman>Chase!How's cameron?

642
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,970
<40-14,Chase>她没有发昏
<40-14,Chase>She's not giddy.

643
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,030
<41-1,Chase>烧退了 白细胞也有好转
<41-1,Chase>Fever's down.White count's improving.

644
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,160
<41-2,Foreman>她对你说了什么吗?
<41-2,Foreman>Has she said anything to you?

645
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,660
<41-3,Chase>你指像“我完全理解foreman为何这样做,我并不恨他” 这样的话?
<41-3,Chase>You mean like,"I completely understand why foreman did what he did,and I hold no grudge?"

646
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,510
<41-4,Foreman>我所做的...挽救了我的生命
<41-4,Foreman>What I did...did save my life.

647
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,440
<41-4,Foreman>近来帮忙 别管无菌衣了!
<41-4,Foreman>Get in here and help!Forget the suit!

648
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,010
<42-1,Foreman>心动过速! 波形宽而多变,像是室性心动过速!
<42-1,Foreman>He's tachycardic!Wide-complex looks like v-tach!

649
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,410
<42-2,Cameron>不是隐球菌!
<42-2,Cameron>It's not cryptococcus!

650
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,460
<42-4,Cameron>- 什么?,- House错了, 样本呈阴性
<42-4,Cameron>What?--House was wrong.The samples were negative.

651
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,160
<42-5,Foreman>那么是什么?
<42-5,Foreman>So what is it?

652
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,680
<42-7,Chase>- 不知道!,- 给他注胺碘酮
<42-7,Chase>We don't know!--Give him in the amio.

653
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,130
<42-8,Foreman>还有别的线索么?
<42-8,Foreman>Do we have any more leads?

654
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,950
<42-9,Cameron>那就是了! Foreman!
<42-9,Cameron>that was our lead!Foreman!

655
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,670
<42-11,Foreman>所以治疗不起作用
<42-11,Foreman>So the treatment isn't doing anything.

656
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,030
<42-13,Cameron>Foreman! 他心室纤维式颤动
<42-13,Cameron>Foreman!He's in v-fib!

657
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,120
<42-14,Chase>没反应 再一次
<42-14,Chase>No good.Hit him again.

658
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,070
<42-15,Foreman>别这样 拜托 joe
<42-15,Foreman>Come on,man.Come on,joe.

659
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,370
<42-16,Cameron>再一次!
<42-16,Cameron>Hit him again!

660
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,990
<42-17,Chase>注射肾上腺素
<42-17,Chase>give him an amp of epi!

661
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,530
