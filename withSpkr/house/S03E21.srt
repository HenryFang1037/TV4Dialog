1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,580
<1-1,CLAUDIA>看见他时 不要害怕 好吗?
<1-1,CLAUDIA>try not to be scared when you see him,okay?

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,140
<1-2,MATTY>妈妈 我见过他病的样子
<1-2,MATTY>Mom,I've seen him sick.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,740
<1-2,MATTY>我不害怕
<1-2,MATTY>I'm not scared.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,980
<1-3,CLAUDIA>这次不一样
<1-3,CLAUDIA>This time's different.

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,600
<1-4,CLAUDIA>他化疗和放疗的量都加大了...
<1-4,CLAUDIA>The doctors gave himan extra course of radiati and chemo--

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,640
<1-5,MATTY>我知道
<1-5,MATTY>I know.

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,110
<1-6,CLAUDIA>你知道我们多么以你为荣 对吧?
<1-6,CLAUDIA>And you understand how proud we are of you,right?

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,590
<1-7,MATTY>手套 口罩
<1-7,MATTY>Gloves, mask.

9
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,670
<1-8,CLAUDIA>matty.
<1-8,CLAUDIA>Matty

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,140
<1-9,SCOTT>你说想在动手术前见见你的哥哥
<1-9,SCOTT>You said you wanted to see your brother before the procedure.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,390
<1-10,NICK>我知道我看起来像个外星人
<1-10,NICK>I know I look like an alien,

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,880
<1-10,NICK>但我保证不会吃掉你的脑袋
<1-10,NICK>but I promise not to eat your brain.

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,740
<1-11,MATTY>这一切结束之后 你会回来和我玩吗?
<1-11,MATTY>When this is done, will you be able to play out back with me?

14
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,500
<1-12,NICK>我会击中所有你抛进好球区的球
<1-12,NICK>I'll rip anything you put near the strike zone.

15
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,520
<1-13,WILSON>我们去抽骨髓 让你的哥哥休息一会儿
<1-13,WILSON>let your brother rest up while we take some of your marrow.

16
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,360
<1-14,WILSON>你不需要呆在隔离室里
<1-14,WILSON>You don't need to be in an isolation room,

17
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,230
<1-14,WILSON>但我特地把你安排到了你哥哥隔壁房间
<1-14,WILSON>but I pulled some strings so you'd be next door to your brother.

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,450
<1-15,MATTY>我会错过多少比赛?
<1-15,MATTY>How many games will I miss?

19
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,140
<1-16,WILSON>你只需在这里呆一个晚上
<1-16,WILSON>Well,you only have to be here overnight,

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,540
<1-16,WILSON>但你要好好休息一段时间
<1-16,WILSON>but you do have to take it easy for a little bit.

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,190
<1-17,MATTY>- 我已经错过了两场,- Matty
<1-17,MATTY>- I already missed two.,- Matty.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
<1-18,CLAUDIA>我了解 没关系的
<1-18,CLAUDIA>I know.It's okay.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,490
<1-19,WILSON>肯定拖后退了
<1-19,WILSON>Must've been a drag.

24
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,930
<1-19,WILSON>只是要确认你没有受到任何感染
<1-19,WILSON>We just had to make sure you weren't exposed to any bugs.

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,700
<1-19,WILSON>你健康的骨髓,才能治愈你哥哥的白血病...
<1-19,WILSON>Because your healthy bone marrow is what's gonna cure your brother's leukemia--

26
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,170
<1-19,WILSON>他打喷嚏了
<1-19,WILSON>he sneezed.

27
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,810
<3-1,CHASE>也许只是过敏
<3-1,CHASE>Maybe it's just an allergy.

28
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,430
<3-2,HOUSE>过敏可不会伴有脾脏肿大和发烧
<3-2,HOUSE>Not with an enlarged spleen and a fever.

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,330
<3-3,WILSON>他得了任何一种感染
<3-3,WILSON>he's got one of 10,000 possible infections.

30
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,890
<3-3,WILSON>那怕只是普通感冒
<3-3,WILSON>Even if it's just the common cold,

31
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,830
<3-3,WILSON>那样移植也会杀了他哥哥
<3-3,WILSON>I do the transplant,he kills his brother.

32
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,780
<3-4,CHASE>我们还有多久?
<3-4,CHASE>How long do we have?

33
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,750
<3-5,WILSON>放射治疗破坏了他的免疫系统
<3-5,WILSON>radiation obliterated his immune system.

34
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,890
<3-5,WILSON>就算在无菌室里
<3-5,WILSON>Even in a clean room,he's only got.

35
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,480
<3-5,WILSON>他也只剩下四五天了
<3-5,WILSON>four,maybe five days left.

36
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,310
<3-6,CAMERON>我们不可能很快找到办法的
<3-6,CAMERON>no way we can solve this that fast.

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,520
<3-6,CAMERON>得去再找一个捐献者
<3-6,CAMERON>You need to find another donor.

38
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,760
<3-7,WILSON>他们是黑人
<3-7,WILSON>they're african-american.

39
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,540
<3-7,WILSON>几乎不可能再找到完全匹配的了
<3-7,WILSON>It makes it nearly impossible to find a full match.

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,840
<3-8,HOUSE>说得对
<3-8,HOUSE>Tell me about it.

41
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,990
<3-8,HOUSE>连我的黑手下都找不到了
<3-8,HOUSE>I can't even find the one I've got working for me.

42
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,520
<3-8,HOUSE>Foreman去哪儿了?
<3-8,HOUSE>Where's foreman?

43
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,820
<4-1,HOUSE>医死患者唤醒你唱诗班男孩的本性
<4-1,HOUSE>Nothing like a dead patient to send you back to your choir boy roots.

44
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,030
<4-2,HOUSE>你肯定不能相信
<4-2,HOUSE>You're not gonna believe what happened.

45
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,350
<4-2,HOUSE>Wilson刚刚和你一样 治死个孩子
<4-2,HOUSE>Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.

46
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,550
<4-3,WILSON>他还没有死
<4-3,WILSON>He's not dead.

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,380
<4-4,HOUSE>五天转瞬即过
<4-4,HOUSE>Five days are gonna fly by.

48
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,250
<4-4,HOUSE>他辐射那孩子时 没有考虑周全
<4-4,HOUSE>He didn't look both ways before he nuked.

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,570
<4-4,HOUSE>你和你想象中的朋友聊完了吗?
<4-4,HOUSE>You done talking to your imaginary friend?

50
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,510
<4-4,HOUSE>因为我想你也该做本职工作了
<4-4,HOUSE>'Cause I thought maybe you could do your job.

51
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,820
<4-5,FOREMAN>我该对捐骨髓的弟弟使用广谱抗生素
<4-5,FOREMAN>We should start the donor brother on broad spectrum antibiotics.

52
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,640
<4-6,HOUSE>好主意 如果只想救兄弟其中一人的话
<4-6,HOUSE>Great idea,if you're looking to save exactly one kid.

53
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,490
<4-6,HOUSE>广谱抗生素要一个星期才能见效
<4-6,HOUSE>Broad spec will take at least a week to work.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,850
<4-6,HOUSE>得用窄谱抗生素
<4-6,HOUSE>We need narrow spec.

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,550
<4-6,HOUSE>Hector几岁了?
<4-6,HOUSE>How old is hector?

56
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,150
<4-7,CAMERON>病人的名字叫Matty 他哥哥叫Nick
<4-7,CAMERON>our patient's name is matty.His brother's nick.

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,490
<4-8,WILSON>Hector是我的狗
<4-8,WILSON>Hector's my dog.

58
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,870
<4-8,WILSON>他大概17岁了
<4-8,WILSON>He's about 17.

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,890
<4-8,WILSON>17岁?
<4-8,WILSON>17?

60
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,420
<4-9,HOUSE>那相当于
<4-9,HOUSE>That's like.

61
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,050
<4-9,HOUSE>人类年龄的119岁
<4-9,HOUSE>119 in human years.

62
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,120
<4-9,HOUSE>他怎么还活着?
<4-9,HOUSE>Why is he still alive?

63
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,120
<4-10,FOREMAN>讨论Wilson的狗花20秒 得从五天里减去
<4-10,FOREMAN>five days minus 20 seconds talking about wilson's dog.

64
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,610
<4-10,FOREMAN>得开始做测试
<4-10,FOREMAN>We need to start testing.

65
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,790
<4-10,FOREMAN>粪便采样检查寄生虫 抗体检测...
<4-10,FOREMAN>Stool samples for parasites,antibody tests--

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,680
<4-11,CHASE>血检否定了所有常见的猜测
<4-11,CHASE>blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.

67
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,460
<4-12,HOUSE>那是因为感染实在太轻
<4-12,HOUSE>That's 'cause the infection is too small.

68
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,800
<4-12,HOUSE>现在检查 犹如草垛寻针
<4-12,HOUSE>We start testing now,it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

69
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,700
<4-12,HOUSE>我们抽血 只能捞上茅草
<4-12,HOUSE>We draw blood,odds are we're just gonna come up with hay.

70
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,200
<4-12,HOUSE>得多丢几根针进去
<4-12,HOUSE>We need to grow more needles.

71
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,160
<4-13,HOUSE>好吧 也许得说得更明白一点
<4-13,HOUSE>Okay,that probably needs further explanation.

72
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,040
<4-13,HOUSE>让捐骨髓那孩子病再重些
<4-13,HOUSE>We make the donor kid sicker.

73
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,830
<4-13,HOUSE>让他受冻 让他淋湿 破坏他的免疫系统
<4-13,HOUSE>We freeze him,we soak him,break down his immune system.

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,090
<4-13,HOUSE>这样就能找到那根针,针眼大到骆驼能穿过
<4-13,HOUSE>Suddenly we're looking at some needle a camel can pass through the eye of.

75
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,120
<4-14,CHASE>那样做可能会使感染散布他全身
<4-14,CHASE>Making him sicker risks spreading the infection all throughout his body.

76
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,910
<4-15,HOUSE>没错 那又怎样?
<4-15,HOUSE>True,but who cares?

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,630
<4-15,HOUSE>只要知道是什么感染 就可以针对治疗了
<4-15,HOUSE>Once we know what the infection is,we'll know exactly how to treat it.

78
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,260
<4-15,HOUSE>只要他不死 就没问题
<4-15,HOUSE>As long as he isn't dead yet,we're cool.

79
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,980
<4-16,FOREMAN>我们应该按常规手段来办...
<4-16,FOREMAN>We should do what we normally do--

80
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,080
<4-16,FOREMAN>去那孩子家 寻找感染源
<4-16,FOREMAN>go to the kid's house,check for sources of infection.

81
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,520
<4-17,HOUSE>浪费时间
<4-17,HOUSE>Waste of time.

82
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,130
<4-17,HOUSE>你认为感染在房子里
<4-17,HOUSE>You think it's in the house.

83
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,460
<4-17,HOUSE>我肯定它在患者身体里
<4-17,HOUSE>I know it's in the patient.

84
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,960
<4-18,FOREMAN>总比故意让他病得更重安全
<4-18,FOREMAN>Safer than intentionally making the kid sicker.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,070
<4-18,FOREMAN>好 去吧
<4-18,FOREMAN>Fine.Go.

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,250
<5-1,SCOTT>那你们具体打算让Matty病多重?
<5-1,SCOTT>so exactly how sickare you gonna make matty?

87
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,980
<5-2,WILSON>可能得很重
<5-2,WILSON>he could get quite ill.

88
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,200
<5-2,WILSON>对谁这感觉肯定都不好受 但这是...
<5-2,WILSON>This certainly won't be a pleasant experience for anyone,but it's our on--

89
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,240
<5-3,HOUSE>有没有不带伞时碰到下雨?
<5-3,HOUSE>ever get caught in the rain without an umbrella?

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,020
<5-3,HOUSE>就是这意思 签字吧
<5-3,HOUSE>That's all we're talking about here,sign the form.

91
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,780
<5-4,WILSON>这比那个要复杂一些
<5-4,WILSON>it's a little more complicated than that.

92
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,910
<5-4,WILSON>还会做白细胞去除术
<5-4,WILSON>We'll also be doing leukopheresis.

93
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,970
<5-4,WILSON>通过机器把Matty血中的白细胞过滤出来
<5-4,WILSON>We run matty's blood through a machine that filters outhis white blood cells.

94
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,610
<5-5,CLAUDIA>但如果没有白细胞 他怎么能及时恢复?
<5-5,CLAUDIA>But without his white cells,how can he get better in time?

95
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,430
<5-6,WILSON>一旦有诊断结果 立刻把白细胞输回去
<5-6,WILSON>We'll pump the white blood cells back as soon as we have a diagnosis.

96
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,340
<5-7,WILSON>那样就可以治疗感染 不耽误移植
<5-7,WILSON>Then we should be able to cure the infection in timeto do the transplant.

97
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,660
<5-8,SCOTT>但你们不能保证?
<5-8,SCOTT>But you can't guarantee?

98
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,700
<5-9,HOUSE>我们不是通用汽车
<5-9,HOUSE>we're not gm.

99
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,660
<5-9,HOUSE>不能召回 不能打折
<5-9,HOUSE>No recalls,no rebates.

100
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,890
<5-9,HOUSE>还有问题吗 当你们儿子的生命在消逝
<5-9,HOUSE>Any more questions while your son's life slips away?

101
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,170
<5-10,CLAUDIA>你真觉得我们该这么做?
<5-10,CLAUDIA>You really thinkwe should do this?

102
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,410
<5-10,CLAUDIA>是的
<5-10,CLAUDIA>yes.

103
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,520
<5-11,HOUSE>抱歉
<5-11,HOUSE>Sorry.

104
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,360
<5-12,WILSON>你的病人 你来说
<5-12,WILSON>You patient.You tell them.

105
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,640
<5-12,WILSON>这是你的家人
<5-12,WILSON>This is your family.

106
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,330
<5-12,WILSON>得你来做出决定
<5-12,WILSON>It needs to be your decision.

107
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,240
<6-1,HOUSE>你唯一该说的是"是的 我同意"
<6-1,HOUSE>all you had to do was say,"yes,I do."

108
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,290
<6-1,HOUSE>谁都知道你这辈子常常说这句话
<6-1,HOUSE>God knows that's a phrase you've used often enoughin your life.

109
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,650
<6-2,WILSON>每次都是个错误
<6-2,WILSON>It was a mistake every time.

110
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,450
<6-2,WILSON>消停一下吧 他们同意了
<6-2,WILSON>Give it a break.They said yes.

111
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,420
<6-3,HOUSE>对你来说不够好
<6-3,HOUSE>That's not enough for you.

112
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,960
<6-3,HOUSE>你得让他们心甘情愿地同意
<6-3,HOUSE>You need them to feel good about saying yes.

113
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,740
<6-4,WILSON>我花几个月 甚至几年来治疗病人,而不是像你 几个礼拜就好
<6-4,WILSON>I treat patients for months,maybe years,not weeks like you.

114
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,880
<6-5,HOUSE>我比你高
<6-5,HOUSE>I'm taller.

115
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,730
<6-6,WILSON>如果他们不信任我 我就没法工作
<6-6,WILSON>If they don't trust me,I can't do my job.

<6-9,HOUSE>不该给父母做出错误决定的机会
<6-9,HOUSE>Giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.

119
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,340
<6-10,WILSON>至少是他们自己的选择
<6-10,WILSON>At least it would've been their choice.

120
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,330
<6-11,HOUSE>他们会在儿子葬礼上后悔

<7-4,FOREMAN>很显然你觉得这时间花得不值
<7-4,FOREMAN>You obviously think your time could be better spent.

<7-13,CHASE>记忆会减退的
<7-13,CHASE>Memories fade.

<7-14,FOREMMAN>一星期前我害死她,却记不得她穿着什么颜色的上衣
<7-14,FOREMMAN>I killed her a week ago and I can't remember what color top she was wearing.

<7-15,CHASE>醒来时没有想着她 我会开心
<7-15,CHASE>I was grateful when I could wake up not thinking about her.

<10-10,CHASE>会不会找错方向了?
<10-10,CHASE>What if we're looking for the wrong thing?

206
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,380
<10-11,CAMERON>这些是唯一能导致阴囊肿胀的感染
<10-11,CAMERON>These are the only infections that cause swollen testicles.

<10-11,CAMERON>你能不能就现在说四遍,然后一个月都不来烦我?
<10-11,CAMERON>Why don't you just say it four times now and leave me alone for a month?

208
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,180
<10-12,CHASE>会不会根本不是感染?
<10-12,CHASE>What if it's not an infection?

209
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,050
<10-13,CAMERON>他的体温高得吓人,粘液都快从身体里流出来了
<10-13,CAMERON>His temperature's through the roof,there's mucuspouring out of him.

210
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,480
<10-14,CHASE>我知道他有感染,如果不是感染直接导致阴囊问题
<10-14,CHASE>I know he has an infection,but what if it didn't directly cause the scrotum issue?

211
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,700
<10-14,CHASE>如果感染只是
<10-14,CHASE>What if it just.

212
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,580
<10-14,CHASE>引发了可致阴囊问题的病症
<10-14,CHASE>caused the thing that caused the scrotum issue?

<10-17,CHASE>显示了心脏受损
<10-17,CHASE>indicates cardiac injury.

216
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,290
<10-17,CHASE>我们把他关在那房间里,强力驱动他流流鼻涕的小感染
<10-17,CHASE>We stuck him in that room,put his stupid little runny nose infection into hyper drive.

217
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,680
<10-17,CHASE>会不会就奔向心脏了?
<10-17,CHASE>What if it went to his heart?

218
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,580
<11-1,CHASE>肺动脉瓣看上去没问题
<11-1,CHASE>pulmonary valve looks clean.

219
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,970
<11-2,CAMERON>等等
<11-2,CAMERON>wait.

220
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,010
<11-2,CAMERON>停下

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,930
<11-2,CAMERON>二尖瓣那

<11-3,CAMERON>有异常生长
<11-3,CAMERON>There's a growth.

223
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,070
<11-3,CAMERON>清除这个 得用一个月的抗生素
<11-3,CAMERON>He'll need a month of antibiotics to clear that.

224
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,130
<11-3,CAMERON>而他哥哥只有4天能活
<11-3,CAMERON>His brother only has four days to live.

225
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,420
<11-3,CAMERON>Matty的二尖瓣感染使他不能捐赠了
<11-3,CAMERON>the infection in matty's mitral valve rules him out as a donor.

226
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,290
<13-1,CAMERON>完美
<13-1,CAMERON>This is perfect.

227
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,860
<13-2,HOUSE>我们把感染赶到他的心脏去了
<13-2,HOUSE>We drove the infection into his heart.

228
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
<13-3,CAMERON>好吧 说完美太夸张了
<13-3,CAMERON>Okay.Perfect is too strong a word.

229
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,600
<13-4,HOUSE>但仍然非常 非常之好
<13-4,HOUSE>But it's very,very good.

230
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
<13-4,HOUSE>现在知道感染在哪儿
<13-4,HOUSE>Now we know where the infection is.

231
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,250
<13-4,HOUSE>只要移出那块瓣膜
<13-4,HOUSE>All we gotta do is remove the valve,I.D.

232
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,930
<13-4,HOUSE>确认感染 瞄准 破坏即可
<13-4,HOUSE>The infection,target and destroy.

233
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,020
<13-5,FOREMAN>移除瓣膜?
<13-5,FOREMAN>remove the valve?

234
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,610
<13-5,FOREMAN>他用抗生素就能康复
<13-5,FOREMAN>He'll be fine on antibiotics.

235
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,860
<13-5,FOREMAN>根本没必要做需要开心的大手术
<13-5,FOREMAN>He doesn't need open heart surgery.

236
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,260
<13-6,HOUSE>他哥哥死了 他会心碎的
<13-6,HOUSE>He'll be heartbroken on account of his dead brother.

237
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,150
<13-7,CHASE>怎样他哥哥都活不成
<13-7,CHASE>either way,he's gota dead brother.

238
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,910
<13-7,CHASE>感染并不只限于瓣膜
<13-7,CHASE>The infection isn't just in the valve.

239
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,260
<13-7,CHASE>即使用药正确,也不可能及时清理整个系统
<13-7,CHASE>Even with targeted medication,there's no way we can clear his system in time.

240
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,430
<13-8,HOUSE>没有必要
<13-8,HOUSE>We don't have to.

241
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,250
<13-8,HOUSE>只需要清理骨髓
<13-8,HOUSE>We just have to clear his marrow.

242
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,550
<13-8,HOUSE>手术之后 你们收获骨髓
<13-8,HOUSE>After the surgery,you harvest the marrow,

243
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,960
<13-8,HOUSE>泡制在针对性的抗生素中 慢炖 然后上菜
<13-8,HOUSE>marinate it in the targeted antibiotic,simmer and serve.

244
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,180
<13-9,WILSON>可行
<13-9,WILSON>It could work.

245
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,050
<13-10,FOREMAN>这太疯狂了
<13-10,FOREMAN>It's insane.

246
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,430
<13-11,WILSON>总比死掉哥哥好
<13-11,WILSON>It is better than a dead brother.

247
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,010
<13-12,FOREMAN>我要去告诉Cuddy
<13-12,FOREMAN>I'm running this by cuddY.

<14-1,FOREMAN>这个手术极其危险 生死攸关
<14-1,FOREMAN>This surgery is dangerous and life-altering.

251
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,230
<14-1,FOREMAN>绝没有考虑到病人的利益
<14-1,FOREMAN>And clearly not in the interest of our patient.

252
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,750
<14-2,WILSON>如果他爱他哥哥 算是考虑到了
<14-2,WILSON>It is if he likesh is brother.

253
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,360
<14-3,FOREMAN>- 我们有利益冲突,- 父母难道没有?
<14-3,FOREMAN>We have a conflict of interests.the parents don'T.

254
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,490
<14-4,WILSON>他们当然有
<14-4,WILSON>Of course they do.

255
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,320
<14-5,FOREMAN>他们不是第一次拿Matty的健康,来换他兄弟的命了
<14-5,FOREMAN>They already sacrificed matty's health to benefit his brother once.

256
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,980
<14-6,WILSON>他们只是加重了他的感冒
<14-6,WILSON>They made his cold worse.

257
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,440
<14-7,FOREMAN>感冒加重 损坏了他的心脏瓣膜
<14-7,FOREMAN>We screwed up his heart valve by making his cold wor.

258
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,170
<14-8,CUDDY>对于这场辩论你有没什么好补充的?
<14-8,CUDDY>Do you have anything to add to this debate?

259
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,640
<14-9,HOUSE>Wilson正确 Foreman错误
<14-9,HOUSE>Wilson's right,foreman's wrong,

260
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,330
<14-9,HOUSE>你的上衣对坐办公室而言太暴露了点
<14-9,HOUSE>and your shirt is way too revealing for the office.

261
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,840
<14-10,CUDDY>想让我怎么做?
<14-10,CUDDY>What do you want me to do?

262
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,480
<14-11,WILSON>打电话给儿童保护中心,让他们指派一个监护人给Matty
<14-11,WILSON>We should call child services and have them appointa guardian for matty.

263
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,890
<14-11,WILSON>不
<14-11,WILSON>No.

264
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,060
<14-12,CUDDY>解释给家长 让他们选择
<14-12,CUDDY>Go explain the choices to the parents.

<14-18,HOUSE>I think he's got the yips.

<14-20,CUDDY>而你在给他时间渡过这一关?
<14-20,CUDDY>And you're.giving him timeto work through it?

<14-21,HOUSE>四天 不行就滚蛋
<14-21,HOUSE>Four days and then he's fired.

<14-21,HOUSE>得了yips好不了
<14-21,HOUSE>You don't get better from the yips.

277
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,550
<15-1,SCOTT>心内直视手术?
<15-1,SCOTT>Open-heart surgery?

278
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,410
<15-2,HOUSE>想让两个孩子都活下来 这是唯一的方法
<15-2,HOUSE>if you want both kids to live,it's the only choice.

279
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,830
<15-3,WILSON>因瓣膜被移除
<15-3,WILSON>due to the valve replacement,

280
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,000
<15-3,WILSON>Matty需要用血液稀释剂 预防梗塞
<15-3,WILSON>matty will have to be on blood thinners,to prevent potential clots.

281
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,510
<15-4,SCOTT>- 一直持续多久?,- 一辈子
<15-4,SCOTT>- For how long?,- Forever.

<15-6,CLAUDIA>骨髓库那怎样?
<15-6,CLAUDIA>What about the marrow registry?

284
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,120
<15-6,CLAUDIA>也许还有能配对的呢
<15-6,CLAUDIA>Maybe they'll find a match.

285
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,260
<15-7,HOUSE>也许他会骑着独角兽飞驰而来
<15-7,HOUSE>Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.

286
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,800
<15-8,WILSON>恐怕很难指望再找一个可行的捐赠者
<15-8,WILSON>I'm afraid finding a viable new donor isn't something we can realistically depend on.

287
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,400
<15-9,SCOTT>要不弄残一个 要不就让另一个死？
<15-9,SCOTT>Either we cripple one sonor kill the other.

<15-10,HOUSE>他不能再打棒球

<15-10,HOUSE>但并不代表就残了
<15-10,HOUSE>But that doesn't make hima cripple.

<15-11,SCOTT>我们该怎么办?
<15-11,SCOTT>What should we do?

<16-4,WILSON>I did exactly what cuddy told us not to do.

<16-6,HOUSE>你真难过起来了
<16-6,HOUSE>You're actually upset.

303
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,930
<16-8,HOUSE>因为事情搞砸的时候 会少点内疚
<16-8,HOUSE>Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong.

304
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,270
<16-8,HOUSE>那不是保护选择权
<16-8,HOUSE>You're not protecting your choices.

305
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,820
<16-9,HOUSE>是逃避自责
<16-9,HOUSE>You're soothing your conscience.

306
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,700
<16-10,WILSON>照这逻辑 反社会者是世上,最好的病人权益倡导者
<16-10,WILSON>By that logic,a sociopath would make the best patient advocate in the world.

<17-10,SCOTT>You did the right thing.

320
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,630

<20-12,HOUSE>怎么可能不--
<20-12,HOUSE>Of course he's--

344
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,750
<20-13,HOUSE>它正飘飘欲仙
<20-13,HOUSE>He's stoned.

345
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,930
<20-13,HOUSE>我就来
<20-13,HOUSE>I'll be right in.

346
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,970
<21-1,HOUSE>一路切进孩子的心脏
<21-1,HOUSE>We cut all the way into this kid's heart,

347
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,870
<21-1,HOUSE>得到的只是非感染性的破纤维组织
<21-1,HOUSE>and all we got was this lousy,noninfectious fibrous tissue.

348
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,270
<21-2,WILSON>怎么会弄错的?
<21-2,WILSON>How did we miss this?

349
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,540
<21-3,CAMERON>Matty发着烧
<21-3,CAMERON>Matty had a fever.

350
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,500
<21-3,CAMERON>抑制住他的免疫系统后 病情就加重
<21-3,CAMERON>He got sicker whenwe suppressed his immune system.

351
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,900
<21-3,CAMERON>这些都指着感染的存在
<21-3,CAMERON>That all points to infection.

352
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,050
<21-4,HOUSE>是啊是啊
<21-4,HOUSE>Yeah,yeah,yeah.

353
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,630
<21-5,HOUSE>不是我们的错
<21-5,HOUSE>Not our fault.

354
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,120
<21-6,CAMERON>纤维性组织
<21-6,CAMERON>Fibrous tissue.

355
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,760
<21-5,HOUSE>他好端端的心脏瓣膜怎么变成了软骨
<21-5,HOUSE>Something is turning his healthy heart valve to gristle.

356
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,710
<21-6,CAMERON>纤维性组织 扩大了的脾脏
<21-6,CAMERON>fibrous tissue,enlarged spleen.

357
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,720
<21-6,CAMERON>发烧 可能是自体免疫病
<21-6,CAMERON>fever--could mean autoimmune.

358
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,400
<21-7,WILSON>自体免疫病不在骨髓中传播
<21-7,WILSON>Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along in bone marrow.

359
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,520
<21-7,WILSON>他还是能够捐赠
<21-7,WILSON>He can still donate.

360
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,030
<21-7,WILSON>确认一下 我做手术
<21-7,WILSON>We confirm,I do the surgery.

361
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,010
<21-8,HOUSE>狼疮和白塞氏病可能性不大
<21-8,HOUSE>Lupus and bechet's are our best bet.

362
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,650
<21-8,HOUSE>做抗核抗体和过敏反应检测
<21-8,HOUSE>Do an ana and a thergy test.

363
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,690
<21-9,FOREMAN>仍可能是感染
<21-9,FOREMAN>or it could be infection.

364
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,020
<21-10,HOUSE>我的记忆力是大不如前
<21-10,HOUSE>My memory's not what it used to be,

365
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,160
<21-10,HOUSE>好像在8秒前排除了那个吧?
<21-10,HOUSE>but didn't we just rule that out 8 seconds ago?

366
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,370
<21-11,FOREMAN>就算感染没有破坏他的瓣膜,也不能证明它不存在
<21-11,FOREMAN>Just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.

367
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,050
<21-12,HOUSE>我们要是猜对了 好处可大了
<21-12,HOUSE>Uh-huh; and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along.

368
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,410
<21-12,HOUSE>猜错了 就一点坏处 哥哥死了
<21-12,HOUSE>A little disadvantage of making big brother dead.

369
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,550
<21-13,FOREMAN>这就是你的论点?
<21-13,FOREMAN>That's your argument?

370
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,390
<21-13,FOREMAN>由结果好坏来判断?
<21-13,FOREMAN>Better outcome?

371
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,280
<21-14,HOUSE>这说得通
<21-14,HOUSE>It fits.

372
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,620
<21-15,FOREMAN>这家的孩子,一个白血病 一个自体免疫病
<21-15,FOREMAN>The family has one kid with leukemia and one with autoimmune.

373
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,190
<21-15,FOREMAN>太蹊跷了
<21-15,FOREMAN>Wouldn't stand next to them in a rainstorm.

374
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,140
<21-16,HOUSE>这就是你的论点 悲惨得不可能发生?
<21-16,HOUSE>That's your argument--it sucks for them?

375
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,460
<21-17,FOREMAN>也说得通 还救得了大的
<21-17,FOREMAN>It fits,and we can still help big brother.

376
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,100
<21-17,FOREMAN>全国骨髓库有一个六分之四配对的捐赠者
<21-17,FOREMAN>National marrow registry came up with a four out of six donor--

377
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,600
<21-18,HOUSE>六分之六要好过六分之四吧
<21-18,HOUSE>six out of six is two better than four out of six,right?

378
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,450
<21-18,HOUSE>我是说 虽然2是个很小的数字
<21-18,HOUSE>I mean,I know two is so small,

379
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,170
<21-18,HOUSE>但代表的是 他会得移植物抗宿主病
<21-18,HOUSE>but since it means that he's gonna get graft versus host disease,

380
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,240
<21-18,HOUSE>骨髓攻击他的身体 痛苦地死去
<21-18,HOUSE>the marrow will attack his body and he'll diea painful death.

381
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,930
<21-18,HOUSE>找出是哪种自体免疫病
<21-18,HOUSE>Find out what autoimmuneit is.

382
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,330
<22-1,SCOTT>这个叫自体免疫病的,比起换心脏瓣膜是好还是坏?
<22-1,SCOTT>Is this autoimmune better or worse than a new heart valve?

383
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,880
<22-2,CAMERON>那取决于是哪种自体免疫病
<22-2,CAMERON>It depends on which autoimmune it is.

384
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,930
<22-2,CAMERON>但发现得早的话 大多都能控制
<22-2,CAMERON>With early detection,most are manageable.

385
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,340
<22-3,CLAUDIA>测试需要多长时间?
<22-3,CLAUDIA>How long will the testing take?

386
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,820
<22-4,CAMERON>这就是另一个好处
<22-4,CAMERON>That's the other good thing about this.

387
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,020
<22-4,CAMERON>感染有成千上万种 自体免疫病就只有那么几个
<22-4,CAMERON>There's literally thousands of possible infections but only a handful of autoimmune conditions.

388
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,560
<22-4,CAMERON>几小时内就会有答案的
<22-4,CAMERON>We'll have the answerin a few hours.

389
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,110
<22-5,NICK>医生?
<22-5,NICK>hey,doctor?

390
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,420
<22-6,NICK>这很糟糕吗?
<22-6,NICK>Is this bad?

391
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,550
<23-1,HOUSE>看不看电影?
<23-1,HOUSE>Wanna catch a movie?

392
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,400
<23-2,WILSON>现在是凌晨一点
<23-2,WILSON>It's 1:00 in the morning.

393
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,750
<23-3,HOUSE>我知道有个地方可以
<23-3,HOUSE>I know a place.

394
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,170
<23-3,HOUSE>虽然我不推荐你穿那鞋去
<23-3,HOUSE>Although I wouldn't recommend wearing those shoes.

395
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,650
<23-4,WILSON>到底一只狗是怎么打开药瓶子的?
<23-4,WILSON>How,exactly,does a dog unscrew a bottle of pills?

396
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,770
<23-5,HOUSE>脑筋急转弯?
<23-5,HOUSE>Is that a riddle?

397
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,430
<23-6,WILSON>需要有与其它手指相对的拇指
<23-6,WILSON>It requires an opposable thumb.

398
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,750
<23-7,HOUSE>我大概没有盖紧
<23-7,HOUSE>I must have left it off.

399
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,730
<23-8,WILSON>丢在地上?
<23-8,WILSON>On the floor?

400
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,440
<23-9,HOUSE>猜是他跳着从浴室台面拨弄下来的
<23-9,HOUSE>I think he hopped upon the bathroom counter.

401
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,700
<23-10,WILSON>他有关节炎
<23-10,WILSON>He has arthritis.

402
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,580
<23-11,WILSON>这回不是我
<23-11,WILSON>Not me this time.

403
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,200
<23-12,HOUSE>不 是你的臭狗!
<23-12,HOUSE>No,it's your damn dog!

404
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,600
<23-12,HOUSE>他见什么啃什么
<23-12,HOUSE>He chews everything!

405
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,900
<23-12,HOUSE>我的文件不见了
<23-12,HOUSE>I was missing a file.

406
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,370
<23-12,HOUSE>论文在他大便里
<23-12,HOUSE>Found paper in his stool.

407
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,460
<23-12,HOUSE>78年太阳唱片猫王的原版唱片 不见了
<23-12,HOUSE>An original sun record78 elvis recording--gone.

408
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,800
<23-12,HOUSE>哪有啃乙烯基的笨蛋?,(黑胶唱片的原材料)
<23-12,HOUSE>Who the hell chews vinyl?

409
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,300
<23-12,HOUSE>他是来寻仇的
<23-12,HOUSE>He's vindictive.

410
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,880
<23-12,HOUSE>他的命还很硬
<23-12,HOUSE>And he's had a good,long life.

411
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,630
<23-12,HOUSE>但他的末日来了
<23-12,HOUSE>It's his time.

412
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,110
<23-13,CAMERON>你没事吧?
<23-13,CAMERON>Are you okay?

413
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,820
<23-14,HOUSE>我被Wilson的伪善绊倒了
<23-14,HOUSE>I just tripped overwilson's self-righteousness.

414
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,910
<23-15,HOUSE>有什么发现?
<23-15,HOUSE>What do you got?

415
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,120
<23-16,CHASE>Matty检查都是阴性
<23-16,CHASE>Matty's negative for everything.

416
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,280
<23-16,CHASE>不是自体免疫病
<23-16,CHASE>It's not autoimmune.

417
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,680
<23-16,CHASE>只好再怀疑是感染
<23-16,CHASE>so we're back to infection.

418
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,670
<23-17,CAMERON>Nick在迅速恶化
<23-17,CAMERON>Nick's starting to deteriorate fast.

419
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,010
<23-17,CAMERON>他的手臂上都是瘀青
<23-17,CAMERON>He's got bruising all over his arms.

420
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,300
<23-18,CHASE>毛细血管在渗漏
<23-18,CHASE>Capillaries are leaking blood.

421
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,970
<23-18,CHASE>如果发生在大脑 他就死了
<23-18,CHASE>If it happens in his brain,he's dead.

422
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,090
<23-19,CAMERON>只得用那个6个里4个匹配的捐献者了
<23-19,CAMERON>We've got to go with the four out of six donor.

423
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,800
<23-20,HOUSE>我难道没说清楚 4个比6个少?
<23-20,HOUSE>Did I mention my concerns about four being less than six?

424
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,090
<23-20,HOUSE>Wilson的第一任老婆犯了同样的错误
<23-20,HOUSE>Wilson's first wife ignored a similar issue.

425
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,510
<23-20,HOUSE>只不过在那时 是他们的婚姻丧了命
<23-20,HOUSE>Of course,that time,it wasonly fatal to their marriage.

426
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,500
<23-21,WILSON>得随机检查Matty是哪种感染
<23-21,WILSON>It's either that or we start randomly testing matty for infections.

427
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,070
<23-21,WILSON>我知道你恨"随机"这个词
<23-21,WILSON>I know you hate the word random.

428
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,380
<23-22,HOUSE>按首字母顺序来
<23-22,HOUSE>Do it alphabetically.

429
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,520
<23-22,HOUSE>不能做移植
<23-22,HOUSE>We're not doing that damn transplant.

430
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,340
<23-22,HOUSE>Foreman在哪儿?
<23-22,HOUSE>Where's foreman?

431
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,720
<24-1,FOREMAN>找到一个捐献者
<24-1,FOREMAN>we found a donor.

432
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,240
<24-1,FOREMAN>不是完美匹配
<24-1,FOREMAN>It's not an ideal match.

433
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,030
<24-1,FOREMAN>不过6个里4个匹配 值得一试,(HLA测试6个白细胞抗原的相容程度)
<24-1,FOREMAN>But four out of six still gives nick a chance.

434
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,350
<25-1,WILSON>半匹配移植极其危险
<25-1,WILSON>a partial match transplant is extremely dangerous.

435
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,450
<25-2,SCOTT>Foreman医生解释过了
<25-2,SCOTT>Dr.Foreman explained.

436
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,020
<25-3,HOUSE>他有没有提你们儿子会经历多大的痛苦?
<25-3,HOUSE>He also explain what sort of pain your son will experience

437
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,780
<25-3,HOUSE>- 如果他得了移植物抗宿主病?,- 是的
<25-3,HOUSE>- if he gets graft versus host disease?,- Yes.

438
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,350
<25-4,SCOTT>看来他的描述还不够鲜明
<25-4,SCOTT>Apparently,he didn't explain it vividly enough.

439
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,460
<25-5,HOUSE>让我来试一下
<25-5,HOUSE>Let me give it a whack.

440
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,840
<25-6,CLAUDIA>他也说 如果我们什么都不做
<25-6,CLAUDIA>he also explained that if we did nothing,

441
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,230
<25-6,CLAUDIA>Nick会颅内出血
<25-6,CLAUDIA>nick could start bleeding into his brain.

442
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,910
<25-7,WILSON>Matty是完美的匹配
<25-7,WILSON>Matty is a perfect match.

443
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,470
<25-7,WILSON>请给我们多点时间来寻找
<25-7,WILSON>Just give us a little more time to figure out--

444
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,730
<25-8,CLAUDIA>多久?
<25-8,CLAUDIA>how much time?

445
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,520
<25-9,WILSON>House医生是最好的诊断专家
<25-9,WILSON>Dr.House is the best diagnostician--

446
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,630
<25-8,CLAUDIA>要多久?
<25-8,CLAUDIA>how much time?

447
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,190
<25-11,WILSON>不确定
<25-11,WILSON>I don't know.

448
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,910
<25-12,SCOTT>Nick随时都回颅内出血
<25-12,SCOTT>and nick can start bleeding into this brain without any warning.

449
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,730
<25-13,WILSON>但错配导致并发症的可能性
<25-13,WILSON>Yes,but the chances of complications from a mismatch--

450
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,700
<25-14,SCOTT>我的儿子受够了
<25-14,SCOTT>my boy shave suffered enough.

451
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,610
<25-14,SCOTT>让Matty好起来
<25-14,SCOTT>Get matty better.

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,980
<25-14,SCOTT>让Nick接受新捐献者移植
<25-14,SCOTT>And give nick the transplant from the new donor.

453
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,100
<26-1,WILSON>Foreman捅我们一刀
<26-1,WILSON>Foreman screwed us.

454
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,670
<26-2,HOUSE>不 是你无能
<26-2,HOUSE>No! You screwed us.

455

<31-15,HOUSE>And if we don't know what it is,we can't kill it.

571
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,240
<31-15,HOUSE>得等它再长出来
<31-15,HOUSE>You gotta wait for itto grow back again.

572
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,630
<31-15,HOUSE>可他的土壤贫瘠
<31-15,HOUSE>Now his soil is arid.

573
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,610
<31-15,HOUSE>他们兄弟俩都会死
<31-15,HOUSE>So he and his brother will be dead by the time--

574
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,190
<31-16,HOUSE>如果蒲公英长在肥沃的土壤
<31-16,HOUSE>what if the dandelion was in fertile soil?

575
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,940
<31-16,HOUSE>把Matty身上的野草根,种到Nick身上
<31-16,HOUSE>What if we take the roots from matty and put them in nick?

576
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,560
<31-16,HOUSE>把那孩子当作培养皿
<31-16,HOUSE>Turn the kid into a petri dish?

577
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,490
<31-16,HOUSE>比培养皿更好
<31-16,HOUSE>Only better.

578
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,200
<31-16,HOUSE>培养皿不会叫疼
<31-16,HOUSE>A petri dish can't tell you when it hurts.

579
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,120
<31-17,CHASE>你想把感染给他哥哥?
<31-17,CHASE>You want to give him his brother's infection?

580
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,810
<31-17,CHASE>自从他打喷嚏来,我们千方百计避免的事?
<31-17,CHASE>The very thing we've been trying to avoid since the brother sneezed?

581
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,490
<31-18,HOUSE>白血病孩没有抵抗力
<31-18,HOUSE>Leukemia kid's got no defenses.

582
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,930
<31-19,CAMERON>所以他要死了
<31-19,CAMERON>Which is why he'll die.

583
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,850
<31-20,HOUSE>在他死前 感染会迅速蔓延
<31-20,HOUSE>But before he does,the infection will spread,fast.

584
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,790
<31-20,HOUSE>来得及让我们发现它是什么
<31-20,HOUSE>Fast enough to tell us what it is.

585
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,480
<31-20,HOUSE>来得及救他弟弟
<31-20,HOUSE>In time to save his brother.

586
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,980
<31-21,WILSON>还有别的法子吗?
<31-21,WILSON>Do you see any other way?

587
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,090
<32-1,WILSON>感染在屠戮Matty的骨髓
<32-1,WILSON>the infection is decimating matty's bone marrow.

588
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,640
<32-1,WILSON>但
<32-1,WILSON>But.

589
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,170
<32-1,WILSON>如果把Matty的骨髓给Nick
<32-1,WILSON>if we give that marrow to nick,

590
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,480
<32-1,WILSON>他的症状能帮助我们诊断Matty
<32-1,WILSON>his symptoms could let us diagnose matty.

591
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,960
<32-2,CLAUDIA>但会杀了Nick
<32-2,CLAUDIA>But it'll kill nick.

592
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,370
<32-3,HOUSE>是的
<32-3,HOUSE>Yes.

593
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,640
<32-4,SCOTT>你是说 我们该用一命换一命?
<32-4,SCOTT>You're-- you're saying we should,kill one son to save the other?

594
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,040
<32-5,HOUSE>Nick治不好了
<32-5,HOUSE>Nick is gonna die either way.

<32-6,SCOTT>不许这么说!
<32-6,SCOTT>you don't know that!

596
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,350
<32-6,SCOTT>他现在是很痛苦 但
<32-6,SCOTT>I mean,he's in pain right now,but--

597
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,560
<32-7,WILSON>药物对Nick的移植物抗宿主病无效
<32-7,WILSON>nick's graft versus host is not responding to medication.

598
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,730
<32-8,SCOTT>会有起色的
<32-8,SCOTT>It can change.

599
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,560
<32-8,SCOTT>也许 他 他能挺过来
<32-8,SCOTT>May--maybe he'll--he'll rally.

600
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,650
<32-8,SCOTT>我的Nick从不服输
<32-8,SCOTT>Hey,my nick is a fighter.

601

<32-9,HOUSE>阳光笑容和正面形象,并不能让他免于排异反应
<32-9,HOUSE>graft versus host is not gonna go away because of nick's sunny smile and positive outlook.

602
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,790
<32-10,CLAUDIA>Nick挺过了三次白血病复发
<32-10,CLAUDIA>Nick has survived three reoccurrences of his leukemia.

603

<32-11,HOUSE>他的全身都被破坏了一遍
<32-11,HOUSE>He's being torn apart from the inside out.

604

<32-11,HOUSE>他会越来越痛苦 直至死亡
<32-11,HOUSE>His pain's gonna get worse and worse until he dies.

605
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,130
<32-11,HOUSE>现在只是无谓的拖延
<32-11,HOUSE>You're just dragging it out.

609
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,080
<32-13,WILSON>你应该让我们做这个
<32-13,WILSON>You should let us do this.

610
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,980
<32-14,CLAUDIA>不
<32-14,CLAUDIA>No.

611
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,140
<32-15,SCOTT>我们不会放弃Nick
<32-15,SCOTT>We're not giving upon nick.

612
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,840
<32-15,SCOTT>不会
<32-15,SCOTT>Not!

613
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,330
<33-1,HOUSE>显然他们一个儿子都不想要了
<33-1,HOUSE>patients' parents apparently don't want to be parents anymore.

<33-1,HOUSE>Any ideashow we get around this?

616
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,490

617
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,350
<33-3,HOUSE>这根本算不上奸滑

<33-4,FOREMAN>我们可以救Matty
<33-4,FOREMAN>We can still save matty.

<33-5,HOUSE>Take you approximately eight years.

624

<33-6,FOREMAN>实际上只要4个月,即使我查到最后一项化验才中

<36-8,NICK>Let me do it for matty.

<37-1,CUDDY>你下决心了吗?
<37-1,CUDDY>Are you sure?

692
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,740
<37-1,CUDDY>没
<37-1,CUDDY>no.

693
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,020
<37-2,SCOTT>他下了
<37-2,SCOTT>But he is.

694
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,420
<37-3,FOREMAN>把Nick推回无菌房
<37-3,FOREMAN>get nick back to the clean room.

695
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,010
<37-4,CUDDY>家人同意感染他
<37-4,CUDDY>The parents agreed to infect him.

696
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,230
<37-5,FOREMAN>我知道Matty的病因了
<37-5,FOREMAN>We figured out what's wrong with matty--

697
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,080
<37-6,FOREMAN>组织胞浆菌病
<37-6,FOREMAN>histoplasmosis.

698
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,680
<37-7,SCOTT>这是什么东西 他怎么会...
<37-7,SCOTT>well,what is that? I mean,why did it--

699
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,740
<37-8,FOREMAN>真菌感染
<37-8,FOREMAN>fungal infection.

700
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,960
<37-8,FOREMAN>在鸡粪里生长
<37-8,FOREMAN>Grows in chicken feces.

701
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,720
<37-8,FOREMAN>投球区的土应该是来自鸡舍的
<37-8,FOREMAN>The dirt that matty used to build his pitcher's mound must have sat under a chicken coop.

702
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,260
<37-8,FOREMAN>你们整个社区都是建在农场上
<37-8,FOREMAN>Your whole neighborhood was built on top of farmland.

703
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,290
<37-8,FOREMAN>早先我们没有检查这项 因为...
<37-8,FOREMAN>We didn't test for it earlier because we--

704
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,830
<37-9,CLAUDIA>能治好吗?
<37-9,CLAUDIA>can you fix him?

705
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,480
<37-10,FOREMAN>全面施用两性霉素 他会好的
<37-10,FOREMAN>Full course of amphotericin,and he should be fine.

706
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,500
<37-10,FOREMAN>那Nick呢
<37-10,FOREMAN>And nick?

707
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,720
<37-11,SCOTT>能不能先治好Matty 然后-
<37-11,SCOTT>I mean,can you clean matty's marrow,um,

708
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,560
<37-11,SCOTT>就像你们之前说的 只不过加快速度
<37-11,SCOTT>just like you were talking about doing it,but do it fast and.

709
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,700
<37-11,SCOTT>把骨髓给Nick
<37-11,SCOTT>and get it into nick?

710
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,540
<37-11,SCOTT>很抱歉
<37-11,SCOTT>I'm sorry.

711
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,490
<37-12,CUDDY>Matty之所以病得这么重,是因为骨髓受到感染
<37-12,CUDDY>The reason matty is so sick is because the infection's attacking his marrow.

712
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,130
<37-12,CUDDY>这时候取骨髓 Matty可能有危险
<37-12,CUDDY>He doesn't have enough left to safely take from him and give to his brother.

713
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,800
<38-1,MATTY>我会好起来?
<38-1,MATTY>I'm going to get better now?

714
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,560
<38-2,FOREMAN>就这样
<38-2,FOREMAN>That's it?

715
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,090
<38-2,FOREMAN>是这样
<38-2,FOREMAN>That's it.

716
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,590
<38-3,MATTY>Nick怎么办?
<38-3,MATTY>And what about nick?

717
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,290
<38-4,FOREMAN>你哥哥甘冒生命危险救你
<38-4,FOREMAN>Your brother was willing to risk his life to save you.

718
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,950
<38-4,FOREMAN>你愿意为他这样做吗?
<38-4,FOREMAN>Are you willing to do that for him?

719
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,180
<38-5,FOREMAN>不能打麻药
<38-5,FOREMAN>I can't sedate you.

720
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,800
<38-5,FOREMAN>你太虚弱
<38-5,FOREMAN>You're too sick.

721
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,450
<38-6,MATTY>求求你住手
<38-6,MATTY>Please,please stoP.

<38-6,MATTY>Please,please.

723
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,160
<38-6,MATTY>已经抽完了吧
<38-6,MATTY>You're done,right?

724
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,680
<38-6,MATTY>对不起
<38-6,MATTY>Sorry.

725
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,270
<38-7,FOREMAN>还要很多
<38-7,FOREMAN>I need a lot more.

<38-7,FOREMAN>停下
<38-7,FOREMAN>No.Stop!

727
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,060
<38-7,FOREMAN>停
<38-7,FOREMAN>Stop!

728
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,400
<39-1,HOUSE>很难招架那对父母吧?
<39-1,HOUSE>How much heat are you taking from the parents?

729
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,370
<39-2,WILSON>他们正在冷静
<39-2,WILSON>They're calming down.

730
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,380
<39-2,WILSON>大概是因为两个儿子都活着,醒了而且可以进食
<39-2,WILSON>I think it has something to do with both their kids being alive,awake,and eating.

731
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,550
<39-2,WILSON>骨髓移植有效果
<39-2,WILSON>The marrow transplant took.

<39-5,HOUSE>告诉他我为他骄傲?
<39-5,HOUSE>And tell him how proud I am?

735

<39-6,WILSON>如果你认为他很丢脸,也可以跟他说
<39-6,WILSON>Hey,if you're ashamed of him,you can tell him that.

736
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:50,830
<39-7,HOUSE>跟有感情的人 才谈得上骄傲还是丢脸,对雇员用不着
<39-7,HOUSE>Pride and shame only apply to people we have a vested interest in,not employees.

737
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,830
<39-8,WILSON>你要跟人相处多久才能感觉亲如一家?
<39-8,WILSON>How many hours a day do you have to spend with someone before they're basically family?

738
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,620
<39-9,HOUSE>说得好
<39-9,HOUSE>Good point.

<39-9,HOUSE>But first,I gotta tell cameron and chase that they're violating god's will.

740
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,300
<39-10,WILSON>我只是希望你跟他像成人般地谈谈,让他知道
<39-10,WILSON>I'm just asking you to have an adult conversation to let him know--

741
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,570
<39-11,HOUSE>让他知道他做得对?
<39-11,HOUSE>he did a good job?

742
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,040
<39-11,HOUSE>他知道的
<39-11,HOUSE>He knows it.

743
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,710
<39-11,HOUSE>成人不需要成人对话
<39-11,HOUSE>Adults don't need adult conversations.

744
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,440
<39-11,HOUSE>就好像我不需要听你废话
<39-11,HOUSE>Just like I don't need this conversation.

745
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,120
<39-12,WILSON>你干掉Hector没有?
<39-12,WILSON>Have you killed hector yet?

746
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,480
<39-13,HOUSE>显然还没
<39-13,HOUSE>Obviously not.

747
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,360
<39-14,WILSON>他很安静
<39-14,WILSON>He's quiet.He's--

748
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,070
<39-14,WILSON>那是我的听诊器?
<39-14,WILSON>is that my stethoscope?

749
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,140
<39-15,HOUSE>狗狗坏!
<39-15,HOUSE>Bad dog!

750

<39-16,WILSON>Pets are now allowed.

<39-16,WILSON>If you want to keep him,she wants a new puppy anyway.

754
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,890
<39-16,WILSON>她会理解的
<39-16,WILSON>She'll understand.

755
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,590
<39-17,HOUSE>我怎么会想留着他?
<39-17,HOUSE>Why would I wantto keep him?

756
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,070
<39-18,WILSON>你肯定?

<40-6,FOREMAN>and not even take a moment to question whether I'm doing the right thing.
