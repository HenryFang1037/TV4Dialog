120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,020
<6-8,Taub>也许给Natalie下毒的不是别人
<6-8,Taub>Maybe it wasn't thoseabckids who poisoned natalie.

121
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,820
<6-8,Taub>而是Natalie自己

<7-3,Natalie>In case I get a headache.

125

<8-1,Cuddy>Acetylcysteine could save her liver.

142
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,830
<8-1,Cuddy>但如果她真吃了那些药
<8-1,Cuddy>But we have to act fast.

143
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,500
<8-1,Cuddy>我们就得尽快采取其它治疗--

<8-1,Cuddy>好吧
<8-1,Cuddy>Okay.

<8-1,Cuddy>and it's like this secretiveabclittle stranger moved into her room.

148
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,630
<7-1,Natalie>我试着和她沟通

153
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,770
<9-3,Wilson>这就缩小了范围
<9-3,Wilson>That narrows it down.

154
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,100
<9-3,Wilson>把目标定在那些识字而且abc到过书店的人身上就行了
<9-3,Wilson>Just look for someone who knows howabcto reador has been to a bookstore.

155
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,150

163
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,150

<9-10,Taub>the natural response is to guessabcthe color of the paper it's wrapped in

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,870
<9-10,Taub>尔后又陷入了深深的沉默?

<9-11,Wilson>我以为会使他痛苦
<9-11,Wilson>I thought it would kill him.

170
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,100
<9-11,Wilson>然而...

<17-7,Cuddy>别跟我说你是指我想收养的婴儿
<17-7,Cuddy>You are not really making thisabcabout the baby I tried to adopt.

338
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
<17-8,House>已经几个星期了
<17-8,House>it's been a few weeks.

339
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,730
<17-8,House>够你走出伤感了
<17-8,House>Just enough time toabcget over hurt feelings.

<17-9,Cuddy>Natalie's 16.

341
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,960
<17-9,Cuddy>我想你把人性和母性混淆了
<17-9,Cuddy>I think you're confusing beingabcmaternal with being human.

342
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,820
<17-9,Cuddy>如果我们当初没排除蘑菇
<17-9,Cuddy>If we hadn'truledabcout the mushrooms--

343
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,680
<17-9,Cuddy>也许不该排除
<17-9,Cuddy>maybe we shouldn't have.

344
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,630
<17-10,Kutner>别管中毒了 想想过敏的可能
<17-10,Kutner>forget toxic--abcthink allergic.

345
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,660
<17-10,Kutner>严重的过敏可能引起肝衰竭abc呼吸停止和脑病
<17-10,Kutner>Severe mold allergy could cause, uh, liverabcfailure, respiratory arrest, and encephalopathy.

346
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,160
<17-11,Thirteen>她好几天前吃的蘑菇 不应该还在生病
<17-11,Thirteen>She ate the 's hrooms days ago.abcThere's no way she'd still be sick.

347
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,940
<17-12,House>除非她同时真菌感染
<17-12,House>Unless it also gaveabcher a fungal infection.

348
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,440
<17-12,House>给她做皮肤点刺 测试抗真菌药
<17-12,House>give her a prick test in antifungals.

<18-3,Foreman>-她还好?abc-是的

<18-4,Thirteen>她感到恶心 她说你让她挺过去?
<18-4,Thirteen>Her nausea-- she said youabctold her to, like, get over it?

353
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,840
<18-5,Foreman>然后呢?
<18-5,Foreman>And?

354
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,470
<18-6,Thirteen>恶心并非靠意志力就能挺过去的
<18-6,Thirteen>Nausea isn't something you canabcovercome with sheer will power.

355
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,910
<18-7,Foreman>我也没开给她意志力的方子
<18-7,Foreman>Which is why I didn't prescribe willpower.

356
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,070
<18-7,Foreman>给她开了抗酸剂
<18-7,Foreman>I prescribed antacids.

357
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,040
<18-7,Foreman>如果她挺不过去 早晚会离开试验
<18-7,Foreman>If she can't handle that, she'dabchave to leave the trial anyway.

358
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,970
<18-8,Thirteen>给她打电话 说你很抱歉 她就会回来
<18-8,Thirteen>Just call her,say you'reabcsorry. She'll come back.

359
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,350
<18-9,Foreman>不
<18-9,Foreman>No.

360
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,300
<18-10,Thirteen>你现在很像House
<18-10,Thirteen>God, you're acting like house now.

361
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,070
<18-11,Foreman>我可不像House 所以我也不需要道歉
<18-11,Foreman>No, I'm not acting like house, which isabcexactly why I don't need to apologize.

362
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,840
<18-11,Foreman>我既不残忍 也不想控制别人
<18-11,Foreman>I'm not being cruel. I'mabcnot being manipulative.

363
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,580
<18-12,Thirteen>我情绪不好的时候abc你跟我说了一模一样的话
<18-12,Thirteen>You said the same thing to me whenabcI told youI was having a hard time.

364
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,260
<18-13,Foreman>确实好用
<18-13,Foreman>And it worked.

365
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,840
<18-14,Thirteen>她是个四十岁的女人abc生理和心理都很糟糕
<18-14,Thirteen>She's a 40-year-old woman who's fallingabcapart physically and emotionally.

366
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,620
<18-14,Thirteen>她要死了
<18-14,Thirteen>She's dying.

367
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,410
<18-15,Foreman>我知道 圣诞节死人对你来说不好过
<18-15,Foreman>Look, I know seeing the ghostabcof your christmas future is tough.

368
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,090
<18-15,Foreman>但是我能帮她的唯一方法是abc让她遵守治疗要求
<18-15,Foreman>But the only way I can help her isabcto make sure she follows her regimen,

369
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,010
<18-15,Foreman>并非告诉她怎么活
<18-15,Foreman>not by becoming her life coach.

370
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,330
<18-16,Thirteen>你不是像House
<18-16,Thirteen>You're not acting like house.

371
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,430
<18-16,Thirteen>你根本就是他
<18-16,Thirteen>You are like him.

372
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,460
<19-1,Whitney>House医生?

<19-1,Whitney>这是我未婚夫 Geoff
<19-1,Whitney>This is my fianc? geoff.

374
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,180
<19-2,Geoff>她说 你跟她说坐在马桶圈上就可以怀孕
<19-2,Geoff>She says you told her you can getabcpregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.

375
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,120
<19-3,House>我说了那些词语 但设定了特殊的场景
<19-3,House>I said those words, butabcwith a particular inflection.

376
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,030
<19-4,Geoff>我知道那不是真的
<19-4,Geoff>I knew it was untrue.

377
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,140
<19-5,Whitney>还有其他可能性吗 绝无可能么?
<19-5,Whitney>Well, is there any otherabcway? Isn't it possible?

378
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,500
<19-6,House>报道说有个士兵abc在内战时期睾丸中了一枪
<19-6,House>There was a reported case of a civil warabcsoldier who was shot in the testicles,

379
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,310
<19-6,House>这个步枪子弹连同睾丸里的"子弹"
<19-6,House>and th musket ball carriedabcthe non-musket ball

380
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
<19-6,House>射到了在附近田野里劳作的女人子宫里
<19-6,House>into the uterus of a womanabcworking in a neighboring field.

<19-6,House>九个月后 神奇地生下了一个孩子
<19-6,House>Nine months later,aabcmiracle child was born.

382
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,620
<19-6,House>不过 也许她出轨了
<19-6,House>Also, maybe she cheated on you.

383
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,300
<19-7,Geoff>我们互相承诺
<19-7,Geoff>We made a promise.

385
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,450
<19-8,Whitney>有没有可能他的精子进入了子宫?
<19-8,Whitney>Couldn't some of his spermabchave made it up there somehow?

386
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,080
<19-9,House>准确点 精子是通过插入的阴茎来到子宫
<19-9,House>More likely,it came from the guy whoseabcpenis made it up there somehow. But...

387
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,720
<19-9,House>当然 任何事情都是可能的
<19-9,House>sure, anything's possible.

<19-10,Geoff>我想做亲子测试
<19-10,Geoff>I want a paternity test.

389

<19-11,House>Tell him that amnios are dangerousabcthis early onin the pregnancy.

<19-9,House>-是么?abc-谁在乎阿?他不知道
<19-9,House>- Are they?abc- Well, who cares? He doesn't know.

394
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,910
<20-3,Taub>如果是真菌过敏的话 就能解释病状
<20-3,Taub>If you had a mold allergy, itabcwould explain your symptoms.

395
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,860
<20-4,Kutner>我们会搞明白的 别担心
<20-4,Kutner>We'll find out what's wrong,don't worry.

396
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,330
<20-4,Kutner>我知道有些事情abc父母在身边的话不方便说
<20-4,Kutner>And, uh,I know some things are hardabcto talk about with your parents around,

397
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,130
<20-4,Kutner>但是同学确实恶劣
<20-4,Kutner>but kids can be really mean.

410

<21-2,Kutner>That only leaves guilt.abcWhat'd you do to her?

<21-11,Simon>我们曾是朋友
<21-11,Simon>We used to be friends.

<21-11,Simon>如果不被人取笑的话abc我现在还会做她的朋友
<21-11,Simon>And I'd be friends with her now if,abcyou know, people wouldn't make fun of me.

<21-12,Kutner>能跟我说点有用的么?
<21-12,Kutner>There's nothing youabccould tell us that'll help?

424
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,070
<21-13,Simon>她跟你们说过她以前喝很多酒么?
<21-13,Simon>Did she mention she used to drink a lot?

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,070
<21-14,Kutner>没有 你怎么知道的

<21-15,Simon>以前我每周都给她弄几瓶伏特加
<21-15,Simon>I used to get her a fewabcbottles of vodka each week.

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,840
<21-16,Kutner>那为什么不干了?

<21-17,Simon>She got her own I.D.Said itabcwas cheaper buying it herself.

<22-2,Cuddy>不知道你的肝脏为什么衰竭abc不能把你加到移植名单上
<22-2,Cuddy>We can't get you on the transplant listabcuntil we know why your liver is failing.

437
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,930
<22-2,Cuddy>酗酒能够解释
<22-2,Cuddy>Alcohol abuse would explain that.

438
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,540
<22-2,Cuddy>痉挛可能因戒酒引起
<22-2,Cuddy>The seizures could be from withdrawal.

445

<30-9,Wilson>委员会根本都不会看档案
<30-9,Wilson>The committee won't even open the file.

555
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,530
<30-9,Wilson>如果不能救命abc干吗要她吃化疗的那些苦呢
<30-9,Wilson>There's no reason to put a dying girl through aabcpainful treatment if it can't save her.

556
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,100
<30-9,Wilson>他这是好意
<30-9,Wilson>He's being kind.

557
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,300
<30-10,Cuddy>我让他们做活检
<30-10,Cuddy>I'll arrange a biopsy.

558
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,370
<31-1,Foreman>Burke夫人?
<31-1,Foreman>Mrs. Burke?

559
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,780
<31-1,Foreman>我们同时还在进行另一项试验
<31-1,Foreman>We are conducting anotherabctrial in tandem with yours.

560
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,660
<31-1,Foreman>一样的药 剂量要低
<31-1,Foreman>Same drug, lower dose.

561
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,860
<31-1,Foreman>恶心不会那么严重
<31-1,Foreman>The nausea will be less.

562
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,510
<31-1,Foreman>我查了一下 我可以给你换组
<31-1,Foreman>I did some checking. I can switch you.

563
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,090
<31-1,Foreman>要是你想回来 把表填下吧
<31-1,Foreman>Here's the forms if you want back in.

564
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,950
<31-1,Foreman>要是我们错了呢?
<31-1,Foreman>What if we're wrong?

565
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,530
<32-1,Cuddy>也许我们不该排除自体免疫疾病
<32-1,Cuddy>Maybe we shouldn't haveabcoverlooked autoimmunes.

566
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,740
<32-2,House>- 高沉降率...abc- 我们讨论过了
<32-2,House>- High sed rate--abc- we went over this.

567
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,380
<32-2,House>补体水平正常
<32-2,House>Normal complement level.

568
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,320
<32-3,Cuddy>所以不是肝纤维化
<32-3,Cuddy>So it isn't hepatic fibrosis.

569
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,520
<32-3,Cuddy>可能是微血管炎
<32-3,Cuddy>Could still beabcmicroangiopathic vasculitis.

570
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,310
<32-3,Cuddy>用高剂量的类固醇 说不定能够...
<32-3,Cuddy>With high-dose steroids,abcwe might be able to reverse--

571
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,250
<32-4,House>你管这家医院 每天治上万人
<32-4,House>you run a hospital that treatsabcthousands of patients every day.

572
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,660
<32-4,House>有些救不活 天天如此
<32-4,House>Some of them die. Every day.

573
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:08,040
<32-4,House>如果对每个人你都这么上心...
<32-4,House>If you're gonna get this workedabcup over every one of them--

574
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,810
<32-4,House>好的!
<32-4,House>yes!

575
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,710
<32-5,Cuddy>- 马上回来abc- 是什么?
<32-5,Cuddy>- B. R. B.abc- What is it?

576
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,660
<32-6,House>病人送的礼物
<32-6,House>Thank you from a patient.

577
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,020
<32-7,Cuddy>给你的?
<32-7,Cuddy>For you?

578
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:25,210
<32-8,House>我告诉他们 她怀孕是单性生殖abc从而拯救了他们的婚姻
<32-8,House>I saved her marriage by showing that herabcpregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis.

579
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,360
<32-9,Cuddy>人的单性生殖? 你证明了...
<32-9,Cuddy>Human parthenogenesis?Youabcproved--

580
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,750
<32-10,House>是啊 真难以置信
<32-10,House>yep. It's unbelievable.

581
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,820
<32-10,House>但我亲自检查了5遍
<32-10,House>But I personally checked it five times.

582
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,360
<32-11,Cuddy>你怎么查了5遍?
<32-11,Cuddy>How did you check it five times?

583
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,610
<32-11,Cuddy>扩增仪坏了 你必须送出去abc至少要...
<32-11,Cuddy>The cycler's broken, you would have hadabcto send it out.It would have taken--

584
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,470
<32-12,House>是啊...
<32-12,House>oh, yeah.

585
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,030
<32-12,House>确实挺不可能的 现在想想
<32-12,House>That does sound impossible,abcnow that I think of it.

586
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,700
<32-12,House>可能更好的解释是abc亲子鉴定表明她偷情了
<32-12,House>I guessthe better explanation is thatabcthe paternity test showed she cheated

587
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,760
<32-12,House>所以单性生殖是我自己伪造的
<32-12,House>so I faked theabcwhole parthenogenesis thingy.

588
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,170
<32-13,Cuddy>什么? 为什么?
<32-13,Cuddy>What? Why?

589
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,010
<32-14,House>我赢了
<32-14,House>I win.

590
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,900
<32-15,Cuddy>你编出个科学奇迹abc就为了赢和Wilson打的赌?
<32-15,Cuddy>You fakeda scientific miracleabcjust to win a bet with wilson?

591
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,550
<32-16,House>嗯 更像是个争论
<32-16,House>Mmm, more an argument.

592
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,410
<32-16,House>我知道直接造假亲子鉴定更容易
<32-16,House>I realize it would have been simplerabcto just fake the paternity test,

593
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,380
<32-16,House>但是 现在可是圣诞节呐
<32-16,House>but hey--christmas spiritabcand all that.

594
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,510
<32-17,Cuddy>我觉得你又善恶不分了
<32-17,Cuddy>I think you'reabcconfusing nice and evil again.

595
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,310
<32-17,Cuddy>让妻子欺骗丈夫 发明个处女生子abc好方便你...
<32-17,Cuddy>Letting a woman deceive her husband byabcinventing a virgin birth just so you can--

596
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,500
<32-18,House>要是孩子在圣诞那天出生会更贴切
<32-18,House>and it obviously would have been more fittingabcif the baby had been born on christmas,

597
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,160
<32-18,House>而不仅仅是在那天发明
<32-18,House>not just invted then.

598
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,000
<32-19,Cuddy>不是白血病
<32-19,Cuddy>It's not leukemia.

599
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,930
<32-19,Cuddy>癫痫 肝衰竭
<32-19,Cuddy>Seizures,liverabcfailure--

600
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,320
<32-19,Cuddy>是子痫
<32-19,Cuddy>it's eclampsia.

601
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,810
<32-20,House>这就是说不是一个救不活
<32-20,House>This means we don'thaveabcone dead patient.

602
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,390
<32-20,House>而是两个
<32-20,House>We have two.

603
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,930
<33-1,Cuddy>你患了子痫
<33-1,Cuddy>you have a disease called eclampsia.

604
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,860
<33-1,Cuddy>导致肝衰竭 肺水肿 癫痫
<33-1,Cuddy>It causes liver failure,pulmonaryabcedema, and seizures.

605
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,160
<33-1,Cuddy>也跟心肌病有关系
<33-1,Cuddy>It's also associatedabcwith cardiomyopathy.

606
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,050
<3-3,Thirteen>那是怀孕了才会得的病
<3-3,Thirteen>That's a pregnancy disease.

607
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,950
<3-4,House>她入院的时候你查过
<3-4,House>You tested her when she came in.

608
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,210
<3-4,House>可能在生产1个月内得子痫
<3-4,House>Uh, you can get eclampsia upabcto a month after giving birth.

609
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,580
<33-1,Cuddy>太荒唐了
<33-1,Cuddy>That's ridiculous.

610
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,360
<33-2,Cuddy>她怀孕了 我们怎么会都不知道?
<33-2,Cuddy>How could she hide a pregnancy?

611
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,510
<33-3,Cuddy>肥大的衣服 她本身体格就比较大
<33-3,Cuddy>Loose clothes. She's heavy to begin with.

612
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
<33-3,Cuddy>可能是早产
<33-3,Cuddy>It was probably premature.

613
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,320
<33-3,Cuddy>如果是3个礼拜之前abc体检的时候可能查不出来
<33-3,Cuddy>If it was three weeks ago, they couldabchave missed it on a physical exam.

614
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,710
<33-3,Cuddy>你戒酒就是因为孩子 是吧?
<33-3,Cuddy>The baby's why youabcquit drinking,isn't it?

615
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,750
<33-3,Cuddy>所以你问我我有没有孩子
<33-3,Cuddy>Why you asked me if I had kids.

616
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,870
<33-3,Cuddy>所以你才会觉得内疚
<33-3,Cuddy>Why you feel guilty.

<33-4,Natalie>对不起

624
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,480
<33-6,Natalie>我本来想送去领养
<33-6,Natalie>I was gonna give it away.

<33-6,Natalie>街那边有栋空房子 但是她却没气了
<33-6,Natalie>There was this empty house down theabcstreet, but then she wasn't breathing.
