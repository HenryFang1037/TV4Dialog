<1-1,Miles>主啊  女士们
<1-1,Miles>My lords, and ladies.

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,630
<1-1,Miles>今天你们的王后就要选出她的勇士
<1-1,Miles>Today your queen will choose her champion.

3
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,800
<1-1,Miles>此刻  他不仅将为了她的荣耀而战
<1-1,Miles>Here, he will battle for not only her honor,

4
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,770
<1-1,Miles>也将为他自己的头衔而战
<1-1,Miles>but for a title of his own.

5
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,040
<1-2,Miles>但只有打败我的侍卫长
<1-2,Miles>But only if he can defeat the Captain of my guard,

6
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,100
<1-2,Miles>黑爵士  贺拉斯
<1-2,Miles>Sir Horace the Black!

7

8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,600
<1-3,Shannon>你愿意为了我的荣耀而战么

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,300
<1-4,William>直至战死  王后殿下
<1-4,William>To the death, your majesty.

10
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,370
<1-5,Shannon>让我们祈祷不至于此  好吗
<1-5,Shannon>Let's hope it does not come to that, eh?

11
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,110
<1-5,Shannon>我选择威廉姆爵士为我的勇士
<1-5,Shannon>I choose Sir William as my champion.

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,560
<1-6,Shannon>攻击他的左侧
<1-6,Shannon>Attack from his left side.

13
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,650
<1-6,Shannon>今早我看到他的侍卫在包扎肩部
<1-6,Shannon>I saw his squire bandaging that shoulder this morning.

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,730
<1-6,Shannon>我祝你好运  赐你力量
<1-6,Shannon>I wish thee luck and strength.

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,080
<1-7,William>我感到需要全部我能得到的
<1-7,William>I feel I shall need all I can get.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,170

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,150
<1-8,Miles>黑爵士  贺拉斯
<1-8,Miles>Sir Horace the Black!

18
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,440
<1-9,Miles>我的王后  你确定不再考虑你的选择吗
<1-9,Miles>Are you sure you wouldn't like to reconsider your choice, my queen?

19
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,530
<1-10,Shannon>我相信我的选择是正确的  国王
<1-10,Shannon>I believe I chose rightly, my king.

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,910
<1-12,Miles>勇敢骑士们 以这片土地光荣的传统  现在开始
<1-12,Miles>Brave knights, in the honored tradition of our lands, have at ye!

21
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,710
<1-13,Miles>我觉得你选错了  亲爱的
<1-13,Miles>I feel you chose most poorly, my love.

22
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,960
<1-14,Chanting Crowd>威廉姆  威廉姆
<1-14,Chanting Crowd>William! William!

23
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,280

<2-4,Sam>抱歉  我不知道有人在家

<2-4,Sam>James had an early call, and I was just leaving.

37
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,220
<2-7,House>豪斯  很高兴认识你
<2-7,House>House. Nice to meet you.

38
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,440
<2-8,Sam>要是你能穿上这个就更好了
<2-8,Sam>It'd be nicer if you'd put this on.

39
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,060
<2-9,House>那么  你和威尔森
<2-9,House>So you and Wilson...

40

<2-10,Sam>以为你昨晚呆在纽约了
<2-10,Sam>thought you were staying in New York last night.

41
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,450
<2-11,House>对不起 一定是没看到外面的"请勿打扰" 了
<2-11,House>Sorry, must have missed the "if this trailer be a-rockin" sign out front.

42
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:15,770
<2-12,Sam>我真的晚了 要是可以假装什么也没发生
<2-12,Sam>I'm really late, so if there's any chancethat we can pretend this never happened,

43
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,490
<2-12,Sam>我完全没有意见
<2-12,Sam>I'd be completely fine with that.

44
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,490
<3-1,Foreman>8岁小孩  耳朵流血
<3-1,Foreman>An eight-year-old with bleeding ears.

45

<3-2,Chase>我马上就能看你耳朵流血 再你给个彻底的肌肉退化
<3-2,Chase>I'll see your bleeding ears and raise you a total muscular degeneration.

46
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,990
<3-3,Taub>搞什么
<3-3,Taub>What the hell?

47
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,440
<3-4,Thirteen>我曾做过这样的梦
<3-4,Thirteen>I had a dream like this once.

48
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,620
<3-4,Thirteen>结果可不妙
<3-4,Thirteen>It didn't end well.

49
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,820
<3-5,House>好啊  我忠诚的农夫们
<3-5,House>Huzzah, my loyal peasants!

50
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,370
<3-6,Foreman>豪斯  你在干什么
<3-6,Foreman>House, what are you doing?

51
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,970
<3-7,House>在戈尔茨坦[诺贝尔医学奖]的割礼中代替山谬尔·拉比
<3-7,House>Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl at the Goldstein bris.

52
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,890
<3-7,House>我忙的时候
<3-7,House>While I'm busy,

53
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,200
<3-7,House>你们能去看看楼下急症里的骑士
<3-7,House>you all can check out the Knight down in the E.R.,

54
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,520
<3-7,House>没有夺得王冠  癫痫却发作了
<3-7,House>who, instead of seizing the throne, just seized.

55
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,020
<3-8,Taub>他在文艺复兴艺术节上工作吗
<3-8,Taub>He works at a Renaissance Festival?

56
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,120
<3-9,House>不在那里工作  他住在那里 作为小剧团
<3-9,House>Doesn't work there, he lives there as part of a wonderful little troupe,

57
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,680
<3-9,House>于周末时重现伟大的时代
<3-9,House>who spend their weekends reenacting a nobler age,

58
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
<3-9,House>当人们随地解手时
<3-9,House>when people crapped in the streets,

59
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,690
<3-9,House>十三会是一个祖母
<3-9,House>and thirteen would have been a grandmother.

60
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,050
<3-10,Thirteen>是数周  不是周末
<3-10,Thirteen>Weeks, not weekends.

61
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,950
<3-10,Thirteen>这里写着  他已经露营一个月了
<3-10,Thirteen>Says here he's been camping out for a month.

62
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,700
<3-11,House>用笔试试看
<3-11,House>Try doing that with a pen.

63
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,570
<3-12,Foreman>在你杀了我们中的一个前 为何不把那个放下呢
<3-12,Foreman>Why don't you put that down before you kill one of us?

64
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,950
<3-13,House>更好的主意 为何不给我点有用的东西
<3-13,House>Better idea, why don't you give me something I can use

65
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,200
<3-13,House>那样就没必要了
<3-13,House>so I won't feel the need to?

66
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,230
<3-14,Foreman>争斗后的癫痫发作显然提示脑震荡
<3-14,Foreman>Seizure right after a fight obviously suggests concussion.

67
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,090
<3-15,Chase>显然  不是不然急诊不会找豪斯
<3-15,Chase>Obviously it isn't, or the E.R. wouldn't have called House.

68
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,890
<3-16,Taub>全套盔甲能防止明显外伤
<3-16,Taub>A full set of armor would protect againt visible trauma,

69
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,900
<3-16,Taub>但不能防止可传递震荡力
<3-16,Taub>but not transmitted concussive force.

70
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,030
<3-16,Taub>可能是硬膜下血肿
<3-16,Taub>Could be a subdural hematoma.

71
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,540
<3-17,House>你们忘了魔鬼附体了
<3-17,House>You're forgetting to demonize.

72
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,720
<3-18,Taub>恶魔  邪恶的硬膜下血肿
<3-18,Taub>An evil, satanic subdural hematoma.

73
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,350
<3-18,Taub>不是
<3-18,Taub>No.

74
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,500
<3-19,House>两只恶魔的眼睛
<3-19,House>Two demon eyes.

75
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,360
<3-19,House>巩膜出血
<3-19,House>Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.

76
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,840
<3-20,Thirteen>可能是对文艺复兴文艺节上的东西过敏
<3-20,Thirteen>Could be an allergic reaction to something from the Renaissance Fair.

77
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,740
<3-21,House>因此我们要检查一下中世纪
<3-21,House>Which is why we need to check out middle earth.

78
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,310
<3-21,House>福曼  带上佛罗多[魔戒人物]和霍比人[魔戒人物]分享面包
<3-21,House>Foreman, take Frodo and break bread with the Hobbits.

79
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,870
<3-22,Taub>我仍然认为血肿更有可能
<3-22,Taub>I still think a hematoma is more likely.

80
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,130
<3-23,House>所以你和奇斯去做核磁共振
<3-23,House>That's why you and Chase are gonna get an MRI.

81
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,610
<3-24,Taub>但你刚
<3-24,Taub>But you just--

82
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,600
<3-25,House>我说了佛罗多  不是咕噜[指环王人物]
<3-25,House>I said Frodo, not Gollum.

83
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,670
<3-26,Thirteen>他是说我腿短吗 或者是脚上多毛吗
<3-26,Thirteen>Is he saying I have short legs or hairy feet?

84
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,510
<3-27,Chase>我都不知道谁是佛罗多
<3-27,Chase>I don't even know who Frodo is.

85
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,660
<4-1,House>那个小妞是谁  为什么要藏着
<4-1,House>Who's the chick, and why are you hiding her?

86
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,850
<4-2,Wilson>昨晚你在家吗
<4-2,Wilson>You were home last night?

87
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,110
<4-3,House>还有今早
<4-3,House>And this morning.

88
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,800
<4-3,House>我撞见你的宝贝  光着
<4-3,House>I bumped into your babe, naked.

89
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,200
<4-4,Wilson>我告诉过你别进我的浴室
<4-4,Wilson>I told you to stay out of my bathroom.

90
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,140
<4-5,House>我在厨房
<4-5,House>I was in the kitchen.

91
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,470
<4-6,Wilson>她没穿衣服在厨房吗
<4-6,Wilson>She was naked in the kitchen?

92
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,240
<4-7,House>我没穿
<4-7,House>I was naked.

93
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,520
<4-8,Wilson>你为什么不穿衣服去厨房
<4-8,Wilson>Why the hell were you naked in the kitchen?

94
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
<4-9,House>眼下这个不重要了
<4-9,House>Uh, it's not important right now.

95
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,010
<4-9,House>重要的是  为何一开始你就不想我见她
<4-9,House>What is, is why you didn't want me to meet her in the first place.

96
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,030
<4-9,House>她结婚了吗 没有
<4-9,House>Is she married?  No.

97
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,110
<4-11,House>是病人吗
<4-11,House>A patient?

98
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
<4-12,Wilson>我没时间谈这个
<4-12,Wilson>I don't have time for this.

99
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,630
<4-13,House>她过去是男的
<4-13,House>She used to be a man.

100
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,270
<4-14,Wilson>豪斯
<4-14,Wilson>House!

101
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,690
<4-15,House>她想成为一个男的
<4-15,House>She wants to be a man.

102
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,760
<4-15,House>山姆  是一个男人的名字  全称是
<4-15,House>Sam--it's a man's name, short for...

103
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,630
<4-16,House>萨曼莎
<4-16,House>Samantha.

104
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,500
<4-16,House>我们相遇前你娶过的没有灵魂的女妖
<4-16,House>The soulless harpy you were married to before we met.

105
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,660
<4-17,Wilson>人是会变的  豪斯
<4-17,Wilson>People change, House.

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,840
<4-18,House>当然  变老  卵巢开始枯竭
<4-18,House>Sure. They get older, ovaries start drying up,

107
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,940
<4-18,House>如你般的好男人会焕发第二春
<4-18,House>and nice guys like you look attractive again.

108
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,140
<4-19,Wilson>听着  我了解  在你的疯狂的想法中
<4-19,Wilson>Listen, I know that, in your own demented way,

109
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,520
<4-19,Wilson>你觉得  你在帮我留心
<4-19,Wilson>you think you're looking out for me.

110
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,250
<4-19,Wilson>但是我的事
<4-19,Wilson>But I have this.

111
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,570
<4-20,House>说到你的事  你的意思是 心中感到低落么
<4-20,House>By this, you mean a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach.

112
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,090
<4-20,House>行了  我懂
<4-20,House>Fine. I get it.

113
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,080
<4-20,House>是你的人生  你去搞砸吧
<4-20,House>It's your life. You go screw it up.

114
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,800
<4-21,Wilson>我能等  等什么
<4-21,Wilson>I can wait.For what?

115
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,140
<4-22,House>等着告诉你"我早说过"
<4-22,House>To tell you, "I told you so."

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,640
<5-1,Chase>没有血肿迹象

117
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,600
<5-1,Chase>脑部看上去完全正常
<5-1,Chase>Brain looks completely normal.

118
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,630
<5-2,Taub>一切正常  除了一个方面 他喜欢玩角色扮演
<5-2,Taub>Normal, except for the fact that he likes to play dress-up.

119
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,270
<5-3,Chase>我叔叔曾经假装他是利奥波德之王
<5-3,Chase>My Uncle used to pretend he was King Leopold.

120
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
<5-4,William>我不是在假装
<5-4,William>I'm not pretending.

121
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,820
<5-5,Chase>不好意思
<5-5,Chase>Um, sorry about that.

122
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,380
<5-5,Chase>你不会是真把自己当成是个骑士吧
<5-5,Chase>You don't really think you're a Knight, do you?

123
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,220
<5-6,William>骑士生涯并不是一场游戏
<5-6,William>Being a Knight isn't a game.

124
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,640
<5-6,William>这是一种生活格调
<5-6,William>It's a lifestyle,

125
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,430
<5-6,William>我们每天都以这种方式生活着  而不是只在角色扮演时才这么干
<5-6,William>and we do it every day,not just when we play dress-up.

126
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,270
<5-6,William>我们有着生活准则  坚持美好的信念
<5-6,William>We live by a code and uphold ideals

127
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,630
<5-6,William>比如忠诚  勇气  谦逊
<5-6,William>like loyalty, courage, humility.

128
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,530
<5-7,Taub>那么你们穿着盔甲  互相往死里打也算是其中的一种喽
<5-7,Taub>And the part where you beat the crap out of each other in armor?

129
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,990
<5-8,William>那只是我们为了娱乐才作的
<5-8,William>That we do for fun.

130
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,150
<5-8,William>至少到昨天为止还是这么回事
<5-8,William>At least it was up until yesterday.

131
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,000
<5-8,William>我们是不是快结束了
<5-8,William>Are--are we almost done?

132
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,670
<5-8,William>因为我感觉有点
<5-8,William>'Cause I'm feeling--

133
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,060
<5-9,Chase>我们得在他呕吐之前把他弄出来
<5-9,Chase>let's get him out of there before he aspirates.

134
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,150
<6-1,Foreman>核磁共振有没有检查出什么异常呢
<6-1,Foreman>anything abnormal on the MRI?

135
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,170
<6-2,Man at Faire>天哪
<6-2,Man at Faire>God's teeth,

136
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,100
<6-2,Man at Faire>这些衣服着实古怪
<6-2,Man at Faire>what strange manner of garments be these?

137
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,960
<6-3,Foreman>好  我们很快就回去
<6-3,Foreman>Okay, we'll be back soon.

138
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,190
<6-4,Man at Faire>此男还手握此等微小异怪之物
<6-4,Man at Faire>He consorts with tiny demons in his hand.

139
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,620
<6-4,Man at Faire>此乃巫蛊之物
<6-4,Man at Faire>'Tis witchcraft, I say!

140
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,900
<6-5,Foreman>我看起来像是到这里来陪你们玩得吗
<6-5,Foreman>Do I look like I'm here to play pretend with you?

141
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,560
<6-6,Thirteen>放轻松  他们不是在针对你
<6-6,Thirteen>Relax, it's not personal.

142
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,190
<6-6,Thirteen>你可以告诉他们你是穿梭时空的旅行者之类的谎话
<6-6,Thirteen>Just tell them you're a time traveler or something.

143
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,260
<6-6,Thirteen>可是  既然我们都已经来了 不如就好好享受一下
<6-6,Thirteen>Well, if we're gonna be here, we might as well enjoy it.

144
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,630
<6-7,Foreman>我们的骑士大人刚刚在核磁共振器里吐了
<6-7,Foreman>Our Knight just vomited inside the MRI.

145
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,320
<6-7,Foreman>陶博认为他可能是食物中毒
<6-7,Foreman>Taub thinks it might be food poisoning...

146
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,540
<6-8,Foreman>这也难怪
<6-8,Foreman>which shouldn't be surprising--

147
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,080
<6-8,Foreman>露天公厕  在牲畜棚旁
<6-8,Foreman>outdoor latrines, food prep going on

148
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,220
<6-8,Foreman>处理食物
<6-8,Foreman>next to livestock.

149
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,330
<6-9,Miles>吾闻尔等欲问威廉姆骑士之事
<6-9,Miles>I hear you wish to speak with me,

150
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,550
<6-9,Miles>他可安好 不是太好
<6-9,Miles>concerning Sir William. How faireth he? Not well,

151
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,790
<6-10,Foreman>不然我们也不会到这里来
<6-10,Foreman>or we wouldn't be here.

152
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,610
<6-11,Miles>真乃顽疾是也
<6-11,Miles>A pox indeed is--

153
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
<6-11,Miles>迈尔斯  [别装古人说话了]
<6-11,Miles>Miles.

154
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,640
<6-12,Shannon>我们还以为只是脑震荡
<6-12,Shannon>We just thought it was a concussion.

155
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,450
<6-13,Miles>他会好起来吧
<6-13,Miles>He's gonna be okay, right?

156
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,850
<6-14,Thirteen>我们需要查看一下他宿营的地方
<6-14,Thirteen>We need to look at the area he was camping out in.

157
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,360
<6-15,Foreman>你也许需要在这个王国里搞个全民护牙计划
<6-15,Foreman>And you might want to invest into a dental plan for the kingdom.

158
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,660
<7-1,Miles>你确定他是从这里得的病吗
<7-1,Miles>You sure he got sick from something here?

159
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,050
<7-2,Foreman>我们现在还无法断言  但是
<7-2,Foreman>We're not sure of anything yet, but...

160
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,830
<7-3,Foreman>你认为这是什么
<7-3,Foreman>What do you make of this?

161
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,580
<7-4,Thirteen>看起来像是呕吐物
<7-4,Thirteen>Hmm... looks like vomit.

162
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,390
<7-4,Thirteen>这就说明他在决斗前就已经显示出病症了
<7-4,Thirteen>Means he was showing symptoms prior to the fight.

163
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,720
<7-5,Foreman>没错  可我指的是这个
<7-5,Foreman>True, but I meant this.

164
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,050
<7-6,Miles>噢  这是个牛眼
<7-6,Miles>Oh, it's a cow eye.

165
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,710
<7-6,Miles>是比武大赛的前夜大餐
<7-6,Miles>From the night before the tournament.

166
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,760
<7-7,Shannon>他让骑士们吃各种各样恶心的东西
<7-7,Shannon>He makes the Knights eat all kinds of disgusting stuff.

167
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,520
<7-8,Thirteen>为什么
<7-8,Thirteen>Why?

168
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,400
<7-9,Shannon>他是从恐惧元素那个节目里得来的灵感
<7-9,Shannon>He got the idea from Fear Factor.

169
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,570
<7-10,Foreman>他怎么在入院时没有提起呢
<7-10,Foreman>Why didn't he mention it when he checked into the hospital?

170
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,860
<7-11,Miles>我让他们发誓对这个仪式保密的
<7-11,Miles>I make them all take an oath of secrecy about the ritual.

171
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,480
<7-11,Miles>威廉姆非常认真地扮演 地对待骑士这个角色
<7-11,Miles>William tends to take his role as a Knight very seriously.

172
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,830
<7-12,Shannon>你认为这是导致他昏迷的原因吗
<7-12,Shannon>Do you think that's what caused him to pass out?

173
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,700
<8-1,Taub>这可一点都不卫生
<8-1,Taub>That's not exactly sanitary.

174
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,280
<8-2,House>有趣的东西从来都不卫生
<8-2,House>Fun stuff never is.

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,910
<8-3,Thirteen>极为严重的细菌性感染食物中毒可以解释癫痫和呕吐病症
<8-3,Thirteen>Serious bacterial food poisoning explains seizure and vomiting.

176
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,560
<8-4,Chase>做个腰椎穿刺可以证实这点
<8-4,Chase>A lumbar puncture could confirm.

177
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,110
<8-5,House>可是这不是食物中毒
<8-5,House>Except it's not food poisoning.

178
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,390
<8-5,House>如果是的话急诊室现在就会像亚瑟王的宫殿般繁华了
<8-5,House>If it was, the E.R. Would look like Camelot right now.

179
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,520
<8-6,Foreman>要想引起食物中毒 你只需要吃个腐坏的眼球
<8-6,Foreman>All it takes is one bad eyeball.

180
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,750
<8-7,Thirteen>或是睾丸 牛脑  或是我的个人推荐
<8-7,Thirteen>Or testicle, cow brain, or my personal favorite,

181
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,910
<8-7,Thirteen>猪肠子加上括约肌作
<8-7,Thirteen>pig rectum, with a side order

182
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,540
<8-7,Thirteen>佐菜
<8-7,Thirteen>of sphincter.

183
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,180
<8-8,Taub>我想在澳洲人们叫这种食物为早餐
<8-8,Taub>I think they call that breakfast in Australia.

184
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,250
<8-9,House>没人因此得病
<8-9,House>No one else was sick,

185
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,900
<8-9,House>那是因为他们不像他那么过敏
<8-9,House>because they weren't allergic like he was.

186
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,460
<8-10,Foreman>对什么过敏
<8-10,Foreman>To what?

187
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,630
<8-11,House>这就是我需要把你送到地心去找寻的东西
<8-11,House>That's what I sent you to middle earth to find out.

188
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,710
<8-11,House>用你取回的样本去做个划痕试验
<8-11,House>Run scratch tests for the samples you brought back.

189
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,280
<8-12,Chase>那需要花时间  而他的状况正在变糟
<8-12,Chase>That's gonna take time, and he's getting worse.

190
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,210
<8-13,House>那就先给他上肾上腺素
<8-13,House>So treat him with epinephrine too.

191
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,490
<9-1,Foreman>这个应该能阻止新病症的出现
<9-1,Foreman>This should prevent any more symptoms

192
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,740
<9-1,Foreman>我们就有足够的时间来找出你的过敏源
<9-1,Foreman>until we can figure out what it is you're allergic to.

193
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,470
<9-2,William>多谢
<9-2,William>Thanks.

194
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,240
<9-3,Shannon>我告诉过你不该把那些东西都吃了
<9-3,Shannon>Told you you shouldn't have eaten all that stuff.

195
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,040
<9-4,William>你真的不用待在这里
<9-4,William>You know, you don't have to stay.

196
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,530
<9-4,William>我知道你和迈尔斯为了处理婚礼
<9-4,William>I'm sure you and Miles are crazy busy,

197
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,710
<9-4,William>和相关的事情都快忙疯了
<9-4,William>what with the wedding and all.

198
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,130
<9-5,Shannon>迈尔斯说我们会把婚礼延期到
<9-5,Shannon>Miles said we could postpone it until--

199
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,520
<9-6,William>别担心  我会好起来的
<9-6,William>don't worry. I'll be fine.

200
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,680
<9-6,William>我会出席你们婚礼的
<9-6,William>I'll be there.

201
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,250
<9-6,William>我只希望你们能找个好的摄影师
<9-6,William>I just hope you have a good photographer,

202
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,220
<9-6,William>我可不觉得普通摄影师能够处理好我的这个红眼问题
<9-6,William>'cause I don't think the standard red-eye filter is gonna work on these.

203
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,530
<9-7,Thirteen>把右臂伸出来
<9-7,Thirteen>I need your right arm.

204
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,940
<9-8,William>那个
<9-8,William>That, uh...

205
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,930
<9-8,William>觉得
<9-8,William>Feels--

206
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,310
<9-8,William>我感觉有点奇怪
<9-8,William>feels strange.

207
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,200
<9-9,Shannon>怎么了  哪儿不对
<9-9,Shannon>What is it? What's wrong?

208
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,130
<9-10,Thirteen>他的心跳变的不规律了
<9-10,Thirteen>His heart rate's become irregular.

209
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,870
<9-11,William>我胸口疼  我觉得它就要炸开了
<9-11,William>My--my chest hurts. It feels like it's gonna explode.

210
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,260
<9-12,Foreman>心动过速  我们要把心跳击回正常频率
<9-12,Foreman>Tachycardia--we need to shock him back into rhythm.

211
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,670
<9-13,Shannon>天哪  威廉姆
<9-13,Shannon>Oh, my God, William.

212
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,830
<9-14,Thirteen>把他的上衣揭开
<9-14,Thirteen>I need his gown open.

213
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,820
<9-15,William>这  这是什么东西
<9-15,William>What is-- what is that stuff?

214
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,290
<9-16,Foreman>我不知道
<9-16,Foreman>I don't know.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,480
<10-1,Foreman>这绝对不是过敏
<10-1,Foreman>It's definitely not an allergy,

216
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,230
<10-1,Foreman>不然肾上腺素应该缓解症状而不是加剧症状
<10-1,Foreman>or the eppy would have helped him, not made him worse.

217
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,610
<10-2,House>除非他既是过敏生病 又对对治疗药剂亚硫酸氢钠过敏
<10-2,House>Unless he's allergic and allergic to the cure.Sodium bisulfite--

218
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,490
<10-2,House>肾上腺素药品中的能使药物快速生效
<10-2,House>the preservative that keeps eppy peppy--

219
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,990
<10-2,House>的添加剂会导致心动过速
<10-2,House>can cause tachycardia.

220
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,200
<10-3,Taub>预激综合征一样会导致心动过速
<10-3,Taub>So can wolff-parkinson-white syndrome,

221
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,540
<10-3,Taub>它还会引起眼部充血
<10-3,Taub>and it also causes hemorrhaging in the eyes.

222
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
<10-4,Chase>以及心电通道异常
<10-4,Chase>And abnormal electrical pathways in the heart,

223
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,450
<10-4,Chase>继而引起癫痫
<10-4,Chase>which could cause seizures.

224
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,540
<10-5,Foreman>但它不会引起皮肤感染
<10-5,Foreman>But not skin infections.

225
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,970
<10-6,Thirteen>有一种感染
<10-6,Thirteen>There is an infection that can cause

226
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,940
<10-6,Thirteen>会引起皮肤和神经损伤  而且迅速传播 并无法医治
<10-6,Thirteen>skin and neurological damage and spreads rapidly without treatment.

227
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,600
<10-7,Foreman>耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌[MRSA]
<10-7,Foreman>Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus?

228
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,220
<10-8,House>我们的骑士感染了MRSA
<10-8,House>Lord have MRSA.

229
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,730
<10-9,Thirteen>你在把他心脏电击回正常心率时 没有带手套
<10-9,Thirteen>You weren't wearing gloves when we shocked his heartback into rhythm.

230
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
<10-10,House>我确信你会没事的
<10-10,House>I'm sure you'll be fine.

231
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,930
<10-10,House>你们两个带着样本到实验室去确认
<10-10,House>You two get a sample to the lab to confirm,

232
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,200
<10-10,House>你带骑士去隔离病房给他静脉注射抗生素
<10-10,House>you get the Knight into isolation and on I.V. Antibiotics.

233
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,220
<10-10,House>你  离我远一点
<10-10,House>You... stay away from me.

234
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,560
<11-1,House>我们需要谈一下
<11-1,House>Need to talk.

235
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,470
<11-2,Cuddy>关于MRSA吗  我都知道了  我们
<11-2,Cuddy>About the MRSA? I know, we're--

236
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,730
<11-3,House>不是什么MRSA不MRSA的
<11-3,House>MRSA, shmrsa.

237
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,860
<11-4,Cuddy>是些重要的事你是指那些你认为是比
<11-4,Cuddy>Something important. Something you think is more important

238
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,110
<11-4,Cuddy>那些可以像野火般传遍整个医院的
<11-4,Cuddy>than the potentially lethal bacteria

239
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,910
<11-4,Cuddy>致命细菌更为重要的事
<11-4,Cuddy>spreading like wildfire through my hospital?

240
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,020
<11-4,Cuddy>那么范围就已经缩小到 那些有关私人的  愚蠢的事情了
<11-4,Cuddy>Well, that narrows it down to something personal and stupid.

241
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,760
<11-5,House>威尔森
<11-5,House>Wilson.

242
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,940
<11-6,Cuddy>刚好证实了我的理论
<11-6,Cuddy>Theory confirmed.

243
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,350
<11-6,Cuddy>他在和他的第一任妻子约会  我知道
<11-6,Cuddy>He is dating his first wife. I know.

244
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,880
<11-7,House>我不信
<11-7,House>I don't believe it.

245
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,180
<11-8,Cuddy>你不信他居然没有先征得你的同意吗
<11-8,Cuddy>That he didn't ask your permission first?

246
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,850
<11-9,House>不  我惊讶的是他竟然有事情能瞒住我
<11-9,House>No, that he's actually capable of keeping a secret from me.

247
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,840
<11-10,Cuddy>是么  威尔森没告诉你的事情可多着呢
<11-10,Cuddy>Well, you'd be surprised how many things Wilson doesn't tell you.

248
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,650
<11-11,House>真的
<11-11,House>Would I?

249
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,550
<11-11,House>比如  你和你爸最好的朋友 上床的事吗
<11-11,House>Like... Like how you slept with your father's best friend or...

250
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,680
<11-12,Cuddy>他死定了
<11-12,Cuddy>I'm gonna kill him.

251
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,820
<11-13,House>你得劝他们分手
<11-13,House>You need to break them up.

252
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,230
<11-14,Cuddy>没门
<11-14,Cuddy>Forget it.

253
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,190
<11-15,House>你就打算袖手旁观等着看那金发魔鬼故伎重演
<11-15,House>So you'd rather sit back and watch while the evil blonde gorges on Wilson's tender flesh

254
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,760
<11-15,House>再把威尔森敏感的心撕成碎片吗
<11-15,House>and then tosses out his bones like she did the last time?

255
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,980
<11-15,House>你记得他跟她分手之后的样子吧
<11-15,House>You remember what he was like after that?

256
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,710
<11-16,Cuddy>我记得
<11-16,Cuddy>Yes, I do.

257
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,270
<11-17,House>这就是了  行动吧
<11-17,House>Well, then do something.

258
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,900
<11-17,House>天知道  我怎么劝他都不会听
<11-17,House>God knows he's not gonna listen to me.

259
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,230
<11-17,House>你则不然  与各种烂人恋爱交往了
<11-17,House>You, on the other hand, have decades of experience

260
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,190
<11-17,House>几十年  经验丰富
<11-17,House>dating and being attracted to losers.

261
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,190
<11-18,Cuddy>明显  我不在其列
<11-18,Cuddy>Obviously, I don't include myself. You know what happens

262
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,890
<11-18,Cuddy>干预他人情感生活是什么后果  你清楚得很
<11-18,Cuddy>when you interfere in other people's relationships?

263
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,510
<11-19,House>自然  我是惯犯
<11-19,House>Of course. I do it all the time.

264
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,100
<11-19,House>明白你的意思了
<11-19,House>Hmm, I see your point.

265
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,640
<11-20,Cuddy>所以我才不闻不问
<11-20,Cuddy>That is why I'm staying out of this.

266
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,510
<11-20,Cuddy>强扭的瓜不甜
<11-20,Cuddy>You force him to choose, you might not like the answer.

267
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,220
<12-1,Shannon>他看起来不那么痛苦了
<12-1,Shannon>He doesn't seem to be in as much pain anymore.

268
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,240
<12-2,Thirteen>那太好了
<12-2,Thirteen>That's good, but we won't be

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,240
<12-2,Thirteen>但在疱疹消失前
<12-2,Thirteen>out of the woods for sure

270
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,760
<12-2,Thirteen>还不算完全脱离危险
<12-2,Thirteen>until the blisters start to recede.

271
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,830
<12-3,William>我好渴
<12-3,William>Hey, I'm really thirsty.

272
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
<12-3,William>帮我拿杯苏打水好吗
<12-3,William>You mind getting me a soda?

273
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,320
<12-4,Shannon>好  我马上回来
<12-4,Shannon>Sure, I'll be right back.

274
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,900
<12-5,Thirteen>怎么了
<12-5,Thirteen>What's wrong?

275
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,300
<12-6,William>我胸口疼得更厉害了
<12-6,William>The pain in my chest, it's getting worse.

276
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,570
<12-7,Thirteen>刚开始疼吗
<12-7,Thirteen>Just now?

277
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,960
<12-8,William>早开始了  只是不想让她担心
<12-8,William>No, I didn't want to worry her.

278
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,190
<12-9,Thirteen>你暗恋她多久了
<12-9,Thirteen>So how long have you been in love with her?

279
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:16,820
<12-9,Thirteen>什么
<12-9,Thirteen>What?

280
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,500
<12-10,William>不是的  我们只是朋友
<12-10,William>No, we're just friends.

281
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,310
<12-10,William>真的
<12-10,William>Seriously.

282
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,700
<12-11,William>从我第一次见她开始
<12-11,William>Since the first time I saw her.

283
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,300
<12-12,Thirteen>为什么不表白
<12-12,Thirteen>Why don't you tell her?

284
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,580
<12-13,William>-她跟我朋友订婚了  -国王吗
<12-13,William>- She's engaged to my friend. - The King?

285
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,270
<12-14,Thirteen>没见他来照顾你呢
<12-14,Thirteen>Haven't seen him visiting or sitting by your bedside.

286
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,310
<12-15,William>-他有职责在身  -是吧
<12-15,William>- He has responsibilities. - Yeah.

287
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,310
<12-16,Thirteen>王后不是也有职责
<12-16,Thirteen>I'm guessing the Queen does too.

288
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,020
<12-17,William>抢朋友的未婚妻  那算什么骑士
<12-17,William>What kind of Knight steals his friend's bride?

289
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,560
<12-17,William>我为自己有这种想法感到羞耻
<12-17,William>I hate that I even think about it.

290
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,840
<12-18,Thirteen>你不是骑士
<12-18,Thirteen>You're not a Knight.

291
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,500
<12-18,Thirteen>只是个普通人
<12-18,Thirteen>You're just a guy.

292
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,550
<12-19,William>可我有更高的追求
<12-19,William>But I want to be more than that.

293
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,740
<12-20,Thirteen>嗷
<12-20,Thirteen>Oh!

294
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,680
<12-21,William>胸口疼吗 不  是后背
<12-21,William>Your chest?  No, my...my back.

295
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,140
<12-21,William>像刀子扎的一样
<12-21,William>Feels like there's a knife in it.

296
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,460
<12-22,William>是不是感染扩散了
<12-22,William>Is the infection spreading?

297
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,370
<12-22,William>不是耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌
<12-22,William>It's not MRSA.

298
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,510
<13-1,Chase>看上去像某种梭菌菌体
<13-1,Chase>It looks like some sort of clostridial organism.

299
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,940
<13-2,Taub>问题是  是哪种梭菌
<13-2,Taub>Question is, which type of clostridium?

300
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,770
<13-3,Chase>梭菌有几百种
<13-3,Chase>There's hundreds.

301
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,060
<13-3,Chase>产气荚膜梭菌吗
<13-3,Chase>C. Perfringens?

302
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,100
<13-4,Taub>与他的其他症状不符
<13-4,Taub>Wouldn't account for his other symptoms.

303
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,780
<13-4,Taub>破伤风杆菌呢
<13-4,Taub>C. Tetani, on the other hand...

304
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,220
<13-5,Chase>他应该注射过破伤风疫苗
<13-5,Chase>Tetanus, he...he would have been inoculated against it.

305
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,370
<13-6,Taub>那就是他割伤了但没打后续疫苗
<13-6,Taub>So he cut himself and didn't get a booster shot.

306
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,680
<13-6,Taub>这是个会拿剑跟人打架玩的家伙
<13-6,Taub>The guy fights people with swords for fun.

307
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,070
<13-6,Taub>能聪明到哪儿去
<13-6,Taub>No one said he's smart.

308
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,360
<13-7,Chase>他们打架不止是玩
<13-7,Chase>They don't just fight for fun.

309
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,040
<13-7,Chase>也为了证明自己的勇敢
<13-7,Chase>They fight to prove their bravery.

310
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,350
<13-8,Taub>你真信荣誉那套吗
<13-8,Taub>You're buying this honor stuff?

311
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,730
<13-8,Taub>打架可不是勇敢  是愚蠢
<13-8,Taub>Fighting's not brave. It's just stupid.

312
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,800
<13-9,Chase>你这么想倒不奇怪
<13-9,Chase>You would say that.

313
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,830
<13-10,Taub>你以为我没打过架吗
<13-10,Taub>You think I've never been in a fight?

314
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,200
<13-11,Chase>不  我只是觉得你没打赢过
<13-11,Chase>No, I just think you've never won one.

315
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,560
<13-12,Taub>我上大学的时候一挑三
<13-12,Taub>I took on three guys in college once.

316
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,210
<13-13,House>希望你们有叫人带买晚餐
<13-13,House>Hope they bought you dinner first.

317
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,250
<13-14,Chase>不是耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌
<13-14,Chase>It's not MRSA.

318
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,090
<13-15,House>我知道  是毒葛
<13-15,House>I know, it's poison Ivy.

319
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,760
<13-16,Chase>毒葛
<13-16,Chase>Poison Ivy?

320
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,210
<13-17,Taub>反映严重者可能起疱疹
<13-17,Taub>A severe reaction could cause the blisters

321
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,840
<13-17,Taub>而对眼部刺激强烈可能诱发出血
<13-17,Taub>and maybe irritate his eyes enough to cause the hemorrhaging,

322
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,980
<13-17,Taub>但胸部疼痛和突发症候
<13-17,Taub>but the chest pain and seizures...

323
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,630
<13-18,House>他们每晚都生篝火
<13-18,House>They have bonfires every night.

324
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,110
<13-18,House>燃烧的枝叶将毒葛散布到空气中
<13-18,House>The burning leaves aerosolizes the oil.

325
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,020
<13-18,House>依照他体表受害症状
<13-18,House>We've seen what it's done to the outside of his body.

326
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,230
<13-18,House>不难想象他鼻窦和肺部受到的伤害
<13-18,House>Imagine what it's doing to his lungs and his sinuses.

327
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,000
<13-19,Chase>好吧  勉强说得通  但我还是
<13-19,Chase>Okay, maybe it remotely fits, but I'd rather go

328
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,800
<13-19,Chase>觉得科学依据比你的直觉可信
<13-19,Chase>with scientific evidence than with your gut.

329
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,020
<13-20,House>这个算不算
<13-20,House>How about this?

330
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,610
<13-20,House>明显  他的剑上也沾满了
<13-20,House>Apparently, it's all over his sword.

331
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,670
<13-21,Thirteen>又是心率
<13-21,Thirteen>It's his heart rate again.

332
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,600
<13-22,Taub>有多快
<13-22,Taub>How fast is it?

333
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,390
<13-23,Thirteen>心跳变缓  你怎么没带... 不是MRSA
<13-23,Thirteen>It's slowing, why aren't you... It's not MRSA.

334
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,040
<13-25,Chase>我要给他注射12毫升肾上腺素
<13-25,Chase>I'm giving him 12 ccs epinephrine.

335
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,850
<13-26,Taub>他肾上腺素过敏  他的心脏会跳爆的
<13-26,Taub>He tested positive. You'll blow his heart out!

336
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,610
<13-27,Chase>心跳再缓  就要停跳了
<13-27,Chase>If it slows any more, it's gonna stop.

337
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,100
<13-28,Taub>我就说嘛
<13-28,Taub>I told you.

338
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,860
<13-29,Chase>我就说嘛
<13-29,Chase>And I told you.

339
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,530
<14-1,Taub>病源不是毒葛
<14-1,Taub>That wasn't caused by poison Ivy.

340
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,790
<14-2,Foreman>也不是肾上腺素
<14-2,Foreman>Or epinephrine.

341
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,400
<14-2,Foreman>之前排除的心脏症候
<14-2,Foreman>That means the heart problem we ruled out,

342
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,730
<14-2,Foreman>要重新纳入考虑范围
<14-2,Foreman>we now have to rule back in.

343
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,980
<14-3,Chase>我们在皮肤样本中发现了梭菌
<14-3,Chase>We found clostridium bacteria in the skin samples.

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,340
<14-4,Thirteen>泥土中就含有梭菌 它们基本是无害的
<14-4,Thirteen>Clostridium's in dirt and basically harmless.

345
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,880
<14-5,Chase>如果他免疫系统失灵的话也不是没有可能
<14-5,Chase>But opportunistic, if his immune system is depressed.

346
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,760
<14-6,Taub>白血病吗  那他在文艺复兴节前很久
<14-6,Taub>Leukemia? He would have had symptoms way before

347
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,380
<14-7,Foreman>就该有症状了
<14-7,Foreman>the Renaissance Festival.

348
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,420
<14-8,House>任何损害免疫体系的疾病都该有先期症状
<14-8,House>Which is true of anything that would compromise his immune system,

349
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,870
<14-8,House>所以一定是另有环境毒素在作怪
<14-8,House>which means it has to be some other environmental toxin.

350
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,030
<14-8,House>昨日的健康骑士今天就变了睡美人\
<14-8,House>Yesterday he was a healthy Knight, Ntoday he's sleeping beauty.

351
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,390
<14-8,House>没其他可能病症了吗
<14-8,House>Nothing else fits?

352
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,730
<14-9,Chase>食用带卵肉类感染旋毛虫病吗
<14-9,Chase>Trichinosis from eating infected meat?

353
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,110
<14-10,Thirteen>食物中毒的可能已经排除了
<14-10,Thirteen>We already ruled out food poisoning.

354
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,720
<14-10,Thirteen>我们查了肉铺和小吃摊
<14-10,Thirteen>Both the butcher shop and the food stands

355
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,960
<14-10,Thirteen>那集市卫生得很
<14-10,Thirteen>at the fair were totally clean.

356
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,650
<14-11,House>这么说  毒苹果必是来自他处了
<14-11,House>Then he ate the poison apple somewhere else.

357
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,600
<14-11,House>或者是你们没发现
<14-11,House>Or maybe you just missed it.

358
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,890
<14-11,House>开始按旋毛虫病治疗
<14-11,House>Start treatment for trichinosis

359
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,190
<14-11,House>做肌肉活检来验证
<14-11,House>and confirm with a muscle biopsy.

360
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,840
<15-1,Wilson>难以置信我会开这个口
<15-1,Wilson>I can't believe I'm about to say this.

361
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,920
<15-2,House>-山姆  -我就说嘛
<15-2,House>- Sam... - Told you so.

362
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,330
<15-3,Wilson>不  她没甩我
<15-3,Wilson>No, she didn't dump me.

363
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,870
<15-3,Wilson>她想进一步地了解你
<15-3,Wilson>She wants to get to know you better.

364
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,730
<15-4,House>该死
<15-4,House>Damn it.

365
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,830
<15-4,House>就不该让她看见我裸体
<15-4,House>I never should have let her see me naked.

366
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,210
<15-5,Wilson>我所有的本能都告诉我不行
<15-5,Wilson>It goes against all my instincts,

367
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,320
<15-5,Wilson>可我还是答应她了
<15-5,Wilson>but I said all right.

368
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,830
<15-6,House>为什么
<15-6,House>Why?

369
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,310
<15-7,Wilson>她认为我不想让你见到她
<15-7,Wilson>She thinks I was hiding her from you.

370
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,990
<15-8,House>没错啊
<15-8,House>You were.

371
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,500
<15-9,Wilson>我可不想承认
<15-9,Wilson>I don't want her to know.

372
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,700
<15-10,House>这么说  你是求我容忍一段建立在谎言
<15-10,House>So you're asking me to condone a relationship

373
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,460
<15-10,House>怀疑之上的交往
<15-10,House>based on lies and mistrust.

374
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,720
<15-11,Wilson>是
<15-11,Wilson>Yeah.

375
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,380
<15-12,House>几点  在哪儿见
<15-12,House>When and where?

376
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,230
<15-13,Wilson>今晚8点  威尼斯餐馆
<15-13,Wilson>Tonight, Venezia, 8:00.

377
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,560
<15-14,House>我穿什么去呢
<15-14,House>What am I gonna wear?

378
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,710
<15-14,House>我的正装可全送洗衣店了
<15-14,House>All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.

379
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,900
<15-15,Wilson>豪斯  听我说
<15-15,Wilson>House, listen.

380
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,280
<15-15,Wilson>我知道你在为我担心
<15-15,Wilson>I know you're worried about me,

381
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,810
<15-15,Wilson>也知道这种无私的关怀
<15-15,Wilson>and I also know that that kind of unselfishness

382
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,090
<15-15,Wilson>你不是对谁都如此有感而发
<15-15,Wilson>doesn't come naturally to you.

383
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,550
<15-15,Wilson>但我不想要你帮我
<15-15,Wilson>But I don't want your help.

384
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,670
<15-15,Wilson>我不需要你的帮助
<15-15,Wilson>I don't need your help.

385
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,600
<15-15,Wilson>就是来吃个饭
<15-15,Wilson>Just come to dinner

386
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,750
<15-15,Wilson>随意就好
<15-15,Wilson>and be your usual selfish self.

387
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,330
<15-16,House>我怎能拒绝呢
<15-16,House>How could I say no?

388
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,280
<16-1,Shannon>迈尔斯说他一会儿会顺便过来看你
<16-1,Shannon>Miles said he'd stop by later.

389
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,530
<16-2,William>不  让他别来
<16-2,William>No, tell him not to.

390
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,040
<16-2,William>我不想让他看见这样的我
<16-2,William>I don't want to be seen like this.

391
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,520
<16-3,Shannon>你病了  没什么好难为情的
<16-3,Shannon>You're sick. That's nothing to be ashamed of...

392
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,700
<16-3,Shannon>除非你意思是想让我走
<16-3,Shannon>Un-unless you're saying you want me to leave.

393
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,590
<16-4,William>不  别走
<16-4,William>No, don't.

394
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,130
<16-5,Thirteen>我想他意思是
<16-5,Thirteen>I think he's saying

395
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,380
<16-5,Thirteen>和你在一起会好些  夏伦
<16-5,Thirteen>it's different with you, Shannon.

396
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,810
<16-5,Thirteen>男人们就是这样  他们不喜欢在同性面前显示出软弱的一面
<16-5,Thirteen>It's a guy thing--they don't like showing weakness in front of each other.

397
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,560
<16-5,Thirteen>对吗  威廉姆
<16-5,Thirteen>Right, William?

398
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,840
<16-5,Thirteen>没错
<16-5,Thirteen>Right.

399
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
<16-6,William>可能等我好点就会了
<16-6,William>Maybe when I'm feeling a little better.

400
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,260
<16-7,Thirteen>我准备从你这里取一小片肌肉组织试样
<16-7,Thirteen>I'm gonna take a small sample of your muscle tissue here.

401
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,410
<16-7,Thirteen>不介意到外面等一下吧
<16-7,Thirteen>Do you mind waiting outside for this?

402
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,750
<16-8,Shannon>别伤着他
<16-8,Shannon>Don't hurt him.

403
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,940
<16-9,Thirteen>放心吧
<16-9,Thirteen>He's safe with me.

404
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,330
<16-10,William>我以为你要告诉她
<16-10,William>I thought you were gonna tell her.

405
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,360
<16-11,Thirteen>我可没有权利说  但如果你需要
<16-11,Thirteen>It's not my call, but if you ask me,

406
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,890
<16-11,Thirteen>她也等着你说呢
<16-11,Thirteen>she's waiting for you too.

407
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,440
<16-12,William>骑士理应是无私的
<16-12,William>Knights are supposed to be selfless.

408
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,510
<16-13,Thirteen>没错  他们攻城略地  保家卫国
<16-13,Thirteen>Right, they conquered countries and built Castles

409
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,840
<16-13,Thirteen>是无私驱动的
<16-13,Thirteen>by being selfless.

410
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,070
<16-13,Thirteen>勇敢和忠诚是军人最好的品质
<16-13,Thirteen>Bravery and loyalty are great qualities for soldiers.

411
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,280
<16-13,Thirteen>如果你想成为国王
<16-13,Thirteen>If you want to be King,

412
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,060
<16-13,Thirteen>有时你该取你之所取
<16-13,Thirteen>sometimes you have to be willing to take what's yours.

413
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,350
<16-14,William>她不是我的
<16-14,William>She's not mine.

414
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,650
<16-15,Thirteen>也不是他的
<16-15,Thirteen>She's not his either...

415
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,230
<16-15,Thirteen>还不是
<16-15,Thirteen>Not yet.

416
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,820
<17-1,Sam>不过是一顿饭  放松点
<17-1,Sam>It's just dinner. Relax.

417
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,550
<17-2,Wilson>相信我  没有"不过"当豪斯来搅局的时候
<17-2,Wilson>Trust me, there is no "just" when House is involved.

418
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,120
<17-3,Sam>我们坐在一个餐厅的正中央
<17-3,Sam>We're in the middle of a restaurant.

419
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,630
<17-3,Sam>他还能...
<17-3,Sam>What could he possibly...

420
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,600
<17-3,Sam>干什么
<17-3,Sam>Do?

421
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,500
<17-4,Wilson>看吧
<17-4,Wilson>That.

422
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,930
<17-5,House>对不起  我们迟到了
<17-5,House>Sorry we're late.

423
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,310
<17-5,House>但你们知道  女人嘛
<17-5,House>But you know girls.

424
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,500
<17-5,House>出门前总要梳妆打扮一番
<17-5,House>Always fiddling with the hair and the makeup.

425
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,100
<17-5,House>詹姆斯  山姆  这位是萨拉
<17-5,House>James, Sam.... this is Sarah.

426
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,100
<17-6,Sarah>-认识你们很高兴  -贺拉斯告诉我
<17-6,Sarah>- It's nice to meet you. - Horace has told me all--

427
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,700
<17-7,House>是豪斯
<17-7,House>House.

428
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,220
<17-8,Sarah>豪斯  总跟我提起你们俩
<17-8,Sarah>House... has told me all about you.

429
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,370
<17-9,Sam>很高兴见到你们
<17-9,Sam>It's nice to meet you.

430
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,490
<18-1,Foreman>诊断出什么病了吗
<18-1,Foreman>What's the diagnosis?

431
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,710
<18-2,Thirteen>他的肌肉活检没问题
<18-2,Thirteen>His muscle biopsy is clean.

432
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,540
<18-2,Thirteen>不是旋毛虫病
<18-2,Thirteen>It's not trichinosis.

433
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,840
<18-2,Thirteen>豪斯错了  不是环境的问题
<18-2,Thirteen>House was wrong, this is not environmental.

434
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,230
<18-3,Foreman>或者是我们错了  或者是在文艺复兴城落掉了某些细节
<18-3,Foreman>Or we screwed up and missed something at the Renaissance Fair.

435
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,300
<18-4,Thirteen>你觉得我们落掉什么了吗
<18-4,Thirteen>You think we did?

436
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,530
<18-5,Foreman>不  但豪斯会认为我们落下了
<18-5,Foreman>No, but I think House will think we did.

437
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,730
<18-6,Thirteen>我们会落下什么呢
<18-6,Thirteen>What could we have missed?

438
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,610
<18-7,Foreman>霉菌感染
<18-7,Foreman>Fungal infection?

439
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,130
<18-8,Thirteen>他血液里一点都没有霉菌感染的迹象
<18-8,Thirteen>There's nothing in his blood work even remotely suggesting that.

440
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,910
<18-9,Foreman>那他的症状是怎么回事
<18-9,Foreman>What if it's his symptoms?

441
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,510
<18-10,Thirteen>你想重新检验我们用来检验孢子的样本吗
<18-10,Thirteen>You wanna re-test every sample we took for spores?

442
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,520
<18-10,Thirteen>我们会整晚都在这
<18-10,Thirteen>We'll be here all night.

443
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,290
<18-11,Foreman>你注意到他最近有多痛苦吗
<18-11,Foreman>Have you noticed how much pain he's been in lately?

444
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,140
<18-12,Thirteen>这又有什么关系呢
<18-12,Thirteen>And that's relevant how?

445
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,510
<18-13,Foreman>额外的痛苦表明有额外的问题
<18-13,Foreman>Extra pain means extra cranky,

446
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,600
<18-13,Foreman>表明破坏了他的游戏规则
<18-13,Foreman>it means off his game.

447
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,060
<18-13,Foreman>除非我们让他别无选择否则他是不会承认不是环境问题的
<18-13,Foreman>He's not gonna accept this isn't environmental unless we give him no choice.

448
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,820
<18-14,Sam>我真不敢相信你来自布鲁明顿
<18-14,Sam>I cannot believe you're from Bloomington.

449
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,710
<18-15,Sarah>我知道  这难道不惊奇吗
<18-15,Sarah>I know, isn't it amazing?

450
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,000
<18-16,House>是啊  多有意思啊
<18-16,House>Yeah, delightful.

451
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,080
<18-17,Wilson>别理他
<18-17,Wilson>Ignore him.

452
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,770
<18-17,Wilson>他就是因为我们高兴而不高兴了
<18-17,Wilson>He's just upset that we're having fun.

453
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,500
<18-18,Sarah>你记得那个小面包店吗 有超好吃纸杯蛋糕的那个吗
<18-18,Sarah>Do you remember that little bakery, the one with the amazing cupcakes?

454
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,050
<18-20,Sarah>-基诺家  -没错
<18-20,Sarah>- Gino's. --Oh, yes!

455
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,550
<18-21,Sam>每次我回家去的第一站
<18-21,Sam>First stop, every time I go home.

456
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,310
<18-22,Sarah>我也是
<18-22,Sarah>Oh, me too...Mmm!

457
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,430
<18-23,Sam>记得那个脱衣舞夜总会吗
<18-23,Sam>Remember that strip club?

458
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,060
<18-24,Sarah>我以前还在那里工作过呢
<18-24,Sarah>Girl, I used to work at that strip club.

459
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,580
<19-1,Thirteen>哪里疼  威廉姆
<19-1,Thirteen>Where does it hurt, William?

460
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,270
<19-2,William>我的腿  像着火了一样
<19-2,William>My legs, it feels like they're on fire!

461
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,250
<19-2,William>横肌纹溶解症表明他的肾脏正在衰竭
<19-2,William>Rhabdomyolysis means his kidneys are failing.

462
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,680
<20-1,Thirteen>也说明不是环境的问题
<20-1,Thirteen>Also means it's not environmental.

463
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,690
<20-2,Foreman>我们得继续排查
<20-2,Foreman>We need to move on.

464
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,510
<20-3,Taub>我建议先做全套的癌症检查
<20-3,Taub>I recommend we start with a full cancer workup,

466
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,720
<20-5,Foreman>豪斯
<20-5,Foreman>House...

467
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,750
<20-6,House>他的症状明显是环境...
<20-6,House>His symptoms fit an environmental--

468
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,370
<20-7,Foreman>检测结果不是  我们重新...
<20-7,Foreman>the test results don't, we redid--

469
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,550
<20-8,House>去检查公寓
<20-8,House>search the apartment.

470
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,250
<20-9,Thirteen>他三周没去过公寓了
<20-9,Thirteen>He hasn't been there in three weeks--

471
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,720
<20-10,House>快去
<20-10,House>go!

472
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,930
<20-10,House>现在
<20-10,House>Now!

473
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,340
<20-11,Chase>我还是喜欢他吃维科丁的时候
<20-11,Chase>I liked him better when he was on Vicodin.

474
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,010
<20-12,Foreman>你和13去检查他家
<20-12,Foreman>You and thirteen check out his place.

475
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,600
<20-12,Foreman>在你们浪费时间的时候 我们去给他肝脏做超声波检查
<20-12,Foreman>While you're wasting your time, we'll ultrasound the liver.

476
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,500
<20-12,Foreman>如果是癌症  开始随便治疗
<20-12,Foreman>If it's cancer, it's as good a place as any to start.

477
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,930
<21-3,Cuddy>我听说豪斯见过山姆了
<21-3,Cuddy>I hear House met Sam.

478
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,110
<21-4,Wilson>第一次  他全裸着
<21-4,Wilson>First time, he was naked.

479
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,890
<21-4,Wilson>第二次  他带了个人妖妓女来吃饭
<21-4,Wilson>The second time he brought a transvestite prostitute to dinner.

480
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,550
<21-4,Wilson>总体来说  再糟糕不过了
<21-4,Wilson>Overall, it could have been worse.

481
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,150
<21-5,Cuddy>很好
<21-5,Cuddy>Great.

482
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,390
<21-6,Wilson>你就这反应吗
<21-6,Wilson>That's your reaction?

483
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,260
<21-7,Cuddy>什么
<21-7,Cuddy>What?

484
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,090
<21-8,Wilson>全裸  妓女
<21-8,Wilson>Nudity, prostitute...

485
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,630
<21-9,Cuddy>对不起  心不在焉
<21-9,Cuddy>Sorry, preoccupied.

486
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,890
<21-10,Wilson>豪斯和你说了什么  不是吗
<21-10,Wilson>House said something to you, didn't he?

487
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,730
<21-11,Cuddy>没  他没有
<21-11,Cuddy>Nope. He didn't.

488
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,400
<22-1,Wilson>是有点疯狂  可是
<22-1,Wilson>It is a little crazy, though.

489
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,360
<22-1,Wilson>我是说...  不是吗
<22-1,Wilson>I mean... isn't it?

490
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,680
<22-1,Wilson>我是说  看起来不错但他们看起来好像
<22-1,Wilson>I mean... things seem to be going great. But they seemed to be going great

491
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,170
<22-1,Wilson>12年前就认识了
<22-1,Wilson>12 years ago.

492
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,940
<22-1,Wilson>优点还是优点
<22-1,Wilson>The good things are still good.

493
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,450
<22-1,Wilson>她还是那么聪明  有趣  善解人意
<22-1,Wilson>She's still smart, funny, gets me.

494
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,100
<22-1,Wilson>而且不争强好胜
<22-1,Wilson>And she's less competitive.

495
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,360
<22-1,Wilson>也许是她变了  或许是我变了
<22-1,Wilson>Either she's changed, or I've changed.

496
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,040
<22-1,Wilson>可是  不管怎样...
<22-1,Wilson>But, either way...

497
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,010
<22-1,Wilson>我是不是有点发神经呢
<22-1,Wilson>Am I out of my mind?

498
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,540
<22-2,Cuddy>你永远不知道结局会怎样
<22-2,Cuddy>You never know what can happen.

499
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,040
<22-2,Cuddy>还是给彼此一个机会的好
<22-2,Cuddy>You might as well give it a chance.

500
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,820
<22-2,Cuddy>好吧
<22-2,Cuddy>Yeah.

501
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,050
<23-1,Taub>看来你是对的
<23-1,Taub>Looks like you were right.

502
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,310
<23-1,Taub>肿瘤  到处都是
<23-1,Taub>Tumors... dozens of them.

503
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,080
<23-1,Taub>内部  表皮上都是
<23-1,Taub>Inside, and on the surface.

504
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,530
<23-2,Foreman>拉近点
<23-2,Foreman>Pull in closer.

505
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,140
<23-3,Foreman>看到了吗
<23-3,Foreman>See that?

506
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,040
<23-4,Taub>那是什么
<23-4,Taub>What is that?

507
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,030
<23-4,Taub>我不知道
<23-4,Taub>I don't know.

508
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,070
<23-5,Foreman>但肯定不是癌症
<23-5,Foreman>But it's definitely not cancer.

509
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,380
<24-1,Thirteen>厨房没问题
<24-1,Thirteen>Kitchen's clean.

510
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,210
<24-2,Chase>卧室也没问题
<24-2,Chase>Bedroom as well.

511
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,140
<24-2,Chase>他医药箱里最危险的东西就是牙线了
<24-2,Chase>Most dangerous thing in his medicine cabinet was dental floss.

512
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,220
<24-3,Thirteen>那个锁着  钥匙不在钥匙扣上
<24-3,Thirteen>It's locked, key wasn't on his ring.

513
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,400
<24-4,Chase>说真话  难道你想回去
<24-4,Chase>Do you honestly want to go back

514
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,100
<24-4,Chase>告诉豪斯我们没有查遍他屋子的每一个角落吗
<24-4,Chase>and tell House we didn't check every square inch of this place?

515
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,960
<24-5,Thirteen>当然不想
<24-5,Thirteen>Of course not.

516
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,330
<24-7,Thirteen>我的英雄
<24-7,Thirteen>My hero.

517
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,660
<24-8,Chase>这是什么
<24-8,Chase>What the hell is this?

518
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,140
<24-9,Thirteen>一个通往霍格华兹的秘密通道或者是
<24-9,Thirteen>Either a secret entrance to Hogwarts, or...

519
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,580
<24-9,Thirteen>我们的骑士  是个巫师
<24-9,Thirteen>Our Knight... is a witch.

520
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,580
<24-10,Chase>我们的骑士正在进行某种恐怖活动
<24-10,Chase>Our Knight is into some seriously creepy stuff.

521
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,880
<24-11,Thirteen>他声称只是糖水  但是我们把剩下的送到了实验室化验
<24-11,Thirteen>He claims it's just sugar water but we sent the rest down to the lab for testing.

522
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,940
<24-12,Taub>你觉得他想毒死自己么
<24-12,Taub>Do you think he poisoned himself?

523
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,620
<24-13,Foreman>那不是毒药  要不然我们早就在验血的时候发现了
<24-13,Foreman>It's not poison, we would have picked it up in his blood work.

524
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,470
<24-14,Taub>要是在肝脏里慢慢累积起来的就不同了
<24-14,Taub>Not if it collected slowly in his liver.

525
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,040
<24-14,Taub>它会一次性渗入到他的身体系统里
<24-14,Taub>and it all started leaking into his system at once.

526
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,590
<24-15,Taub>这些不是肿瘤的肿瘤
<24-15,Taub>These tumors that aren't tumors,

527
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,000
<24-15,Taub>如果只是充血性肝脏节点状病变呢
<24-15,Taub>What if they're focal hepatic lesions filled with blood?

528
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,040
<24-15,Taub>每次激增都会释放更多的量
<24-15,Taub>Every time one explodes it'd be releasing another dose.

529
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,600
<24-16,Thirteen>什么的量
<24-16,Thirteen>Of what?

530
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,690
<24-17,House>铅葵
<24-17,House>Plumbum nigrum.

531
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,830
<24-18,Chase>你给谁施过法了吗
<24-18,Chase>You putting a hex on someone?

532
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,770
<24-19,Foreman>拉丁文  意思是石铅
<24-19,Foreman>It's latin, for black lead.

533
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,200
<24-20,House>我们的骑士/术士显然也练过炼金术
<24-20,House>Our Knight/Warlock apparently also dabbles in alchemy.

534
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,640
<24-21,Chase>铅中毒
<24-21,Chase>Lead poisoning.

535
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,530
<24-22,Taub>癫痫  瘫痪  免疫力差
<24-22,Taub>Seizures, paralysis,weak immune system,

536
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,590
<24-22,Taub>最后会出现  昏迷
<24-22,Taub>and eventually, coma.

537
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,360
<24-23,House>在膀胱处取样做活检  你一定会发现铅
<24-23,House>Biopsy the cysts, and you'll find your lead.

538
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,960
<25-1,Sam>你觉得我们七点半能到吗
<25-1,Sam>You think we'll make the 7:30?

539
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,150
<25-2,Wilson>对不起  如果我不换衣服的话
<25-2,Wilson>I'm sorry, if I don't change,

540
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,860
<25-2,Wilson>我会觉得自己一晚上都在工作
<25-2,Wilson>I'm gonna feel like I'm at work all night.

541
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,100
<25-3,Sam>对  我记得
<25-3,Sam>Yeah, I remember.

542
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,160
<25-4,Wilson>有问题吗
<25-4,Wilson>Is it a problem?

543
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,760
<25-5,Sam>根本没有
<25-5,Sam>Not at all.

544
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,040
<25-5,Sam>其实如果我们快一点
<25-5,Sam>In fact, if we hurry--

545
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,360
<25-6,Wilson>我们七点半肯定到不了
<25-6,Wilson>We will definitely not make the 7:30.

546
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,000
<25-7,Sam>反正九点四十还能去
<25-7,Sam>Well, there's always the 9:40.

547
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,510
<25-9,Sam>也许不能
<25-9,Sam>Or not.

548
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,050
<25-10,Wilson>你不是应该在医院里吗
<25-10,Wilson>Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

549
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,050
<25-11,House>如果我包揽了所有的活就不需要手下了  对吧
<25-11,House>Wouldn't need a team if I did all the work now, would I?

550
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,290
<25-11,House>另外  我还要给你们做晚餐
<25-11,House>Plus, I had to make you dinner.

551
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,570
<25-12,Wilson>我们有安排了
<25-12,Wilson>We have plans.

552
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,520
<25-13,House>我敢担保你们的计划肯定尝起来没这么美
<25-13,House>I bet your plans don't taste like this.

553
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,460
<25-13,House>不要
<25-13,House>Don't!

554
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,500
<25-14,Wilson>豪斯  不管你脑子里面转的什么
<25-14,Wilson>House, whatever it is that you're up to--

555
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,510
<25-15,House>我只是想做个好人
<25-15,House>I'm trying to be nice.

556
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,850
<25-15,House>那天晚上我太孩子气了
<25-15,House>What I did the other night was juvenile.

557
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,720
<25-15,House>对不起
<25-15,House>I'm sorry.

558
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,810
<26-1,Sam>但奶酥太好吃了
<26-1,Sam>The souffle was amazing.

559
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,030
<26-2,House>是我妈妈的配方
<26-2,House>It's my mom's recipe.

560
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,610
<26-2,House>其他的我都是从网上搜来的
<26-2,House>Everything else, I got off the Web.

561
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,460
<26-3,Wilson>为网络干杯
<26-3,Wilson>Here's to the Internet.

562
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,320
<26-4,House>因为它我找到了蔬菜炖肉
<26-4,House>Where I found the lamb ragout,

563
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,020
<26-4,House>而你们找到了彼此再一次地
<26-4,House>and you two found each other... Again.

564
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,020
<26-5,Wilson>不只是网络
<26-5,Wilson>Well, it wasn't just the Internet.

565
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,870
<26-6,Sam>对啊  更多的是离婚  压抑
<26-6,Sam>Yeah, more like divorce, depression,

566
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,770
<26-6,Sam>心理治疗  更多的心理治疗 最后才是网络
<26-6,Sam>therapy, more therapy, and the Internet.

567
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,090
<26-7,House>我们就这样在一起了
<26-7,House>And here we are.

568
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,070
<26-7,House>没错
<26-7,House>Exactly.

569
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,220
<26-7,House>我们就这样在一起了
<26-7,House>And here we are.

570
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,620
<26-10,Wilson>我要去趟洗手间
<26-10,Wilson>Well, I need to go to the bathroom.

571
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,340
<26-11,House>我想你现在应该能独自应对了吧
<26-11,House>I think you're old enough, now.

572
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,900
<26-11,House>不过如果你希望我跟你一起
<26-11,House>But if you would like me to come along with you...

573
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,150
<26-12,Wilson>我的意思是  你们俩单独在一起没事吧
<26-12,Wilson>I mean, is it safe to leave the two of you?

574
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,740
<26-13,Sam>少来  詹姆斯  够了
<26-13,Sam>Come on, James. Enough, already.

575
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,770
<26-14,House>对啊  詹姆斯  我们会和平共处的
<26-14,House>Yeah, James,I cook in peace.

576
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,370
<26-15,Wilson>好的
<26-15,Wilson>Okay.

577
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,040
<26-15,Wilson>我马上回来
<26-15,Wilson>I'll be right back.

578
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,210
<26-16,House>你是个冷血的女人  把他的心都伤透了
<26-16,House>You're a cold-hearted bitch, who ripped his heart out.

579
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,500
<26-16,House>为了平复你带给他的伤害我看着他苦苦挣扎了好多年
<26-16,House>I watched him struggle for years to overcome the damage you did.

580
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,080
<26-16,House>我绝不能就这么让你
<26-16,House>And there's no way I'm going to just let you

581
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,330
<26-16,House>把他骗回去  再伤害他一次
<26-16,House>wheel him back in so you can do it all over again.

582
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,860
<26-17,Sam>那这算什么
<26-17,Sam>And all this?

583
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,950
<26-18,House>第二阶段是要了解我的敌人
<26-18,House>Phase two of getting to know my enemy.

584
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,620
<26-19,Sam>你看错我了
<26-19,Sam>You're wrong about me.

585
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,790
<26-19,Sam>不过我很高兴詹姆斯不在的时候
<26-19,Sam>But I'm glad now I don't have to pretend to like you,

586
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,830
<26-19,Sam>我不用再假装喜欢你了
<26-19,Sam>except for when James is standing next to me.

587
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,170
<26-20,House>我也是
<26-20,House>Same here.

588
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,070
<26-20,House>唯一的不同是  我比你更长久
<26-20,House>Only difference is, I'll outlast you.

589
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,020
<26-21,House>开演
<26-21,House>And scene.

590
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,750
<26-22,Wilson>现在看电影太晚了
<26-22,Wilson>Well, it's too late for the movie.

591
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,540
<26-22,Wilson>想看看电视吗
<26-22,Wilson>Wanna see what's on tv?

592
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,360
<26-23,House>当然
<26-23,House>Absolutely.

593
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,480
<26-24,Sam>很乐意
<26-24,Sam>Love to.

594
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,870
<27-1,Foreman>检查血液或者肝脏活检时并未发现铅
<27-1,Foreman>There wasn't any lead present in his blood work. Or liver biopsy.

595
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,160
<27-2,Taub>他的心率和血压越来越不稳定
<27-2,Taub>And his heart rate and BP are getting even more erratic.

596
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,390
<27-3,Chase>我们晚上已经两次通过电击来恢复心率
<27-3,Chase>We had to shock it back into rhythm twice during the night.

597
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,870
<27-4,House>那就只剩一件事可做
<27-4,House>There's only one thing left to do.

598
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,500
<28-1,Thirteen>我们在浪费时间
<28-1,Thirteen>We're waiting our time.

599
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,580
<28-2,House>事实上  我已经捡回便宜了
<28-2,House>Actually, I've already gotten good value.

600
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,570
<28-3,Thirteen>我已经告诉过你  这里没有东西 能引起他的任何症状
<28-3,Thirteen>I told you,there's nothing here that could have caused any of his symptoms.

601
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,190
<28-4,House>不对  你告诉我的是  你不能在这里找到
<28-4,House>No, you told me that you couldn't find

602
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,140
<28-4,House>任何能引起他的症状 的东西
<28-4,House>anything here that could becausing the symptoms.

603
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,200
<28-5,Thirteen>现在我们就能找出点新东西来
<28-5,Thirteen>And now we're gonna find something new

604
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,260
<28-5,Thirteen>因为我们也乔装打扮了一下吗
<28-5,Thirteen>because we're in costume?

605
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,660
<28-5,Thirteen>我们搜查了每一处  检测了每一样东西
<28-5,Thirteen>We looked everywhere, tested everything.

606
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,310
<28-5,Thirteen>威尔森的办事拙劣并不能代表我们跟他一样
<28-5,Thirteen>Just because Wilson's acting stupid doesn't mean we are.

607
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,510
<28-6,House>你觉得他做得不对
<28-6,House>Do you think he's making a mistake?

608
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,310
<28-6,House>当然
<28-6,House>Of course.

609
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,680
<28-7,Thirteen>不过他早晚会发觉的
<28-7,Thirteen>But he'll figure it out, sooner or later.

610
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,320
<28-7,Thirteen>但愿就在几个星期激烈的床上运动之后
<28-7,Thirteen>Hopefully after a few weeks of great sex.

611
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,610
<28-7,Thirteen>不入虎穴  焉得虎子
<28-7,Thirteen>Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

612
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,770
<28-8,House>威尔森跟我们不一样
<28-8,House>Wilson's not like us.

613
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,490
<28-8,House>他太关心别人  和他们的感受
<28-8,House>He cares too much about people and their feelings.

614
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,690
<28-9,Thirteen>谢谢你的赞美
<28-9,Thirteen>Thanks for the compliment.

615
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,950
<28-10,House>我们的骑士所扬言的一切法则
<28-10,House>The code that our Knight claims to live by,

616
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,050
<28-10,House>那些关于光荣和骑士的狗屁精神
<28-10,House>all that crap about honor and chivalry.

617
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,180
<28-10,House>威尔森天生就那样  这就是为什么他是
<28-10,House>Wilson's naturally like that, which is why he's--

618
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,570
<28-11,Thirteen>一个很棒的人
<28-11,Thirteen>a great guy.

619
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,710
<28-12,House>一个被人玩弄的猎物
<28-12,House>A sucker and a target.

620
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,170
<28-12,House>所以我们得看着他
<28-12,House>So we gotta look out for him.

621
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,910
<28-12,House>你闻到了吗
<28-12,House>Do you smell that?

622
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,180
<28-13,Thirteen>是的  这是药店
<28-13,Thirteen>Yeah, it's the apothecary shop.

623
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,250
<28-13,Thirteen>而且  福曼和我已经
<28-13,Thirteen>And yes, Foreman and I already...

<29-1,Shop Clerk>有什么事情吗  先生
<29-1,Shop Clerk>I cry your pardon, Sir.

625
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,590
<29-2,House>你知道这是什么吗
<29-2,House>You know what this is?

626
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,630
<29-3,Shop Clerk>这是薰衣草
<29-3,Shop Clerk>Well, that's lavender.

627
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,790
<29-4,House>这是蔷薇果
<29-4,House>Try rose hips.

628
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,620
<29-5,Thirteen>都是无害的  谁在乎
<29-5,Thirteen>Both harmless, who cares?

629
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,930
<29-6,House>按他说的  这可能是氰化物
<29-6,House>It could be cyanide as far as he knows.

630
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,670
<29-6,House>这是什么
<29-6,House>How about this?

631
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,950
<29-7,Shop Clerk>这只是圣约翰草
<29-7,Shop Clerk>It be nothing but St. John's Wort.

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,780
<29-8,House>又错了  黑哈希
<29-8,House>Wrong again. Black cohash.

633
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,120
<29-9,Shop Clerk>店主是我叔叔  我不过是刚来当学徒的
<29-9,Shop Clerk>My Uncle owns the shop,I just started apprenticing.

634
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,110
<29-9,Shop Clerk>有什么大不了的
<29-9,Shop Clerk>What the big deal?

635
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,220
<29-9,Shop Clerk>喂

<29-11,House>你知道这是什么吗
<29-11,House>You know what this is?

638
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,610
<29-12,Shop Clerk>一根野生胡萝卜
<29-12,Shop Clerk>A wild carrot?

639
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,320
<29-13,House>这是铁杉  你这个绣花枕头
<29-13,House>It's hemlock, you embossed carbuncle.

640
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,830
<29-14,Shop Clerk>那是铁杉吗  你确定吗
<29-14,Shop Clerk>That's hemlock? You sure?

641
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,820
<29-15,House>你卖给谁了吗
<29-15,House>Did you sell it to anyone?

642
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,140
<29-16,Thirteen>这是毒药  再想想
<29-16,Thirteen>It's poison, think hard.

643
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,970
<29-17,Shop Clerk>只是那么一根而已
<29-17,Shop Clerk>It was just one branch.

644
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,940
<29-18,House>你卖给了威廉姆先生
<29-18,House>You sold it to Sir William?

<29-19,Shop Clerk>给国王的
<29-19,Shop Clerk>To the King.

647
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,360
<29-20,House>这就是你唯一没检查到环境因素
<29-20,House>It's the only part of the environment you didn't check.

648
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,480
<29-20,House>住在这里的居民
<29-20,House>The people living in it.

649
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,040
<30-1,Miles>到底怎么了
<30-1,Miles>What's going on?

650
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,180
<30-1,Miles>为什么不让我们见威廉姆
<30-1,Miles>Why can't we see William?

651
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,890
<30-2,House>因为你对他下毒了
<30-2,House>Because you poisoned him.

652
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,500
<30-2,House>你这个皇家恶棍

655
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,210
<30-3,Miles>是铁杉
<30-3,Miles>Hemlock.

656
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,030
<30-4,House>我要知道你用了多少是怎样调制的
<30-4,House>I need to know how much you used and how you prepared it.

657
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,110
<30-5,Shannon>是你对威廉姆动了手脚
<30-5,Shannon>You did something to William?

658
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,160
<30-6,Miles>不  当然没有
<30-6,Miles>No, of course not!

659
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,190
<30-7,Thirteen>他还活着
<30-7,Thirteen>He's still alive.

660
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,870
<30-7,Thirteen>要是想避免谋杀罪  你还是快点招了
<30-7,Thirteen>You want to avoid a murder charge, start talking fast.

661
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,810
<30-8,House>那个药剂师愿意出庭作证他只把这东西卖给了你
<30-8,House>The apothecary's willing to testify that you're the only one he gave it to.

662
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,680
<30-9,Miles>好吧  也许我为了挑战各种 食物而买了那个
<30-9,Miles>Okay, yeah, maybe I bought it for the food challenge,

663
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,950
<30-9,Miles>可我不知道那是铁杉
<30-9,Miles>but I didn't know that was hemlock.

664
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,520
<30-10,House>既然是挑战  那为什么只有
<30-10,House>If it was for the challenge, then why is wee Willie

665
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,690
<30-10,House>小Willie骑士奄奄一息了呢
<30-10,House>the only Knight who's dying?

666
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,400
<30-10,House>我不知道
<30-10,House>I don't know!

667
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,220
<30-11,Miles>我告诉你  我不知道
<30-11,Miles>I'm telling you, I didn't know.

668
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,440
<30-11,Miles>我为什么要伤害威廉姆
<30-11,Miles>Why would I want to hurt William?

669
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,090
<30-12,Thirteen>至少我能想到一个理由
<30-12,Thirteen>I can think of at least one reason.

670
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
<30-13,Shannon>迈尔斯  拜托
<30-13,Shannon>Miles, please.

671
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
<30-13,Shannon>不管发生了什么  把真相说出来吧
<30-13,Shannon>Whatever happened, just tell them the truth.

672
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,040
<30-14,Miles>我说的是实话
<30-14,Miles>I am!

673
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,790
<30-14,Miles>我发誓
<30-14,Miles>I swear.

674
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,900
<31-1,Foreman>我们对他的血液做了气相色谱分析
<31-1,Foreman>We ran a gas chromatography on his blood.

675
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,910
<31-1,Foreman>发现了一定量的哌啶类生物碱
<31-1,Foreman>Found trace amounts of piperidine alkaloids.

676
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,010
<31-2,Chase>铁杉中的主要致毒成分
<31-2,Chase>The main markers of hemlock intoxication.

677
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,810
<31-3,House>好消息是我们弄清楚你的病因了
<31-3,House>Well, the good news is we now know what's wrong with you.

678
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,130
<31-3,House>坏消息是
<31-3,House>The bad news is

679
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,730
<31-3,House>你国王的完美形象都是伪装出来的
<31-3,House>that your King's precious ideals were just pretend after all.

680
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,360
<31-3,House>至少  对他的王后过分亲近的人是这样
<31-3,House>At least, when it comes to guys who get too close to his Queen.

681
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,490
<31-4,William>这不是真的
<31-4,William>It's not true.

682
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,360
<31-5,House>我估计你从来没听说这句话吧
<31-5,House>I guess you've never heard the expression,

683
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,620
<31-5,House>"气相色谱分析仪从不骗人"
<31-5,House>"Gas chromatography machines don't lie."

684
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,180
<31-6,William>迈尔斯也从不撒谎
<31-6,William>Neither does Miles.

685
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,560
<31-6,William>他是我认识的最优秀的骑士
<31-6,William>He's the best Knight I've ever known.

686
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,790
<31-6,William>这就是为什么他会成为国王
<31-6,William>It's why he was chosen King.

687
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,390
<31-7,House>迈尔斯是极具嫉妒心的白痴
<31-7,House>Miles is a jealous idiot.

688
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,920
<31-7,House>而你是个纯粹的傻瓜
<31-7,House>And you're just an idiot.

689
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,950
<31-8,Taub>好像有点不对劲
<31-8,Taub>Uh, something's wrong.

690
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,870
<31-8,Taub>我们给他洗了胃
<31-8,Taub>We performed a gastric lavage

691
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,770
<31-8,Taub>用了活性炭
<31-8,Taub>and administered activated charcoal,

692
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,580
<31-8,Taub>但他的病情没有好转  反而恶化了
<31-8,Taub>but he's getting worse, not better.

693
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,700
<31-9,House>毒素在他体内已经两天了
<31-9,House>Well, it's been in his system two days.

694
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,370
<31-9,House>他撑了这么久  我们算幸运了
<31-9,House>We're lucky he's lasted this long.

695
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,650
<31-10,Taub>如果真是铁杉  他要么早就死了
<31-10,Taub>If it was hemlock, he'd either be dead already

696
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,690
<31-10,Taub>要么就好转了
<31-10,Taub>or getting better with treatment.

697
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,210
<31-11,Foreman>确实是铁杉  我们在他的血液中查到的
<31-11,Foreman>It's hemlock, we found it in his blood.

698
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,440
<31-12,Taub>他可能是吃了一些铁杉 但这不是他的病因
<31-12,Taub>He may have had some hemlock, but it's not what's killing him.

699
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,540
<32-1,Lucas>千万别动手
<32-1,Lucas>Don't do it!

700
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,110
<32-1,Lucas>不管你在预谋什么
<32-1,Lucas>Whatever you're planning,

701
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,780
<32-1,Lucas>特别是你还想用手上的那玩意儿
<32-1,Lucas>especially if you're gonna use that thing.

702
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,420
<32-1,Lucas>天哪
<32-1,Lucas>Geez.

703
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,450
<32-2,House>这剑还好好呆着石头里呢[亚瑟王]
<32-2,House>It was just sitting in a stone.

704
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,710
<32-2,House>给你
<32-2,House>Here.

705
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,710
<32-3,Lucas>你要的这么具体价钱可得高些
<32-3,Lucas>It's gonna cost extra, because of the level of detail that you wanted.

706
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,820
<32-4,House>有什么猛料吗
<32-4,House>Anything good?

707
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,500
<32-4,House>当然  我说的是反话
<32-4,House>And by good, I, of course, mean bad.

708
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,860
<32-5,Lucas>没有  差不多就是你的翻版
<32-5,Lucas>Nope, pretty much your typical life.

709
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,610
<32-5,Lucas>早婚  离了婚
<32-5,Lucas>Married young, got divorced.

710
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,180
<32-5,Lucas>老一点后再婚  再离婚了
<32-5,Lucas>Married a little less young, got divorced.

711
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,220
<32-5,Lucas>除了婚姻  她各方面都很成功
<32-5,Lucas>She's been pretty successful in everything she's done, except marriage.

712
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,880
<32-6,House>肯定有什么内幕能被我利用
<32-6,House>Well, there's gotta be something I can use.

713
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,440
<32-7,Lucas>也许吧  不过我没看她的心理医生笔记
<32-7,Lucas>Maybe. Didn't read her shrink's notes.

714
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
<32-7,Lucas>这样似乎不太好
<32-7,Lucas>Didn't seem right.

715
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,620
<32-8,House>但把它们偷出来就没关系
<32-8,House>But stealing them did.

716
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,960
<32-9,Lucas>我可不是偷的
<32-9,Lucas>Whoa, I didn't steal them.

717
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,130
<32-9,Lucas>我有特殊渠道能弄到
<32-9,Lucas>I found a way to obtain them.

718
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,740
<32-10,Sam>抱歉  我不是故意要打断你们 你现在有时间吗
<32-10,Sam>Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but you got a minute?

719
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,540
<32-10,Sam>当然
<32-10,Sam>Sure.

720
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,860
<32-11,Lucas>你找他啊  好吧  我回避
<32-11,Lucas>Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.

721
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,660
<32-12,House>小心点  我可有把剑
<32-12,House>Careful. I have a sword.

722
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,340
<32-13,Sam>我并不赞同你的话
<32-13,Sam>I don't agree with what you said.

723
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,590
<32-13,Sam>但我能理解你这么说的目的
<32-13,Sam>But I understand why you said it.

724
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,740
<32-13,Sam>我们结婚时很年轻  我们犯了很多错误
<32-13,Sam>We were married young, we both made mistakes,

725
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,770
<32-13,Sam>的确  大部分是我的错
<32-13,Sam>and yes, I did make most of them.

726
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,590
<32-13,Sam>但这都过去十多年了
<32-13,Sam>But that was almost a decade ago.

727
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,990
<32-14,House>不好意思 今天是忏悔日吗
<32-14,House>I'm sorry, is that the statutory period for soul sucking?

728
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,860
<32-15,Sam>我没要求你喜欢我  豪斯
<32-15,Sam>I'm not asking you to like me, House.

729
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,790
<32-15,Sam>坦白说  我认为你是个混蛋
<32-15,Sam>To be honest, I think you're an ass.

730
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,590
<32-15,Sam>但我们有一点是相同的
<32-15,Sam>But we do have one thing in common.

731
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,370
<32-15,Sam>那就是我们都在乎詹姆斯
<32-15,Sam>We care about James.

732
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,740
<32-16,House>那就证明啊
<32-16,House>So prove it.

733
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,390
<32-16,House>甩了他  再甩一次
<32-16,House>And dump him... again.

734
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,410
<32-17,Sam>你总是让人如此难以忍受吗
<32-17,Sam>You're pretty much insufferable all the time, aren't you?

735
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,500
<32-18,House>抱歉  继续  没错
<32-18,House>Sorry, go on. And, yes.

736
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,130
<32-19,Sam>我们才刚刚重聚  我们也不清楚 今后会怎样发展
<32-19,Sam>We just reconnected, we have no idea where we're headed.

737
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,780
<32-19,Sam>但要问  你能不能给我们
<32-19,Sam>But is it really too much to ask

738
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,720
<32-19,Sam>继续下去的机会  是不是有点多余
<32-19,Sam>that you give us a chance to find out?

739
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,420
<32-20,Sam>我相信  我们会常见面的
<32-20,Sam>I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

740
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,970
<33-1,House>我们成功了
<33-1,House>We did it.

741
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,150
<33-1,House>其实  是我成功了
<33-1,House>Well, I did it.

742
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,810
<33-2,Chase>我们到底做什么了
<33-2,Chase>What exactly did we do?

743
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,570
<33-2,Chase>是你做什么了
<33-2,Chase>You do?

744
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,960
<33-3,House>他肝脏上的并不是节点状病变
<33-3,House>These aren't focal hepatic lesions on his liver,

745
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,980
<33-3,House>而是紫癜造成的肝脏损伤
<33-3,House>they're peliosis hepitus lesions.

746
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,310
<33-3,House>再加上心率不齐
<33-3,House>Which in combination with an erratic heart rate,

747
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,520
<33-3,House>这通常是
<33-3,House>usually indicates--

748

<33-4,Foreman>心内膜炎
<33-4,Foreman>endocarditis.

749
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,880
<33-4,Foreman>心脏瓣膜感染
<33-4,Foreman>Infection on his heart valve.

750
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,060
<33-5,House>滥用促蛋白合成类固醇的两大症状
<33-5,House>Two major symptoms of anabolic steroid abuse.

751
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
<33-6,Thirteen>不  他不会
<33-6,Thirteen>No, he wouldn't.

752
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,330
<33-7,Taub>横纹肌溶解是第三个症状
<33-7,Taub>And the rhabdo makes the third.

753
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,040
<33-8,House>我们的病人是个瘾君子
<33-8,House>Our patient's a juicer.

754
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,390
<33-8,House>古老的毒药加速了现代毒药 造成的损伤
<33-8,House>Ancient poison accelerated the damage of the modern poison.

755
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,630
<33-8,House>开始治疗  把国王放了
<33-8,House>Start treatment, let the King out of the tower.

756
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,310
<34-1,Thirteen>感觉怎样
<34-1,Thirteen>How are you feeling?

757
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,820
<34-2,William>很惭愧
<34-2,William>Ashamed.

758
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,770
<34-3,Thirteen>你是该感到惭愧
<34-3,Thirteen>You should be.

759
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,340
<34-3,Thirteen>你宁愿选择比武的胜利
<34-3,Thirteen>You'll compromise your ideals to win a fight,

760
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,600
<34-3,Thirteen>也不愿争取心上人的垂青
<34-3,Thirteen>but not to go for the woman you love.

761
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,540
<34-4,William>那只是场游戏
<34-4,William>That was a game.

762
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,210
<34-4,William>而不是现实生活
<34-4,William>Not real life.

763
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,570
<34-4,William>-我没有  -伤害任何人吗
<34-4,William>- I didn't-- - hurt anyone?

764
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,970
<34-5,Thirteen>这话你倒是跟夏伦去说啊
<34-5,Thirteen>Try telling that to Shannon.

765
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,100
<34-5,Thirteen>或许她在你床边哭泣的时候 我错过了什么
<34-5,Thirteen>Or maybe I missed something while she was crying by your bed.

766
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,850
<34-5,Thirteen>爱人的心不是赢来的
<34-5,Thirteen>You don't need to win anyone's heart.

767
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,270
<34-5,Thirteen>你应该问她愿不愿意将心交给你
<34-5,Thirteen>You just need to ask for it.

768
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,660
<34-5,Thirteen>迈尔斯是个好人
<34-5,Thirteen>Miles is a great guy.

769
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,630
<34-6,William>他富有  聪明  待她好
<34-6,William>He's rich, smart, treats her well.

770
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,240
<34-6,William>她和他在一起会很幸福
<34-6,William>She's gonna have a great life with him.

771
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,630
<34-6,William>而我呢
<34-6,William>But me?

772
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,520
<34-6,William>为了她  我尽我所有
<34-6,William>Well, I'd do everything I could for her,

773
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,290
<34-6,William>即使我再努力  也无法做到
<34-6,William>but even at my best, it wouldn't be much.

774
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,150
<34-6,William>她应该过最好的生活
<34-6,William>And she deserves the best.

775
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,530
<34-6,William>我想  我愿意看着她幸福 即使这意味着我会很痛苦
<34-6,William>I guess I'd rather she be happy even if it means I'm not.

777
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,730
<34-7,Thirteen>我想豪斯说对了
<34-7,Thirteen>I guess House was right about that, too.

778
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,580
<34-8,William>什么
<34-8,William>What?

779
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,800
<34-9,Thirteen>你真的是个傻瓜
<34-9,Thirteen>You really are an idiot.
