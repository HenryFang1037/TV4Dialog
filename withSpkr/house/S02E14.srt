<3-3,Amy>他出去散步,吃的很正常.他--
<3-3,Amy>He jogs, he eats right.,He--

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,880
<3-4,Henry>我--我上个星期天有些头疼
<3-4,Henry>I--well, I did have a headache,last Sunday.

57
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,240
<3-4,Henry>过去两年,我一直
<3-4,Henry>And for the past two years,,I've been getting

58
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,110
<3-5,Foreman>在反胃酸
<3-5,Foreman>acid reflux a lot.

59
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,310
<3-4,Henry>我觉得,呃,我所需要的只是抗酸药物
<3-4,Henry>And I thought that, uh, antacids,were all I needed.

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,080
<3-4,Henry>我应该早一些过来吗?
<3-4,Henry>Should I have come in sooner?

61
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,040
<3-5,Foreman>就因为反胃酸和头疼?
<3-5,Foreman>For acid reflux and a headache?

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,640
<3-6,Henry>嗯,我--你知道,我听说楼下的咖啡
<3-6,Henry>Well, I--you know, I hear,the coffee downstairs

63
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,240
<3-6,Henry>味道很不错
<3-6,Henry>is really good.

64
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,510
<3-6,Henry>你能帮我去买一杯吗,亲爱的?
<3-6,Henry>Could you get me a cup, Honey?

65
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,280
<3-6,Henry>你介意把百叶窗关上吗?
<3-6,Henry>Would you mind,closing the blinds?

66
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,010
<4-1,Foreman>他右边的睾丸几乎有他左边的两倍那么大
<4-1,Foreman>,His right testicle is almost,twice as big as his left.

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,180
<4-2,House>酷
<4-2,House>Cool.

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,340
<4-3,Chase>可能是睾丸癌
<4-3,Chase>It's probably,testicular cancer.

69
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,510
<4-3,Chase>嗯,不是
<4-3,Chase>,Mmm, no.

70
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,680
<4-4,House>那是不可能的
<4-4,House>That's impossible.

71
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,580
<4-5,Chase>所有显示出来的症状--
<4-5,Chase>The symptoms all indicate--

72
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,010
<4-6,House>鞋子不对
<4-6,House>The shoes aren't right.

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,340
<4-6,House>睾丸癌可以这么自己来证明
<4-6,House>Here's how testicular cancer,would manifest itself.

74
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,940
<4-6,House>首先,病人会说出他自己
<4-6,House>First, the patient would get,the exact symptoms

75
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,310
<4-6,House>准确的症状
<4-6,House>that he's got.

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,340
<4-6,House>然后Foreman会对他进行检查
<4-6,House>Then Foreman would examine him.

77
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,010
<4-6,House>由于症状是那么明显,然后他就会
<4-6,House>Then he'd suspect,testicular cancer on account of

78
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,910
<4-6,House>怀疑是睾丸癌
<4-6,House>the symptoms being so perfect.

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,240
<4-6,House>然后他会往里面戳根针,再打电话给一个外科医生
<4-6,House>Then he'd stick a needle in it.,Then he'd call a surgeon.

80
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,940
<4-6,House>在那个家伙做手术的时候,我们剩下的人
<4-6,House>And while that guy operates,,the rest of us

81
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,940
<4-6,House>就可以出去打保龄球了
<4-6,House>would be out bowling.

82
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,580
<4-6,House>既然我们没有穿保龄球的鞋子
<4-6,House>And since we're not,wearing bowling shoes,

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,740
<4-6,House>所以这个病很明显不是这么来处理的
<4-6,House>the disease obviously did not,progress in that fashion.

84
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,010
<4-7,Foreman>标准腹腔镜手术显示有一些白色的细胞,但他的核磁共振检查什么也没有
<4-7,Foreman>LP showed some white cells.,But his MRI is clean.

85
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,110
<4-8,House>当然.如果你把他脑袋中的微脓肿叫做"什么也没有"
<4-8,House>Sure. If you call a microabscess,in his brain "clean."

86
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,140
<4-9,House>什么,你不相信我?
<4-9,House>What, you don't trust me?

87
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,980
<4-10,Foreman>你是在说左边那个暂时性突出物?
<4-10,Foreman>Are you talking about,the left temporal lobe?

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,240
<4-11,House>太好了.你可以透过我的手看到
<4-11,House>Neat.,You can see through my hand.

89
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,280
<4-12,Foreman>这只是一个阴影
<4-12,Foreman>It's just a shadow.

90
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,540
<4-13,House>或者就是一个感染源
<4-13,House>Or it's an infection.

91
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,480
<4-13,House>当人们有头脑/胯部的毛病
<4-13,House>When guys have brain/crotch,problems,

92
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,010
<4-13,House>结果通常都是一边使用的太多
<4-13,House>it's usually the result of using,one too much

93
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,410
<4-13,House>而另一边太少
<4-13,House>and the other too little.

94
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,110
<4-14,Foreman>血液和尿样的检查
<4-14,Foreman>,Blood and urine were negative

95
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,510
<4-14,Foreman>都显示梅毒,淋病和衣原体为阴性
<4-14,Foreman>for syphilis, gonorrhea,,and chlamydia.

96
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,610
<4-15,House>那就以这三种毛病来治疗.马上
<4-15,House>So treat him for all three.,Stat.

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,940
<4-16,Cameron>嗯...阴性就表示他没有得
<4-16,Cameron>Um...negative means,he doesn't have it.

98
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,080
<4-17,House>不,阴性只表示他可能没有得
<4-17,House>No. Negative means,he probably doesn't have it.

99
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,740
<4-17,House>表示他可能得了癌症
<4-17,House>Which means he probably,has cancer.

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,680
<4-18,Cameron>我以为我们穿错了治疗癌症的鞋子
<4-18,Cameron>I thought we were wearing,the wrong shoes for cancer.

101
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,380
<4-19,House>我们穿错了治疗睾丸癌的鞋子
<4-19,House>We're wearing the wrong shoes,for testicular cancer.

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,210
<4-19,House>但对于淋巴瘤来说是正确的,除了Chase
<4-19,House>They're perfect for lymphoma.,Except Chase's.

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,640
<4-19,House>它们真的很蠢
<4-19,House>They're just goofy.

104
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,040
<4-20,House>淋巴瘤会导致他的生殖器官
<4-20,House>Lymphoma could cause infiltrants,in his reproductive organs

105
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,180
<4-20,House>和脑子中有浸渍剂
<4-20,House>and his brain.

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
<4-20,House>如果到了那个时候,不管我们做什么他都死定了
<4-20,House>If it's this advanced,,he's dead no matter what we do.

107
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,740
<4-20,House>给他进行性传播疾病测试,希望测试是错的
<4-20,House>So give him the STD meds,and hope the tests were wrong.

108
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,340
<5-1,House>Svinnuk.谁是那个幸运的女人?
<5-1,House>Svinnuk.,Who's the lucky woman?

109
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,480
<5-2,Wilson>我妻子
<5-2,Wilson>My wife.

110
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,680
<5-3,House>不,我不想知道是谁拿到了巧克力
<5-3,House>No, I don't want to know,who gets the chocolates.

111
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,980
<5-3,House>我想知道你正在和谁乱搞
<5-3,House>I want to know who,you're having the affair with.

112
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,080
<5-4,Wilson>他在是孩子的时候把脑子撞坏了,真是悲惨
<5-4,Wilson>Fell on his head as a child.,Tragic.

113
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,310
<5-5,House>挪威巧克力

<5-5,House>坦白说,你买那个东西,恐怖分子赢了
<5-5,House>Frankly, you buy that stuff,,the terrorists win.

115
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,210
<5-6,Wilson>有些人会把他们的感觉用瓶子封装起来
<5-6,Wilson>Some people bottle up,their feelings,

116
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
<5-6,Wilson>作为物理疼痛释放出来
<5-6,Wilson>have them come out,as physical pain.

<5-6,Wilson>健康的人会表达自己的感觉
<5-6,Wilson>Healthy human beings,express feelings,

118
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,540
<5-6,Wilson>比如爱情,就通过赠送礼物
<5-6,Wilson>such as affection,,by giving gifts.

119
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,580
<5-7,House>礼物表示有罪恶
<5-7,House>Gifts express guilt.

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,810
<5-7,House>表达得越贵
<5-7,House>The more expensive,the expression,

121
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,810
<5-7,House>说明罪恶越深

124
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,280
<5-7,House>要么她并不是那么好
<5-7,House>or she wasn't that good.

125
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,180
<5-8,Wilson>不是所有的都和性有关,House
<5-8,Wilson>It's not all about sex, House.

<6-2,House>Actually, at your age,

129
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,940
<6-2,House>只要你小心一些

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,240
<6-3,Patient>如果我注射了足够多的剂量
<6-3,Patient>If I get a high enough dose.

133
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,380
<6-4,House>你说的"平静"是指某个凉爽的夏季晚上
<6-4,House>You mean "calm",as in a peaceful lake,

00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,980
<6-4,House>的平静的湖?
<6-4,House>on cool summer evening?

135
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,110
<6-4,House>还是我们通常所说的
<6-4,House>Or in the lesser used,meaning of,

136
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,780
<6-4,House>没有什么可以再打搅你了
<6-4,House>nothing can ever,bother you again

137
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
<6-4,House>因为生命对你来说再没有什么意义
<6-4,House>because life has absolutely,no meaning?

138
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,080
<6-4,House>高剂量的避孕注射剂
<6-4,House>High dose of Depo-Provera

139
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,640
<6-4,House>会化学性的阉割你

<6-6,House>走到那扇门前,转动把手
<6-6,House>And I'm gonna a walk,to that door, turn the handle.

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,480
<6-6,House>然后你会突然决定
<6-6,House>And then you're suddenly,gonna decide

145
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,110
<6-6,House>你必须告诉我事实
<6-6,House>that you have to,tell me the truth.

146
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,340
<6-6,House>而我不得不转身在一路走回来
<6-6,House>I'm gonna have to turn around,and come all the way back.

147
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,340
<6-6,House>看,问题是,我的腿很疼
<6-6,House>See, the thing is,,my leg hurts.

148
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,380
<6-6,House>我们能不能就保持现状别让我走动?
<6-6,House>Can we cut the walking,out of the equation?

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,980
<6-7,Patient>我爱上了母牛

<6-8,House>有什么特别的...品种吗?

153
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,710
<6-10,House>哦,上帝
<6-10,House>Oh, God.

154

<6-11,Patient>我在上学的路上会经过一个农场
<6-11,Patient>I pass a farm,on my way to school.

<6-11,Patient>它们看起来是那么漂亮
<6-11,Patient>And they're so beautiful.

<6-11,Patient>它们是那么的宏伟.我做梦也梦到它们
<6-11,Patient>They're so majestic.,I dream about them.

00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,680
<6-11,Patient>把它们做成皮鞋,汉堡包
<6-11,Patient>Leather shoes, hamburgers.

<6-11,Patient>有谁可以那么对待一只母牛呢?
<6-11,Patient>How can anybody do that,to a cow?

159
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,640
<6-12,House>做爱 而不是做皮带 这很不错
<6-12,House>Make love, not belts.,It's beautiful.

160
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,940
<6-13,Patient>- 我实际上并没有--,- 好,放松
<6-13,Patient>I haven't actually--,Well, relax.

<6-14,House>作我们医生这行一直在处理这种事情
<6-14,House>Something we doctors deal with,all the time.

162

<6-14,House>我会给你写一份药品的名称
<6-14,House>I'm gonna write you,the name of a drug.

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,340
<6-14,House>你并不需要处方
<6-14,House>You don't need a prescription.

164
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,480
<6-14,House>看起来和注射避孕剂差不多
<6-14,House>And it looks,just like Depo-Provera.

165
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,680
<6-15,Patient>但它也能起到相同的作用吗?
<6-15,Patient>But does it do the same thing?

166
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,880
<6-15,Patient>哦,上帝,不
<6-15,Patient>Oh, God, no.

<6-16,House>那东西带有所有恶心的副作用
<6-16,House>That stuff has all sorts,of nasty side effects.

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,040
<6-16,House>而这是真正的用药
<6-16,House>It's real medicine.

<6-16,House>不,这才是你所需要的
<6-16,House>No, this is all you need.

<6-16,House>你兄弟会的哥们会完全被愚弄
<6-16,House>Your frat buddies will be,completely fooled.

<6-16,House>告诉他们那个医生是多么的惊骇
<6-16,House>Tell them how appalled,the doctor was.

172
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,440
<6-16,House>肯定会有很多嘲笑
<6-16,House>Lots of laughs.

173
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,410
<7-1,Foreman>我们认为你或许有性传播方面的疾病
<7-1,Foreman>We think you may have,a sexually transmitted disease.

174
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,010
<7-2,Henry>不,这不可能
<7-2,Henry>No. It's not possible.

175
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,680
<7-3,Foreman>先生,或许我们应该私下说一下
<7-3,Foreman>Sir, maybe we should,speak in private?

176
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,440
<7-4,Amy>你们给他做了这方面的测试?
<7-4,Amy>Have you tested him for this?

177
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,640
<7-5,Foreman>测试显示为阴性
<7-5,Foreman>The tests were negative.

178
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,240
<7-6,Henry>那么,就是没有
<7-6,Henry>Well, then it's not that.

179
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,140
<7-6,Henry>那还可能是什么原因呢?
<7-6,Henry>So what else could it be?

180
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,540
<7-7,Foreman>没什么好的理由
<7-7,Foreman>Nothing good.

181
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,040
<7-7,Foreman>如果你曾有过性生活
<7-7,Foreman>If you've been having sex,

182
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,480
<7-7,Foreman>你必须告诉我

<7-8,Henry>自从我离婚后,我就再也没有过性生活
<7-8,Henry>I have not had sex,since my divorce.

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
<8-1,House>我并没有让他吃药
<8-1,House>I didn't ask him,to take the medicine.

185
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,940
<8-1,House>我是让你给他吃药
<8-1,House>I asked you to give him,the medicine.

186
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,910
<8-2,Foreman>他已经一年多没有性生活了
<8-2,Foreman>He hasn't had sex,in over a year.

187

<8-3,House>- 他在撒谎,- 他知道危险性
<8-3,House>He's lying.,He knows wt's at stake.

188
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,840
<8-4,Foreman>我们应该马上开始对他进行,淋巴瘤的治疗
<8-4,Foreman>We should start treating him,for lymphoma right away.

189
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,740
<8-4,Foreman>- 或许如果我们快速用力的打击他--,- Wilson!
<8-4,Foreman>Maybe if we hit him,hard and fast--,Wilson!

190
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,740
<8-5,House>你可以过多久无性的生活?
<8-5,House>How long can you go,without sex?

<8-7,House>不要这样,我是认真的,一个星期?一个月?
<8-7,House>No, seriously.,Week? Month?

193
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,740
<8-8,Wilson>我并没有在拈花惹草
<8-8,Wilson>I'm not having an affair.

194
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,210
<8-9,House>我没有说你是
<8-9,House>I didn't say you were.

195
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,540
<8-9,House>起码不是在这次谈话中
<8-9,House>Not in this conversation.

196
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,380
<8-9,House>我们正在讨论一个病人的情况
<8-9,House>We're talking about a patient.

197
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,940
<8-10,Foreman>人们有控制冲动的能力
<8-10,Foreman>People have impulse control.

198
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,180
<8-10,Foreman>我们并不需要性生活
<8-10,Foreman>We don't need sex.

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,640
<8-11,House>好吧,并不象空气那样
<8-11,House>Well, not like air.

200
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,810
<8-11,House>但作为生物学方面的需求,我们肯定需要
<8-11,House>But as a biological imperative,,sure we do.

201
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,440
<8-11,House>我们会为了两件事情而做蠢事
<8-11,House>There's two things,we get stupid for.

202
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,940
<8-11,House>金钱和性
<8-11,House>Money and sex.

203
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,310
<8-11,House>既然金钱不太可能会进入血液...
<8-11,House>And since money rarely,enters the bloodstream...

204
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,940
<8-11,House>你在问他是否有性生活的时候,他的女儿是否在房间里?
<8-11,House>Was his daughter in the room,when you asked if he'd had sex?

205
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,440
<8-12,Foreman>我告诉他我们可以私下谈一下
<8-12,Foreman>I told him we could,talk privately.

206
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,840
<8-12,Foreman>他并不介意她是否在那里
<8-12,Foreman>He didn't care,if she was there.

207
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,540
<8-13,House>已经是中午了,小女孩会去吃午饭
<8-13,House>It's almost noon.,Little girl would go to lunch.

208
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,780
<8-13,House>在她出门的时候,你去做下记录
<8-13,House>Soon as she's out the door,,you're gonna get paged.

209
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
<8-13,House>然后告诉我
<8-13,House>Then you page me.

210
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,640
<8-14,House>你的午饭时间还真早,嗯?
<8-14,House>Lunch is early, huh?

213
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,310
<9-1,House>我听说你情愿死掉
<9-1,House>I hear you'd rather die,than admit

214
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,840
<9-1,House>也不愿意承认你有性生活
<9-1,House>you had sex.

215
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,110
<9-2,Henry>对不起.我...我不能告诉我的女儿
<9-2,Henry>I'm sorry.,I...couldn't tell my daughter.

216
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,910
<9-3,House>很好.因为她...怎么,有22岁了吗?
<9-3,House>Right. 'Cause she's...,what, 22?

217
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,340
<9-4,Henry>我和她妈妈一起睡觉
<9-4,Henry>I slept with her mom.

218
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,980
<9-5,House>她可能已经知道有这么回事了
<9-5,House>She probably knows,that's happened already.

219
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,280
<9-5,House>翻身
<9-5,House>Roll over.

220
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,210
<9-6,Henry>我的妻子有了外遇,我原谅了她
<9-6,Henry>My wife had an affair.,I forgave her.

221
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,240
<9-6,Henry>她又有了另一次外遇
<9-6,Henry>She had another affair.

222
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,310
<9-6,Henry>我再一次原谅了她
<9-6,Henry>And I forgave her again.

223
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,080
<9-6,Henry>然后...Amy觉得
<9-6,Henry>And...Amy thinks

224
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,210
<9-6,Henry>我是一个傻瓜
<9-6,Henry>I was an idiot.

225
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,310
<9-7,House>挺痛苦的.你一定非常骄傲
<9-7,House>So smart.,You must be very proud.

226
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,280
<9-7,House>翻身
<9-7,House>Roll over.

227
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,540
<9-8,Henry>我假定你是在谈恋爱
<9-8,Henry>I assume you've been in love.

228
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,640
<9-9,House>我帮你进行性传染病的鸡尾酒治疗
<9-9,House>I'm starting you on a cocktail,of STD meds.

229
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,380
<9-10,Henry>Amy刚刚熬过这段时间
<9-10,Henry>Amy is just getting over it.

230
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,510
<9-10,Henry>她已经好几个月没有和她妈妈说话了
<9-10,Henry>She barely spoke to her mom,for months.

231
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,910
<9-10,Henry>如果她知道又发生了相同的事情
<9-10,Henry>If she thought that,it was happening again,

232
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,180
<9-10,Henry>而且正是我得病的原因--
<9-10,Henry>that that's why I got sick--

233
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,440
<9-10,Henry>我们只是在同一个
<9-10,Henry>We just happened,to be at the same

234
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,940
<9-10,Henry>意大利乳酪品尝会上碰见
<9-10,Henry>Italian cheese-tasting thing.

235
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,310
<9-11,House>乳酪是恶魔的玩具
<9-11,House>Cheese is the devil's plaything.

236
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,210
<9-12,Henry>就只有一个晚上
<9-12,Henry>It was just the one night.

237
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,580
<9-13,House>哦,你很明显完全忘记她了
<9-13,House>Oh, you're obviously,completely over her.

238
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,740
<9-14,Henry>Amy觉得爱情会让你作出愚蠢的选择
<9-14,Henry>Amy thinks love leads you,to make stupid choices.

239
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,310
<9-15,House>你还正好为她树立了一个好的榜样
<9-15,House>You're certainly setting,a good example for her.

240
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,880
<9-16,Henry>她只是还没有领会到
<9-16,Henry>She just doesn't get it.

241

<9-16,Henry>如果你没有准备好看起来很愚蠢的样子
<9-16,Henry>If you're not prepared,to look stupid,

242
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,880

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
<9-29,Amy>性传染病怎么会这样?
<9-29,Amy>How would an STD do this?

260
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,110
<10-1,Chase>这是瞬间肺部水肿
<10-1,Chase>,It was flash pulmonary edema.

261
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,010
<10-1,Chase>我们取走了一公升的液体
<10-1,Chase>We took a liter of fluid off,

262
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,210
<10-1,Chase>但问题不是他的肺
<10-1,Chase>but the problem wasn't,with his lungs.

263
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
<10-1,Chase>是他的心脏
<10-1,Chase>It's his heart.

264
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,480
<10-1,Chase>有赘生物
<10-1,Chase>There are vegetations

265
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,110
<10-1,Chase>阻碍了他的冠状动脉
<10-1,Chase>obstructing his mitral valve.

266
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,210
<10-2,Foreman>这不是性传染病
<10-2,Foreman>,It's not an STD.

271
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,110
<10-3,House>我觉得拜伦写过这种毛病
<10-3,House>I think Byron wrote about that.

272
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,410
<10-4,Cameron>可能是鹦鹉热
<10-4,Cameron>Could be psittacosis.

273
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,740
<10-5,Chase>衣原体培养恢复显示为阳性
<10-5,Chase>,Chlamydia cultures would've,come back positive.

274
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,410
<10-6,Foreman>绿色霉素链球装菌会伤害到心脏
<10-6,Foreman>Strep viridans,can hit the heart.

275
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,080
<10-7,Cameron>但不会导致生殖系统的紊乱
<10-7,Cameron>Wouldn't mess with,the reproductive system.

276
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,680
<10-7,Cameron>或许事情并不是...那么巧妙地关联
<10-7,Cameron>Maybe things aren't...,so nicely connected.

277
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,980
<10-7,Cameron>他65岁了
<10-7,Cameron>He's 65.

278

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,740
<10-9,Chase>这-不会有所联系吧
<10-9,Chase>It--it can't be relevant.

284
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,010
<10-10,House>看来除了性生活之外
<10-10,House>,It seems there are other ways

285
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,340
<10-10,House>还有其他的办法会把人杀死
<10-10,House>to kill people besides,having sex with them.

286
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,780
<11-1,House>你不是那么需要这个
<11-1,House>You don't need this so much.

287

303
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,180
<11-11,House>作为调味
<11-11,House>For flavor.

304
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,480
<11-12,Amy>你给他喂细菌?
<11-12,Amy>You fed him bacteria?

305
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,880
<11-13,House>几乎所有的东西上都有
<11-13,House>It's pretty much,on everything.

306
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,980
<11-13,House>特别是未经高温消毒的羊干酪
<11-13,House>Especially the unpasteurized,sheep cheese

307
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,710
<11-13,House>他们在阿尔卑斯山制作
<11-13,House>they make in the Alps.

308

<11-13,House>那东西会带给你普鲁氏菌病
<11-13,House>That stuff will give you,brucellosis.

312
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
<11-14,Henry>可没什么意义啊
<11-14,Henry>Doesn't make any sense.

313
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,340
<11-14,Henry>我是说,教堂里的其他人都没有生病
<11-14,Henry>I mean, nobody else,at the church got sick.

<11-15,House>使得那些恶心的普鲁氏菌死掉
<11-15,House>for all those nasty little,brucellosis bugs.

318
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,840
<11-15,House>但由于你一直反胃酸而在使用抗酸剂
<11-15,House>But you were taking antacids,for your acid reflux.

319
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,440
<11-15,House>所以就使得你的消化管道
<11-15,House>So that turns,your digestive tract

320
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,480
<11-15,House>变成了所有那些

<12-2,House>你的袜子不匹配
<12-2,House>Your socks don't match.

324
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,740
<12-2,House>那就表示你是在黑暗中
<12-2,House>Which means you got up

325
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,140
<12-2,House>起床穿衣的
<12-2,House>and got dressed in the dark,

326
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,510
<12-2,House>也就表示你不想吵醒你的妻子
<12-2,House>which means you don't want,to wake your wife.

327
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,640
<12-2,House>也表示你不想和她说话

328
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,680
<12-2,House>还说明--
<12-2,House>Which means--

329
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,880
<12-3,Wilson>我是在说你的病人
<12-3,Wilson>I was referring to your patient.

<12-4,House>拜托,我是根据干酪来医治的
<12-4,House>Come on, I'm basing it,on cheese.

332
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,280
<12-5,Wilson>还要多久才能拿到测试结果?
<12-5,Wilson>How long before,you get the tests back?

333
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,010
<12-6,House>我们会在拿到之前就知道结果了
<12-6,House>We'll know before that.

334
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,980
<12-6,House>如果我错了,他的病情会继续恶化,然后慢慢死亡
<12-6,House>If I'm wrong, he'll just keep,getting worse and slowly die.

335
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
<12-6,House>但如果我是对的,那我们都能够节约时间
<12-6,House>But if I'm right,,either we caught it in time

336
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,240
<12-6,House>他也会慢慢好起来
<12-6,House>and he gets better.

337
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,840
<12-6,House>也可能我们会更忙而他
<12-6,House>Or we didn't and he goes

338
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,510
<12-6,House>会在某个时刻需要用到强心剂
<12-6,House>into cardiac arrest,at any moment.

349
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,080

<15-1,Chase>His heart is back,in sinus rhythm.

360
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,410
<15-1,Chase>但受到了极大的损害
<15-1,Chase>There's a lot of damage,,though.

361
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,680
<15-2,Cameron>的确是普鲁氏菌病,但我们知道的太晚了
<15-2,Cameron>It was brucellosis,,but we got to it too late.

<15-2,Cameron>赘生物打破了他的冠动脉
<15-2,Cameron>The vegetation broke off,in his main coronary artery

<15-3,Foreman>他的心肌有一半已经坏死
<15-3,Foreman>His heart muscle's,half-dead.

<15-3,Foreman>幸运的话他还能活一个礼拜
<15-3,Foreman>He'll be lucky,to last a week.

<15-4,House>除了这些,他怎么样?
<15-4,House>Other than that,,how's he doing?

367
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,410
<15-4,House>我是认真的

00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,240
<15-5,Cameron>呃...他的脑部现在很好
<15-5,Cameron>Uh...his brain is clear now.

371
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,010
<15-5,Cameron>泌尿生殖器管道也很好
<15-5,Cameron>And so is,the genito-urinary tract.

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,440
<15-5,Cameron>肾功能也不错
<15-5,Cameron>And his kidney function is good.

373
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,280
<15-6,House>那么,他所需要的就是一个心脏,他自己的已经没有了
<15-6,House>So, all he needs is a heart,,and he's outta here.

374
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
<16-1,House>他是移植器官名单上的主要候选人
<16-1,House>,He's a prime candidate,for transplant.

<16-1,House>他的血毒理分析显示为阴性
<16-1,House>His tox screen was negative,for illegal drugs.

<16-1,House>是合法的
<16-1,House>And legal ones.

378

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,680
<16-2,Cuddy>他66岁了
<16-2,Cuddy>He's 66 years old.

381
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,780
<16-3,House>他告诉我他65岁,大话王
<16-3,House>He told me he was 65.,Liar.

382
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,810
<16-3,House>我不管了
<16-3,House>I'm outta here.

383
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,980
<16-4,Simpson>病人的年龄和手术成功几率
<16-4,Simpson>There is an inverse correlation

384
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,210
<16-4,Simpson>是成反比的
<16-4,Simpson>between patient age,and success rates.

385
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
<16-5,House>他非常健康
<16-5,House>He's in excellent health.

386
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,310
<16-5,House>在他23岁那年跌断腿以后
<16-5,House>This was his first,hospitalization

387
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,040
<16-5,House>这可是他第一次住院治疗
<16-5,House>since breaking his leg at 23.

388
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,580
<16-5,House>可能是22岁.我不太确定了
<16-5,House>Or 22.,I'm not sure anymore.

389
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,910
<16-6,Simpson>如果这个病人能从手术中存活下来
<16-6,Simpson>If this patient were to survive,the operation,

390
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,010
<16-6,Simpson>他还能获得什么?
<16-6,Simpson>he'd get another what?

<16-6,Simpson>5年,10年,或许20年,如果他幸运的话
<16-6,Simpson>5, 10, maybe 20 years,if he's very lucky.

392
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,710
<16-7,House>所以你是说
<16-7,House>,So you're saying

393
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,310
<16-7,House>老人不值得和一个年轻人一样来拯救
<16-7,House>that old people aren't as worth,saving as young people.

394
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
<16-8,Cuddy>他是说心脏
<16-8,Cuddy>,He's saying that hearts

395
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,110
<16-8,Cuddy>是很奇缺的资源
<16-8,Cuddy>are a scarce resource.

396
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,440
<16-8,Cuddy>很明显我们必须选择标准--
<16-8,Cuddy>We obviously have to,choose criteria--

397
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,980
<16-9,House>不,我懂了
<16-9,House>,No, I get it.

398
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,210
<16-9,House>女人能活的更长,所以她们应该有优先权,是吗?
<16-9,House>Women live longer, so they,should get preference, right?

399
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,910
<16-9,House>而非洲裔美国人
<16-9,House>And African-Americans,

400
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,240
<16-9,House>他们会死的比较早
<16-9,House>they die a lot younger.

401
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,680
<16-9,House>所以他们比较该死
<16-9,House>So to hell with them.

402
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,810
<16-10,Simpson>什么,你觉得你把我称为种族主义者
<16-10,Simpson>What, you think,you're gonna win me over

403
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,110
<16-10,Simpson>就能说过我吗?
<16-10,Simpson>by calling me a racist?

404
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,180
<16-11,House>如果测试是说谁应该能活的更长一些
<16-11,House>If the test is who gets,to use it the longest,

405
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,210
<16-11,House>你可以成为一个种族主义者或者伪君子
<16-11,House>you can either be a racist,or a hypocrite.

406
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,940
<16-12,Simpson>你的病人有自己的生活,有自己的家庭
<16-12,Simpson>Your patient had a life.,A family.

407
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,740
<16-12,Simpson>我们有一个18岁的孩子都没有--
<16-12,Simpson>We've got 18-year-old kids,who will neve--

408
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,140
<16-13,House>你多大了,医生?
<16-13,House>How old are you, Doctor?

409
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,940
<16-13,House>我们什么时候可以把你扔到冰河里去?
<16-13,House>When do we get to toss you,on an ice flow?

410
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,340
<16-14,Cuddy>好吧,谢谢你,House医生
<16-14,Cuddy>,And thank you, Dr. House.

411
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,180
<16-14,Cuddy>如果没有人有其他更多的问题
<16-14,Cuddy>Unless anybody else,has any further questions,

412
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,280
<16-14,Cuddy>我们现在要进入私下谈话部分
<16-14,Cuddy>we will now go,into private session.

413
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,280
<16-15,House>哦,我真是坐立不安啊
<16-15,House>Oh, I'm on pins and needles.

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,580
<16-15,House>我非常想知道你们是怎么决定的
<16-15,House>I wonder how you'll decide.

415
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,110
<17-1,Amy>网队在赛季中赢得了第三场的胜利
<17-1,Amy>The Nets just won,their third game in a row.

<17-1,Amy>Beat the Lakers.

417
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240

<17-2,Foreman>他们投了否决票
<17-2,Foreman>They voted no.

419
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
<17-3,Henry>所以...

423
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,140
<17-4,Foreman>我写了一封信给董事会成员
<17-4,Foreman>I wrote a letter,to the board of directors,

<18-1,Cameron>恳求考虑移植委员会的决定
<18-1,Cameron>appealing the transplant,committee's decision.

425
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,210
<18-1,Cameron>我说对你的偏见阻碍了他们的医学判断
<18-1,Cameron>I'm alleging bias against you,clouded their medical judgment.

432
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,880
<18-4,House>帮病人说情
<18-4,House>Advocating for my patient.

433
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,410
<18-6,House>我门诊的时间到了
<18-6,House>I've got clinic duty.

<18-7,Cameron>你真的以为这事能改变他们的决定?
<18-7,Cameron>You really think this thing'll,change their decision?

437
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,710
<18-8,House>不

438
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,080
<19-2,Patient>我想我把我的脚踝弄断了
<19-2,Patient>I think I broke my ankle.

439

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,240
<19-5,House>哪个?我要知道名字

<19-6,Patient>为什么它要有名字?,不是"它"
<19-6,Patient>Why would it have a name?,Well, not "it."

446
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
<19-7,House>是她,或者是他

<19-8,Patient>它只是只母牛
<19-8,Patient>It's a cow.

449

<19-9,House>嘿,我可不那个说他沉浸在爱河中的人
<19-9,House>Hey, I'm not the one,who said he was in love.

450
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,040
<19-9,House>人们真的要将这种情况
<19-9,House>People who actually,have this condition

451
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,080
<19-9,House>合理化
<19-9,House>rationalize it.

452
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,480
<19-9,House>他们会不去考虑
<19-9,House>They dismiss it.

453
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,210
<19-9,House>他们不会将这个提升到诗情画意的地步
<19-9,House>They don't elevate it,to the level of poetry.

454
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,780
<19-9,House>再加上那里还有块木头碎片
<19-9,House>Plus there's a wooden splinter,in there.

455
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,310
<19-9,House>所以要么是你自己撞到了一块宽4寸厚2尺的木头

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,240
<19-9,House>回来再编个故事唬其他人吧

465
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,140
<19-11,House>疼痛以及经常性的羞辱性测试后

<24-6,House>She's not in pain.,She's not suffering.

<24-6,House>我们只是...只是在这里处理她的肉体
<24-6,House>It's just her...meat,we're dealing with here.

<24-10,House>I respect the living.,Right.

598
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,840
<24-11,Donald>这就是为什么你让我觉得你是她的医生
<24-11,Donald>That is why you made me think,that you were her doctor.

599
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,140
<24-11,Donald>让我相信
<24-11,Donald>Made me believe that

600
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,210

<24-20,Cuddy>House.你不觉得有一些操纵吗?
<24-20,Cuddy>House. Don't you think,that's a little manipulative?

<24-21,House>不.是绝对的操纵
<24-21,House>No.,It's hugely manipulative.

<24-25,House>你很恼怒我,很好,我接受
<24-25,House>You're mad at me.,Fine, I get that.

<24-25,House>那就发泄在我身上,不要发泄在她身上
<24-25,House>Take it out on me.,Not on her.

624
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,740
<24-25,House>哇哦!
<24-25,House>Ooh!

625
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,470
<24-26,Donald>很好
<24-26,Donald>Fine.

626
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,810
<24-26,Donald>你的爸爸可以,呃...拥有她的心脏
<24-26,Donald>Your dad can, uh...,have her heart.

627
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,740
<25-1,House>发烧,胃疼
<25-1,House>Fever. Stomach pain.

628
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,540
<25-1,House>提升了肝脏的酶
<25-1,House>Raised liver enzymes.

629
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,970
<25-2,Foreman>她生病了
<25-2,Foreman>She's sick.

630
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
<25-3,House>比这更糟
<25-3,House>Worse than that.

631
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,210
<25-3,House>她死了
<25-3,House>She's dead.

632
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,010
<25-4,Foreman>我的意见是
<25-4,Foreman>My point is,

633
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,110
<25-4,Foreman>即使她没有得丙型肝炎
<25-4,Foreman>even if it's not hep C,

634
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,310
<25-4,Foreman>是其他什么毛病
<25-4,Foreman>it's something.

635
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,910
<25-4,Foreman>他们拒绝了她作为器官的捐赠人
<25-4,Foreman>They turned her down,as a donor

636
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,110
<25-4,Foreman>因为如果我们把她的心脏放到某人身体里
<25-4,Foreman>because if we put that heart,into someone,

637
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,770
<25-4,Foreman>他们都不会活下来
<25-4,Foreman>they won't survive.

638
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,070
<25-4,Foreman>不管是什么让她生的病都会害死他
<25-4,Foreman>Whatever made her sick,will kill him.

639
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,540
<25-5,House>是啊.那会是什么毛病?
<25-5,House>Yeah. So what is it?

640
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,910
<25-6,Chase>- 酶说明--,- 你要我们给
<25-6,Chase>Enzymes indicate--You want us to do

641
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,470
<25-6,Chase>一个死去的人做特别的诊断?
<25-6,Chase>a differential diagnosis,on a dead person?

642
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,270
<25-7,House>我们要把她治好
<25-7,House>We're going to cure her.

643
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
<25-8,Cameron>我们要把死人治好?
<25-8,Cameron>We're going to cure death?

644
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,470
<25-9,House>很明显
<25-9,House>Doubt it.

645
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,110
<25-9,House>只是想得到她心脏之外的感染源
<25-9,House>Just want to get the infection,out of her heart

646
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,540
<25-9,House>在我们把心脏从她身体里取出之前
<25-9,House>before we get the heart,out of her.

647
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,170
<25-9,House>发烧表示
<25-9,House>The fever indicates

648
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,740
<25-10,Foreman>- 有感染,- 她可能有肝炎
<25-10,Foreman>an infection.-She probably has hep C

649
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,110
<25-10,Foreman>以及严重的流感
<25-10,Foreman>and a bad case of the flu.

650
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,970
<25-11,House>假设一下,就为了好玩吧,问题的答案
<25-11,House>Let's assume, just for fun,,that the answer

651
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,470
<25-11,House>或许对我们会有很大的帮助
<25-11,House>is something,that might be helpful.

652
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,640
<25-12,Chase>发烧和胃疼
<25-12,Chase>Fever and belly pain.

653
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,270
<25-12,Chase>可能是胆囊感染
<25-12,Chase>Could be a gall bladder,infection.

654
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,710
<25-13,House>差不多
<25-13,House>Like that.

655
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,040
<25-13,House>做个核磁共振.马上
<25-13,House>Do an MRI. Stat.

656
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:30,370
<26-1,Foreman>你真的不需要待在这里
<26-1,Foreman>You really don't need to be here.

657
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,140
<26-2,Donald>我假定,呃,House是一个厉害的医生
<26-2,Donald>I assume, uh, House,is a great doctor.

658
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,040
<26-3,Chase>你为什么要这么假定?
<26-3,Chase>Why would you assume that?

659
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,940
<26-4,Donald>因为,呃,如果你是那么个古怪的家伙
<26-4,Donald>Because, uh, when you're,that big a jerk,

660
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,740
<26-4,Donald>要么你很厉害,要么你只能失业
<26-4,Donald>you're either great,or unemployed.

661
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,110
<26-4,Donald>没有胆囊感染的迹象
<26-4,Donald>No sign of gall bladder infection.

662
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,440
<27-1,Chase>但那里有个肿囊
<27-1,Chase>But there was a cyst.

663
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,540
<27-2,Foreman>- 非常肥大,- 丙型肝炎不会导致--
<27-2,Foreman>Perfectly round.,Now, hep C wouldn't cause--

664
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,240
<27-3,House>问题并不是问你是不是丙型肝炎
<27-3,House>The question was never,,is it hep C?

665
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,710
<27-3,House>给出的问题是说那并不是丙型肝炎
<27-3,House>The question was given,that it's not hep C,

666
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,310
<27-4,Chase>是什么?
<27-4,Chase>what is it?

667
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,140
<27-5,Cameron>腺瘤?,不够立体
<27-5,Cameron>Adenoma?,Not solid enough.

668
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,940
<27-6,Foreman>巨型血管瘤?
<27-6,Foreman>Cavernous hemangioma?

669
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,110
<27-7,Cameron>周围没有血管
<27-7,Cameron>Not vascular enough.

670
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,740
<27-8,House>如果她在排便后洗手的时候
<27-8,House>What if she was sloppy

671
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,640
<27-8,House>被污染了呢?
<27-8,House>about washing her hands,after pooping?

672
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,670
<27-9,Foreman>呃...,变形虫感染?
<27-9,Foreman>Uh...,amoeba infection?

673
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,340
<27-10,House>如果变形虫病是从她的肝脏开始发作
<27-10,House>If the amebiasis started,in her liver,

674
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,540
<27-10,House>然后扩展到她的血液中
<27-10,House>then spread to her blood,

675
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,510
<27-10,House>那就能解释她所有的症状
<27-10,House>that would explain,all her symptoms.

676
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,940
<27-10,House>除了为什么会撞碎头骨盖
<27-10,House>Except for the crushed skull,

677
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,410
<27-10,House>而我还很好奇这只是一起小汽车撞车
<27-10,House>but I'm assuming that's,from the car crash.

678
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,310
<27-11,Chase>我会开始给她进行巴龙霉素和氯喹的治疗
<27-11,Chase>Ill start her on paromomycin,and chloroquine.

679
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,710
<27-12,House>每种十克
<27-12,House>Ten grams each.

680
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,470
<27-13,Chase>那...可是正常剂量的20倍
<27-13,Chase>That's...,20 times the normal dose.

681
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,310
<27-14,House>是的.所以我们会破坏她的视网膜,还会损害她的听力
<27-14,House>Right. So we'll destroy her,retinas and damage her hearing.

682
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,070
<27-14,House>无论谁得到这样的治疗都是非常糟糕的一天
<27-14,House>Whoever wants those parts,is having a very bad day.

683
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,370
<27-14,House>对于她来说,治疗几个小时后,她会感觉非常好的
<27-14,House>Couple hours on the meds,,she'll be feeling great.

684
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,810
<28-1,House>我得到了你的报告结果
<28-1,House>Got your labs.

<28-5,House>所有的蛋白质
<28-5,House>All kinds of proteins.

694
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,310
<28-5,House>包括一些被我称为

00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,510
<28-5,House>牛的免疫血清的东西
<28-5,House>bovine serum albumin.

696
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,010
<28-5,House>是通过吃某些你所说过
<28-5,House>Which you get from eating

697
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,810
<28-5,House>的动物而得来的
<28-5,House>the animals mentioned.

698
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,270
<28-5,House>或是母牛
<28-5,House>Or cow.

699
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,970
<28-5,House>你不是真的崇拜母牛
<28-5,House>You don't really worship cows.

700
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,740
<28-5,House>所以我不得不想知道,还有什么比
<28-5,House>So I have to wonder,,what could be more humiliating

701
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,610
<28-5,House>有人叫你的女朋友为母牛,而并没有
<28-5,House>than someone calling,your girlfriend a cow

702
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,940
<28-5,House>隐含寓意在里面更为羞辱的了
<28-5,House>and not being metaphorical?

703
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,740
<28-6,House>不错
<28-6,House>Nice.

704
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,970
<28-7,Patient>这是我的妈妈

707
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,010
<28-9,Patient>她会穿着比基尼在房子里面走来走去,或穿的更少
<28-9,Patient>She goes around the house,in a bikini. Or less.

717
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,010

<28-13,Patient>until I graduate and I move,out of the house.

718
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,340
<28-13,Patient>求你了
<28-13,Patient>Please.

719
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,640
<28-14,House>你不会在毕业的时候再得到任何乐趣
<28-14,House>You're not gonna have any fun,at graduation.

720
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,140
<29-1,House>继续保持好好工作
<29-1,House>Keep up the good work.

721
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,770
<29-1,House>你的衬衣是烫过的
<29-1,House>Your shirt is ironed.

722
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,070
<29-1,House>那表示你还没有跟你的妻子说什么
<29-1,House>That means you haven't told,your wife anything.

723
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,340
<29-2,Wilson>就算你是对的吧
<29-2,Wilson>Let's say you're right.

724
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,040
<29-3,House>你说我说对了?

<29-3,House>No.Let is saying.

726
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,240
<29-5,House>那样说是不是会
<29-5,House>Does it occur to you,that maybe

727
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,040
<29-4,Wilson>比说"闭上你的嘴"要更深刻些?
<29-4,Wilson>there's some deeper guidance,than "keep your mouth shut"?

728
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,770
<29-4,Wilson>一个朋友的价值对你来说是否
<29-4,Wilson>That maybe a friend might

729
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,340
<29-4,Wilson>比油腔滑调要高一些呢?
<29-4,Wilson>value concern over glibness?

730
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,070
<29-4,Wilson>或许...
<29-4,Wilson>That maybe...

731
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,040
<29-4,Wilson>或许我该检查一下
<29-4,Wilson>Maybe I'm going through,something

732
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,340
<29-4,Wilson>我是否真的需要真的讨论一下这件事情?
<29-4,Wilson>that I need to have,an actual conversation about?

733
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,810
<29-5,House>你是否想过你需要
<29-5,House>Does it occur to you

734
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,770
<29-5,House>这种类型的一个朋友
<29-5,House>that if you need,that kind of a friend,

735
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,870
<29-5,House>会让你不至于犯下更深刻的错误
<29-5,House>you may have made,some deeper errors.

736
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,040
<29-5,House>她的心跳不正常
<29-5,House>Her heartbeat's irregular.

737
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,910
<30-1,Chase>像是整体运动功能减退
<30-1,Chase>Looks like global hypokinesis.

738
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,870
<30-2,House>停止治疗
<30-2,House>Stop the meds.

739
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,910
<30-3,Donald>你放弃了?
<30-3,Donald>You're giving up?

740
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,740
<30-4,House>要么是我们错了,她的心脏的确不能使用...
<30-4,House>Either we're wrong,and her heart is unusable...

741
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,970
<30-4,House>如果我们是对的,就是我们给她的治疗
<30-4,House>or right, but the treatment,we had to give her

742
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,540
<30-4,House>会让她的心脏不能使用
<30-4,House>will make her heart unusable.

743

<30-4,House>对不起.你现在可以拔管子了
<30-4,House>I'm sorry.,You can pull the plug now.

<30-4,House>帮我再找一具尸体吧
<30-4,House>Find me another body.

745
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,910
<30-4,House>那个服用避孕药的的胖子看来没那么热切
<30-4,House>That fat guy on Ortho service,didn't look so hot.

746
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,240
<30-4,House>不!
<30-4,House>No!

747
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,610
<30-5,Donald>她还没有准备好
<30-5,Donald>She's not ready.

748
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,610
<30-6,House>你今天早上就已经准备好了
<30-6,House>You were ready this morning.

749
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,840
<30-7,Donald>她还没有死
<30-7,Donald>She's not done.

750
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
<30-7,Donald>她要救那个家伙
<30-7,Donald>????

751
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,010
<31-1,House>交替理论?
<31-1,House>Alternate theories?

752
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,170
<31-2,Chase>变形虫病是我们最希望的
<31-2,Chase>Amebiasis was our best hope.

753
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,970
<31-2,Chase>但事实是她的心跳恢复到了正常速率
<31-2,Chase>The fact that her heart rate,went back to normal

754
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,870
<31-2,Chase>在我们适时停止了治疗后
<31-2,Chase>when we stopped the meds pretty much

755
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,340
<31-3,House>那我们第二个希望呢?
<31-3,House>What's our second best hope?

756
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,170
<31-4,Chase>House,可以把听筒放下了
<31-4,Chase>House, put down the wand.

757
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,540
<31-4,Chase>那里没有什么障碍物
<31-4,Chase>There's no obstruction.

758
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,240
<31-5,Foreman>或许我们应该进行一下
<31-5,Foreman>Maybe we should just

759
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,470
<31-5,Foreman>活组织切片检查
<31-5,Foreman>biopsy it.

760
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,210
<31-6,House>她就像是一台拔了电源的冰箱
<31-6,House>She's a fridge,with the power out.

761
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,540
<31-6,House>如果我们戳开看里面
<31-6,House>We start poking around inside,

762
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,670
<31-6,House>蔬菜就都会坏掉
<31-6,House>the vegetable goes bad.

763
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,870
<31-6,House>不能动
<31-6,House>No offense.

764
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,570
<31-7,Foreman>我觉得我们没太多选择
<31-7,Foreman>I don't see that,we have a lot of choice.

765
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
<31-7,Foreman>唯一可以找到感染源的方法--
<31-7,Foreman>The only way we're gonna find,that infection--

766
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,540
<31-8,Cameron>如果不是感染呢?
<31-8,Cameron>What if it's not an infection?

767
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,140
<31-8,Cameron>毒素可以导致相似的症状
<31-8,Cameron>Toxins can cause similar symptoms.

768
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,040
<31-8,Cameron>特别是在肝脏受损的情况下
<31-8,Cameron>Especially if whatever it is,did liver damage.

769
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,210
<31-9,Donald>她,呃,毒理检验正常
<31-9,Donald>Her, uh, toxin screen was clean.

770
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,310
<31-10,House>那些仪器永远也照不出
<31-10,House>Those things never cover

771
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,670
<31-10,House>任何真正的毒素
<31-10,House>for any of the really cool,toxins.

772
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,510
<31-10,House>再做一次扫描看看你能想到什么
<31-10,House>Run the screen again,for whatever you can think of.

773
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,870
<31-10,House>你,让另外一个病人继续活着
<31-10,House>You, keep the other patient,alive.

<31-10,House>你,去检查一下学校
<31-10,House>You, check out the school.

775
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,640
<31-10,House>我看来需要
<31-10,House>And I seem to need

776
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,110
<31-10,House>再去雇个医生
<31-10,House>to hire another doctor

777
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,940
<31-10,House>来检查她的屋子
<31-10,House>to go search her home.

778
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,740
<31-10,House>来吧
<31-10,House>Come on.

779
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,410
<32-1,Donald>如果她正在服用什么药物
<32-1,Donald>If she was taking,any medications,

780
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,340
<32-1,Donald>我会知道的
<32-1,Donald>I'd know about it.

781
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,140
<32-2,House>你的妻子染发吗?
<32-2,House>Did your wife dye her hair?

782
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,610
<32-2,House>不

<32-3,Donald>她妈妈头发一直没有变白
<32-3,Donald>Her mom never went gray.

784

785
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,510
<32-4,House>那我猜这一定是你的
<32-4,House>Guess this must be yours, then.

786
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,770
<32-4,House>你能否想起有什么她可能会对你撒谎的?
<32-4,House>Can you think of anything else,she might've lied to you about?

787
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,310
<32-4,House>有什么毒品是在她嫁给你之后戒掉的?
<32-4,House>Any drugs she "gave up",when she married you?

788
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,540
<33-1,Chase>你感觉怎么样,先生?
<33-1,Chase>How are you feeling, sir?

789
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,510
<33-1,Chase>Arrington先生?

<33-1,Chase>Mr. Arrington?

791
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,810
<33-2,Amy>怎么了?
<33-2,Amy>What's going on?

792
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,370
<33-3,Chase>他的心脏没有向脑部提供足够的血液
<33-3,Chase>His heart's not pumping enough,blood to his brain.

793
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,740
<33-3,Chase>我们必须给它一些帮助
<33-3,Chase>We're gonna have to give it,some help.

794
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,470
<33-3,Chase>去把充气囊准备好
<33-3,Chase>Get the balloon ready.

795
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,570
<34-1,House>你用这个抽屉?
<34-1,House>You use this drawer?

796
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,810
<34-2,Donald>不,是放她的维生素的
<34-2,Donald>,No, that's for her vitamins.

797
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,240
<34-3,House>安眠药
<34-3,House>Sleeping pills.

798
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,970
<34-4,Donald>她从来不吃安眠药
<34-4,Donald>She never took sleeping pills.

799
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,370
<34-4,Donald>好吧
<34-4,Donald>Okay.

800
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,610
<34-5,House>你在减肥?
<34-5,House>You on a diet?

801
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,510
<34-5,House>不
<34-5,House>No.

802
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,010
<34-6,Donald>我猜你从未真正去了解过一个人,是吗?
<34-6,Donald>I guess you never really,know someone, do you?

803
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,070
<34-7,House>不错的洞察力
<34-7,House>Quite the insight.

804
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,370
<34-7,House>关于她的头发她对你撒了谎
<34-7,House>She lied to you,about her hair color.

805
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,670
<34-7,House>不想你知道她觉得她自己很胖
<34-7,House>And didn't want you to know,she thought she was fat.

806
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,110
<34-7,House>除非你从来没有对她
<34-7,House>Unless you never lied to her

807
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,870
<34-7,House>撒过什么大谎
<34-7,House>about anything that huge.

808
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,240
<34-7,House>否则你就不可能让这些事情自然发展
<34-7,House>And then you can probably,let those slide.

809
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,040
<35-1,Foreman>减肥药会让她的机能混乱
<35-1,Foreman>Diet pills could've,messed her up.

810
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,170
<35-1,Foreman>引起生物酶升高,导致腹痛
<35-1,Foreman>Raised the live enzymes,and caused the bellyache.

811
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,310
<35-2,House>但不会发烧
<35-2,House>But not the fever.

812
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,070
<35-3,Foreman>或许是其他东西导致发烧
<35-3,Foreman>Maybe something else,set off the fever.

813
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,470
<35-4,House>什么呢?
<35-4,House>Like what?

814
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,770
<35-5,Cameron>在我给你看这些之前
<35-5,Cameron>Before I show you these,

815
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,870
<35-5,Cameron>它们是被锁在她书桌的抽屉里
<35-5,Cameron>they were in a locked drawer,in her desk.

816
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,810
<35-5,Cameron>代校长说肯定是Laura
<35-5,Cameron>The vice principal,said that Laura

817
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,240
<35-5,Cameron>没收了它们
<35-5,Cameron>must've confiscated them.

818
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,310
<35-5,Cameron>它们肯定有什么问题--
<35-5,Cameron>They've had some problems with--

819
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,570
<35-6,House>既不有趣也没有帮助
<35-6,House>Neither interesting nor helpful.

820
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,910
<35-6,House>至少很有趣
<35-6,House>This at least is interesting.

821
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,240
<35-7,Foreman>不,不有趣
<35-7,Foreman>[No, it's not.

822
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,240
<35-8,House>和青少年做爱不有趣吗?
<35-8,House>Sex with teenagers,isn't interesting?

823
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,240
<35-8,House>你在哪里长大的?
<35-8,House>Where did you grow up?

824
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,840
<35-9,Foreman>这没什么用
<35-9,Foreman>It isn't helpful.

825
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,170
<35-9,Foreman>青少年并不是毒素
<35-9,Foreman>Teenage boys,aren't toxins.

826
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,640
<35-10,House>如果囊肿并不是囊肿呢?
