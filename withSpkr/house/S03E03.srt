15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,140
<4-52,Dad and Daughter >71岁 癌症研究专家
<4-52,Dad and Daughter >71 years old, cancer research specialist

16
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,430
<4-62,Cameron >轻微震颤 两年前切除局限性黑色素瘤,有白内障
<4-62,Cameron >Minor tremors,localized melanoma,removed two years ago,cataracts.

17
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,520
<4-72,Cameron >而且他不能呼吸
<4-72,Cameron >And he can't breathe.

18
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,100
<4-72,Cameron >还不算脸部的伤痕
<4-72,Cameron >Also,disregard,the facial lacerations.

19
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,010
<3-1,House>虽然很可怕 但与这次发病没关系
<3-1,House>They're creepy,,but unfortunately irrelevant.

20
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,000
<3-1,House>不想知道原因吗?
<3-1,House>Don't you want to know why?

21
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,460
<3-2,Cameron>你用拐杖的原因
<3-2,Cameron>You have your cane.

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,840
<3-2,Cameron>不 是那些可怕伤痕的原因
<3-2,Cameron>No,why the lacerations,are creepy.

23
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,800
<3-3,House>他晕倒的时候 在实验室里解剖大白鼠
<3-3,House>He was about to dissect,one of his lab rats when he collapsed.

24
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,910
<3-3,House>可以说 他整天弄老鼠
<3-3,House>The little vermin seized,the day,so to speak,

25
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,350
<3-3,House>结果把自己给搭上去了
<3-3,House>and went medieval,on his ass.

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,550
<3-3,House>怎么了? 我拉链开了?
<3-3,House>What?,My fly open?

27
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,270
<3-4,Foreman>又开始疼了
<3-4,Foreman>So the pain's returned.

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
<3-5,House>不疼 他没有意识了
<3-5,House>There was no pain,,he was unconscious.

29
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,180
<3-5,House>我想是因为他无法呼吸
<3-5,House>I'm guessing because,he wasn't able to breathe.

30
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,490
<3-6,Cameron>我们是在说你
<3-6,Cameron>We're talking about you.

31
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,060
<3-7,House>明显是 但明显我不是
<3-7,House>Obviously.,I'm obviously not.

32
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,330
<3-7,House>你们这些人怎么了?,我不用拐杖 你们觉得惊讶
<3-7,House>What is it with you people?,I don't use the cane,you're shocked.

33
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
<3-8,Cameron>- 我用了...,- 我们只是关心你
<3-8,Cameron>I use the cane...,We're just concerned.

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,420
<3-9,House>搞错对象了 我还能呼吸
<3-9,House>About the wrong person.,I can breathe.

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,650
<3-9,House>而那个Ezra Powell都快死了
<3-9,House>Ezra Powell,on the other hand,,is gonna die.

36
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,850
<3-10,Foreman>那个Ezra Powell?
<3-10,Foreman>The Ezra Powell?

37
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,750
<3-11,Chase>研究员? 写那本教材的?
<3-11,Chase>Researcher? The guy who wrote,that textbook?

38
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,520
<3-12,House>不是那本教材 就一本
<3-12,House>Not that textbook,,the textbook.

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,890
<3-13,Cameron>等下 又一个你崇拜的医生?
<3-13,Cameron>Wait. There's actually,another doctor you admire?

40
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,790
<3-14,House>我崇拜很多医生的
<3-14,House>I admire lots,of doctors.

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,680
<3-14,House>当然了 他们穿起膝袜来,比Ezra Powell好看多了
<3-14,House>Of course,most of them look a lot better,in knee socks than Ezra Powell,

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,250
<3-14,House>他们呼吸正常
<3-14,House>but seeing,as they can all breathe...

43
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,890
<3-15,Chase>基底被氧化
<3-15,Chase>Oxygenation is,through the floor,

44
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,450
<3-15,Chase>肺部充满了积液
<3-15,Chase>and lungs are full,of fluid.

45
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,770
<3-15,Chase>应该是心脏 可能是淀粉样变性病
<3-15,Chase>Gotta be his heart.,Could be amyloidosis.

46
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,350
<3-16,Foreman>也许是肺,多年来在实验室吸入有毒化学物
<3-16,Foreman>Or his lungs,probably from years of inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,430
<3-17,Chase>不是肺 胸片没问题
<3-17,Chase>not the lungs,chest x-ray's clean.

48
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,190
<3-18,Foreman>心电图也好的 不是心脏
<3-18,Foreman>so's his ekg,it's not his heart.

49
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,200
<3-19,House>我们太友善了
<3-19,House>We're being too nice!

50
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,060
<3-19,House>在医院外 他不能呼吸 医院里就行
<3-19,House>Outside the hospital,he can't breathe,inside the hospital,he can.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,110
<3-19,House>因为我们帮了忙
<3-19,House>Because we help.

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,170
<3-19,House>足以干扰了检查结果
<3-19,House>At least,enough to screw with our test results.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,380
<3-19,House>问题的症结不是在心脏就是在肺
<3-19,House>Source of the problem's either in his heart or his lungs.

54
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,990
<3-19,House>要做的就是停止帮助
<3-19,House>So all we gotta do is stop helping.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,190
<3-19,House>施加压力 看哪个先崩溃
<3-19,House>Put a little pressure on him,and see which gives out first.

56
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,410
<3-20,Chase>71岁 心或肺一旦衰竭,很难复苏
<3-20,Chase>At 71,we get his heart or lungs to give out,we might not get 'em to give in again.

57
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,440
<3-21,House>所以才要在医院进行
<3-21,House>That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital.

58
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,080
<3-21,House>让他在倾斜的踏机上运动 作压力心电图
<3-21,House>Put him on an incline treadmill,and do a stress ekg.

59
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,950
<3-22,Foreman>所谓仰慕不过如此
<3-22,Foreman>So much for the admiration.

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,140
<4-1,Cameron>开始吧
<4-1,Cameron>let's get you started.

61
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,770
<4-1,Cameron>把氧气调高
<4-1,Cameron>I'll turn your oxygen up.

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,960
<4-2,Powell >我和William研究过这机器,最早的医疗方案
<4-2,Powell >I-I worked with williams on the first protocol for this machine.

63
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,510
<4-3,Cameron>大家都还在用它
<4-3,Cameron>Everyone still uses it.

64
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,180
<4-4,Powell>除了Williams
<4-4,Powell>Except for williams.

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,290
<4-4,Powell>他4年前去世了
<4-4,Powell>He died four years ago.

66
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,320
<4-5,Cameron>真遗憾
<4-5,Cameron>I'm sorry.

67
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,440
<4-6,Powell >享年84
<4-6,Powell >He was 84.

68
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,490
<4-6,Powell >他死于帆伞运动
<4-6,Powell >He died parasailing.

69
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,520
<4-6,Powell >他一直是个傻瓜
<4-6,Powell >He was always an idiot.

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,790
<4-7,Cameron >你没事?
<4-7,Cameron >You okay?

71
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,760
<4-7,Cameron >哈
<4-7,Cameron >Oh,huh.

72
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,030
<4-7,Cameron >坚持住 医疗方案只几分钟
<4-7,Cameron >Hang in there,you knowthe protocol's only a few minutes.

73
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,970
<4-8,Foreman>心律平稳
<4-8,Foreman>his heart rate's flat.

74
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,320
<4-8,Foreman>不超过130 就什么也观察不到
<4-8,Foreman>We don't get it past 130,we're not gonna see anything.

75
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,790
<4-9,Chase>要是摔倒 折了髋 一样观察不到
<4-9,Chase>and if he falls and breaks a hip,we're not gonna see anything either.

76
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,080
<4-9,Chase>除了增加医疗失当保险费
<4-9,Chase>Except an increasein our malpractice insurance.

77
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,670
<4-10,Cameron >我料到House会再吃药片,可他又用拐杖了 回到之前
<4-10,Cameron >I figured house might go backto the pills,but if he's using his cane,he's right back to where he was before.

78
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,810
<4-10,Cameron >甚至更糟
<4-10,Cameron >Maybe even worse.

79
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,990
<4-11,Chase>幸好 他能像个成人 坦然接受
<4-11,Chase>Luckily,he'll handle itin a stoic,grown-up fashion.

80
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,320
<4-11,Chase>他永远不会对我们表现出来
<4-11,Chase>He'd never take itout on us.

81
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,510
<4-12,Powell >我不行了
<4-12,Powell >I can'T.

82
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,970
<4-12,Powell >得停下
<4-12,Powell >I've--I gotta stop.

83
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,080
<4-13,Cameron >再久一些
<4-13,Cameron >Just a little longer.

84
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,810
<4-14,Foreman>心律才90
<4-14,Foreman>heart rate's only 90.

85
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,160
<4-14,Foreman>把倾斜角加大
<4-14,Foreman>I'm gonna increasethe incline.

86
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,780
<4-15,Powell>非得停下了
<4-15,Powell>I gotta stop.

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,150
<4-15,Powell>我要下来
<4-15,Powell>I-I've gotta get off.

88
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,090
<4-16,Cameron>你做得很好 再快点怎样?
<4-16,Cameron>You're doing great,just a little faster,okay?

89
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,040
<4-17,Powell>我可不要啦啦队长 要需要氧气
<4-17,Powell>I--I don't needa cheerleader,I need oxygen.

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,690
<4-61,House >停
<4-61,House >Stop.

91
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,600
<4-62,Cameron >不起作用
<4-62,Cameron >This isn't working.

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,320
<4-19,House>他的心律都没超90
<4-19,House>His heart ratebarely got above 90.

93
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,970
<4-20,Cameron>他无法呼吸 肺里积液太多
<4-20,Cameron>He can't breathe,there'stoo much fluid in his lungs.

94
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,190
<4-20,Cameron>真的?
<4-20,Cameron>Really?

95
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,540
<4-20,Cameron>他肺里有积液?
<4-20,Cameron>He's got fluid in his lungs?

96
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,890
<4-21,House >该怎么办?
<4-21,House >Whatever are we gonna do?

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,350
<4-21,House >哦 记得了
<4-21,House >Oh,yeah,now I remember.

98
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,890
<4-21,House >让他在踏机上 像轮轴上的老鼠一样跑
<4-21,House >Put him on a treadmill,and run him like one of his ratson a wheel.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,410
<4-22,Cameron>他跑不起来 几乎不能走
<4-22,Cameron>He can't run,he can hardly walk.

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,990
<4-23,House>那是因为他还不够努力
<4-23,House>That's 'cause he's not tryinghard enough.

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,300
<4-23,House>如果加把劲 他的心率就会上升了
<4-23,House>If he was,his heart ratewould go up.

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,250
<4-24,Cameron>肺里充满积液 运动起来会很疼
<4-24,Cameron>Exercising with a lungful of your own bodily fluidstends to hurt.

103
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,430
<4-25,House>叫做压力测试 不是没有缘由的
<4-25,House>They don't call ita stress test for nothing.

104
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,160
<4-26,Cameron>- 重新做测试,- 他快要溺弊了!
<4-26,Cameron>Do it again.,He's drowning!

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,480
<4-27,House >把他从池子里拉出来 然后重新做
<4-27,House >Then pull him out of the pool,and do it again.

106
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,270
<4-28,Powell >我想这不是你的远期解决方案
<4-28,Powell >I'm assuming this isn'tyour idea of a long-term solution.

107
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,450
<4-29,Cameron>需要排掉你肺内的积水 才可以做测试
<4-29,Cameron>We need to get rid of the fluidin your lungs so you'll be able to dothe test.

108
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,700
<4-30,Powell >看看问题出在我的心脏还是肺
<4-30,Powell >To see if it's my heartor my lungs.

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,940
<4-31,Cameron>就是这样
<4-31,Cameron>Exactly.

110
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,880
<4-32,Powell>我这两样都花过钱了
<4-32,Powell>My money's on both.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,420
<4-32,Powell>过去几年 我一直进进出出医院
<4-32,Powell>I've been in and outof the hospital for the past year.

112
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,830
<4-32,Powell>我又老又病
<4-32,Powell>I'm old,i'm sick.

113
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,990
<4-32,Powell>变得更老 病得更重
<4-32,Powell>I'm getting older,and sicker.

114
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,260
<4-32,Powell>不是非常有趣的鉴别诊断 但是--哦
<4-32,Powell>Not a very interestingdifferential,but--oh.

115
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,540
<4-33,Chase>进去了
<4-33,Chase>I'm in.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,150
<4-34,Dad >你不需要一个400刀的手提包
<4-34,Dad >You don't needa $400 handbag.

117
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,180
<4-35,House>这样查你的喉咙有点难,如果你的牙床上下翻滚
<4-35,House>It's kinda hardto check your throat when you're flappingyour gums around.

118
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,180
<4-36,Dad >哦 不好意思
<4-36,Dad >Oh,sorry.

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,720
<4-37,Daughter>但是为了秋季社交活动
<4-37,Daughter>But it's forthe fall formal.

120
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,300
<4-38,House >他不会在乎 就算是为了总统就职典礼
<4-38,House >He doesn't care if it's forthe presidential inauguration.

121
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,380
<4-40,Daughter>但是我穿Merissa的旧裙子 这不花钱
<4-40,Daughter>But I'm usingmarissa's old dress.It's free.

122
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,190
<4-41,House >你知道还有什么是不花钱的?
<4-41,House >Yeah,you knowwhat else is free?

123
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,640
<4-41,House >你头上的屋顶 吃的东西 你的电话 电脑
<4-41,House >Roof over your head,the food you eat,your phone,your computer.

124
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,970
<4-41,House >你已经这样充血了多久?
<4-41,House >How longhave you been congested?

125
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,300
<4-42,Dad>一周 自从弗雷斯诺(加州中部城市)回来
<4-42,Dad>A week,ever since we got backfrom fresno.

126
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:34,980
<4-43,House >弗雷斯诺?
<4-43,House >Fresno?

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,150
<4-43,House >是在法国 对么?
<4-43,House >That's in france,right?

<4-65,Cameron>是肾上腺素么? 这不在治疗方案内
<4-65,Cameron>Is that epi?That's not the protocol.

165
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,600
<4-66,House >不是 你遵循治疗方案 都失败了

<4-70,Powell >不 他是对的!
<4-70,Powell >No,he's right!

173
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,060
<4-70,Powell >让他这样做
<4-70,Powell >Let him do it.

174
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,530
<4-71,House>瞧见了? 这就是他为什么不需要穿中统袜
<4-71,House>See?That's why he doesn'thave to wear knee socks.

181
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,730
<4-75,House>表示说问题不在心脏 那么肯定是在肺部了
<4-75,House>Which meansit's not the heart.So it must be the lungs.

182
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,310
<4-75,House>瞧见了? 没有那么难 不是么?
<4-75,House>See?Wasn't so hard,was it?

183
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,070

<4-77,Cameron>测试结束 没问题 让你稳定下来
<4-77,Cameron>Test is over,it's okay,we're gonna stabilize you.

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,090
<4-78,Powell>不 就让我死去

188
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,100
<4-79,Cameron>你不会死的
<4-79,Cameron>You're not gonna die.

189
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,110
<4-80,Powell >不 我会的
<4-80,Powell >Yes,i am.

190
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,410
<4-81,Cameron>会找到治疗方法的
<4-81,Cameron>We'll find a treatment.

191
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,800
<4-82,Powell >我不要像这样活着
<4-82,Powell >I don't wanna livelike this.

195
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,130
<4-83,Cameron>他不要再检查,他要我们帮他死去
<4-83,Cameron>he says no more tests,he wants to die and he wants us to help him do it

196
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,200
<4-84,House >我要玩个小游戏 叫作,与米斯蒂·梅防守扣球 (排球名将)
<4-84,House >And I want to playa little game I like to call block my spikewith misty may.

197
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,540
<4-85,Cameron>他经过深思熟虑 这不是冲动的决定.
<4-85,Cameron>He's thought this through,it's not an impulsive decision.

198
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,720
<4-86,House>我的也不是
<4-86,House>Neither is mine.

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,660
<4-86,House>他心情抑郁
<4-86,House>He's depressed.

200
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,180
<4-86,House>治好以后 就会感觉好多了
<4-86,House>He'll feel much betterafter we cure him.

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,810
<4-87,Chase>他和我们都目睹了检查
<4-87,Chase>He's seen l the testswe've seen.

202
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,140
<4-87,Chase>即使搞清了引起肺损伤的原因,要扭转病情也太迟了
<4-87,Chase>Even if we figure outwhat's causing the lung damage,it's too late to reverse it.

203
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,130
<4-88,House>不知道问题所在 说不准的
<4-88,House>You can't know that withoutknowing what's wrong.

204
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,600
<4-89,Chase >他有权决定
<4-89,Chase >It's his calL.

205
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,520
<4-90,Foreman>那么 我们怎么办?
<4-90,Foreman>So,what do we do?

206
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,750
<4-90,Foreman>把一个塑料袋罩在他头上来结果..?
<4-90,Foreman>Put a plastic bag over his headand get it over with?

207
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,370
<4-91,Chase>不 给他满满一针的吗啡
<4-91,Chase>No,we give him a syringefull of morphine.

208
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,370
<4-91,Chase>我共事过的每个医生都曾做过
<4-91,Chase>Every doctor I've everpracticed with has done it.

209
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,710
<4-91,Chase>他们不想 也不喜欢这么做,但行医就是如此
<4-91,Chase>They don't want to,they don't like to,but that's the way it is.

210
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,520
<4-92,Foreman >我没有过 我不会的
<4-92,Foreman >I haven't,I won'T.

211
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,680
<4-93,Cameron>我也做不了
<4-93,Cameron>I couldn't do it either.

212
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,780
<4-94,Chase >你刚刚说过 要尊重他的决定
<4-94,Chase >You just said we should respecthis decision.

213
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,300
<4-95,Cameron>尊重决定不意味着我们赞同它
<4-95,Cameron>Respect it doesn'tnecessarily mean we honor it.

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,060
<4-95,Cameron>是啊
<4-95,Cameron>Right.

215
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,860
<4-96,Chase>意味着讨论一下
<4-96,Chase>It just means we talk about it.

216
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,750
<4-96,Chase>在某种意义上 "不伤害"意味着顺其自然
<4-96,Chase>At some point,"do no harm"has to mean allowing nature to take its course,

217
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,380
<4-96,Chase>而不是顽固的从中阻拦
<4-96,Chase>not stubbornly standing in the way of it.

218
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,920
<4-97,Foreman>把金属针头插进静脉输液管,注入致命剂量的吗啡
<4-97,Foreman>Sticking a metal syringeinto a plastic iv line and pumping in a lethal doseof morphine

219
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,050
<4-97,Foreman>不叫作顺其自然
<4-97,Foreman>is not letting naturetake its course.

220
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,560
<4-97,Foreman>按照新泽西州的规矩 也不是
<4-97,Foreman>Not according to the stateof new jersey.

221
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,410
<4-98,Cameron>让他在积液中慢慢窒息 会更好些?
<4-98,Cameron>So it's better we allow himto slowly suffocate in his own plasma?

222
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,490
<4-99,Foreman>你到底站在谁那边 参议员?
<4-99,Foreman>Whose side are you on,senator?

223
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,650
<4-99,Foreman>开始是尊重他的意愿,一会入侵伊拉克 一会又撤军回国...
<4-99,Foreman>First respect his wishes,then invade iraq,then get the troops home...

224
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,650
<4-99,Foreman>下定决心
<4-99,Foreman>make up your mind.

225
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,630
<4-100,House>当然有很多有趣的事情要考虑
<4-100,House>Certainly a lot ofinteresting things to consider.

<4-100,House>心电图排除了心脏的可能
<4-100,House>Stress ekg rules outthe heart.

227
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,030
<4-100,House>意味着有东西侵袭了他的肺部
<4-100,House>Which means something'sgotta be attacking his lungs.

228
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,140
<4-100,House>支原体肺炎或链球菌肺炎
<4-100,House>Mycoplasma or strep pneumo.

229
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,400
<4-100,House>问题是 做什么都已经太晚了
<4-100,House>The problem is,it's too lateto do anything about it.

230
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,870
<4-100,House>可以试试左氧氟沙星
<4-100,House>We could try levofloxacin.

231
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,520
<4-101,Cameron>除非说服他值得试一试,否则想新的治疗方案毫无用处
<4-101,Cameron>Coming up with a new treatmentisn't gonna do us any good unless we convince himit's worth trying.

232
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,480
<4-102,House>拜托 他又老 又病 又小个
<4-102,House>Come on,he's old,sick,tiny.

233
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,850
<4-102,House>可以对他为所欲为
<4-102,House>We can do whateverwe want to him.

234
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,910
<4-103,Cameron>发生了什么?
<4-103,Cameron>What happened?

235
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,280
<4-104,Nurse>我不知道
<4-104,Nurse>I don't know.

236
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,930
<4-104,Nurse>他肯定是掉下床了 把鼻套管勒在脖子上
<4-104,Nurse>He must've fallen out of bedand got the nasal cannula wrapped around his necksomehow.

237
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,700
<4-105,Cameron>Ezra 你在做什么?
<4-105,Cameron>Ezra,what are you doing?

<4-106,Powell >太--太过虚弱不能自理屎尿
<4-106,Powell >Too we--too weak to wipemy own ass.

240
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,800
<4-107,House >你为什么要自理屎尿 如果有人看护
<4-107,House >Why would you want to wipe your own ass,when you could havesomeone do it for you?

241
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,280
<4-108,Powell>你在浪费时间
<4-108,Powell>You're wasting your time.

242
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,770
<4-108,Powell>肯定还有其他的病人 你真的可以帮助
<4-108,Powell>There must be other patientsyou could actually help.

243

322
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,100

<5-28,Cameron>很多人录音笔记

<5-29,House>如果认为是这样 就一无所获
<5-29,House>Yes,we could assume that,and we'd have nothing.

325
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,250
<5-29,House>如果把这看作是疾病症状,同时影响了他的肺和脑
<5-29,House>Or we could assume it's a symptom,in which case,whatever's in his lungs is also in his brain.

326
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,130
<5-29,House>除非你查到更有突破性的
<5-29,House>Unless you got somethingmore promising.

<5-32,Powell >但我肯定 你们的检查越来越远离肺了
<5-32,Powell >but I'm pretty sure you'removing farther and farther away from my lungs.

332
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,100
<5-32,Powell >转到其它地方察看
<5-32,Powell >Running out of places to look,aren't you?

<5-33,Cameron>我们不会停止寻找
<5-33,Cameron>Doesn't meanwe're gonna stop looking.

335
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,610
<5-35,Cameron>你希望我们失败?
<5-35,Cameron>You want us to fail?

<5-35,Cameron>No.

337
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,140
<5-36,Powell>但你们会失败
<5-36,Powell>But you will.

338
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,430
<5-37,Wilson>细胞核无异常 不是白血病
<5-37,Wilson>No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia.

339
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,400
<5-37,Wilson>他喝酒?

<5-38,House>Not according to the history.

341
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,900
<5-39,Wilson>要么他喝酒 一个现成好理由,能解释这些非细胞形态
<5-39,Wilson>Which means,yes,he drinks,which gives us a nice,mundane explanationfor the acellularity.

342
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,170
<5-40,House>也许他说的是真话
<5-40,House>Or he's telling the trutH.

343
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,000
<5-40,House>还剩下真菌感染没排除
<5-40,House>Which means fungusis still on the table.

344
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,970
<5-41,Wilson>那你对人性的认识就被摧毁了
<5-41,Wilson>But your entire viewof human nature gets destroyed.

345
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,810
<5-41,Wilson>好坏参半
<5-41,Wilson>Six of one,half a dozenof the other.

<5-44,House>太糟了
<5-44,House>Too bad.

350
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,280
<5-44,House>要是他脑子坏了 就不用听他的了
<5-44,House>If his brain was addled,we wouldn't have to listento anything he says.

<5-45,Wilson>给我10%的KOH
<5-45,Wilson>Hand me the 10% koh.

352
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
<5-46,Cameron>4点了 没查出病因
<5-46,Cameron>It's 4:00,we have nothingto tell him.

353
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,260
<5-47,House>就不用跟他谈了
<5-47,House>Then we have no reasonto talk to him.

354
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,750
<5-47,House>还没有排除真菌
<5-47,House>Still haven't ruled out fungus.

355
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,080
<5-48,Wilson>排除了 没有病菌 没有菌丝
<5-48,Wilson>Yep,we have,no bugs,no hyphae.

356
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,170
<5-49,House>好 下一步

<5-50,Powell>Whole team.

359
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,300
<5-50,Powell>肯定是坏消息
<5-50,Powell>Must be bad news.

360
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,380
<5-51,House>不 骨髓活检显示是多样骨髓瘤
<5-51,House>Nope,bone marrow biopsyrevealed multiple myeloma.

361
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,510
<5-51,House>虽不是好消息 至少有的治
<5-51,House>It's not good news,but there are some treatments.

362
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,450
<5-51,House>得抽点血
<5-51,House>We have to drawsome blood.

363
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,220
<5-52,Powell>我的呼吸呢?
<5-52,Powell>What about my breathing?

364
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,660
<5-53,House>并发的高粘稠度综合症破坏了肺部的血管
<5-53,House>Associated hyperviscositysyndrome gummed up the blood vesselsin your lungs.

365
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,480
<5-54,Powell>Chase医生说我尿钙浓度正常
<5-54,Powell>Dr.Chase said my calciumis normal.

366
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,840
<5-55,House>我们喊他蠢蛋医生
<5-55,House>Mm,we call him dr.Idiot.

367
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,150
<5-56,Powell>尿里也没有单株球蛋白
<5-56,Powell>There's no m proteinin my urine.

368
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,220
<5-57,House>怪异的陈述
<5-57,House>Odd presentation.

369
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,220
<5-58,Powell>更怪的是Cameron医生也不相信
<5-58,Powell>So odd that dr.Camerondoesn't-- doesn't believe it either.

370
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
<5-59,House>再给我12个小时
<5-59,House>Just give me 12 more hours.

371
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,690
<5-60,Powell>我们说好的
<5-60,Powell>We had a deal.

372
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,730
<5-60,Powell>不再做检查了
<5-60,Powell>No more tests.

373
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,530
<5-61,House>很公平
<5-61,House>Fair enough.

374
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,760
<5-61,House>再给我6个小时
<5-61,House>Gimme six more hours.

375
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,180
<5-61,House>没有证据你已病入膏肓
<5-61,House>Listen,there is no evidencethat you are terminal.

376
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,120
<5-62,Powell>你信守诺言么?
<5-62,Powell>You a man of your wordor not?

377
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,950
<5-63,House>不 事实上我并不
<5-63,House>No,as a matter of fact,I'm not.

378
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,250
<5-63,House>好
<5-63,House>Fine.

379
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,350
<5-64,Powell>让我出院
<5-64,Powell>Then discharge me.

380
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,730
<5-64,Powell>我的肺会慢慢充溢液体
<5-64,Powell>My lungs will slowly fillwith fluid.

381
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,420
<5-64,Powell>尽力呼吸 气喘不已
<5-64,Powell>I'll gasp to catchevery breath.

382
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,070
<5-64,Powell>却不能够
<5-64,Powell>But never can.

383
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,090
<4-115,Cameron >每次呼吸都困难重重
<4-115,Cameron >Every breath will be petrifying.

384
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,010
<4-116,House>漫长且饱受折磨
<4-116,House>It'll be slow,painful,torturous.

385
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,270
<4-116,House>你真想看我这么死
<4-116,House>You're really gonna let medie like that?

386
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,450
<6-1,Foreman>你去哪里?
<6-1,Foreman>Where you going?

387
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,830
<6-2,House >不去哪儿!
<6-2,House >Nowhere!

388
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,590
<7-1,House>能走的都出去
<7-1,House>Everybody who can walkshould get outta here.

389
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
<7-2,Cameron>你不能这么做
<7-2,Cameron>You can't do that.

390
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,560
<7-2,Cameron>不能做什么?
<7-2,Cameron>Can't do what?

391
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,430
<7-3,House>给一个疼痛中的病人施处方止疼剂
<7-3,House>Administera prescription painkiller to a patientwho's in pain?

392
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,000
<7-3,House>去 得保证有人在楼下餐厅看见你们
<7-3,House>Go,make suresomebody sees you downstairs in the cafeteria.

393
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,880
<7-4,Foreman>不能让你这么做
<7-4,Foreman>I can't let you do this.

394
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,190
<7-5,Ezra>我要么痛死 要么直接死
<7-5,Ezra>Either I die in pain,or I just die.

395
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,290
<7-5,Ezra>这是争论焦点
<7-5,Ezra>That's what the argumentis here.

396
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,810
<7-6,Foreman>不 关系到你是自然死亡 还是被谋杀
<7-6,Foreman>No,it's about whether you die,or we murder you.

397
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,350
<7-7,House>这里会发生的 只是有人被打上一针吗啡
<7-7,House>What's gonna happen hereis that someone's getting a buttload of morphine.

398
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,550
<7-7,House>我不能确保是谁被打针
<7-7,House>I'm not sure exactly whoat this point.

399
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,640
<7-8,Cameron>我不想参与
<7-8,Cameron>I can't be a partof this.

400
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,750
<7-9,Ezra>谢谢
<7-9,Ezra>Thank you.

401
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,290
<7-9,Ezra>我总是好奇 另一端是怎样
<7-9,Ezra>I always wondered exactly what was on the other side.

402
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,060
<7-10,House>什么也没有
<7-10,House>Nothing.

403
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,540
<7-11,Chase>你在干什么?
<7-11,Chase>What are you doing?

404
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,130
<7-12,House>做喉镜
<7-12,House>Getting a laryngoscope.

405
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,400
<7-12,House>别傻站着 帮忙
<7-12,House>Don't just stand there,help.

406
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,510
<7-13,Chase>- 但你告诉他 - 是
<7-13,Chase>But you told him-- yeah.

407
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,560
<7-13,Chase>我称其为谎言
<7-13,Chase>It was somethingI like to call a lie.

408
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,980
<7-14,House>很糟 但比谋杀要好得多
<7-14,House>Bad,I know,but it'sway further down the list than murder.

409
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,140
<7-14,House>无意识 再不反抗
<7-14,House>Unconscious,no more whining.

410
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,910
<7-14,House>继续作检查
<7-14,House>Keep testing him.

411
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
<7-14,House>去拿个呼吸机
<7-14,House>Go get a ventilatoR.

412
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,050
<8-10,Cameron>我不能整夜这样
<8-10,Cameron>I can't do this all night.

413
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,780
<8-1,Cameron>明智的人会同意
<8-1,Cameron>we can legally assume that he'd consent to whatever a reasonable person would consent to.

414
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,800
<8-1,Cameron>有理智的人都会反对被置于昏迷,仅仅满足你的好奇心
<8-1,Cameron>And a reasonable personwould obviously consent to being put in a comaagainst their will just to satisfyyour curiosity.

415
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,880
<8-2,House>我要杀他 你气疯
<8-2,House>I try to kill him,you're mad.

416
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,490
<8-2,House>我不杀他 你又气疯
<8-2,House>I don't kill him,you're mad.

417
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,860
<8-3,Cameron>他要的是尊严
<8-3,Cameron>All he wantedwas some dignity.

418
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,320
<8-4,House>你没看到他么?
<8-4,House>Were you in that roomwith him?

419
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,740
<8-4,House>难道他被自己的积液窒息时,还能衣冠楚楚
<8-4,House>Was he wearing a tux while hewas choking on his own plasma?

420
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,790
<8-4,House>继续检查
<8-4,House>Keep doing the tests.

421
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,830
<8-4,House>抓紧时间 别出错
<8-4,House>Take your time,do it right.

422
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,620
<8-4,House>去
<8-4,House>Go.

423
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,370
<8-4,House>开工
<8-4,House>Get to work.

424
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,430
<8-4,House>等等!
<8-4,House>Wait!

425
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,950
<8-4,House>Cameron 你做他头部核磁成像时,切口为什么这么低
<8-4,House>Cameron,why'd you do these cutsso far down on this mri of his head?

426
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,600
<8-5,Cameron>我想看到他的脑干和颈椎,保证他的膈肌没有瘫痪
<8-5,Cameron>I wanted to get his brain stemand his c-spine,make sure his diaphragmwasn't paralyzed.

427
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,580
<8-6,House>你还拍到了他的肺
<8-6,House>You also caught the topof his lungs.

428
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,860
<8-6,House>有疤痕
<8-6,House>There's scarring.

429
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,450
<8-6,House>你知道无法以眼杀人么?
<8-6,House>You do know that you can'treally pierce me with your stares?

430
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,820
<8-7,Chase>肺部疤痕 加上不健康的骨髓,指向自身免疫性病
<8-7,Chase>Lung scarring,along with the bad bone marrow,points to an autoimmune disease.

431
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,190
<8-7,Chase>可能是肺纤维化
<8-7,Chase>Could be pulmonary fibrosis.

432
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,140
<8-8,Foreman>或是狼疮
<8-8,Foreman>Or lupus.

433
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,180
<8-9,House>我们治好他后 他可以自杀
<8-9,House>He can kill himselfafter we get him better.

434
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,100
<8-9,House>注射静脉免疫球蛋白 再做个直肠镜
<8-9,House>Start him on an ivigfor the lupus,and get a colonoscopy.

435
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,540
<8-9,House>狼疮可能藏在那里
<8-9,House>Lupus could be hiding there.

436
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,240
<8-10,Cameron>我不能这么做
<8-10,Cameron>I can't do this.

437
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,360
<8-11,House>戏剧女王
<8-11,House>Drama queen.

438
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,400
<9-1,Foreman>降结肠无异常
<9-1,Foreman>Descending colon's clean.

439
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,300
<9-2,Chase>移到乙状结肠
<9-2,Chase>moving into the sigmoid.

440
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,580
<9-3,Foreman>还需要帮手
<9-3,Foreman>Sure could usea little more help around here.

441
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,340
<9-4,Chase>她依照信仰行事
<9-4,Chase>She's doingwhat she believes in.

442
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,140
<9-5,Foreman>如果她有原则的话 应该阻止我们
<9-5,Foreman>Yeah,if she was actingon principle,she'd be in here tryingto stop us.

443
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,680
<9-5,Foreman>她只是逃离了原则 逃避直面时的不安
<9-5,Foreman>All she's doing is running awayfrom the principle so she won't have to feeluncomfortable facing it.

444
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,990
<9-6,Chase>你要是有原则 在认为House想杀他时,就该报警
<9-6,Chase>And if you were actingon principle,you would've called the copswhen you thought house was killing the guy.

445
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,790
<9-7,Foreman>你最好快点
<9-7,Foreman>You better hurry up.

446
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,050
<9-7,Foreman>为什么?
<9-7,Foreman>Why?

447
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,220
<10-1,Foreman>我想她不会犹疑该怎么向Cuddy报告
<10-1,Foreman>I don't think she's gonnahave a problem deciding whatto tell cuddy.

448
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,150
<10-1,Foreman>氧饱和度89 还在降
<10-1,Foreman>O2 sats 89 and dropping.

449
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,710
<10-1,Foreman>我以为你在妊娠的前三个月,每星期只增重一磅
<10-1,Foreman>I thought you were only supposedto put on a pound a week during your last trimester.

450
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,280
<11-1,House>我没有怀孕
<11-1,House>I'm not pregnant.

451
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,310
<11-2,Cuddy>我听说了你对Powell医生耍的花招
<11-2,Cuddy>I heard about your little stuntwith dr.Powell.

452
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,480
<11-2,Cuddy>不算花招
<11-2,Cuddy>Mmm,not reallya stunt.

453
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,470
<11-3,House>只是个把戏 诡计 障眼法
<11-3,House>More of a trick,a ruse,a hoodwink.

454
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,370
<11-4,Cuddy>谎言
<11-4,Cuddy>A lie.

455
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,470
<11-4,Cuddy>好吧
<11-4,Cuddy>Okay.

456
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,570
<11-5,House>说话也有好的
<11-5,House>Lying is sometimes good,right?

457
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,180
<11-5,House>比如 你想教人幽默
<11-5,House>Like when you're tryingto teach someone a lesson about humility or something.

458
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,920
<11-5,House>或是像我 救人一命
<11-5,House>All I'm trying to dois save his life.

459
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
<11-5,House>他可学不到什么
<11-5,House>He's not gonnalearn anything.

460
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,620
<11-5,House>我想原理是适用的
<11-5,House>I just thought the sameprinciple might apply.

461
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,860
<11-6,Cuddy>是
<11-6,Cuddy>It does.

462
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,170
<11-7,House>我本可以让他死去
<11-7,House>I could've justlet him die.

463
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,690
<11-8,Cuddy>让他活着可不会被起诉
<11-8,Cuddy>Not gonna get suedfor keeping him alive.

464
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,580
<11-9,House>也有可能
<11-9,House>Well,we could.

465
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,380
<11-9,House>我们完全违反了他的意志
<11-9,House>We completely disregardedhis wishes.

466
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,820
<11-10,Cuddy>你要我反对你?
<11-10,Cuddy>Do you want meto disagree with you?

467
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,800
<11-10,Cuddy>对你嚷嚷?
<11-10,Cuddy>Want me to yell at you?

468
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,850
<11-11,House>那样或许舒服点
<11-11,House>It is comforting.

469
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,680
<11-12,Cuddy>我们是医生
<11-12,Cuddy>We're doctors.

470
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,700
<11-12,Cuddy>治疗患者 不杀他们
<11-12,Cuddy>We treat patients,we don't kill them.

471
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,780
<11-13,House>你说的真对 Cuddy医生!
<11-13,House>How right you are,dr.Cuddy!

472
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,260
<11-13,House>我们也不给自己开处方,不从配药处偷样品
<11-13,House>We also don't pad our bills,swipe samples from the pharmacy,

473
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,050
<11-13,House>也不对病人的女儿浮想联翩
<11-13,House>or fantasizeabout the teenage daughters of our patients either.

474
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,960
<11-14,Cuddy>没错 最好是这样 你这头猪
<11-14,Cuddy>True,better be true,and you're a pig.

475
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,740
<12-2,Wilson>你腿这样 我很难过
<12-2,Wilson>I'm sorryabout your leg.

476
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,990
<11-16,House>我们确实该花点时间谈谈这个
<11-16,House>Yeah,we really should spendsome time talking about that.

477
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,290
<11-17,Foreman>静脉免疫球蛋白让他情况更糟
<11-17,Foreman>The ivig made him worse.

478
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,600
<11-17,Foreman>氧饱和度直降
<11-17,Foreman>O2 sats plummeted.

479
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,050
<11-18,House>可以肯定不是狼疮
<11-18,House>So we knowit's not lupus.

480
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,180
<11-18,House>还会是什么?
<11-18,House>What else could it be?

481
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,600
<11-19,Chase>先天性肺纤维化
<11-19,Chase>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

482
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,000
<11-20,House>得做个开胸肺活检来确定
<11-20,House>Gonna need an open lungbiopsy to confirm.

483
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,780
<11-21,Foreman>要对他动手术?
<11-21,Foreman>So now we're gonnaoperate on the guy?

484
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,740
<11-22,House>除非你发明了做开胸肺活检的新方法
<11-22,House>Unless you've inventeda new way of doing an open lung biopsy.

485
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:50,400
<11-23,House>搜查Powell医生的办公室时,有没有发现1967年1月马萨诸塞州医刊
<11-23,House>When you searcheddr.Powell's office,did you find a copyof the january 1967 massachusetts medical journal?

486
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,140
<11-24,Cameron>什么?
<11-24,Cameron>Why?

487
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,910
<11-25,House>我想 你不工作的话 也得打发时间
<11-25,House>I just figured,if you'renot doing any work,you might like something to pass the time.

488
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,260
<11-25,House>杂志插画能消磨时间
<11-25,House>Centerfold's a killer.

489
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,540
<12-2,Wilson>你腿怎么样了?
<12-2,Wilson>How's your leg?

490
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,760
<12-3,House>疼
<12-3,House>It hurts.

491
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,040
<12-3,House>会继续疼
<12-3,House>It's gonna keep on hurting.

492
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,170
<12-3,House>你会一直问?
<12-3,House>You're gonna keep on asking?

493
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,890
<12-4,Wilson>Ezra Powell怎么样了?
<12-4,Wilson>How's ezra powell?

494
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,060
<12-5,House>安稳地休息
<12-5,House>Resting comfortably.

495
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,220
<12-6,Wilson>Cameron可不是这么说的
<12-6,Wilson>Hmm,that'snot what cameron says.

496
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,330
<12-7,House>我讨厌在高中行医
<12-7,House>I hate practicing medicinein high school.

497
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,430
<12-8,Wilson>他不是求你帮忙杀了他
<12-8,Wilson>He's not asking youto help him kill himself.

498
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,060
<12-8,Wilson>他只是求助
<12-8,Wilson>He's just asking for help.

499
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,570
<12-8,Wilson>疾病会杀死了他
<12-8,Wilson>The disease will kill him.

500
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,150
<12-9,House>我明白他要什么
<12-9,House>I know whathe was asking for.

501
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,070
<12-9,House>我说了不
<12-9,House>I just said no.

502
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,370
<12-10,Wilson>你以前做过
<12-10,Wilson>You've done it before.

503
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,400
<12-10,Wilson>很多次
<12-10,Wilson>Plenty of times.

504
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,140
<12-11,House>只对没得救的病人
<12-11,House>To patients that I knewwere terminal.

505
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,490
<12-12,Wilson>算了吧你
<12-12,Wilson>Oh,give me a break.

506
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,780
<12-12,Wilson>这和拯救生命一点也不搭界
<12-12,Wilson>This has nothing to dowith saving a life.

507
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,380
<12-12,Wilson>你只是不能接受在病人死前,没弄明白病因
<12-12,Wilson>You just can't bear the thoughtof a patient dying before you've been ableto figure out why.

508
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,760
<12-13,House>如果为了浇灭我的自负,就一直拒绝治疗病人
<12-13,House>If we're gonna keep refusingto cure patients just to rein in my ego,

509
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,290
<12-13,House>那想吸收新病人 就有点困难了
<12-13,House>then we might start to have a little problemwith patient recruitment.

510
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,650
<12-14,Wilson>担心你一周一个门诊病人的限额?
<12-14,Wilson>Worried about meetingyour one patient a week quota?

511
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,990
<12-15,House>我是个跛子 你没忘吧?
<12-15,House>I'm a cripple,remember?

512
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,390
<12-15,House>总得给我行些方便
<12-15,House>Accommodations must be made.

513
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,340
<12-15,House>左肺叶锲状部被分离切除
<12-15,House>Wedge of left lobe isolatedand removed.

514
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,920
<12-15,House>夹紧
<12-15,House>Clamp.

515
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,500
<13-1,Cameron>你为什么让我去查那篇文章?
<13-1,Cameron>Why'd you have melook up that article?

516
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,830
<13-2,House>你没发现它很有意思吗?
<13-2,House>Didn't you find itinteresting?

517
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,070
<13-3,Cameron>他给新生婴儿注射放射性制剂,只为看是否有尿道逆流
<13-3,Cameron>He injected newborn babieswith radioactive agents just to see if they hadurethral reflux.

518
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,180
<13-4,House>他求知欲很强
<13-4,House>He was curious.

519
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,770
<13-5,Cameron>他甚至没有告诉孩子的父母,他正在做的试验
<13-5,Cameron>He didn't eventell their parents he was doing an experiment.

520
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,730
<13-6,House>他的同辈也是这么干的
<13-6,House>He wasn't doing anythinghis peers weren't doing.

521
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,040
<13-7,Cameron>塔斯基大学梅毒实验,和威路布鲁克肺炎菌实验中的同辈?
<13-7,Cameron>His peersat tuskegee and willowbrook?

522
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,910
<13-8,House>他无视了少数人的权利来拯救更多人
<13-8,House>He ignored the rightsof a few to save many.

523
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,620
<13-9,Cameron>你不反对他所做的?
<13-9,Cameron>Soou're okaywith what he did.

524
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,620
<13-10,House>我怎么想没用
<13-10,House>Doesn't matterwhat I think.

525
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,260
<13-10,House>你怎么想才重要
<13-10,House>It's what you thinkthat's relevant.

526
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:48,050
<13-11,Cameron>你以为我看低他 就会帮你是不是?
<13-11,Cameron>Because if I think less of him,I'll help you more?

527
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,320
<13-11,Cameron>你错了
<13-11,Cameron>You're wrong.

528
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,550
<13-11,Cameron>即使一个病人在外面做了坏事
<13-11,Cameron>The fact that a patientdid bad things doesn't change anything.

529
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,370
<13-11,Cameron>对自己的身体仍然有支配的权利
<13-11,Cameron>He still deserves to havesome control over his own body.

530
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,990
<13-12,House>如果由他支配自己的身体 他就会死
<13-12,House>If he had controlof his own body,he'd be dead.

531
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,540
<13-13,Cameron>我说的是某种程度的支配
<13-13,Cameron>Some control.

532
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,380
<13-13,Cameron>可以保守治疗 不害死他
<13-13,Cameron>We can withhold treatmentwithout killing him.

533
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,540
<13-14,House>不 不行!
<13-14,House>No,you can't!

534
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,650
<13-14,House>要么帮他生 要么帮他死
<13-14,House>You either help him live,or you help him die.

535
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,990
<13-14,House>难以两全
<13-14,House>You can't ha it both ways.

536
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,110
<13-15,House>我猜不是特发性肺纤维化
<13-15,House>I guess it's not ipf.

537
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,010
<13-16,House>也许他马上死掉 会让大家轻松点
<13-16,House>Or maybe he'll die right now,and make everything easyfor all of us.

538
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,930
<14-1,Foreman>心率过快
<14-1,Foreman>Heart rate's fast.

539
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,430
<14-2,Chase>血压过低
<14-2,Chase>bp's low.

540
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,990
<14-3,House>右边听不到呼吸声
<14-3,House>No breath soundson the right side.

541
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,600
<14-3,House>他右肺失去功能了
<14-3,House>He's dropped his right lung.

542
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,700
<14-3,House>空气堵塞胸腔 挤压心脏
<14-3,House>Air's building up in his chest,and pressing his heart.

543
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,480
<14-4,Chase>心率正在下降
<14-4,Chase>Heart rate's decreasing.

544
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,470
<14-5,Foreman>血压稳定
<14-5,Foreman>Bp's stabilizing.

545
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,370
<14-6,Chase>你在干什么?
<14-6,Chase>What are you doing?

546
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,920
<14-7,House>左半边对疼痛刺激有退缩反应,但右半边没有
<14-7,House>Withdraws from pain stimulion the left side,but not the right.

547
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,590
<14-7,House>那些只是由反射弧起作用
<14-7,House>Those are just reflex arcs.

548
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,810
<14-8,Foreman>他现在在麻醉状态下
<14-8,Foreman>He's under anesthesia.

549
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,420
<14-9,House>可能他某处失去知觉了
<14-9,House>Or he's lost sensationin some places.

550
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,360
<14-10,Chase>或者是缺氧导致他中枢神经麻痹
<14-10,Chase>Or the hypoxia from the arreststunned his cns.

551
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,320
<14-11,House>只有一种可能
<14-11,House>Only one way to tell.

552
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,090
<14-11,House>做体感诱发电位
<14-11,House>Do somatosensory evokedpotentials.

553
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,830
<14-12,Foreman>他在昏迷中 不能做那个
<14-12,Foreman>We can't do thatwhile he's in a coma.

554
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,950
<14-13,House>只有两个办法
<14-13,House>Only two ways to tell.

555
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,290
<14-13,House>找把锤子来测试他的深层肌腱反射
<14-13,House>Get a hammer and checkhis deep tendon reflexes.

556
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,930
<14-13,House>不会有用
<14-13,House>Won't work.

557
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,660
<14-14,Chase>他需要肌肉松弛剂 才可以使用呼吸机
<14-14,Chase>He needs muscle relaxantsto be on the ventilator.

558
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,270
<14-15,House>那么只有一条办法了
<14-15,House>Only one more wayto tell.

559
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,350
<14-15,House>瞳孔反射
<14-15,House>Pupillary reflexes.

560
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,810
<14-16,Foreman>那些测试都是由脑干决定的
<14-16,Foreman>All that testsis the brainstem.

561
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,840
<14-16,Foreman>瞧 还是我对的
<14-16,Foreman>See,I was right.

562
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,690
<14-17,House>只有一个办法
<14-17,House>Only one way to tell.

563
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,530
<14-18,Foreman>做体感诱发电位
<14-18,Foreman>Do somatosensory evokedpotentials.

564
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,800
<14-18,Foreman>当他处在昏迷中 做不了
<14-18,Foreman>I just said we can't do thatwhile he's in a coma.

565
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,670
<14-19,House>那么把他叫醒
<14-19,House>So wake him up.

566
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,900
<14-20,House>不要朝有光的地方走
<14-20,House>Don't go towards the light.

567
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,530
<14-20,House>否则会摔断你的髋骨
<14-20,House>U'll fall and breakyour hip.

568
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,300
<14-21,Ezra>发生什么了?
<14-21,Ezra>What's happening?

569
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,240
<14-22,House>你打了个盹
<14-22,House>You took a little nap.

570
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,120
<14-23,Ezra>我告诉过我不想--
<14-23,Ezra>I know I told youI didn't want--

571
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,490
<14-24,House>对不起 我有只耳朵有点聋
<14-24,House>sorry,a little deafin one ear.

572
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,780
<14-24,House>你的骨髓细胞减少
<14-24,House>Your bone marrowwas hypocellular.

573
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,060
<14-24,House>排除了狼疮和肺部纤维化的可能性
<14-24,House>Ruled out lupusand pulmonary fibrosis.

574
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,190
<14-24,House>但是可能攻击到你的神经
<14-24,House>But it looks like it could beattacking your nerves.

575
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,530
<14-25,Ezra>这么看来全白干了
<14-25,Ezra>So this is all a waste.

576
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,040
<14-25,Ezra>巨大的失败
<14-25,Ezra>Huge failure.

577
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,630
<14-25,Ezra>怎么可能
<14-25,Ezra>Impossible.

578
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,700
<14-25,Ezra>你是Gregory House
<14-25,Ezra>You're gregory house.

579
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,050
<14-26,House>得在你皮肤上帖些传感器
<14-26,House>We need to attach some sensorsto your skin.

580
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,060
<14-27,Ezra>不
<14-27,Ezra>No.

581
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,890
<14-28,House>听着 我们不能按你想的去做
<14-28,House>Look,we can't dowhat you want.

582
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,840
<14-28,House>安排了一名护士盯着你,所以你自己也不行
<14-28,House>We've assigned a nurse to watch you so you can't do iteither.

583
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,560
<14-28,House>所以你最好老老实实做检测
<14-28,House>So you might as welljust let us do the test.

584
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,500
<14-28,House>不 我要出院
<14-28,House>No,I want to bedischarged.

<14-29,Ezra>you can't be discharged.

586

<14-30,Chase>你胸腔里还插了两根管子
<14-30,Chase>You've gottwo chest tubes in.

587
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,640
<14-31,Ezra>那就把它们拿出来

<15-5,Foreman>That means the clean mriof his brain means it's just affectingthe peripheral nerves.

610
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,830
<15-6,House>还有骨髓
