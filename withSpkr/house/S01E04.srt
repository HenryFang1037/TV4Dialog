57
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,900
<3-12,Lim>孩子在发烧

<3-14,Lim>The parents, of course, start freaking

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,710
<3-14,Lim>我不得不花了一个小时对付他们
<3-14,Lim>and I have to deal with that for an hour.

62
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,080
<3-15,Kubisak>好像是你的错似的
<3-15,Kubisak>Like it was your fault.

63

<3-16,Lim>我接生的时候  她可是完好无损的
<3-16,Lim>She was perfect when I delivered her.

64
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,800
<3-16,Lim>要说责任的话  应该找儿科医生
<3-16,Lim>If you want to blame someone,blame the pediatrician.

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,610
<3-17,Kubisak>那么  小孩现在怎样了
<3-17,Kubisak>So, how's the kid now?

67
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,480
<3-19,Kubisak>这就成了儿科医生的功劳了
<3-19,Kubisak>Pediatrician'll take all the credit.

<4-2,Wilson>我仍不敢想象你和病人待在同一个房间
<4-2,Wilson>I'm still amazed you're in the same room with a patient.

<4-4,Wilson>太令人惊异了
<4-4,Wilson>Wow, that is amazing.

80
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,510
<4-4,Wilson>你整上午在妇产科休息室闲晃
<4-4,Wilson>You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge all morning

81
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,040
<4-4,Wilson>听到两个小孩生病了

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,990
<4-4,Wilson>真可怕
<4-4,Wilson>It's eerie.

83

<4-5,House>别碰
<4-5,House>Don't touch that.

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,220
<4-6,Wilson>好吧
<4-6,Wilson>All right...

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,520
<4-7,House>医院里有传染病传播
<4-7,House>We have an infection spreading in the hospital.

86
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,450
<4-8,Wilson>这两个小孩的病完全没有关系
<4-8,Wilson>These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.

87
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,190
<4-9,House>他们4小时内相继发病
<4-9,House>They fell sick within four hours of each other.

88
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,660
<4-9,House>同一产房
<4-9,House>They had the same delivery rooms

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,410
<4-9,House>产后病房相邻  传播完全可能
<4-9,House>maternity rooms are neighboring,so transmission's possible.

90
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,840
<4-9,House>他们有同样的症状
<4-9,House>They have the same symptoms.

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,320
<4-10,Wilson>哈蒂格女婴是肠梗阻
<4-10,Wilson>The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.

92
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,610
<4-10,Wilson>无论他们的病床有多近
<4-10,Wilson>No matter how close their beds are,

93
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,230
<4-10,Wilson>我肯定  他们不会共享同样的梗阻物
<4-10,Wilson>I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.

94
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,730
<4-11,House>肠梗阻在病历上是什么意思
<4-11,House>What does bowel obstruction on a chart indicate?

95
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,070
<4-12,Wilson>一般来说  我会说是
<4-12,Wilson>Well, normally, I'd say

96
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,680
<4-12,Wilson>表示病人的肠子有梗阻
<4-12,Wilson>it indicates a patient's bowel is obstructed,

97
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
<4-12,Wilson>不过我很肯定你有更高深的见解...
<4-12,Wilson>but I'm pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart...

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,690
<4-13,House>这表示  某某些无技术无责任心的医生
<4-13,House>It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks

99
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,530
<4-13,House>认为病人肠部有梗阻
<4-13,House>that the patient's bowel is obstructed.

100
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,350
<4-14,Wilson>好吧  你不爽
<4-14,Wilson>Okay, you're upset

101
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,800
<4-14,Wilson>因为他们把你从休息室赶出来了
<4-14,Wilson>because they threw you out of their lounge.

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,660
<4-15,House>看看X光片
<4-15,House>Look at the x-ray.

103
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
<4-15,House>是普通胀气
<4-15,House>It's a normal gas pattern.

104
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,920
<4-16,Wilson>你要的话  我可以搞把肿瘤科休息室的钥匙给你
<4-16,Wilson>You want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,740
<4-17,House>是空气  直肠里有空气
<4-17,House>Air. Air in the column.

106
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,350
<4-18,Wilson>我们休息室有录像机
<4-18,Wilson>We're getting TiVo.

107
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,450
<4-19,House>如果是空气  就不是肠梗阻
<4-19,House>If it's air, no bowel obstruction.

108
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,690
<4-20,Wilson>即便是空气
<4-20,Wilson>Even if it is air,

109
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,400
<4-20,Wilson>也可能是在肠梗阻前就有的
<4-20,Wilson>it could have been there before the obstruction.

110
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,110
<4-20,Wilson>不
<4-20,Wilson>No.

111
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,940
<4-21,House>两个婴儿同时被感染了
<4-21,House>Something's infected both these infants.

112
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,630
<5-1,Cuddy>你是唯一一个把这两桩事联系起来的  因为...
<5-1,Cuddy>And you're the only one who put this together because...?

113
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,080
<5-2,House>因为我是唯一一个同时关注两个婴儿的
<5-2,House>Because I'm the only one who looked at both kids.

114
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,990
<5-2,House>我要求把他们隔离  并关闭产科病房
<5-2,House>I want them isolated; I want the maternity ward shut down.

115
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,610
<5-3,Cuddy>因为你比放射科医生更懂怎么看X光片
<5-3,Cuddy>Because you're better at reading an x-ray than a radiologist.

116
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,980
<5-4,House>放射科医生总是对婴儿的片子小题大作
<5-4,House>Radiologists always over-read babies' x-rays,

117
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,970
<5-4,House>特别是被要求排除病因的时候
<5-4,House>especially if they're asked to rule out a pathology.

118
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,210
<5-4,House>他们只看他们想看到的
<5-4,House>He read into it what he wanted.

119
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,920
<5-5,Cuddy>可你现在就是这样
<5-5,Cuddy>Which is exactly what you're doing.

120
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,470
<5-5,Cuddy>你在找他们的交集
<5-5,Cuddy>You're finding a cluster

121
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,650
<5-5,Cuddy>因为你觉得这很有意思
<5-5,Cuddy>because you think it's interesting to find a cluster.

122
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,980
<5-5,Cuddy>两个病因寻常的小孩会让你无聊的
<5-5,Cuddy>Two... plain old sick babies would bore you.

123
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,280
<5-6,House>看  这就是我不用花钱看心理医生的缘故
<5-6,House>See, this is why I don't waste money on shrinks,

124
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,710
<5-6,House>因为你就能免费提供全部深刻见解
<5-6,House>'cause you give me all these really great insights for free.

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,440
<5-7,Cuddy>心理医生
<5-7,Cuddy>Shrink.

126
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,760
<5-7,Cuddy>如果你打算看心理医生
<5-7,Cuddy>If you would consider going to a shrink,

127
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,270
<5-7,Cuddy>我会自掏腰包
<5-7,Cuddy>I would pay for it myself.

128
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,460
<5-7,Cuddy>看在上帝的份上  医院会举个行糕点义卖
<5-7,Cuddy>The hospital would hold a bake sale, for God's sake.

129
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,070
<5-8,House>医院有传染病蔓延
<5-8,House>We have an epidemic!

130
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,680
<5-9,Cuddy>两个生病的婴儿很不幸
<5-9,Cuddy>Two sick babies is very sad,

131
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,410
<5-9,Cuddy>但不能证明是传染病
<5-9,Cuddy>but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

132
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,830
<5-10,House>几个才够
<5-10,House>How many do?

133
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,770
<6-1,House>起来
<6-1,House>Get up!

134
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,530
<6-1,House>我们去打猎
<6-1,House>We're going hunting.

135
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,130
<6-2,Foreman>猎什么
<6-2,Foreman>For what?

136
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,060
<6-3,House>病毒
<6-3,House>Wabbits.

137
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,040
<6-3,House>你好
<6-3,House>Hi.

138
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,070
<6-3,House>再见
<6-3,House>Bye.

139
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,550
<7-1,House>他哭了  没事的
<7-1,House>He's screaming, he's fine.

140
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,590
<7-2,Foreman>多漂亮的宝贝儿
<7-2,Foreman>Good looking baby.

141
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,700
<8-1,Cameron>对不起  走错房间了
<8-1,Cameron>Oh, sorry, wrong room.

142
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,500
<8-2,Chase>回头见
<8-2,Chase>We'll see you later.

143
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,950
<8-3,Cameron>12个病房  是吗
<8-3,Cameron>12 rooms, that's it?

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,050
<8-3,Cameron>没错儿
<8-3,Cameron>Yep.

145
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,740
<8-4,Chase>我们检查了整层
<8-4,Chase>We've definitely checked the whole floor.

146
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,090
<8-4,Chase>好消息  没有传染病
<8-4,Chase>Good news, no epidemic.

147
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,280
<8-5,Foreman>杯具啊  不是吗
<8-5,Foreman>Tragic, huh?

148
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,650
<8-6,House>查查其他楼层的病房  3层
<8-6,House>Overflow rooms, third floor.

149
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,150
<8-7,Foreman>这个想象中的传染病蔓延到下一层了吗
<8-7,Foreman>This imaginary infection has spread to the next floor?

150
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,820
<9-1,Judy>我们正打算打电话
<9-1,Judy>We were just going to call.

151
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,010
<9-2,House>他是突然发烧的吗
<9-2,House>Did he get hot all of a sudden?

152
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,400
<9-2,House>是的
<9-2,House>Yeah.

153
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,510
<9-2,House>快到了
<9-2,House>Almost there.

154
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,400
<9-2,House>别担心  快到了
<9-2,House>Don't worry, we're almost there.

155
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,050
<10-1,Cuddy>打扰了
<10-1,Cuddy>Excuse me!

156
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,790
<10-1,Cuddy>-你好 -你好
<10-1,Cuddy>- Hi. - Hi.

157
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,330
<10-1,Cuddy>接待处让你们上来的吗
<10-1,Cuddy>Intake sent you up here?

158
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,870
<10-2,Man>是的  我太太的宫缩少于...
<10-2,Man>Yeah, my wife's contractions are less than...

159
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,690
<10-3,Cuddy>接待处搞错了
<10-3,Cuddy>Yeah, Intake messed up.

160
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,200
<10-3,Cuddy>我很抱歉  非常对不起
<10-3,Cuddy>I'm very, very sorry.

161
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,910
<10-3,Cuddy>阿尔普莱特护士会安排救护车
<10-3,Cuddy>Nurse Alpret will arrange for an ambulance

162
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,980
<10-3,Cuddy>送你们去普林斯顿总院
<10-3,Cuddy>to take you to Princeton General.

163
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,570
<10-5,Cuddy>妇产科临时关闭
<10-5,Cuddy>The maternity ward is temporarily closed.

164
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,810
<10-6,Woman>我们非走不可吗
<10-6,Woman>We have to leave?!

165
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,490
<10-7,Cuddy>是的  我很抱歉
<10-7,Cuddy>Yes, I am very sorry.

166
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,590
<10-8,Man>为什么这么做
<10-8,Man>Why are you doing this?

167
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,740
<10-9,Cuddy>你们很快就能到那里
<10-9,Cuddy>You'll be there very, very soon.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,030
<10-9,Cuddy>现在满意了
<10-9,Cuddy>Happy now?

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,520
<10-10,House>不  不过我感兴趣了
<10-10,House>No. But I am interested.

170
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,900
<11-1,House>三个发病婴儿  第四个出现早期症状
<11-1,House>Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms.

171
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,710
<11-2,Cuddy>有多糟糕
<11-2,Cuddy>How bad?

172
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,830
<11-3,Chase>高烧
<11-3,Chase>Spiking fevers.

173
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,740
<11-4,Foreman>血压下降
<11-4,Foreman>BP's plummeting.

174
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,400
<11-4,Foreman>几乎无法维持心脏收缩
<11-4,Foreman>They're barely able to keep systolic up;

175
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,060
<11-4,Foreman>照这个速度  一天之内就会死亡
<11-4,Foreman>at this rate, they'll be dead in a day.

176
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,950
<11-5,Cuddy>婴儿来自哪里
<11-5,Cuddy>Where did this come from?

177
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,160
<11-6,Cameron>2个产房  4个产后病房
<11-6,Cameron>Two delivery rooms, four different maternity rooms,

178
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,070
<11-6,Cameron>没有公共人员  没有共用仪器
<11-6,Cameron>no common personnel and no common equipment.

179
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,540
<11-7,Cuddy>好吧  肯定有什么是共同的
<11-7,Cuddy>Well, there's gotta be something in common.

180
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,610
<11-8,House>没错  这就是传染病和巧合的区别
<11-8,House>Yeah. That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.

181
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,150
<11-9,Cuddy>我组织一队人  开始消毒
<11-9,Cuddy>I'm putting a team together.We're going to start swabbing.

182
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,070
<11-10,Foreman>消毒什么
<11-10,Foreman>What's she gonna swab?

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,370
<11-10,Foreman>医院的每个呼吸器
<11-10,Foreman>Every respirator,

184
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,050
<11-10,Foreman>水槽  通风口  下水道吗
<11-10,Foreman>sink, vent, drain in the entire hospital?

185
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,740
<11-10,Foreman>要干上几个月呢
<11-10,Foreman>That'll take months.

186
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,800
<11-11,Cameron>大海捞针啊
<11-11,Cameron>A needle in a haystack.

187
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,570
<11-12,House>比这还糟
<11-12,House>It's worse than that.

188
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,710
<11-12,House>我们都不知道要找的是不是针
<11-12,House>We don't even know what's the needle we're looking for.

189
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,880
<11-13,Cameron>那你为什么还让她去做
<11-13,Cameron>Then why'd you let her go do it?

190
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,950
<11-14,House>因为医院是她的孩子
<11-14,House>Because the hospital's her baby,

191
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,520
<11-14,House>孩子病了
<11-14,House>and her baby's sick.

192
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,780
<11-14,House>要是不马上解决  她会发火的
<11-14,House>If she doesn't solve this soon, her head's going to explode,

193
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,140
<11-14,House>我可不想被连累到
<11-14,House>and I don't want to get any on me.

194
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
<11-14,House>所以  让我们看看到底是什么
<11-14,House>So let's figure out what's in the haystack.

195
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,560
<11-14,House>鉴别诊断
<11-14,House>Differential diagnosis, people.

196
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,320
<11-15,Foreman>寄生虫
<11-15,Foreman>Parasite.

197
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,470
<11-16,Cameron>传播的太快了
<11-16,Cameron>Spreading too quickly.

198
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,570
<11-17,House>下一个
<11-17,House>Next?

199
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,300
<11-18,Chase>病毒呢
<11-18,Chase>Virus?

200
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,640
<11-19,Cameron>孩子们病很重  验血也没有淋巴球增多
<11-19,Cameron>Kids are too sick, and the blood tests show no lymphocytosis.

201
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,610
<11-20,Foreman>而且他们对利巴韦林没反应
<11-20,Foreman>And they're not responding to a cycle of avirarapovirin.

202
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,270
<11-20,Foreman>如果是其他病毒  我们也无法及时找到它
<11-20,Foreman>If it's some other virus, we'll never find it in time, anyway.

203
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,080
<11-21,House>所以我们应该考虑细菌性感染
<11-21,House>Which leads us to bacterial infection.

204
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,450
<11-21,House>孩子们对广谱抗生素没反应
<11-21,House>It's not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics,

205
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,860
<11-21,House>因此是耐药菌株  比较常见的怀疑对象
<11-21,House>so we've got something resistant.The usual suspects.

206
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,480
<11-22,Foreman>抗甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌  医院里总会有
<11-22,Foreman>MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.

207
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,240
<11-23,Cameron>也许是污染的食物或者水源呢
<11-23,Cameron>Maybe a contaminated food or water source?

208
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,250
<11-23,Cameron>绿脓杆菌
<11-23,Cameron>Pseudomonas

209
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,640
<11-24,Chase>抗万古霉素肠球菌
<11-24,Chase>Vre?

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,100
<11-25,Foreman>H流感
<11-25,Foreman>H-Flu.

211
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,950
<11-26,House>好吧  这些是可能性比较大的
<11-26,House>Okay, those are the big ones.

212
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,240
<11-26,House>细菌培养要48小时  估计他们死后才能出结果
<11-26,House>Cultures will take 48 hours,might as well be post-mortem.

213
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,690
<11-26,House>给他们用万古霉素治疗抗甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌
<11-26,House>We'll start them on Vancomycin for the MRSA

214
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,530
<11-26,House>用氨曲南对付其它的病因
<11-26,House>and Aztreonam for the rest.

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,620
<11-26,House>去做核磁共振  检查脓肿和隐性感染
<11-26,House>Let's get MRIs, check for abcesses or some occult infection.

216
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,470
<11-26,House>我会在门诊  有重大发现马上通知我
<11-26,House>I'll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find something important.

217
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,780
<11-26,House>不重大也行
<11-26,House>Or unimportant.

218
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,540
<12-1,Cameron>我们给所有婴儿做了核磁共振
<12-1,Cameron>We did a MRI on all the babies,

219
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
<12-1,Cameron>不幸的是  一无所获
<12-1,Cameron>and unfortunately, we didn't find anything,

220
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,130
<12-1,Cameron>我们准备开始给他用最强效抗生素
<12-1,Cameron>so we're starting him on the strongest antibiotics we've got,

221
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,290
<12-1,Cameron>希望这能解决问题
<12-1,Cameron>and we're hoping that that'll take care of it.

222
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,570
<12-2,Judy>不过他还这么小
<12-2,Judy>But he's so tiny.

223
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,400
<12-3,Kim>他的病有多严重
<12-3,Kim>How sick is he?

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,180
<12-4,Cameron>他的体温是103.5度[华氏]  血压是80/40
<12-4,Cameron>His fever's up to 103.5 and his blood pressures 80 over 40.

225
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,350
<12-5,Judy>很严重吗
<12-5,Judy>Um, how bad is that?

226
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,460
<12-6,Cameron>这...
<12-6,Cameron>Ah, it...

227
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,580
<12-7,Foreman>血压很低
<12-7,Foreman>It, it's low.

228
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,260
<12-7,Foreman>心脏需要推动血液循环
<12-7,Foreman>The heart needs to circulate the blood.

229
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,690
<12-7,Foreman>如果心脏衰弱  氧气不会进到
<12-7,Foreman>If it's weak, oxygen isn't

230
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,160
<12-7,Foreman>肝脏  肾脏  和大脑
<12-7,Foreman>getting to the liver, the kidneys, the brain.

231
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,550
<12-8,Judy>我想问你
<12-8,Judy>Um, I have to ask you something.

232
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,450
<12-9,Kim>朱迪...
<12-9,Kim>Judy...

233
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,000
<12-10,Judy>不  不  金  让我说
<12-10,Judy>No, no, Kim. Let me.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,280
<12-10,Judy>我上个月得了感冒
<12-10,Judy>Um, I had a cold last month,

235
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,450
<12-10,Judy>我和医生说了  然后...
<12-10,Judy>and I told the doctors about it, and...

236
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,030
<12-11,Kim>亲爱的  这和你没关系
<12-11,Kim>Honey, this has nothing to do with you.

237
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,140
<12-11,Kim>金说得没错
<12-11,Kim>Kim's right.

238
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,080
<12-12,Cameron>你儿子生下来的时候是健康的
<12-12,Cameron>Your son was born healthy.

239
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,190
<12-12,Cameron>他出生之后才被感染的
<12-12,Cameron>He caught the infection after his birth.

240
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,290
<12-12,Cameron>不可能是你传染给他的
<12-12,Cameron>There's no reason to think he got it from you.

241
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,290
<12-13,Judy>不过你不知道  我是说
<12-13,Judy>But you don't know, I mean...

242
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,840
<12-13,Judy>你不知道他是怎么得病的
<12-13,Judy>You don't know how he got sick.

243
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,480
<13-1,Foreman>相当标准的常见问题
<13-1,Foreman>Pretty standard question:

244
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,790
<13-1,Foreman>我孩子的病有多严重  你居然回答不出
<13-1,Foreman>how sick is my child? You couldn't answer it.

245
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,430
<13-2,Cameron>我回答了
<13-2,Cameron>I answered.

246
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,240
<13-3,Foreman>你只是飞快的说了数字  血压  氧饱和度...
<13-3,Foreman>You rattled off numbers! BP, O2 stats...

247
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,680
<13-3,Foreman>他们不想知道这些
<13-3,Foreman>That's not what they need to know.

248
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,780
<13-4,Cameron>他们想知道的是将要怎么样
<13-4,Cameron>What they need to know is the future.

249
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,000
<13-4,Cameron>难道你有魔力水晶球
<13-4,Cameron>Got a magic 8-ball?

250
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,790
<13-5,Foreman>不是  但我经过八年的医学训练
<13-5,Foreman>No, just eight years of medical training.

251
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,000
<13-5,Foreman>听着
<13-5,Foreman>Look,

252
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,440
<13-5,Foreman>我知道告诉家属坏消息很难
<13-5,Foreman>I realize it's tough to break bad news to family...

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,720
<13-6,Cameron>但比听坏消息简单多了
<13-6,Cameron>Not as tough as hearing it.

254
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,540
<13-7,Foreman>而且我想垂死挣扎是最难的了
<13-7,Foreman>And I guess being the poor guy dying is toughest of all?

255
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,740
<13-7,Foreman>不是
<13-7,Foreman>No.

256
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,170
<13-8,Cameron>自己死比看着别人死要容易
<13-8,Cameron>It's easier to die than to watch someone die.

257
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,060
<14-1,Cuddy>我们正在检查通风道
<14-1,Cuddy>Well, we're checking the vents,

258
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,480
<14-1,Cuddy>疾病可能是通过空气传播的
<14-1,Cuddy>it could be airborne.

259
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,830
<14-1,Cuddy>谁去检查水槽  还有下水道
<14-1,Cuddy>Somebody get the sinks, too,and underneath them.

260
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,860
<14-2,Med Student with the Tie>我去
<14-2,Med Student with the Tie>I'll get it.

261
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,940
<14-3,Wilson>你叫了多少医学院学生来打扫卫生
<14-3,Wilson>How many med students have you got swabbing the decks?

262
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,420
<14-4,Cuddy>他们还能干什么
<14-4,Cuddy>Oh, what else are they going to do?

263
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,960
<14-4,Cuddy>他们又不在接生孩子
<14-4,Cuddy>It's not like they're delivering babies.

264
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,430
<14-5,Wilson>发现什么了吗
<14-5,Wilson>Find anything yet?

265
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,730
<14-6,Cuddy>有
<14-6,Cuddy>Ah, yeah.

266
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,700
<14-6,Cuddy>一半的洗手液器空了或者坏了
<14-6,Cuddy>About half the antibacterial gel dispensers are empty or broken.

267
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,730
<14-7,Wilson>这很不好  但对诊断来说完全没用
<14-7,Wilson>That's bad. And diagnostically, completely insignificant.

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,130
<14-8,Cuddy>如果员工不经常洗手
<14-8,Cuddy>Well, if the staff can't wash their hands,

269
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,590
<14-8,Cuddy>发生感染就不奇怪了
<14-8,Cuddy>it's no wonder an infection has spread.

270
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,990
<14-8,Cuddy>领带夹
<14-8,Cuddy>Hey, tie clip!

271
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,490
<14-9,Med Student with the Tie>什么
<14-9,Med Student with the Tie>Sorry?

272
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,400
<14-9,Med Student with the Tie>医院里正在流行传染病
<14-9,Med Student with the Tie>We have an epidemic in this hospital

273
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,460
<14-10,Cuddy>而你的领带却成为培养皿
<14-10,Cuddy>and your tie is becoming a Petri dish.

274
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,750
<14-10,Cuddy>戴上领带夹  或者把该死的领带拿下来
<14-10,Cuddy>Put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.

275
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,130
<14-10,Cuddy>我的关节近来一直感觉很松弛
<14-10,Cuddy>My joints have been feeling all loose,

276
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,380
<14-10,Cuddy>而且最近一直身体不好
<14-10,Cuddy>and lately I've been feeling sick a lot.

277
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,430
<14-10,Cuddy>也许我运动太多了  我在跑马拉松
<14-10,Cuddy>Maybe I'm overtraining;I'm doin' the marathon,

278
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,750
<14-10,Cuddy>大概每天10英里
<14-10,Cuddy>like, ten miles a day,

279
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,590
<14-10,Cuddy>但我看上去一点也没瘦下来
<14-10,Cuddy>but I can't seem to lose any weight.

280
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,070
<15-1,House>举起你的手臂
<15-1,House>Lift up your arms.

281
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,430
<15-1,House>你有寄生虫
<15-1,House>You have a parasite.

282
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,020
<15-2,Jill>类似绦虫什么的
<15-2,Jill>Like a tapeworm or something?

283
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,390
<15-3,House>躺下去  把毛衣拉上去
<15-3,House>Lie back and lift up your sweater.

284
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,510
<15-3,House>把手臂放下
<15-3,House>You can put your arms down.

285
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,070
<15-4,Jill>你有办法治好吗
<15-4,Jill>Can you do anything about it?

286
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,680
<15-5,House>未来一个月之内有办法
<15-5,House>Only for about a month or so.

287
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,840
<15-5,House>一个月过后  拿掉它就是非法的
<15-5,House>After that it becomes illegal to remove,

288
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,880
<15-5,House>某些州除外
<15-5,House>except in a couple of states.

289
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,240
<15-6,Jill>非法的
<15-6,Jill>Illegal?

290
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,280
<15-7,House>不要害怕
<15-7,House>Don't worry.

291
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,260
<15-7,House>很多女人学会怎样和寄生虫亲密相处
<15-7,House>Many women learn to embrace this parasite.

292
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,840
<15-7,House>给它们起名  用小衣服打扮他们
<15-7,House>They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes,

293
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,990
<15-7,House>和寄生虫们一起玩
<15-7,House>arrange playdates with other parasites...

294
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,090
<15-8,Jill>一起玩...
<15-8,Jill>Playdates...

295
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,110
<15-9,House>他眼睛长得像你
<15-9,House>It has your eyes.

296
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,100
<15-10,Jill>但是  这是不可能的
<15-10,Jill>But... that's impossible.

297
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,670
<15-11,House>估计你最近没来月经
<15-11,House>Well, I assume you weren't getting your period.

298
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,530
<15-11,House>也许这对你来说是个暗示
<15-11,House>Maybe that should have give you an inkling.

299
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,190
<15-12,Jill>可我植入节育器了
<15-12,Jill>But I'm on this birth control implant...

300
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,120
<15-13,House>没错  我知道  我看见你手臂上的疤了
<15-13,House>Yeah, I know. I saw the scar on your arm.

301
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,480
<15-14,Jill>我的医生说  如果这个有效
<15-14,Jill>and my doctor said I might

302
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,840
<15-14,Jill>我也许一直不会有月经
<15-14,Jill>not get any periods at all if it was working.

303
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,930
<15-15,House>有意思
<15-15,House>Interestingly enough,

304
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,620
<15-14,Jill>它无效的话你照样不会有
<15-14,Jill>you also don't get any periods if it isn't working,

305
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,460
<15-15,House>所以你应该做常规怀孕测试
<15-15,House>which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests.

306
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,250
<15-15,House>我会叫个护士帮你做产前护理
<15-15,House>I'm going to send a nurse in here to schedule your prenatal care.

307
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,360
<15-15,House>五个月后临盆  你可以开始准备洗礼了
<15-15,House>You're due in about five months,so start planning the shower.

308
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,810
<15-16,Jill>医生  拜托
<15-16,Jill>Um, Doctor? Please.

309
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,540
<15-16,Jill>我和我丈夫很想要孩子
<15-16,Jill>Me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon,

310
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,490
<15-16,Jill>不过  天哪
<15-16,Jill>but... oh, God.

311
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,940
<15-16,Jill>四个月前我们大吵了一架
<15-16,Jill>Like four months ago we had this really big fight.

312
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,730
<15-16,Jill>他搬出去住了  我做了些傻事
<15-16,Jill>He moved out.I did something stupid.

313
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,730
<15-17,House>一夜情吗
<15-17,House>One-night stand?

314
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,970
<15-18,Jill>前男友
<15-18,Jill>Ex-boyfriend.

315
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,070
<15-19,House>那我会帮你安排一个亲子鉴定
<15-19,House>I'll schedule you a paternity test, too.

316
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,560
<15-20,Jill>我不能让我丈夫知道
<15-20,Jill>I can't let my husband know.

317
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,850
<15-21,House>你前男友长得像你丈夫吗
<15-21,House>Does the old boyfriend look like your husband?

318
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,100
<15-22,Jill>有点
<15-22,Jill>Yeah...

319
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,940
<15-23,House>那就把孩子生下来吧
<15-23,House>Then just have the kid.

320
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,010
<15-23,House>他不会知道的
<15-23,House>He'll never know.

321
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,500
<15-23,House>成功的婚姻是建立在谎言之上的
<15-23,House>The most successful marriages are based on lies.

322
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,140
<15-23,House>你有了一个很好的开始
<15-23,House>You're off to a great start.

323
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,830
<16-1,House>你们看上去很高兴
<16-1,House>Well, you look cheery.

324
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,810
<16-1,House>怎么了
<16-1,House>What's going on?

325
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,460
<16-2,Cameron>哈蒂格和陈·卢皮诺家的孩子
<16-2,Cameron>The Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies.

326
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,040
<16-2,Cameron>他们的肾脏正逐渐停止工作
<16-2,Cameron>Their kidneys are shutting down.

327
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,190
<16-3,Chase>尿液检查没发现管型尿
<16-3,Chase>And the urine tests show no casts.

328
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,480
<16-4,House>说明是抗生素造成的肾衰竭
<16-4,House>Which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.

329
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,790
<16-5,Foreman>你是肾病专家
<16-5,Foreman>You're the nephrologist.

330
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,170
<16-5,Foreman>哪种抗生素引起的  我们停用它
<16-5,Foreman>Which one did it? We'll take 'em off that one.

331
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,850
<16-5,Foreman>不要告诉我万古霉素和氨曲南都会...
<16-5,Foreman>Don't tell me both Vancomycin and Aztreonam can...

332
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,200
<16-6,Chase>他们都会造成肾衰竭
<16-6,Chase>They both can cause this.

333
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,720
<16-6,Chase>没办法知道到底是哪种造成的
<16-6,Chase>There's no way to know which one it is. No test.

334
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,350
<16-7,Foreman>我们不能停用抗生素
<16-7,Foreman>We can't take them off the antibiotics.

335
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,790
<16-7,Foreman>他们会死于传染病的
<16-7,Foreman>They'll die of the infection.

336
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,260
<16-8,Cameron>如果我们同时用两种抗生素
<16-8,Cameron>If we leave them on both the antibiotics

337
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,410
<16-8,Cameron>他们会死于肾衰竭
<16-8,Cameron>they'll die of kidney failure.

338
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,070
<16-9,Chase>所以  我们只有尽力去猜测
<16-9,Chase>So, we take our best guess, then.

339
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,590
<16-9,Chase>哪种药引起了肾脏衰竭
<16-9,Chase>Which drug's causing the kidney failure?

340
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,640
<16-10,Foreman>抗甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌是医院里最常见的感染
<16-10,Foreman>It's like I said: it's always MRSA in hospitals.

341
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,270
<16-10,Foreman>停用氨曲南
<16-10,Foreman>Take 'em off Aztreonam.

342
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,950
<16-11,Cameron>我仍觉得是绿脓杆菌
<16-11,Cameron>I still think it's the pseudomonas.

343
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,950
<16-11,Cameron>我支持停用万古霉素
<16-11,Cameron>I vote to take them off the Vancomycin.

344
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,160
<16-12,House>猜测是没有用的
<16-12,House>There's no point in guessing.

345
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,220
<16-12,House>一个孩子停用万古霉素  另一个停用氨曲南
<16-12,House>Take one kid off Vancomycin and the other off Aztreonam.

346
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,030
<16-13,Chase>他们得同样的病
<16-13,Chase>They have the same disease,

347
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,560
<16-13,Chase>你却要给他们用不同的治疗吗
<16-13,Chase>you want to give them different treatment?

348
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,430
<16-14,Foreman>你到底在干什么
<16-14,Foreman>What the hell are you doing?

349
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,530
<16-15,House>通过治疗性实验来发现病因
<16-15,House>Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection.

350
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,710
<16-16,Foreman>这是不对的
<16-16,Foreman>That's wrong.

351
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,360
<16-17,House>至少有四个孩子生病
<16-17,House>We have four sick kids, at least.

352
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,320
<16-17,House>谁知道到底有多少个还没出现症状的
<16-17,House>Who knows how many more haven't started showing symptoms yet?

353
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,860
<16-18,Foreman>我们要对这两个孩子负责任
<16-18,Foreman>We have a duty to these two!

354
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,280
<16-19,House>如果两个孩子有不同反应
<16-19,House>If these two have different

355
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,280
<16-19,House>我们就知道怎么去救别的孩子
<16-19,House>reactions we know how to save the rest.

356
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,620
<16-20,Foreman>所以你是随机地让
<16-20,Foreman>So you're condemning one

357
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,080
<16-20,Foreman>其中的一个孩子去死喽
<16-20,Foreman>of these kids to die based on random chance.

358
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,810
<16-21,House>大概是吧
<16-21,House>I guess I am.

359
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,880
<17-1,Cuddy>所以  你是要掷硬币吗
<17-1,Cuddy>So, you're going to flip a coin?

360
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,840
<17-1,Cuddy>你就是这么决定孩子生死的吗
<17-1,Cuddy>That's how you decide which baby lives?

361
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,890
<17-2,House>我可以借个硬币吗
<17-2,House>Can I borrow a quarter?

362
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,350
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>你想被起诉  丢执照吗  豪斯
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>Do you want to get sued,lose your license, House?

363
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,160
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>照理说我很乐意你被起诉
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>Well, generally I'd applaud that,

364
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,920
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>但我的工作是保护这家医院
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>but my job is to protect this hospital,

365
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,540
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>所以我强烈建议你想出些医学理论
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>so I strongly advice you to come up with a medical rationale

366
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,010
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>说明为什么宝宝A用X药  反之亦然
<17-3,Hospital Attorney>why Baby A should get Medicine X and vice-versa.

367
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,350
<17-4,House>我是在想这个  滑头
<17-4,House>Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, Slick.

368
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,980
<17-4,House>我们可没上过法学院
<17-4,House>We didn't all go to law school.

369
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,240
<17-4,House>你的建议是我应该
<17-4,House>Your advice is that I should

370
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,300
<17-4,House>基于医学理论来做医学决定吗
<17-4,House>use medical reasons to make medical decisions?

371
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,810
<17-4,House>这可不简单
<17-4,House>Hmm, that's not going to be as easy...

372
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,310
<17-5,Attorney>任何医学的合理解释
<17-5,Attorney>Any medical justification.

373
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,310
<17-5,Attorney>都不需要是完美的
<17-5,Attorney>Doesn't need to be a good one.

374
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,390
<17-6,House>哈蒂格和氨曲南听上去都出自犹太民族
<17-6,House>Well, Hartig sounds Jewish, so does Aztreonam,

375
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,770
<17-6,House>所以哈蒂格家的孩子停用氨曲南  怎么样
<17-6,House>so we'll take the Hartig kid off Vancomycin, how's that?

376
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,570
<17-7,Cuddy>你不能在孩子身上做实验
<17-7,Cuddy>You can't experiment on babies.

377
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,070
<17-8,House>医生一直在病人身上做实验
<17-8,House>Doctors experiment all the time.

378
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,110
<17-9,Cuddy>是成人  并且要他们认可
<17-9,Cuddy>On adults. With their consent.

379
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,920
<17-10,House>好吧  我去征求家长的同意
<17-10,House>Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

380
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,420
<17-11,Attorney>你要告诉实情
<17-11,Attorney>Their informed consent.

381
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,660
<17-11,Attorney>他们必须了解  另一个孩子得到不同的治疗
<17-11,Attorney>They have to know the other kid is getting a different treatment.

382
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,670
<17-12,House>抱歉  不能这样
<17-12,House>Sorry, can't do that.

383
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,770
<17-12,House>让一个病人知道
<17-12,House>It'd be unethical for one

384
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,990
<17-12,House>另一个病人的治疗过程是不道德的
<17-12,House>patient to know about another patient's treatment.

385
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,880
<17-13,Attorney>他们有权知道
<17-13,Attorney>They have a right to know.

386
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,980
<17-14,House>如果他们知道就不会同意  计划就失败了
<17-14,House>If they know, they won't consent,that defeats the whole purpose.

387
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,970
<17-15,Attorney>这是他们的权利
<17-15,Attorney>That's their right.

388
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,220
<17-16,House>又有两个婴儿出现了症状
<17-16,House>Two more babies have just become symptomatic.

389
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,880
<17-16,House>我会听从你的法律建议  哪个具有优先权
<17-16,House>I defer to your legal wisdom:which takes precedence?

390
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,640
<17-16,House>六个将死的孩子  还是一张失踪的医疗合同
<17-16,House>Six dying babies or a missing consent form?

391
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,830
<17-17,Attorney>你不能这么做
<17-17,Attorney>You can't do it.

392
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,730
<17-18,Cuddy>你觉得怎么好就怎么做吧
<17-18,Cuddy>Do what you think is best.

393
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,670
<18-1,Foreman>你女儿的肾脏正在衰竭
<18-1,Foreman>Your daughter's kidneys are shutting down...

394
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,790
<18-2,Cameron>你儿子的肾快不行了
<18-2,Cameron>Your son's kidneys are failing.

395
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,720
<18-3,Foreman>所以我们打算给她停用氨曲南
<18-3,Foreman>...so we're going to take her of the Aztreonam.

396
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,810
<18-4,Cameron>我们要给他停用万古霉素
<18-4,Cameron>We're taking him off Vancomycin.

397
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,060
<18-5,Ethan>可是  最开始她是怎么得病的
<18-5,Ethan>But, uh, but what made her sick in the first place?

398
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,470
<18-6,Kim>你们认为是什么东西引起的
<18-6,Kim>What do you think is causing it?

399
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,030
<18-7,Cameron>看起来是一种叫绿脓杆菌的细菌
<18-7,Cameron>It seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.

400
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,840
<18-8,Foreman>我们认为是MRSA
<18-8,Foreman>We think it's MRSA.

401
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,860
<18-8,Foreman>抗甲氧西林金葡菌
<18-8,Foreman>Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus.

402
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,960
<18-8,Foreman>是一种常见的强力耐药菌
<18-8,Foreman>It's a very resistant form of a very common bacteria.

403
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,820
<18-9,Cameron>我们希望氨曲南可以治疗它
<18-9,Cameron>We're hoping the Aztreonam will clear it up.

404
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,000
<18-10,Foreman>万古霉素是治疗MRSA最有效的药物
<18-10,Foreman>Vancomycin is the best treatment for MRSA,

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,530
<18-10,Foreman>所以我们给她继续用这个药
<18-10,Foreman>so we're gonna keep giving it to her.

406
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,490
<18-11,Ethan>好的  这会治好她吗
<18-11,Ethan>Right. Is it gonna cure her?

407
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,260
<18-12,Foreman>您的孩子病得很重
<18-12,Foreman>Your child is very sick.

408
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,000
<18-12,Foreman>您得认清这个事实
<18-12,Foreman>You need to know that.

409
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,290
<18-12,Foreman>只能尽人事听天命了
<18-12,Foreman>This is a 'hail Mary' pass.

410
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,510
<18-12,Foreman>可能会治好她  也可能不行
<18-12,Foreman>It might cure her, it might not.

411
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,840
<18-13,Judy>那  这能治好他吗
<18-13,Judy>So, so that'll cure him?

412
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,540
<18-14,Cameron>如果有效的话  他24小时之内就会好转
<18-14,Cameron>We'll know in 24 hours if it's working.

413
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,030
<18-15,Wilson>你怎么跟她们说的
<18-15,Wilson>What did you tell them?

414
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,440
<18-16,Cameron>我把事实告诉她们了
<18-16,Cameron>I told them the truth.

415
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,770
<18-17,Wilson>她们看上去松了口气
<18-17,Wilson>They seemed relieved.

416
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,830
<18-17,Wilson>你说了他们的孩子病得多重吗
<18-17,Wilson>You tell them how sick their son is?

417
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,160
<18-18,Cameron>我跟他们说了现在的情况
<18-18,Cameron>I explained what was going on.

418
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,890
<18-18,Cameron>艾莉森  他们的孩子快死了
<18-18,Cameron>Allison, their baby's dying.

419
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,970
<18-19,Wilson>如果你离开的时候  她们没有泪流满面
<18-19,Wilson>If the parents weren't in tears when you left,

420
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,100
<18-19,Wilson>那你肯定没告诉她们真相
<18-19,Wilson>you didn't tell them the truth.

421
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,130
<18-20,Cameron>我不这么认为
<18-20,Cameron>That's not how I see it.

422
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,010
<18-21,Wilson>你想让她们一直蒙在鼓里吗
<18-21,Wilson>Do you want them blindsided?

423
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,020
<18-21,Wilson>等到她们嚎啕大哭  喊着
<18-21,Wilson>Want them coming up and saying

424
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,410
<18-21,Wilson>天啊  我的孩子死了  你怎么不早点告诉我
<18-21,Wilson>"My God, my baby died,why didn't you warn me?"

425
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,210
<18-22,Cameron>你是担心她们对我们大吼大叫吗
<18-22,Cameron>So now it's about worrying about them yelling at us?

426
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,380
<18-23,Wilson>不  我是觉得应该让他们
<18-23,Wilson>No, it's about getting them

427
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,340
<18-23,Wilson>为孩子的死做好思想准备
<18-23,Wilson>prepared for the likely death of their child.

428
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
<18-24,Cameron>如果明天她们的儿子死了
<18-24,Cameron>If their son dies tomorrow,

429
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,880
<18-24,Cameron>你觉得她们会在乎我今天说过什么吗
<18-24,Cameron>do you think they'll give a damn of what I said them today?

430
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,260
<18-24,Cameron>没有任何意义了
<18-24,Cameron>It's not going to matter;

431
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,240
<18-24,Cameron>他们才不会在乎
<18-24,Cameron>they're not going to care;

432
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,800
<18-24,Cameron>一切都会变得不同
<18-24,Cameron>it's not going to be the same ever again.

433
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,610
<18-24,Cameron>不过是给可怜的女人们几小时的希望罢了
<18-24,Cameron>Just give those poor women a few hours of hope.

434
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,120
<19-1,Jill>豪斯医生
<19-1,Jill>Dr. House!

435
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,960
<19-1,Jill>天啊  不要
<19-1,Jill>Oh, no!

436
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,840
<19-1,Jill>豪斯医生  这是我丈夫  查理
<19-1,Jill>Dr. House, this is my husband, Charlie.

437
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,370
<19-2,House>谁告诉你我的办公室的
<19-2,House>Who told you where my office was?

438
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,990
<19-3,Charlie>吉尔  很明显他不想我们打扰他
<19-3,Charlie>Jill, come on, he obviously doesn't want us bothering him.

439
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,690
<19-4,House>躲还来不及呢
<19-4,House>Ooh, I was trying to hide it.

440
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,440
<19-5,Jill>医生  就是
<19-5,Jill>Look, Doctor, this is

441
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,390
<19-5,Jill>您说我得的那个传单(传染性单核细胞增多症)
<19-5,Jill>about the mono you said you thought I had...

442
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,830
<19-6,House>传单
<19-6,House>The mono?

443
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,000
<19-7,Jill>对  查理是不是也该检查一下
<19-7,Jill>Yes. You know, shouldn't Charlie be tested?

444
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,480
<19-7,Jill>你知道的  就是那个检查
<19-7,Jill>You know, the test.

445
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,590
<19-7,Jill>验血
<19-7,Jill>The blood test.

446
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,210
<19-7,Jill>没错
<19-7,Jill>Right.

447
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,290
<19-8,House>不好意思  我不太记得住病人
<19-8,House>Yeah, I'm sorry, I sometimes forget patients,

448
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,740
<19-8,House>我还以为你是那个不知道怎么避孕的笨蛋呢
<19-8,House>I thought you were this idiot who doesn't know how to use birth control.

449
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,510
<19-9,Charlie>我不可能得传单
<19-9,Charlie>I can't have mono.

450
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,030
<19-9,Charlie>都没觉得恶心什么的
<19-9,Charlie>I don't even feel sick or anything.

451
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,940
<19-10,House>初期通常没有症状
<19-10,House>That's very often the first sign.

452
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,580
<19-10,House>上午打电话到我办公室吧
<19-10,House>Call my office in the morning,

453
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,220
<19-10,House>我会安排他验血的
<19-10,House>I'll schedule him for bloodtests.

454
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,560
<19-11,Jill>太感谢了
<19-11,Jill>Thank you!

455
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,660
<19-12,Charlie>我也没觉得全身无力啊
<19-12,Charlie>I'm not even tired.

456
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,630
<20-1,Wilson>查到什么了吗
<20-1,Wilson>Find anything yet?

457
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,350
<20-2,Cuddy>没  就是池子里倒的奶粉
<20-2,Cuddy>No, just some baby formula

458
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,590
<20-2,Cuddy>堵在下水道口了
<20-2,Cuddy>being stored under a sink with a dripping faucet.

459
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,080
<20-3,Wilson>自来水污染
<20-3,Wilson>Tap water contamination.

460
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,390
<20-3,Wilson>你觉得是绿脓杆菌感染吗
<20-3,Wilson>You thinking pseudomonas infection?

461
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,020
<20-4,Cuddy>我以为是  结果浪费了几个小时来检查
<20-4,Cuddy>I was. I wasted a couple of hours chasing it down,

462
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,600
<20-4,Cuddy>这些奶粉当然得在婴儿附近
<20-4,Cuddy>but of course the formula hasn't been anywhere near the babies.

463
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
<20-6,Cuddy>不管哪个笨蛋把它们放这
<20-6,Cuddy>Whatever idiot stored them there...

464
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,700
<20-7,Wilson>我们会查出来的
<20-7,Wilson>All right, we'll figure it out!

465
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,120
<20-7,Wilson>只是...  冷静

<20-15,Karen>我们过不了这一关  是吗
<20-15,Karen>We're not going to make it, are we?

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,860
<20-17,Karen>她和她丈夫离婚了
<20-17,Karen>four months after the funeral.

<20-17,Karen>世事如此  对吗
<20-17,Karen>It's just, uh, what always happens, right?

479
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,740
<20-18,Chase>病人离开医院之后发生了什么
<20-18,Chase>Um, what happens to patients after they leave the hospital,

480
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,070
<20-18,Chase>我并不清楚  尽量别太杞人忧天
<20-18,Chase>I don't know, but... try not to get ahead of yourself.

517
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,190
<20-41,House>氨曲南没用
<20-41,House>The Aztreonam doesn't work.

518
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,000
<20-41,House>把其它孩子的万古霉素用量加倍
<20-41,House>Double-cover all the other babies with Vancomycin.

519
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,390
<20-42,Chase>我去
<20-42,Chase>I'll do it.

520
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,150
<20-43,House>卡梅隆  你去通知父母
<20-43,House>Cameron, you tell the parents.

521
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,740
<20-43,House>告诉她们这孩子可能救了5条命
<20-43,House>Tell them their child probably saved five lives.

522
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,100
<20-44,Cameron>不是该奇斯...
<20-44,Cameron>But Chase should...

523
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,160
<20-45,House>奇斯很忙
<20-45,House>Chase is busy.

524
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,250
<20-46,Cameron>你是主治医师
<20-46,Cameron>You're the attending.

525
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,730
<20-47,House>帮助她完成任务
<20-47,House>Make sure she does her job.

526
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,850
<21-1,House>我叫你帮助她完成任务  不是你替她做
<21-1,House>I asked you to make sure she does her job, not do it for her.

527
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,850
<21-2,Wilson>她都说不出话了
<21-2,Wilson>She froze up.

528
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,060
<21-3,House>她同情那对父母  所以说不出
<21-3,House>She felt sorry for the parents so she shut up.

529
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,220
<21-3,House>你同情她  所以你就替她说了
<21-3,House>You felt sorry for her so you opened your mouth.

530
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,320
<21-4,Wilson>她有心理障碍
<21-4,Wilson>She has a problem.

531
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,670
<21-5,House>她得学会面对
<21-5,House>Yeah, she needs to deal with it.

532
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,170
<21-5,House>如果不是你帮她  她早就克服这障碍了
<21-5,House>If you hadn't bailed her out,she would have done it.

533
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,060
<21-6,Wilson>那她也不会连睡两个星期
<21-6,Wilson>Great, then she wouldn't have slept for two weeks.

534
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,900
<21-6,Wilson>或许她该考虑换个专业
<21-6,Wilson>Maybe she should be thinking about a different specialty.

535
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,810
<21-6,Wilson>实验室  科研
<21-6,Wilson>Lab work, research?

536
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,600
<21-7,House>怎么了
<21-7,House>Yeah, what is it?

537
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,980
<21-8,Chase>哈蒂格家的孩子
<21-8,Chase>The Hartig baby.

538
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,340
<21-8,Chase>病情也加重了
<21-8,Chase>She's getting sicker, too.

539
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,970
<21-8,Chase>万古霉素也不起作用
<21-8,Chase>The Vancomycin isn't working, either.

540
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,240
<22-1,House>万古霉素没用  氨曲南也没用
<22-1,House>Vancomycin doesn't kill it.Aztreonam doesn't kill it.

541
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,470
<22-1,House>到底是什么鬼东西
<22-1,House>What the hell is this?

542
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,560
<22-2,Foreman>超级细菌
<22-2,Foreman>It's a super bug.

543
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,570
<22-3,Chase>可能是抗万古霉素金葡菌
<22-3,Chase>It could be VRSA.

544
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,570
<22-4,Cuddy>整个美国
<22-4,Cuddy>There's only been two

545
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,270
<22-4,Cuddy>一共就报道过两个病例
<22-4,Cuddy>reported cases of it ever in the United States.

546
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,840
<22-5,Chase>那些孩子中有一个  豪森家的  有皮疹
<22-5,Chase>One of the kids, the Hausen baby, had a skin rash.

547
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,610
<22-5,Chase>可能是烫伤样皮肤综合征
<22-5,Chase>It could be scalded-skin syndrome

548
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,220
<22-5,Chase>是抗万古霉素金葡菌的体征之一
<22-5,Chase>which would be a sign of VRSA.

549
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,280
<22-6,Foreman>那这些孩子死定了
<22-6,Foreman>Then these kids are dead.

550
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,780
<22-6,Foreman>这都是我们的错
<22-6,Foreman>This is our fault.

551
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,020
<22-7,House>医生们开了太多的抗生素
<22-7,House>Doctors over-prescribing antibiotics.

552
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,120
<22-7,House>感冒了  吃点青霉素
<22-7,House>Got a cold? Take some penicillin.

553
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,500
<22-7,House>鼻塞  没关系  用点阿奇霉素
<22-7,House>Sniffles? No problem.Have some azithromycin.

554
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,960
<22-7,House>这些都没用了  那就用左氧氟沙星
<22-7,House>Is that not working anymore? Well, got your Levaquin.

555
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,390
<22-7,House>洗手间里全是抗菌肥皂
<22-7,House>Antibacterial soaps in every bathroom.

556
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,470
<22-7,House>很快我们就会往水里加万古霉素了
<22-7,House>We'll be adding Vancomycin to the water supply soon.

557
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,750
<22-7,House>是我们培育了这些超级细菌
<22-7,House>We bred these super bugs.

558
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,010
<22-7,House>它们是我们的孩子
<22-7,House>They're our babies.

559
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,350
<22-7,House>现在它们长大了
<22-7,House>Now they're all grown up and

560
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,530
<22-7,House>伤痕累累  满怀怨恨
<22-7,House>they've got body piercings and a lot of anger.

561
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,440
<22-7,House>另一方面
<22-7,House>On the other hand,

562
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,480
<22-7,House>许多抗生素都无法对付它们
<22-7,House>maybe antibiotics had nothing to do with it.

563
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,570
<22-7,House>你注意到最后他的血压特别低吗
<22-7,House>Did you notice how low his BP was at the end?

564
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,970
<22-7,House>即便上了三个加压器
<22-7,House>Even with three pressers?

565
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,990
<22-8,Wilson>心脏损伤
<22-8,Wilson>Heart damage?

566
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,130
<22-9,House>回家吧
<22-9,House>Go home.

567
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,020
<22-9,House>今晚你们什么都做不了了
<22-9,House>There's nothing more you can do tonight.

568
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,050
<23-1,House>男婴  陈·卢皮诺

<23-1,House>Thursday, December 2nd, 2004.

571
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,830
<23-1,House>这是陈·卢皮诺男婴的心肌横切
<23-1,House>This is a cross-section of the Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium.

572
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,140
<24-1,House>纤维化  淋巴细胞浸润
<24-1,House>Fibrosis, lymphocydic infiltrates.

573
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,700
<24-2,Cameron>可是血液检查没有发现淋巴细胞增多
<24-2,Cameron>There was no sign of lymphocytosis in the blood tests.

574
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,350
<24-3,House>对  我们都有理由相信这是细菌感染
<24-3,House>Yes, well, we all had plenty of good reasons to think bacterial.

575
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,930
<24-3,House>没人在责怪你们
<24-3,House>Nobody is scolding you.

576
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,380
<24-3,House>不幸的是  这些自以为是的理由都错了
<24-3,House>Unfortunately, all of those clever reasons were wrong.

577
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,390
<24-3,House>是病毒感染了他们的心脏
<24-3,House>It is a virus infecting their hearts.

578
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,530
<24-4,Foreman>我们完蛋了
<24-4,Foreman>We're screwed.

579
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,330
<24-4,Foreman>我们不可能查出是什么病毒  可能性太多了
<24-4,Foreman>We can't chase down a virus;there's a thousand possibilities.

580
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,740
<24-5,Cameron>可以跑胶  用抗体实验
<24-5,Cameron>We could run gels, antibody tests.

581
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,710
<24-6,Foreman>做几千个吗
<24-6,Foreman>A thousand of them?

582
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,050
<24-6,Foreman>孩子们的血液不够
<24-6,Foreman>The kids don't have enough blood.

583
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,570
<24-7,House>奇斯  你是这方面的专家
<24-7,House>Chase, you're the intensivist.

584
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,190
<24-7,House>在孩子面临死亡前  我们可以抽几次血?
<24-7,House>How many could we do before we risk exsanguinating the kids?

585
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,570
<24-8,Chase>是小瓶验血  不是针管吧
<24-8,Chase>You're talking vials, not stick tests?

586
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,430
<24-8,Chase>最多五六次
<24-8,Chase>I wouldn't take more than five or six.

587
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:28,040
<24-9,House>那我们得病毒范围从数千种缩小至六种
<24-9,House>Okay, so we have to narrow the thousand viruses down to six.

588
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,660
<24-9,House>尸检结果表明病因是病毒性的
<24-9,House>Now, the autopsy's shown us what the virus does.

589
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,050
<24-9,House>说吧  我们现在知道什么
<24-9,House>So, let's go. What do we know?

590
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,520
<24-10,Wilson>三氮唑核苷和阿昔洛韦没有疗效
<24-10,Wilson>Ribavirin and encyclovir don't knock it out.

591
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,890
<24-11,Cuddy>那就可以排除疱疹病毒
<24-11,Cuddy>Cross out the herpes viruses.

592
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,270
<24-12,House>也可以排除腺病毒
<24-12,House>Also adenovirus.

593
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,830
<24-12,House>还有呢  还有呢  接着说
<24-12,House>What else, what else? Keep talking.

594
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,830
<24-13,Chase>看来该种病毒只会危及孩子
<24-13,Chase>Well, it, it only seems to hit children.

595
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,250
<24-13,Chase>因为母亲们都没有异样
<24-13,Chase>The mothers aren't sick, so...

596
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,700
<24-14,Foreman>排除弓形体病以及风疹
<24-14,Foreman>No toxoplasmosis, no rubella.

597
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,560
<24-14,Foreman>这就排除了TORCH综合症
<24-14,Foreman>Cross out the entire Torch syndrome.

598
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,940
<24-15,Wilson>有没有发现肺损伤
<24-15,Wilson>You didn't find any lung damage?

599
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,530
<24-16,House>没有
<24-16,House>No.

600
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,260
<24-17,Wilson>那就不是副黏液病毒科病毒
<24-17,Wilson>None of the paramyxoviridae.

601
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,350
<24-18,House>记着  他们的心脏功能受损
<24-18,House>Cardiac scarring, people.

602
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,210
<24-19,Chase>巨细胞病毒呢
<24-19,Chase>Cmv?

603
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,840
<24-20,Foreman>还有肠病毒
<24-20,Foreman>Enteroviruses, too, I think.

604
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,260
<24-21,House>艾柯11型病毒
<24-21,House>Echo 11.

605
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,350
<24-22,Cuddy>甲型流感病毒
<24-22,Cuddy>Influenza A.

606
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,250
<24-23,House>甲流病毒
<24-23,House>Influ A.

607
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,670
<24-23,House>好  还有呢
<24-23,House>Yes. And?

608
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,340
<24-23,House>我把呼吸道合胞病毒也算进去
<24-23,House>I'm putting RSV down as a yes.

609
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,000
<24-23,House>现在有8种了
<24-23,House>That makes eight.

610
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,860
<24-24,Chase>抽8小瓶的血会有生命危险
<24-24,Chase>Eight vials of blood is pushing it.

611
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,940
<24-25,House>会有生命危险吗  可咱们爱做化验呀
<24-25,House>Pushing it, but we love that!

612
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,400
<24-25,House>去拿抗体试剂  着手化验
<24-25,House>Get the antibody kits, start testing the sick kids.

613
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,650
<24-26,Wilson>那我去找找有没有抗病毒剂
<24-26,Wilson>All right, I'll start looking into

614
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,480
<24-26,Wilson>可以同时治疗这8种病毒
<24-26,Wilson>whether there are any antivirals for these eight.

615
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,200
<24-27,House>等等  那些同楼层没有得病的孩子
<24-27,House>Wait a second. The, the kids on the floor who didn't get sick.

616
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,700
<24-27,House>还在医院吗
<24-27,House>Are any of them still in the hospital?

617
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,250
<24-28,Wilson>他们被转移到五楼了
<24-28,Wilson>They got moved to the fifth floor.

618
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,050
<24-28,Wilson>不过现在应该都出院了
<24-28,Wilson>But they're probably all checked out by now.

619
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,800
<24-29,Cuddy>没有  林德皮特家的孩子身上有些黄疸
<24-29,Cuddy>No, the Lindpert boy had a bit of jaundice.

620
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,780
<24-29,Cuddy>他应该今天出院
<24-29,Cuddy>He should be checking out today.

621
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,010
<24-30,House>把他的血液化验一下
<24-30,House>I want to test his blood, too.

622
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,730
<24-31,Cuddy>为什么
<24-31,Cuddy>Why?

623
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,730
<24-32,House>我们要获取尽可能多的信息
<24-32,House>'Cause we need all the information we can get.

624
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,580
<24-32,House>健康的孩子可以做对照组
<24-32,House>The healthy kid can be our control group.

625
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,080
<24-33,Cuddy>我去告他的父母说他们的孩子得了天花
<24-33,Cuddy>I'll just tell his parents he can't check out

626
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,690
<24-33,Cuddy>暂时还不能出院
<24-33,Cuddy>because he has the smallpox.

627
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,060
<25-1,Chase>好了  好了
<25-1,Chase>All done, all done.

628
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,000
<26-1,House>怎么样了
<26-1,House>What did we get?

629
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,390
<26-2,Foreman>患病婴儿对艾柯11型病毒检测结果是阳性
<26-2,Foreman>Well, the sick babies all tested positive for Echovirus 11.

630
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,010
<26-3,House>很好
<26-3,House>Great.

631
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,830
<26-4,Foreman>还有巨细胞病毒和细小病毒B19均为阳性
<26-4,Foreman>And CMV, and parvovirus B19.

632
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,120
<26-5,House>三种病毒的检测结果均为阳性吗
<26-5,House>Three viruses?

633
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,090
<26-6,Foreman>更奇怪的  那个健康的孩子检查结果表明
<26-6,Foreman>What's weirder, the healthy kid we tested:

634
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,470
<26-2,Foreman>他对艾柯11型病毒
<26-2,Foreman>he's positive for Echovirus 11

635
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,620
<26-6,Foreman>和巨细胞病毒检测结果也为阳性
<26-6,Foreman>and CMV antibodies as well.

636
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,070
<26-6,Foreman>他们是新生儿
<26-6,Foreman>They're infants.

637
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,030
<26-7,House>他们流淌着母亲的血  有着母亲的抗体
<26-7,House>They have their mother's blood, their mother's antibodies.

638
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
<26-8,Foreman>难道我们一无所获吗
<26-8,Foreman>So we just learned nothing?

639
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,630
<26-9,House>我们已经得到初步结果了
<26-9,House>Uh-uh. We have half the picture.

640
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,800
<26-9,House>健康的孩子得以存活
<26-9,House>The healthy kids survived

641
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,950
<26-9,House>是因为他们母亲的抗体救了他们
<26-9,House>because their mothers' antibodies saved them.

642
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,820
<26-10,Foreman>如果母亲遭受过巨细胞病毒侵害
<26-10,Foreman>The mom had CMV in the past

643
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,310
<26-11,House>她就会产生抗体
<26-11,House>she'd have the antibodies for CMV.

644
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,510
<26-10,Foreman>那么孩子就会对该病毒免疫
<26-10,Foreman>The kid would be immune from it.

645
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,860
<26-10,Foreman>那我们该去检验患病儿童母亲体内是否有
<26-10,Foreman>So we test the sick kids' moms for Echovirus,

646
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,330
<26-10,Foreman>艾柯病毒  巨细胞病毒和细小病毒抗体
<26-10,Foreman>CMV, and parvovirus.

647
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,120
<26-11,House>因此他们所没有的那种病毒抗体
<26-11,House>And whichever they don't have the antibodies for,

648
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,720
<26-11,House>就是他们孩子的病因
<26-11,House>that's what's killing their kids.

649
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,920
<26-12,Foreman>我去化验他们母亲的血
<26-12,Foreman>I'll test the mothers.

650
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,610
<26-12,Foreman>艾柯11型病毒
<26-12,Foreman>Echovirus 11.

651
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,310
<27-1,Foreman>是一种肠道病毒
<27-1,Foreman>It's an enterovirus.

652
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,230
<27-1,Foreman>它寄生在肠道
<27-1,Foreman>It lodges in the intestinal tract.

653
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,930
<27-2,Cameron>肠道病毒会导致成人腹泻
<27-2,Cameron>Enteroviruses cause diarrhea

654
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,840
<27-2,Cameron>以及产生一些类似感冒的症状或是皮疹
<27-2,Cameron>and flu-like symptoms in adults, maybe a rash,

655
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,870
<27-2,Cameron>可该病毒对新生儿是致命的
<27-2,Cameron>but for newborns it can be deadly.

656
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,930
<27-2,Cameron>会损害她的心脏
<27-2,Cameron>It's damaging her heart.

657
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,250
<27-3,Karen>你们打算怎么治疗
<27-3,Karen>Well, is there anything you can do?

658
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,400
<27-4,Foreman>病毒感染比细菌感染更难治疗
<27-4,Foreman>Viruses are more difficult to treat than bacterial infections.

659
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,010
<27-4,Foreman>目前我们尚未发现普通感冒的治疗方法
<27-4,Foreman>We still haven't found a cure for the common cold.

660
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,050
<27-5,Ethan>那没有疫苗或者...
<27-5,Ethan>So, there's no vaccine, or...

661
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,950
<27-6,Foreman>宾夕法尼亚有家公司研制出一种抗病毒药
<27-6,Foreman>There's a company in Pennsylvania developing an antiviral.

662
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,140
<27-6,Foreman>实验结果表明它有良好的疗效
<27-6,Foreman>It got positive results in a lab setting and

663
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,180
<27-6,Foreman>而且我们已经拿到此药
<27-6,Foreman>we managed to get our hands on it.

664
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,920
<28-1,Cameron>试想若你无法触碰自己的孩子
<28-1,Cameron>Imagine not being able to touch your own baby.

665
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,500
<28-1,Cameron>能请你们帮个忙吗
<28-1,Cameron>Can I get your guys' help with something?

666
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,200
<28-2,Ethan>当然
<28-2,Ethan>Sure.

667
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,270
<28-3,Cameron>你们的女儿  她...
<28-3,Cameron>Your daughter, her...

668
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,140
<28-4,Ethan>玛克辛
<28-4,Ethan>Maxine.

669
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,910
<28-5,Karen>那是她的名字
<28-5,Karen>That's her name.

670
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,860
<28-4,Ethan>玛克辛
<28-4,Ethan>Maxine.

671
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,090
<28-6,Cameron>当护士换床单时
<28-6,Cameron>We need someone to hold Maxine off of the bed

672
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,750
<28-6,Cameron>需要有人把玛克辛抱起来
<28-6,Cameron>while the nurse changes her sheet.

673
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,490
<28-6,Cameron>好的
<28-6,Cameron>Sure.

674
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,020
<29-1,House>福曼  有空吗
<29-1,House>Hey, Foreman? Got a minute?

675
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,040
<29-2,Foreman>那两个孩子的肺血管阻力平稳
<29-2,Foreman>So, pulmonary resistance is stabilized for the two kids,

676
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,080
<29-2,Foreman>不过血压仍然...
<29-2,Foreman>but BP's still...

677
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,060
<29-3,House>这不是新闻了
<29-3,House>No news, then.

678
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,600
<29-4,Foreman>你怎么看卡梅隆
<29-4,Foreman>How's Cameron?

679
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,510
<29-4,Foreman>卡梅隆医生吗
<29-4,Foreman>Dr. Cameron?

680
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,260
<29-4,Foreman>是的
<29-4,Foreman>Sure.

681
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,320
<29-5,House>先从她开始
<29-5,House>Let's start with her,

682
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,680
<29-5,House>然后再谈我们认识的其他卡梅隆
<29-5,House>and move on to all the other Camerons we know.

683
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,140
<29-6,Foreman>抱歉  你关心他人
<29-6,Foreman>Sorry, I'm just not used

684
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,350
<29-6,Foreman>还真让我感到有些不适应
<29-6,Foreman>to you asking about someone's well-being.

685
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,530
<29-7,House>我能理解对此你的惊讶
<29-7,House>I can understand how the question would surprise you.

686
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,720
<29-7,House>不过我不理解怎会让你困惑
<29-7,House>I don't quite get how it would confuse you.

687
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,210
<29-8,Foreman>为什么你想知道
<29-8,Foreman>Why do you want to know?

688
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,020
<29-9,House>为什么你想知道我为什么想知道
<29-9,House>Why do you want to know why I want to know?

689
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,710
<29-10,Foreman>好奇而已
<29-10,Foreman>Just curious.

690
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,480
<29-11,House>我也是
<29-11,House>Me, too.

691
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,190
<29-12,Foreman>你没有好奇心
<29-12,Foreman>You don't get curious.

692
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,780
<29-13,House>我是这个世界上好奇心最强的人
<29-13,House>I'm the most curious man in the world.

693
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,890
<29-14,Foreman>可你对日常琐事不好奇
<29-14,Foreman>Not about trivialities.

694
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,670
<29-15,House>这当然不是日常琐事
<29-15,House>Well, then, this must not be trivial.

695
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,880
<29-15,House>卡梅隆的处事能力如何
<29-15,House>How is Cameron handling everything?

696
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,010
<29-16,Foreman>挺好的
<29-16,Foreman>Just fine.

697
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,940
<29-17,House>很好  我知道了
<29-17,House>Great, glad we talked.

698
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,190
<30-1,House>是你老公给你种的"传单"(怀孕)
<30-1,House>Your husband is definitely the source of your "Mono".

699
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,500
<30-1,House>谢天谢地
<30-1,House>Oh, thank God.

700
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,990
<30-2,Jill>我要当妈妈了
<30-2,Jill>Wow, I'm going to be a mom.

701
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,910
<30-2,Jill>太谢谢你了
<30-2,Jill>Thank you so much;

702
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,290
<30-2,Jill>我得给你买个礼物之类的来感谢你
<30-2,Jill>I gotta get you a gift or something.

703
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,450
<30-3,House>最好的礼物就是以后都看不见你
<30-3,House>Sometimes the best gift is the gift of never seeing you again.

704
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,110
<30-3,House>好的
<30-3,House>Okay, all right!

705
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,510
<30-4,Jill>豪斯医生  你太牛了
<30-4,Jill>But, Dr. House, you've been so awesome.

706
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,440
<30-4,Jill>我真的十分信任你
<30-4,Jill>I mean, I really, totally trust you.

707
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,130
<30-5,House>你能不能...
<30-5,House>Do you think you...

708
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,830
<30-5,House>不
<30-5,House>No.

709
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,690
<30-6,Jill>帮我做产前
<30-6,Jill>...could do the prenatal?

710
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,840
<30-8,Jill>-不  -那替我接生呢
<30-8,Jill>- No.  - Or deliver the baby?

711
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,870
<30-9,House>答案是不行
<30-9,House>That would be no.

712
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,690
<30-9,House>好吧
<30-9,House>Okay!

713
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,590
<31-1,Foreman>奇斯  看看这个
<31-1,Foreman>Chase, take a look at this.

714
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,470
<32-1,Ethan>天哪  是好消息
<32-1,Ethan>Oh, God. It's good news.

715
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,240
<32-1,Ethan>不  是天大的好消息
<32-1,Ethan>No, it's great.

716
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,200
<32-1,Ethan>她恢复的很好
<32-1,Ethan>She's doing great.

717
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,880
<33-1,House>他们都走了吗
<33-1,House>They all gone?

718
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,770
<33-2,Cameron>哈蒂格家正在办理出院手续
<33-2,Cameron>Hartigs are checking out right now.

719
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,670
<33-3,House>你看起来很疲倦
<33-3,House>You look tired.

720
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,010
<33-4,Cameron>多谢关心
<33-4,Cameron>Thanks.

721
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,600
<33-5,House>这也难怪
<33-5,House>It's no wonder.

722
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,040
<33-5,House>过去的这段日子你过于操劳
<33-5,House>You've had a hard time the last couple of days.

723
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,330
<33-6,Cameron>难道你没有吗
<33-6,Cameron>And you haven't?

724
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,180
<33-6,Cameron>跟你不一样
<33-6,Cameron>Not like you.

725
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,370
<33-7,House>行为举止如此怪异的人
<33-7,House>Anyone who's that awkward

726
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,510
<33-7,House>要么没有经历过生离死别
<33-7,House>either has no experience with death

727
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,860
<33-7,House>要么就是经历了太多
<33-7,House>or too much,

728
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,500
<33-7,House>我确信不是前者
<33-7,House>and I'm pretty sure it's not the former.

729
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,740
<33-7,House>奇斯说让父母抱着孩子
<33-7,House>Chase told me about that idea you had:

730
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,060
<33-7,House>是你的主意
<33-7,House>the parents holding the baby.

731
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,330
<33-7,House>你怎么想到的
<33-7,House>Where'd you get that?

732
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,590
<33-7,House>你是不是失去过某人
<33-7,House>Did you lose someone?

733
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,780
<33-7,House>一个孩子吗
<33-7,House>Did you lose a baby?

734
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,380
<33-8,Cameron>你真是个混蛋
<33-8,Cameron>You can be a real bastard.

735
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,990
<34-1,Wilson>还没完吗
<34-1,Wilson>Unfinished business?

736
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,290
<34-2,House>我很迷茫
<34-2,House>I'm in the haystack.

737
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,210
<34-3,Wilson>因为你知道你是在大海捞针
<34-3,Wilson>Ah, because now you know you're looking for a needle.

738
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,790
<34-4,House>是的
<34-4,House>Right.

739
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,440
<34-5,Wilson>即便我说"随它去吧"
<34-5,Wilson>If I tell you to "Let it go,"

740
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,610
<34-5,Wilson>也没什么用吧
<34-5,Wilson>it won't make any difference, will it?

741
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,580
<34-6,House>肠道病毒通过人体传播
<34-6,House>Enteroviruses are spread by humans.

742
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,590
<34-6,House>通常是粪便或者唾液
<34-6,House>Fecal, oral usually...

743
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,810
<34-6,House>也可能是呼吸道分泌物
<34-6,House>could be respiratory secretions, though.

744
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,690
<34-7,Wilson>因此卡迪取了全院职工的粪便样本
<34-7,Wilson>So, Cuddy got stool samples from the whole staff.

745
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,560
<34-7,Wilson>现在只等化验结果
<34-7,Wilson>Just wait until they come back.

746
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,990
<34-9,Wilson>-没用的  -为什么
<34-9,Wilson>- That won't do it.  - Why not?

747
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,020
<34-10,House>无论传播者是谁
<34-10,House>The shedder, whoever he is,

748
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,870
<34-10,House>他都应该极具毒性  会伴随有一些症状
<34-10,House>is so virulent, he must have been symptomatic.

749
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,210
<34-10,House>卡迪会注意到他的
<34-10,House>Cuddy would have noticed him.

750
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,680
<34-12,House>况且普通职工也无法触及这些孩子
<34-12,House>And the babies didn't share any common personnel.

751
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,130
<34-13,Wilson>这就是诡异之处
<34-13,Wilson>That's what's weird.

752
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,800
<34-13,Wilson>是啊  是啊  真的很诡异
<34-13,Wilson>Yeah, yeah. That's what's weird.

753
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,230
<34-14,Old woman>有事吗
<34-14,Old woman>Can I help you?

754
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,170
<35-1,Soap patient>你救了我一命
<35-1,Soap patient>You saved my life.

755
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,240
<35-2,Soap doctor>我只是帮你做了些检查而已
<35-2,Soap doctor>I just ran some tests.

756
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,290
<35-2,Soap doctor>是你的求生意志救了你
<35-2,Soap doctor>Your will and determination are what saved your life.

757
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,360
<35-3,Soap patient>我知道我是谁
<35-3,Soap patient>I know who I am now.

758
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,600
<35-4,Soap doctor>是的
<35-4,Soap doctor>Yes, you do.

759
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,030
<35-4,Soap doctor>我也清楚自己的身份
<35-4,Soap doctor>And I know who I am as well.

760
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,360
<35-5,Lim>说真的  你不该待在这里
<35-5,Lim>Hey, seriously, man, you're not supposed to be here.

761
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,970
<35-6,House>我在演习如何接生
<35-6,House>I'm performing a delivery.

762
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,630
<35-7,Kubisak>你帮人接生吗
<35-7,Kubisak>You are.

763
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
<35-8,House>我接手了病人的产前护理
<35-8,House>Patient whose prenatal care I've been handling.

764
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,020
<35-8,House>几分钟前她刚离开医院
<35-8,House>Just checking her out a couple of minutes ago.

765
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,940
<35-8,House>当然接生时我需要你们中的一人协助我
<35-8,House>Of course, I'll need one of you two guys to supervise.

766
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,880
<35-9,Lim>她的预产期是什么时候
<35-9,Lim>When's she due?

767
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,240
<35-10,House>三月底
<35-10,House>Late March.

768
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,300
<35-11,Kubisak>那是五个月以后
<35-11,Kubisak>That's five months from now.

769
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,320
<35-12,House>幸亏这些椅子够舒服
<35-12,House>Thank God these chairs are comfortable.
