<11-1,DERAN>You're not testing it,you're not fixing it?

232
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,390
<11-2,FOREMAN>你女儿的脉管系统血液充盈
<11-2,FOREMAN>Your daughter's vascular system,is engorged with blood.

233
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,290
<11-2,FOREMAN>放一些血降低中风发作的机率
<11-2,FOREMAN>Draining some reduces,the chances of another stroke.

234
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,890
<11-2,FOREMAN>同时给她用药
<11-2,FOREMAN>We're also starting her on a drug

235
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,290
<11-2,FOREMAN>抑制红细胞生成 就不用一直放血了
<11-2,FOREMAN>that suppresses the production of red cells,so we don't have to keep doing this.

236
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,390
<11-2,FOREMAN>她完全恢复的机会很大
<11-2,FOREMAN>Good chance she'll make a full recovery.

<12-3,CHASE>Why'd you take the flower?,Why'd you kiss him?

<12-4,CAMERON>他做的事很可爱
<12-4,CAMERON>He did something sweet.

247

<12-5,CHASE>- 花是偷来的,- 他只有八岁
<12-5,CHASE>- He stole flowers.,- He's eight.

248
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,990
<12-7,CHASE>你想让我心生嫉妒
<12-7,CHASE>You were trying to make me jealous.

<12-8,CAMERON>还弄得我要结束这段关系
<12-8,CAMERON>And it caused me to end our relationship.

252
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,090
<12-9,CHASE>你这是纵容小贼
<12-9,CHASE>You're enabling a thief.

253
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,990
<12-9,CHASE>少年犯
<12-9,CHASE>And a delinquent.

254
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,390
<12-9,CHASE>学校通知
<12-9,CHASE>Letters from school.

255

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,990
<12-9,CHASE>男人不坏女人不爱
<12-9,CHASE>The bad boy is hard to resist.

258
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,790
<12-10,CAMERON>只是单相思 没害处的
<12-10,CAMERON>It's a crush.It's harmless.

259
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,090
<12-12,CAMERON>- 没这么简单,- 你真让我获益良多
<12-12,CAMERON>- It's never harmless.,- So I'm learning.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,990
<12-13,CHASE>所以我们就这样了?
<12-13,CHASE>So this is us now?

261
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,790
<12-13,CHASE>相互攻击?
<12-13,CHASE>We snipe at each other?

262
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,590
<12-14,CAMERON>我没有在找碴 我在找通风口
<12-14,CAMERON>I'm not sniping,,I'm looking for a vent.

263
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,790
<12-14,CAMERON>她的房间正好建在垃圾堆上
<12-14,CAMERON>Her room's directly above the garage.

264
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,490
<12-14,CAMERON>底下有很多一氧化碳气源
<12-14,CAMERON>There's all sorts of co sources down there.

265
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,490
<12-14,CAMERON>找到一个通风口
<12-14,CAMERON>I found a vent.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,490
<12-14,CAMERON>里面好像有东西
<12-14,CAMERON>I think there's something in it.

267
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,590
<12-15,CHASE>这不对劲
<12-15,CHASE>This isn't right.

268
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,990
<12-15,CHASE>你把我甩了 生气的不该是你
<12-15,CHASE>You dumped me.,You don't get to be mad.

269
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,290
<12-16,CAMERON>我们在一起确实感觉不错
<12-16,CAMERON>We had a really good thing.

270
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,590
<12-16,CAMERON>是你坏了规则 惹我生气了
<12-16,CAMERON>You broke the rules.I'm angry.

271
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,890
<12-16,CAMERON>我会平复的
<12-16,CAMERON>I'll get over it.

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,790
<13-1,CAMERON>她被虐待
<13-1,CAMERON>She's being abused.

273
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,790
<13-2,FOREMAN>带血的T恤不等于虐待
<13-2,FOREMAN>a bloody t-shirt doesn't equal abuse.

274
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,090
<13-2,FOREMAN>小孩常常会受伤的
<13-2,FOREMAN>Kids get hurt all the time.

275
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,190
<13-3,CHASE>这么多血?
<13-3,CHASE>That amount of blood?

276
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,390
<13-4,FOREMAN>哦 见鬼
<13-4,FOREMAN>Oh, crap.

277
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,490
<13-4,FOREMAN>你们两个又一条心了
<13-4,FOREMAN>You two are agreeing again.

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,090
<13-5,CAMERON>父亲被繁重的工作压垮,妻子去年又过世了
<13-5,CAMERON>Father's overwhelmed.Hectic job,,his wife passed away last year.

279
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,790
<13-5,CAMERON>他很容易发泄在孩子头上
<13-5,CAMERON>He could easily be taking it,out on the kids.

280
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,890
<13-6,FOREMAN>又或者是孩子流鼻血 抓了件T恤来擦
<13-6,FOREMAN>Or she had a nose bleed and,grabbed a t-shirt.

281
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,590
<13-7,CHASE>她觉得流鼻血太丢人
<13-7,CHASE>she's so ashamed of a nosebleed

282
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,090
<13-7,CHASE>硬是要把衣服藏在床下的通风口
<13-7,CHASE>she has to hide the evidence,in a vent under her bed.

283
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,990
<13-8,CAMERON>她与外界隔离 哥哥一直是个麻烦鬼
<13-8,CAMERON>She's socially isolated,,the brother's always in trouble.

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,990
<13-8,CAMERON>典型的标志
<13-8,CAMERON>It's classic signs.

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,290
<13-9,FOREMAN>但是没有体征,身体没有伤痕 没有任何瘀伤
<13-9,FOREMAN>But no physical signs.,No marks on her body.No bruises at all.

286
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,990
<13-10,CAMERON>也许是性侵犯?
<13-10,CAMERON>What if it's sexual?

287
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,990
<13-10,CAMERON>应该打电话给社会福利署
<13-10,CAMERON>We should call social services.

288
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,290
<13-11,HOUSE>唉 糟透了
<13-11,HOUSE>Well, this sucks.

289
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,290
<13-11,HOUSE>这或是虐待 或者不是
<13-11,HOUSE>Either it's abuse or it's not abuse.

290
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,790
<13-11,HOUSE>或者是一种症状 或者完全无关
<13-11,HOUSE>Which means either it's a symptom,or it's completely irrelevant.

291
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,890
<13-11,HOUSE>无论哪种情况 都得费个半天搞清楚
<13-11,HOUSE>Either way,we gotta waste half a day,figuring out which.

292
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,690
<13-11,HOUSE>全面身体检查
<13-11,HOUSE>Full physical exam.

293
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,090
<13-11,HOUSE>查一下可能遗漏的瘀伤
<13-11,HOUSE>Look for bruises we may have missed.

294
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,590
<13-11,HOUSE>检查口腔 做阴道检查
<13-11,HOUSE>Check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.

295
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,290
<13-12,CHASE>没有父亲同意,不能对六岁孩子做阴道检查
<13-12,CHASE>We can't do a vaginal exam on a,six-year-old without the dad's consent.

296
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,790
<13-12,CHASE>如果是他施虐 绝无可能同意
<13-12,CHASE>And if he's abusing her,,he'll never say yes.

297
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,490
<13-13,HOUSE>世事无绝对
<13-13,HOUSE>Never is just "reven" spelled backwards.

298
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,190
<14-1,FOREMAN>你虐待过你女儿吗?
<14-1,FOREMAN>Have you been abusing your daughter?

299
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,590
<14-2,DERAN>什么 你怎么会...
<14-2,DERAN>What?Why would you...

300
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,190
<14-3,FOREMAN>这是在她床下的通风口找到的
<14-3,FOREMAN>we found this hidden in a vent under her bed.

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,490
<14-4,DERAN>我对此一无所知
<14-4,DERAN>I don't know anything about this.

302
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,990
<14-4,DERAN>也许是流鼻血
<14-4,DERAN>Maybe she had a bloody nose.

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,590
<14-5,FOREMAN>我们需要检查她是否受过虐待
<14-5,FOREMAN>We need to examine her for abuse.

304
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,690
<14-6,DERAN>不是真的以为我...
<14-6,DERAN>You can't really think I...

305
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,190
<14-7,FOREMAN>也许是你 或是学校的流氓,变态的邻居
<14-7,FOREMAN>maybe you,maybe the school bully,,maybe the creepy neighbor.

306
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,090
<14-7,FOREMAN>总之你没有尽责
<14-7,FOREMAN>I'm guessing you're not paying as,much attention as you should be.

307
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,690
<14-7,FOREMAN>你都不知道你儿子现在在哪?
<14-7,FOREMAN>You even know where your son is right now?

308
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,690
<14-8,DERAN>他在这里 一分钟前还在的
<14-8,DERAN>Yeah, he was here just...here a minute ago.

309
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,890
<14-8,DERAN>她没有被虐待
<14-8,DERAN>She isn't being abused.

310
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,190
<14-9,FOREMAN>很遗憾 这回答不能让人信服
<14-9,FOREMAN>Unfortunately, that answer doesn't help me.

311
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,490
<14-9,FOREMAN>如果你虐待过她 自然会撒谎的
<14-9,FOREMAN>If you have abused her,,you're obviously gonna lie about it.

312
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,790
<14-10,DERAN>我没有说谎!
<14-10,DERAN>I'm not lying!

313
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,190
<14-11,FOREMAN>- 我们需要做阴道检查,- 不行
<14-11,FOREMAN>- We need to do a vaginal exam.,- No,

314
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,290
<14-12,DERAN>她快要死了 还不能说话,而你们还在这种事情上浪费时间?
<14-12,DERAN>she may be dying,she still can't talk,,and you're gonna waste your time with this?

315
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,790
<14-13,FOREMAN>你同意了 我们就花几小时做检查
<14-13,FOREMAN>You consent,and we waste a,few hours doing the exam,

316
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,490
<14-13,FOREMAN>如果你拒绝 我就叫社会福利署的人来
<14-13,FOREMAN>or you refuse and I call social services.

317
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,790
<14-13,FOREMAN>他们会花三天调查
<14-13,FOREMAN>And they waste three days,doing the investigation

318
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,290
<14-13,FOREMAN>最后他们还是要做这个检查
<14-13,FOREMAN>which ends with them doing the exam anyway.

319
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,890
<15-1,CAMERON>张大嘴巴 我要看里面
<15-1,CAMERON>I'm gonna look inside your mouth.,Open wide.

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,290
<15-1,CAMERON>接下来要检查胸和背 可以么?
<15-1,CAMERON>I need to look at your chest,and your back next, okay?

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,090
<15-1,CAMERON>我知道你不能讲话,如果害怕了就示意我停下
<15-1,CAMERON>I know you can't talk so,stop me if you get scared.

322
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,490
<15-1,CAMERON>入院前 有人伤害过你么?
<15-1,CAMERON>Before you came here,,did anyone hurt you?

323
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,490
<15-1,CAMERON>让你流血?
<15-1,CAMERON>Make you bleed?

324
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,490
<15-1,CAMERON>现在我要检查你的阴道,能谅解么?
<15-1,CAMERON>I need to look in your vagina now.,Do you understand?

325
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,390
<15-1,CAMERON>我是医生 所以没有关系的 好么?
<15-1,CAMERON>I'm a doctor,so it's okay, all right?

326
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,990
<15-1,CAMERON>屈膝 脚踝并拢
<15-1,CAMERON>Bend your knees,keep your ankles together.

327
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,390
<15-1,CAMERON>膝盖侧向一边 可以么?
<15-1,CAMERON>And just let your knees fall,to the side, okay?

328
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,590
<15-1,CAMERON>哦 天哪
<15-1,CAMERON>Oh, my god.

329
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,890
<15-1,CAMERON>生殖器区尽是割伤
<15-1,CAMERON>She has cuts all over her,genital area.Like slices.

330
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,990
<16-1,CAMERON>一些差不多愈合了 一些是新的
<16-1,CAMERON>Some are almost healed,but some are new.

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,190
<16-2,CHASE>可能是她自己弄得
<16-2,CHASE>She could be doing it to herself.

332
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,790
<16-3,FOREMAN>她太小 不会割伤自己的
<16-3,FOREMAN>She's a little young to be cutting.

333
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,490
<16-4,CHASE>她太小 不会中风
<16-4,CHASE>She's a little young for a stroke.

334
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,290
<16-4,CHASE>抑郁解释了割伤
<16-4,CHASE>Depression accounts for the cuts.

335
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,990
<16-4,CHASE>性侵犯解释了抑郁
<16-4,CHASE>Molestation accounts for the depression.

336
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,690
<16-5,FOREMAN>割伤能解释这么多血吗?
<16-5,FOREMAN>But do the cuts account for all that blood?

337
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,690
<16-6,CAMERON>伤口不够深
<16-6,CAMERON>They weren't deep enough.

338
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,390
<16-7,CHASE>就是说她被割伤了 却并非出血的原因?
<16-7,CHASE>So she's getting cut,,but that's not the source of the blood?

339
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,690
<16-8,FOREMAN>很可能是强行侵入
<16-8,FOREMAN>The other obvious source is,forcible penetration.

340

598
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,220

<30-4,CAMERON>肯定是脑垂体瘤
<30-4,CAMERON>It's gotta be a pituitary adenoma.

<30-5,HOUSE>这是完全能说通

<30-6,CAMERON>没扫描到不代表没有
<30-6,CAMERON>Just because we haven't found anything,on the scan doesn't mean it's not there

616
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,760
<30-6,CAMERON>该切除她的脑垂腺
<30-6,CAMERON>You should remove her pituitary gland.

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,100
<30-7,HOUSE>兄妹两个 同样的症状

<30-8,CHASE>yes,and that would make complete sense,if there was anything in her environment.

621
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,200
<30-9,HOUSE>只因还没有找到
<30-9,HOUSE>That's 'cause we haven't found anything yet.
