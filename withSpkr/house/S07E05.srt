56
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,370
<1-24,Justine>我不听清楚

62
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,850
<1-27,Abbey>为什么没人理我
<1-27,Abbey>Why doesn't someone talk to me?

63
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,540
<2-1,House>取消你们的晚餐计划
<2-1,House>Cancel your dinner plans.

64
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,830
<2-1,House>病史很短  她只有8个小时大
<2-1,House>Short on medical history. She's only eight hours old.

65
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,160
<2-1,House>虽然她不缺大夫
<2-1,House>What she's not short on is doctors.

66
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,030
<2-1,House>但可惜的是  没有一个医生
<2-1,House>Unfortunately, none of them

67
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,830
<2-1,House>可以解决她的呼吸问题
<2-1,House>have been able to solve her breathing problems.

<2-3,Taub>足月妊娠  而且之前用过表面活性剂
<2-3,Taub>Full term, and they gave her surfactant.

70
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,770
<2-3,Taub>似乎发育很完善
<2-3,Taub>Looks like they're fully developed.

71
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,010
<2-4,Cuddy>借一步说话

<2-9,House>麻烦大了
<2-9,House>Oh, you've really got a problem.

80
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,160
<2-10,Cuddy>要是有个成年人在这么十万火急的时候
<2-10,Cuddy>If only there were some mature adult in my life

<2-11,House>裸体小丑们正找我有事呢
<2-11,House>on my back issues of Nudist Circus.

<2-11,House>You should see what the fat lady's got

85
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,540
<2-11,House>都干了些什么
<2-11,House>under her big top.

86
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
<2-12,Cuddy>我只是要找个人顶一下
<2-12,Cuddy>All I need is a warm body.

87
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,740
<2-12,Cuddy>她基本很快就会睡着的
<2-12,Cuddy>She'll be asleep the entire time.

<2-15,House>不如等你回来的时候给我点甜头如何
<2-15,House>How about a little something extra when you get home?

92
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,750
<2-16,Cuddy>我可不会用肉体来和你讨价还价
<2-16,Cuddy>I'm not bargaining sex for babysitting.

93
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,950
<2-16,Cuddy>除此之外  你还欠我的
<2-16,Cuddy>Besides, you owe me.

94
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,650
<2-17,House>-欠你什么  -性别
<2-17,House>- For what?  - Sex.

95
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,550
<2-18,Cuddy>办公室里我还是没有看到女医生
<2-18,Cuddy>I still don't see a female doctor in that room.

96
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,490
<2-18,Cuddy>这样我会很不爽
<2-18,Cuddy>It's making me very unhappy.

97
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,490
<2-19,House>好吧  我就昧着良心干一回
<2-19,House>Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart,

98
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,960
<2-19,House>好让你高兴
<2-19,House>which will make you happy,

99
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,430
<2-19,House>好让你更需要我
<2-19,House>which will make you desire me more,

100
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,800
<2-19,House>那会转化为更猛烈的爱欲
<2-19,House>which will turn into more sex.

101
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,430
<2-20,Cuddy>7点准时到我家
<2-20,Cuddy>Be at my place at 7:00.

102
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,310
<2-21,Taub>捐精卡上并未标注
<2-21,Taub>The sperm donor card from the father

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,110
<2-21,Taub>婴儿的父亲有哮喘史
<2-21,Taub>did note a history of asthma.

104
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,210
<2-22,House>如果肺部症状的原因不是出在肺上呢
<2-22,House>What if her lung problems are not coming from her lungs?

105
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
<2-23,Foreman>心脏看上去没什么问题
<2-23,Foreman>Her heart looks fine.

106
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,520
<2-24,Chase>她的肝转移酶指标升高了
<2-24,Chase>Her liver enzymes are elevated.

107
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,520
<2-25,House>肝脏衰竭的时候  肝脏就停止制造蛋白了
<2-25,House>When the liver fails, it stops producing proteins.

108
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,860
<2-25,House>尤其是那些可以保证血浆限制在血管内
<2-25,House>Specifically the ones that keep your plasma

109
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,330
<2-25,House>而不是跑到肺里的那些蛋白质
<2-25,House>inside your blood vessels and outside your lungs.

110
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,360
<2-25,House>修复肝功能  她就能呼吸顺畅到
<2-25,House>Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath

111
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,930
<2-25,House>让整个病房兴奋一整夜了
<2-25,House>to keep the entire ward up all night.

112
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,940
<2-25,House>福曼  你被留堂了
<2-25,House>Foreman, you need to stay after school.

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,410
<2-25,House>我似乎应该道歉
<2-25,House>I apparently need to apologize.

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,450
<2-25,House>上周  我不该跳过你
<2-25,House>Last week, I should not have gone over your head

115
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,280
<2-25,House>就让奇斯去雇新人
<2-25,House>and allowed Chase to hire a new team member.

116
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,490
<2-25,House>你去雇个廊桥遗梦的女主角来吧
<2-25,House>So go hire someone who liked The Bridges of Madison County.

117
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,820
<2-26,Foreman>你是想让我雇个白人女孩吗
<2-26,Foreman>Do you want me to hire a white girl?

118
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,520
<2-27,House>找个女人来
<2-27,House>Go find a woman,

119
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,230
<2-27,House>把你自鸣得意的笑容收起来
<2-27,House>and wipe that self-satisfied grin off your face.

120
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,390
<2-28,Foreman>很快就好
<2-28,Foreman>This'll be quick.

121
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,830
<2-28,Foreman>我一整周都在面试
<2-28,Foreman>I've been interviewing people all week.

<2-28,Foreman>已经筛选到了两位候选人
<2-28,Foreman>I have it narrowed down to two candidates.

123
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,530

<2-29,House>Well, narrow it down to one

124
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,730
<2-29,House>只要赶在卡迪拿性别说事之前就可以
<2-29,House>before Cuddy starts withholding sex.

125
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,040
<2-30,Foreman>她没有和我提过这事啊
<2-30,Foreman>Uh, she hasn't said anything to me about that.

126
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,370
<2-31,House>我说了  别得意了

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,560
<3-4,House>回床上去
<3-4,House>Go back to bed.

142
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,240
<3-4,House>我说了  回床上去
<3-4,House>I said bed!

143
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,480
<3-5,House>威尔森  想来个男孩狂欢夜吗
<3-5,House>Wilson, hey. You up for a boys' night in?

144
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,290
<4-1,Taub>信不信由你  呼吸问题
<4-1,Taub>Believe it or not, breathing problems

145
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,220
<4-1,Taub>可以因肝脏问题引起
<4-1,Taub>can be caused by a liver problem.

146
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,890
<4-2,Abbey>那么她的肝脏怎么了
<4-2,Abbey>Then what's wrong with her liver?

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
<4-2,Abbey>或许是肝脓肿
<4-2,Abbey>Probably an abscess.

148
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,860
<4-3,Taub>如果超声能证实
<4-3,Taub>If we find it with the ultrasound,

149
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,460
<4-3,Taub>我们就可以抽干脓肿  她就好了
<4-3,Taub>we can drain it, make her better.

150
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,570
<4-3,Taub>到周末你就能带她出院回家了
<4-3,Taub>You'll be able to take her home by the end of the week.

151
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,830
<4-4,Justine>她在出血吗
<4-4,Justine>Is she bleeding?

152
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300
<4-5,Chase>那是静脉穿刺点渗出来的
<4-5,Chase>She's oozing from her IV site.

153
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,570
<4-5,Chase>这是肝衰竭的征状
<4-5,Chase>It's a symptom of liver failure.

154
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,000
<4-5,Chase>这证实了我们的猜测
<4-5,Chase>It's what we would expect to see.

155
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,510
<4-6,Foreman>程医生  我们需要备一个单位的血
<4-6,Foreman>Dr. Cheng, we might need a unit of blood over here.

156
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,140
<4-7,Taub>肝脏有回声区
<4-7,Taub>Echogenic area in the liver.

157
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,280
<4-7,Taub>你能标出来吗
<4-7,Taub>Can you make it out?

158
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,410
<4-8,Foreman>看上去似乎没有
<4-8,Foreman>Doesn't seem to have the thick walls

159
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,050
<4-8,Foreman>脓肿该有的厚壁
<4-8,Foreman>you'd expect from an abscess.

160
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,550
<4-9,Taub>抬高左肩  让我们看清楚点
<4-9,Taub>Lift her left shoulder so we can get a better look.

161
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,820
<4-10,Abbey>可以让我来吗  我还没有抱过她呢
<4-10,Abbey>Oh, can I do it? I haven't been able to hold her yet.

162
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,350
<4-10,Abbey>她身上接的管子和静脉通道太多了
<4-10,Abbey>Uh, she's hooked up to too many tubes and IVs.

163
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,820
<4-11,Abbey>至少让我献点血吧
<4-11,Abbey>Can I at least donate blood?

164
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,160
<4-11,Abbey>当然可以
<4-11,Abbey>Of course.

165
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,160
<4-12,Foreman>这儿完事后  我们就会给你抽血
<4-12,Foreman>We'll draw your blood and see if you're a match

166
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,690
<4-12,Foreman>看看血型配不配
<4-12,Foreman>as soon as we're done here.

167
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,990
<4-12,Foreman>那绝对不会是脓肿
<4-12,Foreman>That's definitely not an abscess.

168
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,930
<4-13,Chase>看上去像是扩张的胆管
<4-13,Chase>It looks like dilated bile ducts.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,270
<4-14,Abbey>什么意思
<4-14,Abbey>What does that mean?

170
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,000
<4-14,Abbey>我还能很快带她回家吗
<4-14,Abbey>Can I still take her home soon?

171
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,370
<5-1,Taub>的确是由肝脏引起的
<5-1,Taub>You were right about the liver.

172
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,540
<5-1,Taub>超声显示
<5-1,Taub>On ultrasound, we found

173
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,280
<5-1,Taub>有肝内胆管扩张
<5-1,Taub>intrahepatic dilated bile ducts.

174
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,860
<5-1,Taub>肝外胆管是正常的
<5-1,Taub>Extrahepatic ducts were normal.

175
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,270
<5-1,Taub>有梗阻性包块吗
<5-1,Taub>Are there any masses causing an obstruction?

176
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,850
<5-2,Taub>没有  你没事吧
<5-2,Taub>No. Are you okay?

177
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,160
<5-3,House>我只是说话温柔了点
<5-3,House>Just talking in a soothing voice.

178
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,190
<5-3,House>和你们没关系
<5-3,House>Not for your benefit.

179
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,190
<5-3,House>怎么了  让你们感觉很爽
<5-3,House>Why? Is it turning you on?

180
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
<5-4,Foreman>豪斯  我要介绍个新人你认识
<5-4,Foreman>House, there's someone here I need you to meet.

181
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,260
<5-4,Foreman>我刚刚雇了克里斯蒂娜·费莎大夫
<5-4,Foreman>I just hired Dr. Christina Fraser.

182
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,000
<5-4,Foreman>她有海外认证的
<5-4,Foreman>She's a board certified--

183
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,670
<5-5,House>很高兴认识你  你被开除了
<5-5,House>Nice to meet you. You're fired.

184
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,140
<5-5,House>什么
<5-5,House>What?

185
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,770
<5-6,Foreman>豪斯  你在开玩笑吧
<5-6,Foreman>House, you're kidding, right?

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,340
<5-6,Foreman>我详细调查过  她是这些人中最棒的
<5-6,Foreman>I've done my due diligence. She's the best there is.

187
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,480
<5-6,Foreman>我做了什么
<5-6,Foreman>What did I do?

188
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,780
<5-7,House>很不幸
<5-7,House>You had the misfortune

189
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,510
<5-7,House>你成了我用来教训福曼的工具
<5-7,House>to be the lesson that Foreman is learning.

190
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,750
<5-7,House>福曼自负的
<5-7,House>That whooshing sound

191
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,920
<5-7,House>小肺肺一定快气炸了
<5-7,House>is the air being let out of his ego.

192
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,990
<5-8,Foreman>你真是混蛋  豪斯
<5-8,Foreman>You are such an ass, House.

193
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,190
<5-8,Foreman>要整我换个法子
<5-8,Foreman>You could have made the same point

194
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,790
<5-8,Foreman>不要拿年轻医生的前途开玩笑
<5-8,Foreman>without crushing the hopes of a young doctor

195
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,790
<5-8,Foreman>她真的对这份工作满怀激情
<5-8,Foreman>who was actually excited to have this job.

196
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,200
<5-9,House>可我不确定我有没有激情
<5-9,House>No, I'm not sure I could have.

197
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,700
<5-9,House>我想你是太相信我了
<5-9,House>I think you give me far too much credit.

198
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,670
<5-9,House>陶博  轮到你去找一个年轻医生了
<5-9,House>Taub, it's your turn to find a young doctor

199
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,100
<5-9,House>要一个真的对这份工作满怀激情的
<5-9,House>who's actually excited to have this job.

200
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,510
<5-9,House>找来让你开除吗
<5-9,House>For you to fire?

201
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,540
<5-10,House>不会  除非你们想要这样
<5-10,House>Not until you or she earns it.

202
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,510
<5-10,House>胆管扩张可能是先天性的
<5-10,House>Dilated bile ducts could be congenital.

203
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,380
<5-11,Chase>也就意味着胆管内部狭窄
<5-11,Chase>That means that it's a stricture in the ducts themselves.

204
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,380
<5-11,Chase>卡罗里综合症[肝内胆管囊性扩张综合症]
<5-11,Chase>Caroli's syndrome.

205
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,850
<5-12,House>那么  给她开刀吧
<5-12,House>So, open her up.

206
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,880
<5-12,House>手术
<5-12,House>Surgery?

207
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,850
<5-13,Taub>这可是个有肝衰竭的新生儿
<5-13,Taub>This is a newborn with liver failure.

208
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,790
<5-13,Taub>她的每个穿刺点都在渗血
<5-13,Taub>She's oozing blood from every puncture site.

209
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,790
<5-13,Taub>给她开刀太危险了
<5-13,Taub>It's insanely risky to open her up.

210
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,430
<5-13,Taub>是的  不幸的是手术是唯一解决途径
<5-13,Taub>Yes. It's unfortunately also the only way to fix her.

211
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,330
<5-14,Wilson>用小小的手术刀给她来个小小的切口
<5-14,Wilson>So make teeny, tiny incisions with a really small scalpel.

212
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,030
<5-14,Wilson>我得挂了
<5-14,Wilson>Gotta go.

213
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,740
<5-14,Wilson>你说你已经买过单了
<5-14,Wilson>You told me you gave them your credit card.

214
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,470
<5-15,House>而你蠢到会相信我
<5-15,House>And you were dumb enough to believe me.

215
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,880
<5-15,House>卡迪70分钟后回来
<5-15,House>Cuddy'll be back in an hour and ten minutes.

216
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,580
<5-15,House>我65分钟后回来
<5-15,House>I'll be back in an hour and five.

217
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,380
<5-16,Wilson>不  你不能
<5-16,Wilson>Oh, no, you don't.

218
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,450
<5-17,House>我就这样
<5-17,House>Oh, yes, I do.

219
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,780
<5-18,Wilson>你不是要丢下宝宝吧
<5-18,Wilson>You're not gonna leave the kid?

220
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,320
<5-19,House>是的  因为和你不同
<5-19,House>Yes, I am, 'cause unlike you,

221
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,290
<5-19,House>我没什么良心
<5-19,House>I don't have a conscience.

222
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,490
<5-20,Wilson>但和你不同的是
<5-20,Wilson>And unlike you,

223
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,720
<5-20,Wilson>我可没和卡迪嘿咻
<5-20,Wilson>I'm not having sex with Cuddy,

224
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,290
<5-20,Wilson>所以我才能走
<5-20,Wilson>so I actually can leave.

225
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,560
<5-20,Wilson>你在唬我
<5-20,Wilson>You're bluffing.

226
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,830
<5-21,Wilson>我要走了
<5-21,Wilson>I'm leaving.

227
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,960
<5-21,Wilson>你不能丢下一个不满两岁的孩子不管
<5-21,Wilson>You're not gonna leave a two-year-old unattended.

228
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,960
<5-22,House>我能啊  我把她留给你了
<5-22,House>True. I'm leaving her with you.

229
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,330
<5-22,House>一个有责任感的成年人
<5-22,House>A responsible adult.

230
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,240
<5-23,Wilson>你最好回屋里去
<5-23,Wilson>Better get back in there.

231
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,010
<5-23,Wilson>孩子一个人呢
<5-23,Wilson>Kid's all alone.

232
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,310
<5-24,House>你不觉得心烦吗
<5-24,House>It's kind of bugging you, isn't it?

233
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,380
<5-25,Wilson>和我没关系
<5-25,Wilson>Not my problem.

234
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,710
<5-26,House>客观来讲
<5-26,House>Well, since, objectively,

235
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,550
<5-26,House>你比我更在乎一个孤独的小孩
<5-26,House>you care more about leaving a child alone than I do,

236
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,720
<5-26,House>你会想照顾她
<5-26,House>it kind of is.

237
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,980
<5-27,Wilson>客观地说  我没有揽过这活
<5-27,Wilson>Objectively, since I never accepted this responsibility,

238
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,080
<5-27,Wilson>我不会管的
<5-27,Wilson>it kind of isn't.

239
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,700
<5-28,House>没错  但你还是会留下  本性难改
<5-28,House>True, and yet it is. Because you're you.

240
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,530
<5-29,House>我要走了
<5-29,House>I'm leaving.

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
<5-29,House>是我要走了
<5-29,House>I'm leaving.

242
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,400
<5-31,House>你不会走的  你做不到
<5-31,House>You're not gonna leave. You can't.

243
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,980
<5-31,House>算你狠
<5-31,House>Fine.

244
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,510
<5-32,Wilson>你说对了
<5-32,Wilson>You're right.

245
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,050
<5-32,Wilson>知道我会怎么做吗
<5-32,Wilson>You know what I can do?

246
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
<5-32,Wilson>我会进屋  然后打电话叫个顾婴服务
<5-32,Wilson>I can go in there and call a babysitting service

247
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,890
<5-32,Wilson>每小时15块  再给卡迪打电话
<5-32,Wilson>for 15 bucks an hour, then call Cuddy

248
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,290
<5-32,Wilson>告诉她谁在看孩子  还有原因
<5-32,Wilson>and tell her who's watching her kid and why.

249
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,030
<5-33,House>你留下  我就不走
<5-33,House>I'll stay if you stay.

250
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,240
<6-1,Wilson>咱们只离开了两分钟啊
<6-1,Wilson>We were gone two minutes.

251
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,610
<6-2,House>你嘴里是什么  甜心
<6-2,House>What have you got there, sweetie?

252
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,350
<6-3,House>来  吐出来
<6-3,House>Come on now, spit it out.

253
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,280
<6-4,Wilson>来  甜心  张嘴
<6-4,Wilson>Come on, sweetie. Open.

254
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,960
<6-5,Wilson>张嘴
<6-5,Wilson>Open.

255
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,310
<6-6,House>瑞秋  你吃了几枚硬币
<6-6,House>Rachel, how many coins did you eat?

256
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,510
<7-1,Chase>隔离胆总管
<7-1,Chase>Isolating the common bile duct.

257
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,440
<7-2,Taub>插入套管末端
<7-2,Taub>And mobilizing the distal end for cannulation.

258
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,010
<7-3,Foreman>血压降到50了
<7-3,Foreman>Bp is down to 50 systolic.

259
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,880
<7-3,Foreman>你得停止插套管了
<7-3,Foreman>You've got to stop the cannulation.

260
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,710
<7-4,Taub>我还没开始
<7-4,Taub>I haven't started yet.

261
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,820
<7-5,Cheng>给她注射一剂肾上腺素
<7-5,Cheng>Hit her with a bolus of phenylephrine.

262
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,370
<7-5,Cheng>这样可以有足够时间插入胆管
<7-5,Cheng>That should buy us enough time to get in the bile ducts.

263
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,220
<7-6,Foreman>血压升起来了  70
<7-6,Foreman>BP is rising. 70 systolic.

264
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,660
<7-7,Taub>很好  进入总胆管了
<7-7,Taub>Nice. I'm in the common bile duct.

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,360
<7-8,Cheng>接下来插入胆囊管
<7-8,Cheng>Advancing past the cystic duct.

266
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,130
<7-8,Cheng>目前为止还没有狭窄或堵塞
<7-8,Cheng>No strictures or blockages so far.

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,260
<7-9,Foreman>血压又下降了
<7-9,Foreman>BP is dropping again.

268
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,460
<7-10,Chase>要再注射一剂肾上腺素吗
<7-10,Chase>Another bolus of phenylephrine.

269
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,150
<7-11,Cheng>不能再注射了
<7-11,Cheng>She can't take more.

270
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,400
<7-11,Cheng>第一剂还在起作用
<7-11,Cheng>The first bolu is still doing the effect.

271
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,430
<7-11,Cheng>血压仍在下降
<7-11,Cheng>BP is still dropping.

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
<7-12,Taub>我们得取出管子了  手术中止
<7-12,Taub>We've got to pull out. We're done.

273
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,240
<7-12,Taub>我都差不多插进去了
<7-12,Taub>I was barely in.

274
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,230
<7-12,Taub>这说不通啊
<7-12,Taub>This doesn't make sense.

275
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,010
<7-13,Foreman>光是肝脏问题
<7-13,Foreman>The liver problem alone

276
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,540
<7-13,Foreman>是不会影响婴儿的血压的
<7-13,Foreman>is not gonna mess with the baby's BP.

277
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,310
<7-13,Foreman>不管是什么问题  肯定影响心脏了
<7-13,Foreman>Whatever this is, it's got to be affecting her heart.

278
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
<7-14,Chase>心脏和肝脏
<7-14,Chase>Heart plus the liver.

279
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,880
<7-14,Chase>可能是结节状硬化
<7-14,Chase>Could be tuberous sclerosis.

280
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,510
<7-15,Foreman>或者是肝脏内的
<7-15,Foreman>Or it could be a vascular malformation

281
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,580
<7-15,Foreman>血管畸形  引起了这两个症状
<7-15,Foreman>in the liver, causing both problems.

282
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,380
<7-16,Taub>你们觉得程医生怎么样
<7-16,Taub>So what do you guys think of Dr. Cheng?

283
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,220
<7-17,Chase>治疗血管畸形最好的方法就是手术
<7-17,Chase>Best treatment for a vascular malformation is surgery.

284
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,460
<7-17,Chase>我觉得你老婆肯定不希望
<7-17,Chase>And I think your wife thinks

285
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,190
<7-17,Chase>你对程医生有想法
<7-17,Chase>you shouldn't think anything of Dr. Cheng.

286
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
<7-18,Foreman>不能做手术了
<7-18,Foreman>No surgery.

287
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,530
<7-18,Foreman>一个新生儿不能再承受一次手术了
<7-18,Foreman>A newborn baby can't handle another trip to the O.R.

288
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,960
<7-19,Taub>我不是说有想法
<7-19,Taub>I didn't mean think think.

289
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,370
<7-19,Taub>我是说聘用她的可能性
<7-19,Taub>I meant think as a potential hire.

290
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,440
<7-20,Chase>我们给孩子用类固醇
<7-20,Chase>What if we started the baby on steroids

291
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
<7-20,Chase>加上血管再生药物和多巴胺怎么样
<7-20,Chase>an anti-angiogenesis agent, and dopamine?

292
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,010
<7-21,Foreman>会和手术的效果一样的
<7-21,Foreman>Could work just as well as surgery.

293
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,110
<7-21,Foreman>关闭那些坏血管
<7-21,Foreman>Snap those bad blood vessels shut.

294
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,810
<7-21,Foreman>我打电话给豪斯确认一下
<7-21,Foreman>I'll call House to get approval.

295
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,950
<7-22,Taub>那  你耸肩是什么意思
<7-22,Taub>So, what was that shrug?

296
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,910
<7-22,Taub>是表示"程医生大概能行"
<7-22,Taub>A "Dr. Cheng could work" shrug?

297
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,380
<7-22,Taub>还是表示
<7-22,Taub>Or a "House is gonna crush you

298
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,220
<7-22,Taub>"豪斯会阻止你考虑她"
<7-22,Taub>for even considering her" shrug?

299
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,920
<7-22,Taub>你真混蛋
<7-22,Taub>You suck.

300
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,490
<7-23,Chase>豪斯会讨厌我们请的任何人
<7-23,Chase>House is gonna hate anyone we hire,

301
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,420
<7-23,Chase>因为他不想雇人
<7-23,Chase>because he doesn't want to hire anyone.

302
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,730
<7-24,Taub>那么你觉得我应该放弃?
<7-24,Taub>So you think I should abstain?

303
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,360
<7-24,Taub>把问题扔回给他?
<7-24,Taub>Just give the decision back to him?

304
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,460
<7-25,Chase>那他又会损你是个窝囊废
<7-25,Chase>Then he'll just mock you for being a wuss.

305
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,400
<7-25,Chase>你纠结吧
<7-25,Chase>You're screwed.

306
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,300
<7-26,Taub>除非豪斯觉得雇用她是他自己的主意
<7-26,Taub>Unless House feels like hiring her is his idea.

307
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,370
<7-27,Foreman>还是不接
<7-27,Foreman>Still not answering.

308
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,510
<7-27,Foreman>我们开始治疗吧
<7-27,Foreman>We should just start the treatment.

309
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,050
<7-27,Foreman>她开了袋中国食品
<7-27,Foreman>She opened up a Chinese food bag

310
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,350
<7-27,Foreman>然后吃了硬币
<7-27,Foreman>to eat money.

311
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,680
<7-27,Foreman>真白痴
<7-27,Foreman>What an idiot.

312
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,980
<8-1,Wilson>是的  你点了木须肉
<8-1,Wilson>Okay, you ordered the moo shoo pork

313
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,520
<8-1,Wilson>和宫保鸡丁外卖  没错吧
<8-1,Wilson>and the orange cashew chicken, right?

314
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,820
<8-2,House>我通常都点这两道菜
<8-2,House>Like I always order.

315
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,120
<8-2,House>你收拾完外面了吗
<8-2,House>Did you clean up in there?

316
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,260
<8-2,House>对  完美如初
<8-2,House>Yeah. It's good enough.

317
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,220
<8-2,House>所以  扣掉税
<8-2,House>Okay, so with tax,

318
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,890
<8-2,House>找零应该是68分
<8-2,House>the change should have been 68 cents.

319
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,460
<8-3,House>外面只有58分
<8-3,House>There's only 58 cents out there.

320
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,860
<8-3,House>丢了一角
<8-3,House>There's a dime missing.

321
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,800
<8-3,House>也可能是他少找你钱了
<8-3,House>Well, he could have shortchanged you.

322
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,740
<8-3,House>冰箱贴啥也没吸到
<8-3,House>Fridge magnet's not getting anything.

323
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
<8-4,Wilson>因为那不过是个冰箱贴
<8-4,Wilson>That's because it's a fridge magnet,

324
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,070
<8-4,Wilson>而且除非她吞了加拿大币
<8-4,Wilson>and unless she swallowed a Canadian dime,

325
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,040
<8-4,Wilson>一般硬币是没磁力的
<8-4,Wilson>it's not magnetic.

326
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,880
<8-4,Wilson>真的吗
<8-4,Wilson>Really?

327
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,240
<8-5,House>我说  小孩总是爱吞东西的  对吧
<8-5,House>I mean, kids swallow things all the time, right?

328
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,310
<8-5,House>她吞了一毛钱  会拉出来的
<8-5,House>I mean, she swallowed a dime, she poops it out.

329
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,710
<8-5,House>-她会没事的  -没错
<8-5,House>- She'll be fine.  - Absolutely.

330
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,050
<8-6,Wilson>除非硬币黏在肠壁上
<8-6,Wilson>Unless it gets stuck in her intestine

331
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,680
<8-6,Wilson>引起堵塞  她会因此死掉
<8-6,Wilson>and causes a blockage, which could kill her.

332
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,590
<8-6,Wilson>那可不太好
<8-6,Wilson>Then she won't be fine.

333
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,220
<8-7,Wilson>你必须告诉卡迪
<8-7,Wilson>You have to tell Cuddy.

334
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,190
<8-7,Wilson>那我就不好过了
<8-7,Wilson>Well, then I won't be fine.

335
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,490
<8-7,Wilson>如果你不告诉卡迪
<8-7,Wilson>If you don't tell Cuddy,

336
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,660
<8-7,Wilson>我会出去亲自告诉她
<8-7,Wilson>I will go out there and tell her myself.

337
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,400
<8-8,House>是吗  你要告诉她什么
<8-8,House>Yeah? What are you gonna tell her?

338
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,760
<8-8,House>难道说你把硬币放在外面
<8-8,House>Are you gonna tell her that you left coins out

339
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,530
<8-8,House>把孩子自己留在家吗
<8-8,House>and you left her child unsupervised?

340
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,970
<8-8,House>你别把这事赖在我头上
<8-8,House>Hey, hey, hey! You are not gonna pin this on me!

341
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,470
<8-8,House>瑞秋需要24小时观察
<8-8,House>Rachel needs to be monitored for 24 hours

342
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,810
<8-9,House >看那一毛钱会不会出来
<8-9,House >to see that the dime passes.

343
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,550
<8-9,House >你知道的  确保别让她死了
<8-9,House >You know, just to make sure she doesn't die.

344
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,110
<8-9,House >你怎么在教我做事的时候
<8-9,House >You're telling me to do the right thing

345
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,480
<8-9,House >自己在往窗户外爬
<8-9,House >while climbing out a window?

346
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,190
<8-10,Wilson>告诉她
<8-10,Wilson>Tell her!

347
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,700
<8-11,Cuddy>她醒过吗
<8-11,Cuddy>Did she wake up at all?

348
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,000
<8-12,House>醒过一次
<8-12,House>One time.

349
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,940
<8-13,Cuddy>她通常不这样啊  她没事吧
<8-13,Cuddy>That's not like her. Is she all right?

350
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,140
<8-14,House>她很好
<8-14,House>She's fine.

351
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,480
<8-14,House>我留下过夜怎么样
<8-14,House>How about I stay the night?

352
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,610
<8-14,House>你就能好好谢我了
<8-14,House>Then you can really thank me.

353
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,450
<8-15,Cuddy>我明天得早起
<8-15,Cuddy>I have to get up early.

354
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,460
<8-15,Cuddy>不能睡过头
<8-15,Cuddy>Won't be able to sleep in.

355
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,890
<8-16,House>我一向睡很沉
<8-16,House>I'm a deep sleeper.

356
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,170
<9-1,Taub>轮班了
<9-1,Taub>Round two.

357
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,430
<9-1,Taub>贾丝廷回家了吗
<9-1,Taub>Did Justine go home?

358
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,670
<9-2,Abbey>她说下楼几分钟
<9-2,Abbey>Said she was going downstairs for a few minutes.

359
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,710
<9-2,Abbey>已经过了几小时了
<9-2,Abbey>A few hours ago.

360
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,840
<9-3,Taub>你们俩很亲密吗
<9-3,Taub>So you two are close?

361
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,110
<9-4,Abbey>事实上比以前好多了
<9-4,Abbey>Well, it's been getting better actually.

362
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,050
<9-4,Abbey>至少她还在这栋楼里
<9-4,Abbey>At least she's here in the building.

363
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,610
<9-4,Abbey>对她来说很难了
<9-4,Abbey>That's pretty supportive for her.

364
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,720
<9-4,Abbey>怎么了
<9-4,Abbey>What is it?

365
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,790
<9-5,Taub>她变粉红色了
<9-5,Taub>She's pinker.

366
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,420
<9-6,Abbey>不好吗
<9-6,Abbey>Is that bad?

367
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,990
<9-7,Taub>很好
<9-7,Taub>That's good.

368
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,860
<9-7,Taub>非常好
<9-7,Taub>That's very good.

369
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,330
<9-8,Abbey>她怎么了
<9-8,Abbey>Was that her?

370
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,670
<9-9,Abbey>我能抱抱她吗
<9-9,Abbey>Can I hold her?

371
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,970
<9-10,Taub>我想你们都期盼许久了
<9-10,Taub>I think it's long overdue.

372
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,250
<9-11,Abbey>终于头一回抱上了
<9-11,Abbey>My first time. Finally.

373
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,090
<9-12,Justine>技术上讲  是第二次吧
<9-12,Justine>Technically, it's your second time.

374
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,320
<9-13,Abbey>我不是那意思
<9-13,Abbey>I didn't mean--

375
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,230
<9-14,Justine>我知道  妈妈
<9-14,Justine>I know, mom.

376
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,580
<10-1,Taub>看着像是血管畸形
<10-1,Taub>Looks like it was a vascular malformation.

377
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,910
<10-1,Taub>格罗根宝宝现在好些了
<10-1,Taub>The Grogan baby is better.

378
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,180
<9-5,Taub>不错嘛
<9-5,Taub>Nice job.

379
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,120
<9-6,Abbey>准备了哦  亲爱的
<9-6,Abbey>Okay, ready, honey.

380
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,220
<9-7,Taub>一动也不要动  屏住呼吸
<9-7,Taub>So stay very, very still and hold your breath.

381
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,290
<10-1,Taub>千万别动哦
<10-1,Taub>Don't move.

382
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,890
<10-2,Cheng>她动了  没一个听话的
<10-2,Cheng>She moved. They always move.

383
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,660
<10-3,Taub>有份很好的工作  作诊断
<10-3,Taub>It is a good job. Diagnostics.

384
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,300
<10-3,Taub>解答迷题  拯救生命
<10-3,Taub>Solve a mystery, save a life.

385
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,730
<10-3,Taub>但我想你可能更喜欢儿科
<10-3,Taub>But I suppose you're pretty attached to pediatrics?

386
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
<10-4,Cheng>不好意思  杨女士
<10-4,Cheng>I'm sorry, Ms. Young,

387
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,610
<10-4,Cheng>我想请您按住您女儿别动
<10-4,Cheng>but I'm gonna have to ask you to restrain your daughter.

388
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,970
<10-4,Cheng>现在这位妈妈肯定不乐意了
<10-4,Cheng>Now the mom's not gonna want to do it

389
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,070
<10-4,Cheng>她情愿
<10-4,Cheng>because she'd rather I just keep

390
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,280
<10-4,Cheng>我一直用话筒说她女儿
<10-4,Cheng>blasting her daughter with radiation.

391
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,110
<10-4,Cheng>你是在说
<10-4,Cheng>You're telling me

392
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,880
<10-4,Cheng>豪斯部门有个空缺职位吗
<10-4,Cheng>there's an opening in House's department?

393
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,120
<10-5,Taub>你有兴趣吗
<10-5,Taub>Would you be interested?

394
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,650
<10-6,Cheng>再没有小孩  再没有家长
<10-6,Cheng>No more kids, no more parents.

395
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,590
<10-6,Cheng>一次只有一个病例而非十七个
<10-6,Cheng>One case at a time instead of 17?

396
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,120
<10-6,Cheng>安排我面试吧
<10-6,Cheng>Set up the interview.

397
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,830
<10-7,Taub>可能你并不需要面试
<10-7,Taub>It's possible you won't need to interview.

398
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,870
<11-2,House>放松  我来
<11-2,House>Relax, I got this.

399
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,610
<11-3,Cuddy>谢了
<11-3,Cuddy>Oh, thanks.

400
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,630
<11-5,Cuddy>没事吧
<11-5,Cuddy>Is everything okay?

401
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,640
<11-6,House>没事  抱歉  我还是个新手
<11-6,House>Yeah, sorry, I'm just new to all this.

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,740
<11-7,Cuddy>要我帮你重设闹钟吗
<11-7,Cuddy>You want me to reset the alarm?

403
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,710
<11-8,House>老天  别
<11-8,House>God, no.

404
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,320
<11-8,House>案子尽在掌控
<11-8,House>Case is under control.

405
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,520
<11-8,House>我要睡个懒觉
<11-8,House>I'm sleeping in.

406
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,090
<11-9,Cuddy>你的老板真是大爱你啊
<11-9,Cuddy>Your boss must really like you.

407
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,130
<11-9,Cuddy>早啊  玛丽娜
<11-9,Cuddy>Hey, Marina.

408
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,360
<11-10,House>意粉在冰箱里  可以当午饭
<11-10,House>Pasta's in the fridge for lunch.

409
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,070
<11-10,House>你一大清早打给我电话
<11-10,House>I assume, since you're calling so early,

410
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,540
<11-10,House>我想是手术非常成功吧
<11-10,House>that the surgery was a rousing success.

411
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,410
<12-1,Foreman>你竟然还以为
<12-1,Foreman>And I assume, since you still think

412
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,840
<12-1,Foreman>我们真做手术了
<12-1,Foreman>we actually did the surgery,

413
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,430
<12-1,Foreman>我想你是有八小时没看过手机了吧
<12-1,Foreman>you haven't checked your messages in eight hours.

414
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,410
<12-1,Foreman>你在哪里
<12-1,Foreman>Where are you?

415
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,810
<12-2,House>我想这就是你们这些人
<12-2,House>I believe this is what your people term

416
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,080
<12-2,House>所谓的垃圾电话
<12-2,House>a poopie call.

417
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,980
<12-3,Foreman>那叫招妓电话
<12-3,Foreman>Uh, the word is Booty.

418
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,880
<12-4,House>我是不知道你们在干什么
<12-4,House>Well, I don't know what you're doing,

419
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,290
<12-4,House>但这就是个垃圾电话
<12-4,House>but this is a poopie call.

420
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,890
<12-4,House>不是卡罗里综合症
<12-4,House>It's not Caroli's syndrome.

421
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,390
<12-5,House>程医生找到
<12-5,House>Dr. Cheng spotted a--

422
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,890
<12-5,House>等等等等  你说什么
<12-5,House>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

423
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,430
<12-5,House>我知道有犹太人  黑人和鳄鱼猎人
<12-5,House>I know about the jew, the black, and the croc hunter,

425
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,260
<12-5,House>可我们什么时候带亚洲人玩了
<12-5,House>but when did we get our Asian persuasion on?

426
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,100
<12-6,Taub>程医生在新生儿重症监护病房参与这案子
<12-6,Taub>Dr. Cheng is the NICU attending on the case.

427
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,570
<12-6,Taub>她现在不在这里
<12-6,Taub>And she's not here.

428
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,740
<12-7,House>那我就是白费口舌了
<12-7,House>Well, then I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet.

429
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,540
<12-8,Taub>她在宝宝的肝脏
<12-8,Taub>She spotted a vascular malformation

430
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,670
<12-8,Taub>发现了血管畸形
<12-8,Taub>in the baby's liver.

431
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,870
<12-9,House>恭喜你
<12-9,House>Good call.

432
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,110
<12-9,House>没有你说的废话这就不是垃圾电话了
<12-9,House>Except for everything you just said.

433
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,110
<12-9,House>我们的病人不可能有血管畸形
<12-9,House>There's no way that our patient has a vascular malformation.

434
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,380
<12-10,Chase>你能根据不在场所收集的大量信息
<12-10,Chase>And you can tell that from the vast amount of information

435
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,620
<12-10,Chase>肯定的得到这一答案吗
<12-10,Chase>you've gleaned from not being here?

436
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
<12-11,House>要记住她急性腰部外伤性劳损程度
<12-11,House>Don't need to be there to remember

437
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,990
<12-11,House>是常人的三倍  不用我到场
<12-11,House>that the patient's A.L.T.S were three times normal.

438
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,790
<12-11,House>宝宝的肝损伤范围大得很
<12-11,House>The baby's liver damage is far too extensive.

439
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,520
<12-11,House>程医生就是个白痴
<12-11,House>Dr. Cheng's an idiot.

440
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,590
<12-12,Taub>公平起见  这不完全是她的主意
<12-12,Taub>In fairness, it wasn't completely her idea.

441
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,560
<12-12,Taub>主要是福曼的
<12-12,Taub>More of a Foreman kind of thing.

442
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,160
<12-13,House>那你就是个超级大白痴
<12-13,House>Well, then you're an even bigger idiot

443
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,530
<12-13,House>还想为她扯谎
<12-13,House>for trying to cover for her.

444
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,300
<12-14,Foreman>豪斯  我们按血管畸形进行治疗
<12-14,Foreman>House, we treated for a vascular malformation,

445
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,570
<12-14,Foreman>她确实好转了
<12-14,Foreman>and she got better.

446
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,600
<12-15,House>不  她没有
<12-15,House>No, she didn't.

447
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,940
<12-15,House>她再次病发时给我电话
<12-15,House>Call me when she crashes again.

448
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,610
<12-16,Taub>结果还不错
<12-16,Taub>That went well.

449
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
<12-16,Taub>有什么事吗
<12-16,Taub>Everything okay?

450
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,860
<13-1,Abbey>说吧  我认得这表情
<13-1,Abbey>Come on. I know that look.

451
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,860
<13-2,Justine>我只是不习惯看到你这样真情流露
<13-2,Justine>I'm just not used to seeing such emotion coming from you.

452
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,190
<13-3,Abbey>我刚生了孩子
<13-3,Abbey>I just gave birth.

453
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,930
<13-3,Abbey>整个母爱泛滥啊
<13-3,Abbey>I'm, like, one big vat of hormones right now.

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,430
<13-4,Justine>不只是荷尔蒙的关系  妈妈
<13-4,Justine>It's not just the hormones, mom.

455
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,080
<13-4,Justine>你对她很特别
<13-4,Justine>You're different with her.

456
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,840
<13-4,Justine>这样没事  很好  只是
<13-4,Justine>It's okay. It's good. It's just...

457
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,680
<13-4,Justine>我不禁要想  在我成长时
<13-4,Justine>I can't help thinking, where was this mom

458
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,940
<13-4,Justine>这样的妈妈在哪里
<13-4,Justine>when I was growing up?

459
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,650
<13-5,Abbey>我从没想过
<13-5,Abbey>Wow. I never realized you considered me

460
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,150
<13-5,Abbey>你认为我是个失败的母亲
<13-5,Abbey>such a failure as a mother.

461
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,120
<13-6,Justine>我不觉得你失败
<13-6,Justine>I don't consider you a failure.

462
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,620
<13-6,Justine>我只是
<13-6,Justine>I just--

463
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,990
<13-6,Justine>我从来不知道你还有充满母爱的一面
<13-6,Justine>I never knew that there was an alternative.

464
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,430
<13-6,Justine>我觉得她尿湿了
<13-6,Justine>Hmm. I think she feels wet.

465
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
<13-6,Justine>你能抱一下她吗
<13-6,Justine>Can you hold her a sec?

466
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,700
<13-7,Justine>我去拿片尿布
<13-7,Justine>I'm gonna grab a diaper.

467
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,170
<13-7,Justine>好的
<13-7,Justine>Okay.

468
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,510
<13-7,Justine>妈妈  不太对劲
<13-7,Justine>Mom, something's wrong.

469
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,350
<13-8,Abbey>护士  她又出血了
<13-8,Abbey>Oh! Nurse! She's bleeding again!

<14-1,Wilson>All right, she's in her office.

<14-1,Wilson>动作快点
<14-1,Wilson>Move fast.

472
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,620
<14-2,House>如果你看到她挪着丰满的屁股过来
<14-2,House>You see a double-wide tuchus coming this way,

473
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,820
<14-2,House>就跟姑娘似的叫吧
<14-2,House>you scream like a girl.

474
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,020
<14-3,Wilson>如果瑞秋醒了
<14-3,Wilson>If Rachel wakes up,

475
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,560
<14-3,Wilson>她会一五一十的告诉卡迪的
<14-3,Wilson>she's gonna tell Cuddy everything.

476
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,860
<14-4,House>她才两岁
<14-4,House>She's two.

477
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,330
<14-4,House>昨晚她一直在哭诉
<14-4,House>Last night, she was whining

478
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,100
<14-4,House>她窗口外的大麋鹿
<14-4,House>about the giant moose that lives outside her window.

479

<15-12,House>不对  等等  惊讶的是你才对
<15-12,House>Oh, no, wait a minute. That's you.

497
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,700
<15-13,Taub>没错  你就是个天才
<15-13,Taub>Yes. You're a genius.

498
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,600
<15-13,Taub>出血说明她的肝脏仍在衰竭
<15-13,Taub>The bleeding means her liver is still failing.

499
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,670
<15-13,Taub>不是血管畸形
<15-13,Taub>It's not a vascular malformation.

500
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,400
<15-14,Wilson>豪斯  过来看这个
<15-14,Wilson>House, come take a look at this.

501
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,970
<15-15,House>继续思考
<15-15,House>Hold that thought.

502
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,870
<15-16,Taub>豪斯  别  我需要你
<15-16,Taub>House, no! I need you!

503
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,610
<15-17,Wilson>刚通过回盲瓣
<15-17,Wilson>Just past the ileocecal valve.

504
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,540
<15-18,House>什么都没有
<15-18,House>It's nothing.

505
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,610
<15-18,House>只是个不规则的东西
<15-18,House>It's just an irregularity.

506
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,310
<15-19,Wilson>那是个一角硬币
<15-19,Wilson>It's a dime.

507
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,150
<15-20,House>也可能是一团空气
<15-20,House>Or a pocket of air.

508
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,820
<15-21,Wilson>是啊  还有富兰克林·罗斯福的头像在上面
<15-21,Wilson>Yeah, with FDR's face on it.

509
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,520
<15-22,House>那不是人头  是阴影
<15-22,House>That's not a face. It's a shadow.

510
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,620
<15-23,Wilson>豪斯  这东西就是个标准圆
<15-23,Wilson>House, the thing is perfectly round.

511
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,220
<15-24,House>移到边上看看
<15-24,House>Well, move the wand to the side.

512
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:09,090
<15-26,Wilson>-痒痒  -因为我是挠痒痒怪兽
<15-26,Wilson>- Tickles!  - That's because I'm the tickle monster.

513
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,000
<15-27,Wilson>我要继续挠你痒痒
<15-27,Wilson>Gonna tickle you even more!

514
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,070
<15-27,Wilson>看那个
<15-27,Wilson>Look at--look at that.

515
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,470
<15-28,House>需要做个X光检查来确认
<15-28,House>We need an X-ray to be sure.

516
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,170
<15-29,Wilson>好主意  尽管给她做无谓的放射吧
<15-29,Wilson>Great, just give her an unnecessary dose of radiation.

517
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
<15-29,Wilson>这就是一角硬币
<15-29,Wilson>It's a dime.

518
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,780
<15-30,Taub>豪斯  我知道你在里面
<15-30,Taub>House, I know you're in there.

519
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,050
<15-30,Taub>快开门
<15-30,Taub>Open the door!

520
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,890
<15-31,Taub>我看到你的分机号了
<15-31,Taub>I saw your extension on the call.

521
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,090
<15-31,Taub>你在这里干什么
<15-31,Taub>What are you doing down here?

522
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,020
<15-32,House>威尔森遇到个两岁的癌症病患
<15-32,House>Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer.

523
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,360
<15-32,House>她很痛苦  真叫人难过
<15-32,House>She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.

524
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,570
<15-33,House>他的临床礼节很到位
<15-33,House>He also has an outstanding bedside manner.

525
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,070
<15-34,Taub>她肝衰竭的情况更糟了
<15-34,Taub>Her liver failure is getting worse.

526
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,800
<15-34,Taub>你是对的  现在怎么办
<15-34,Taub>You were right. Now what?

527
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,270
<15-35,House>有趣的是她为什么先好转
<15-35,House>The interesting question is not why she's worse now

528
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,910
<15-35,House>而非现在才恶化
<15-35,House>but why she got better in the first place.

529
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,940
<15-36,Taub>可能是我们的治疗
<15-36,Taub>Could have been something we did that temporarily

530
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,010
<15-36,Taub>暂时缓解了
<15-36,Taub>relieved the--

531
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,350
<15-37,House>你们给她用了什么
<15-37,House>What'd you put her on again?

532
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,680
<15-38,Taub>输血以后  我们给她用了类固醇
<15-38,Taub>After the transfusion, we gave her steroids,

533
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,650
<15-38,Taub>多巴胺  和抗...
<15-38,Taub>dopamine, and the anti--

534
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,220
<15-38,Taub>类固醇能治疗先天性肝硬化
<15-38,Taub>steroids can treat idiopathic hepatic fibrosis.

535
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,850
<15-38,Taub>这能解释她为什么先好转后恶化
<15-38,Taub>It would explain why she got better and then worse.

536
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,890
<15-39,House>但不能解释多个胆管扩张
<15-39,House>But not the multiple dilated ducts.

537
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,790
<15-40,Wilson>豪斯  你进来一下
<15-40,Wilson>House, I need you back in here!

538
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,500
<15-41,House>癌症比肝病严重
<15-41,House>Cancer kid trumps liver kid.

539
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,900
<15-41,House>抱歉  天机不可泄露  规矩你懂的
<15-41,House>Sorry. Confidentiality. There are rules, you know.

540
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,440
<15-42,Wilson>这就是个一角硬币
<15-42,Wilson>That is a dime.

541
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,870
<15-43,House>它在移动
<15-43,House>It looks mobile.

542
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,210
<15-43,House>还在结肠中间
<15-43,House>And it's right in the middle of the colon.

543
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,940
<15-43,House>拉粑粑的最佳地段
<15-43,House>Prime location for pooping out.

544
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,980
<15-43,House>给她吃点轻泻剂帮助它出来
<15-43,House>We'll give her some laxatives to help it on its way.

545
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,650
<15-44,Wilson>看来  有人能吃到
<15-44,Wilson>Sounds to me like someone's going to get

546
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,950
<15-44,Wilson>好吃的巧克力啦
<15-44,Wilson>some yummy chocolate.

547
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,710
<15-44,Wilson>巧克力  香香啊
<15-44,Wilson>Chocolate. Yum yum yum.

548
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,220
<15-45,House>你将来一定是个好妈妈
<15-45,House>You're gonna make a great mommy one day.

549
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,700
<15-45,House>多谢相候
<15-45,House>Thanks for waiting.

550
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,470
<15-45,House>把婴儿连接到母体
<15-45,House>Hook the mom up to the baby.

551
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,700
<15-45,House>直接输血
<15-45,House>Direct blood transfusion.

552
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,170
<15-46,Taub>然后呢
<15-46,Taub>And what else?

553
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,540
<15-47,House>没然后
<15-47,House>Nothing else.

554
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,720
<16-1,Taub>太神奇了  她的肤色变粉症状也好转了
<16-1,Taub>It's amazing. She's pink and healthy again.

555
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,590
<16-2,House>都是因为母亲的爱抚
<16-2,House>Mother's touch.

556
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,820
<16-3,Abbey>简直是奇迹  谢谢你们
<16-3,Abbey>It's a miracle. Thank you.

557
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,490
<16-4,Taub>输血并不是治疗方案
<16-4,Taub>A blood transfusion isn't a cure.

558
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,290
<16-5,House>也非奇迹
<16-5,House>Or a miracle.

559
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,170
<16-6,Taub>那为什么婴儿看起来像是痊愈了
<16-6,Taub>Then why does the baby seem like she's cured?

560
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,870
<16-7,House>不知道
<16-7,House>I have no idea.

561
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,290
<17-1,House>我们要么让病人
<17-1,House>Our patient can either go through life

562
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,400
<17-1,House>连着世界上最长的"脐带"过一生
<17-1,House>with the world's longest umbilical cord,

563
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,100
<17-1,House>要么开始神奇血液的鉴别诊断
<17-1,House>or we can discuss the differential for magic blood.

564
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,640
<17-2,Cheng>婴儿的血氧含量稳定
<17-2,Cheng>Baby's O2 sats are holding.

565
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,480
<17-3,House>你要么是程医生
<17-3,House>Either you're Dr. Cheng

566
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,680
<17-3,House>要么是太早来给我美甲了
<17-3,House>or you're early for my mani-pedi.

567
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,150
<17-4,Taub>我原以为她的专长能...
<17-4,Taub>I thought her expertise could--

568
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,150
<17-5,House>能告诉我们血氧含量
<17-5,House>Could tell us the O2 sats.

569
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,320
<17-5,House>我希望你能有些独到的见解
<17-5,House>I hope you come with some original ideas.

570
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,420
<17-6,Cheng>两种可能  要么是母亲特殊血液
<17-6,Cheng>Either the mom's blood is special,

571
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,090
<17-6,Cheng>能够治疗某种病症
<17-6,Cheng>which would mean it's treating something specific,

572
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,630
<17-6,Cheng>这就意味着婴儿患有某种疾病
<17-6,Cheng>which means the baby has a disease.

573
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,560
<17-6,Cheng>不然母亲的血就只是普通的血
<17-6,Cheng>Or mom's blood is just blood,

574
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,860
<17-6,Cheng>但是补充了婴儿体内缺乏的物质
<17-6,Cheng>and it's replacing something the baby is missing,

575
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,770
<17-6,Cheng>这就意味着婴儿只是先天不足
<17-6,Cheng>which means the baby has a simple deficiency.

576
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,940
<17-7,House>鉴于她的肝功能衰竭  很可能是
<17-7,House>Given the liver failure, a deficiency of clotting factors,

577
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,710
<17-7,House>缺少凝血因子  酶或者维生素
<17-7,House>enzymes, or vitamins are the most likely.

578
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,010
<17-8,House>那就找出来吧
<17-8,House>So let's find out.

579
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,510
<17-8,House>给婴儿输其他人的血
<17-8,House>Hook the baby up to someone else's blood

580
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,580
<17-8,House>看她是否好转
<17-8,House>and see if she gets better.

581
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,750
<17-9,Taub>-找个捐献者  -我是0型阴性血
<17-9,Taub>- Find a donor. - I'm O negative.

582
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,980
<17-9,Taub>万能输血者
<17-9,Taub>Universal donor.

583
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,150
<17-10,House>那就由你来输血
<17-10,House>Hook yourself up.

584
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,390
<17-10,House>程医生  挂上我
<17-10,House>Dr. Cheng, hook me up.

585
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,150
<17-10,House>跟我走
<17-10,House>Walk with me.

586
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,190
<17-10,House>我的小组对你很有好感
<17-10,House>My team seems to have taken a shine to you.

587
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,830
<17-11,Cheng>我也喜欢他们
<17-11,Cheng>I like them too.

588
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,400
<17-12,House>我猜你跟我们混是因为想要这份工作
<17-12,House>I assume you're hanging around because you want a job.

589
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,060
<17-13,Cheng>猜得没错
<17-13,Cheng>That would be a fair assumption.

590
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,770
<17-14,House>那我得考你一下
<17-14,House>Well, I'm gonna have to test you.

591
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,040
<17-14,House>比如说  两岁大的孩子...
<17-14,House>Let's say, two-year-old...

592
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,470
<17-14,House>20小时之前吞下一枚硬币
<17-14,House>swallowed a coin 20 hours ago.

593
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,770
<17-14,House>她不会有事的  对吗
<17-14,House>She's gonna be fine, right?

594
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,610
<17-15,Cheng>有梗阻的现象吗
<17-15,Cheng>Any signs of obstruction?

595
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,510
<17-16,House>为了达到测试你的目的
<17-16,House>For the purposes of this quiz,

596
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,280
<17-16,House>我当然要说  还没有
<17-16,House>let's say, not yet.

597
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,950
<17-17,Cheng>我会开些泻药
<17-17,Cheng>I'd give a laxative,

598
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,520
<17-17,Cheng>但我不会等太久
<17-17,Cheng>although I wouldn't wait too long.

599
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,280
<17-17,Cheng>她的肠子有可能会局部缺血
<17-17,Cheng>Her bowel could become ischemic,

600
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,750
<17-17,Cheng>更糟的话  可能发生肠套叠
<17-17,Cheng>or worse, an intussusception.

601
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,390
<17-18,House>太久是多久
<17-18,House>Define "Too long."

602
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,220
<17-19,Cheng>最多再等六个小时
<17-19,Cheng>Another six hours, max.

603
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,560
<17-19,Cheng>到那时候  她的身体已经排空了
<17-19,Cheng>By then, her system is clear.

604
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,960
<17-19,Cheng>如果没出来  就不会出来了
<17-19,Cheng>If it's not out, it's not coming out.

605
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,830
<17-20,House>然后我该做什么
<17-20,House>And then what do I do?

606
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,930
<17-20,House>我是说  你该做什么  这是你的考题
<17-20,House>I mean, what do you do? It's your test.

607
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,800
<17-21,Cheng>我会做内镜  把它取出来
<17-21,Cheng>I'd go in with a scope and get it.

608
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,930
<17-21,Cheng>我合格了吗
<17-21,Cheng>Did I pass?

609
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,740
<17-22,House>我说了不算  找陶博去吧
<17-22,House>It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.

610
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,480
<17-23,House>躲在男厕所里
<17-23,House>Men's room?

611
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,950
<17-24,Wilson>事实证明  现在这种情况下厕所更方便
<17-24,Wilson>It turns out, toilets are handy in this situation,

612
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,280
<17-24,Wilson>而且我相对确信卡迪不会进来
<17-24,Wilson>and I felt relatively sure that Cuddy wouldn't come in.

613
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,620
<17-25,House>卡迪进来过
<17-25,House>Oh, Cuddy's been in here.

614
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,250
<17-26,Wilson>真的吗
<17-26,Wilson>Seriously?

615
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,190
<17-26,Wilson>做...  这地方也太糟糕了
<17-26,Wilson>This must be a terrible place to have se--uhh!

616
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,390
<17-27,House>天下哪有糟糕的地儿
<17-27,House>Is there such a place?

617
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,230
<17-27,House>再等六小时
<17-27,House>Okay, six more hours,

618
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,790
<17-27,House>还不行我们就做内镜  把它取出来
<17-27,House>then we're going in with a scope and pulling it out.

619
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,000
<17-28,Wilson>给一个两岁孩子做内镜  太危险了
<17-28,Wilson>Scope a two-year-old? It's dangerous.

620
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,500
<17-29,House>是你一直在提醒我
<17-29,House>And as you keep pointing out,

621
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,530
<17-29,House>这枚角币划破她的内脏同样危险
<17-29,House>so is a dime ripping through her intestines.

622
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,500
<17-30,Wilson>六个小时之后卡迪就回家了
<17-30,Wilson>Cuddy will be home from work in six hours.

623
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,740
<17-30,Wilson>但是没关系  我就大叫  "看那边"
<17-30,Wilson>But no big deal. I'll just scream, "Look over there,"

624
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,370
<17-30,Wilson>你趁此机会迅速把内镜伸进她女儿的直肠
<17-30,Wilson>while you quickly shove a scope up her daughter's rectum.

625
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,910
<17-31,House>我可以主动帮忙看孩子
<17-31,House>I could offer to baby-sit again,

626
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,310
<17-31,House>-让她出去玩一晚  -当然
<17-31,House>- let her have the night out. - Sure.

627
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,480
<17-32,Wilson>你主动帮忙  她绝对不会起疑的
<17-32,Wilson>That won't raise any suspicions.

628
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:14,010
<17-33,House>我开始后悔从不做好人了
<17-33,House>I wish I was nicer.

629
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,350
<17-33,House>把你的辐射剂量计徽章给我
<17-33,House>Hey. Give me your radiation dosimeter.

630
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,520
<17-34,Wilson>为什么
<17-34,Wilson>Why?

631
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,220
<17-35,House>因为它跟我眼睛颜色很搭
<17-35,House>Because it matches my eyes.

632
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,490
<18-1,Taub>我觉得这样不管用
<18-1,Taub>I think we can say this isn't working.

633
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,790
<18-1,Taub>我们可以继续给她输你的血
<18-1,Taub>We'll get her back on your blood.

634
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,990
<18-1,Taub>暂时可以维持
<18-1,Taub>That'll help for now.

635
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,860
<18-1,Taub>但这说明是感染造成的
<18-1,Taub>But this means there's an infection.

636
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,230
<18-1,Taub>首先  我们要确定病因
<18-1,Taub>First we need to identify it.

637
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,330
<18-1,Taub>我们知道是肝部的问题  所以要先取样
<18-1,Taub>We know it's in her liver, so we'll get a sample.

638
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,740
<18-1,Taub>然后我们才能知道怎样治好她
<18-1,Taub>Then we can figure out how to help her get better.

639
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,100
<18-2,Abbey>我要这个孩子
<18-2,Abbey>I had this baby

640
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,270
<18-2,Abbey>是因为我想做一次特别的妈妈
<18-2,Abbey>because I wanted a chance to be a special mom.

641
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,180
<18-2,Abbey>但不是这种
<18-2,Abbey>But not this way.

642
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,960
<18-3,Cuddy>放射科出了点问题
<18-3,Cuddy>Problems in radiology.

643
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,660
<18-3,Cuddy>一枚辐射剂量计徽章显示辐射过量
<18-3,Cuddy>A radiation dosimeter badge turned positive.

644
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,330
<18-3,Cuddy>可能是哪台断层扫描仪发生耗散
<18-3,Cuddy>I could have a CT Scanner that's leaking

645
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,100
<18-3,Cuddy>或者哪里洒了一瓶铊
<18-3,Cuddy>or a spilled vial of thallium somewhere.

646
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,910
<18-3,Cuddy>我还不知道是谁的徽章
<18-3,Cuddy>I don't even know whose badge it was.

647
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,470
<18-3,Cuddy>代码被划掉了
<18-3,Cuddy>The code was scratched off.

648
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,170
<18-4,House>一定是有人故意的
<18-4,House>That had to be intentional.

649
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,880
<18-4,House>-谁会  -不知道
<18-4,House>- Why would anyone... - I don't know.

650
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,580
<18-5,Cuddy>我只知道我要加班了
<18-5,Cuddy>All I know is that I'm gonna need to work late.

651
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,130
<18-5,Cuddy>实际上  我希望你能照顾下宝宝
<18-5,Cuddy>I was actually hoping that you could baby-sit.

652
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,550
<18-7,Cuddy>-不是吧  -拜托了
<18-7,Cuddy>- No. - Please.

653
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,590
<18-8,House>连着两晚当保姆
<18-8,House>Two nights in a row?

654
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,490
<18-7,Cuddy>拜托了
<18-7,Cuddy>Please.

655
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,520
<18-10,House>我也有自己的生活
<18-10,House>I have a life, you know.

656
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,760
<18-11,Cuddy>我会让你劳有所得的
<18-11,Cuddy>I will make it worth your while.

657
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,170
<18-12,House>我不会以带孩子换性福的
<18-12,House>I am not going to bargain babysitting for sex.

658
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,370
<18-12,House>谁说的这种傻话
<18-12,House>Who the hell said that?

659
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,570
<18-12,House>我当然愿意
<18-12,House>Of course I will.

660
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,310
<18-13,Cuddy>谢谢
<18-13,Cuddy>Thank you.

661
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,950
<19-1,Abbey>那东西几乎和她一般大
<19-1,Abbey>Oh, that thing's nearly as big as she is.

662
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,820
<19-2,Taub>别担心  我以前也这样做过  至少一次
<19-2,Taub>Don't worry. I've done this at least once before.

663
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,560
<19-3,Foreman>再往前一厘米就到了
<19-3,Foreman>Advance another centimeter and you're in.

664
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,100
<19-4,Abbey>我的上帝  真可怕  是感染造成的吗
<19-4,Abbey>Oh, God, that looks awful. Is that from the infection?

665
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,470
<19-5,Foreman>不是  这说明我们错了
<19-5,Foreman>No. It means we were wrong.

666
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,480
<19-5,Foreman>那是个黑素瘤
<19-5,Foreman>It's a melanoma.

667
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,110
<19-6,Abbie>你是说  皮肤癌吗
<19-6,Abbie>You mean, like skin cancer?

668
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,060
<19-6,Abbie>她怎么可能得皮肤癌  她都没出去过
<19-6,Abbie>How would she get that? She's never been outside.

669
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,200
<19-7,Taub>可是你出去过
<19-7,Taub>But you have.

670
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,160
<19-8,Abbey>你是说我把癌症传给了孩子
<19-8,Abbey>You're saying I gave my baby cancer?

671
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,020
<19-8,Abbey>我在她左手食指指甲下面找到一颗痣
<19-8,Abbey>I found a mole under the nail on her left index finger.

672
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,200
<19-8,Abbey>活组织切片检查证明是黑素瘤
<19-8,Abbey>The biopsy revealed it's melanoma.

673
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
<20-1,House>就这么简单
<20-1,House>That's it?

674
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,310
<20-1,House>为什么没人帮我准备食物
<20-1,House>How come no one got me food?

675
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,780
<20-2,Cheng>"就这么简单"是什么意思  她长了黑素瘤
<20-2,Cheng>What do you mean, "That's it"? The woman has melanoma.

676
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,740
<20-2,Cheng>她可能会死的  如果我们不...
<20-2,Cheng>She could die if we don't--

677
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,910
<20-3,House>无聊
<20-3,House>Boring.

678
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,150
<20-3,House>既然婴儿患有黑素瘤
<20-3,House>Since the baby has the melanoma,

679
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,550
<20-3,House>就说明母亲也有
<20-3,House>we kind of already knew the mom had it.

680
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,650
<20-4,Cheng>没错  但现在我们知道了瘤的位置
<20-4,Cheng>Yes, but now we know where it is,

681
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,190
<20-4,Cheng>就可以采取有效治疗
<20-4,Cheng>so we can treat it much more effectively.

682
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,390
<20-5,House>太好了  那就去治疗吧
<20-5,House>Great. So treat her.

683
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,990
<20-5,House>还是很无聊
<20-5,House>Also boring.

684
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,400
<20-5,House>有趣的是
<20-5,House>What's interesting is that

685
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,030
<20-5,House>妈妈的黑素瘤在子宫内传给胎儿
<20-5,House>mom's melanoma spread to the baby in utero,

686
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,230
<20-5,House>说明发生了癌细胞转移
<20-5,House>which means it's metastatic,

687
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
<20-5,House>也就说明已经是晚期了
<20-5,House>which means it's late stage.

688
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,100
<20-5,House>有几个黑素瘤晚期病人
<20-5,House>How many people with a late stage melanoma

689
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,180
<20-5,House>能像她这样健康
<20-5,House>are as healthy as she is?

690
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,810
<20-6,Foreman>显然  妈妈血液中有某种物质
<20-6,Foreman>Clearly, something's going on in mom's blood

691
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,670
<20-6,Foreman>治疗了她和婴儿的黑素瘤
<20-6,Foreman>that's treating her melanoma as well as her baby's.

692
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,110
<20-7,House>抗体
<20-7,House>Antibodies.

693
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,590
<20-8,Foreman>如果她的免疫系统在攻击黑素瘤
<20-8,Foreman>If her immune system was fighting the melanoma,

694
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,580
<20-8,Foreman>就不会发生转移了
<20-8,Foreman>it never would have spread.

695
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,280
<20-9,House>没错  这说明免疫系统是在攻击其它东西
<20-9,House>Exactly, which means it's fighting something else,

696
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,120
<20-9,House>而黑素瘤细被抑制是城门失火殃及池鱼
<20-9,House>and the melanoma cells are getting caught in the crossfire.

697
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,320
<20-9,House>那么母亲的免疫系统到底在攻击什么呢
<20-9,House>So what's mom's immune system really shooting at?

698
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,790
<20-10,Taub>硬皮病能够导致抗癌抗体的产生
<20-10,Taub>Scleroderma can cause cancer-fighting antibodies.

699
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,990
<20-11,Chase>变应性肉芽肿病综合征也可以
<20-11,Chase>So can Churg Strauss,

700
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,220
<20-11,Chase>大部分自身免疫疾病都可以
<20-11,Chase>pretty much any auto-immune disease.

701
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,690
<20-12,Cheng>或者是感染造成了肉芽肿  肺结核和分歧杆菌
<20-12,Cheng>Or infections that cause granulomas, TB, mycobacteria.

702
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,660
<20-13,House>你看  程医生
<20-13,House>See, Dr. Cheng?

703
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,990
<20-13,House>这才不叫无聊
<20-13,House>This is not boring.

704
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,530
<20-13,House>从自身免疫疾病着手
<20-13,House>Start with auto-immune.

705
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,130
<20-13,House>你去验血
<20-13,House>Go test her blood.

706
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,230
<20-13,House>把食物留下
<20-13,House>And leave your food.

707
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,370
<20-13,House>会有点儿疼
<20-13,House>Just a little pinch.

708
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,450
<20-13,House>这么说  我没有真的让她好起来
<20-13,House>So, uh, I'm not actually making her better.

709
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,850
<20-13,House>而是让她生病了
<20-13,House>I'm making her sick.

710
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,320
<21-1,Taub>不是你的错
<21-1,Taub>You can't blame yourself.

711
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,150
<21-2,Abbey>我吃正确的食物
<21-2,Abbey>I ate all the right foods,

712
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,190
<21-2,Abbey>读了好多书和研究资料
<21-2,Abbey>I read all the books and the studies,

713
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,360
<21-2,Abbey>甚至雇私家侦探
<21-2,Abbey>and I even hired a private Detective

714
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,260
<21-2,Abbey>调查每一位精子捐献者
<21-2,Abbey>to research each sperm donor.

715
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,510
<21-2,Abbey>可我忽略了最要紧的一件事
<21-2,Abbey>I just missed one big thing.

716
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,700
<21-2,Abbey>我自己的癌症
<21-2,Abbey>My own cancer.

717
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,470
<21-3,Taub>好了
<21-3,Taub>I'm all done here.

718
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,200
<21-3,Taub>很快就会有结果
<21-3,Taub>We'll have the results soon.

719
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,610
<21-4,Abbey>如果是那种病会怎样
<21-4,Abbey>And if that's what this is?

720
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,210
<21-4,Abbey>自身免疫疾病
<21-4,Abbey>An auto-immune disease?

721
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,680
<21-5,Taub>治疗方案很简单
<21-5,Taub>Treatment's fairly simple.

722
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,680
<21-6,Justine>如果是别的疾病呢
<21-6,Justine>And if it's something else?

723
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,220
<21-7,Taub>别急  我们一步一步来
<21-7,Taub>Let's just take this one step at a time.

724
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,090
<21-7,Taub>别折磨自己了
<21-7,Taub>Stop beating yourself up.

725
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,200
<21-8,Justine>妈妈  对不起
<21-8,Justine>I'm sorry, mom.

726
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,170
<21-8,Justine>你生病我很难过  还有我之前不该说那些话
<21-8,Justine>Not just for this, but for what I said earlier.

727
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,680
<21-8,Justine>我又气又嫉妒  才说了那些伤人的话
<21-8,Justine>I was jealous and angry, and I lashed out.

728
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,410
<21-8,Justine>你是个好妈妈
<21-8,Justine>But you were a great mom.

729
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,420
<21-8,Justine>真的是个好妈妈
<21-8,Justine>You are a great mom.

730
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,850
<21-9,Abbey>我不配有你这样好的女儿
<21-9,Abbey>I don't deserve such a good daughter.

731
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,600
<22-1,Chang>硬皮病阴性
<22-1,Chang>Negative for scleroderma.

732
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:14,140
<22-2,Taub>豪斯刚才叫你做什么
<22-2,Taub>So, what did House want earlier?

733
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,770
<22-3,Chang>他让我做了个小测试
<22-3,Chang>He just gave me a little quiz

734
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,370
<22-3,Chang>他说他同意雇用我
<22-3,Chang>and said he was okay with hiring me,

735
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,180
<22-3,Chang>不过还是要你来拿主意
<22-3,Chang>but that it was your decision.

736
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,850
<22-1,Chang>皮肌炎阴性
<22-1,Chang>Negative for dermatomyositis.

737
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,310
<22-4,Taub>他这么说只是为了给我下套
<22-4,Taub>He's just saying that to set me up.

738
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,450
<22-5,Chang>你不打算雇用我吗
<22-5,Chang>So you're not offering me the job?

739
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,270
<22-6,Taub>如果他愿意让我雇用你  其中必有原委
<22-6,Taub>If he wants me to offer you the job, something's going on.

740
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,760
<22-7,Chang>我也这样想  不是狼疮
<22-7,Chang>That was my thinking too. It's not lupus.

741
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,660
<22-8,Taub>豪斯这人办事从不直来直去
<22-8,Taub>Things with House are never as simple as they seem.

742
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,090
<22-8,Taub>相信我  他一定有隐藏的动机
<22-8,Taub>Trust me, he's got an ulterior motive,

743
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,460
<22-8,Taub>在行动之前  我一定要弄清楚
<22-8,Taub>and I've got to figure it out before I do anything.

744
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,700
<22-8,Taub>好吧
<22-8,Taub>Okay.

745
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,440
<22-9,Chang>母亲的变应性肉芽肿阴性  不是自身免疫疾病
<22-9,Chang>Mom's negative for Churg Strauss. This isn't auto-immune.

746
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,370
<22-9,Chang>该给她扫描查可能引发肉芽肿的感染了
<22-9,Chang>Time to scan her for infections that could cause granulomas.

747
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,110
<22-10,Wilson>半小时内拉了3次
<22-10,Wilson>Third poop in the last half hour.

748
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,620
<22-10,Wilson>一无所获
<22-10,Wilson>Still nothing.

749
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,850
<22-10,Wilson>好  就这样了
<22-10,Wilson>All right, that's it.

750
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,290
<22-10,Wilson>时间到
<22-10,Wilson>Time's up.

752
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,420
<22-10,Wilson>执行"女武神"手术计划
<22-10,Wilson>Operation Valkyrie is now in effect.

753
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,000
<23-1,Foreman>管它是不是陷阱  雇她就是了
<23-1,Foreman>Either it's a trap or it's not. Just hire her.

754
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,670
<23-2,Taub>肺部没有肉芽肿
<23-2,Taub>Lungs clear for granulomas.

755
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,340
<23-2,Taub>就是  谁在乎呢
<23-2,Taub>Yeah, who cares?

756
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,310
<23-2,Taub>昨天夹住你腿的捕熊器还爽吧
<23-2,Taub>Did you enjoy that bear trap snapping on your leg yesterday?

757
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,810
<23-3,Foreman>你能意识到这只是个比喻义的陷阱吧
<23-3,Foreman>You realize it's just a metaphorical trap?

758
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,550
<23-3,Foreman>再说你的腿脚还安然无恙呢
<23-3,Foreman>You'll still have all your limbs.

759
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,320
<23-3,Foreman>第四根肋骨  锁骨中线附近
<23-3,Foreman>Fourth rib about the midclavicular line.

760
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,490
<23-4,Taub>你想太多了
<23-4,Taub>You're over-thinking this.

761
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,320
<23-3,Foreman>我选的人面还没见就被豪斯炒了
<23-3,Foreman>House fired my pick sight unseen.

762
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,360
<23-3,Foreman>奇斯选的谁豪斯根本不关心
<23-3,Foreman>He was never even interested in Chase's pick.

763
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,660
<23-3,Foreman>他只是揪住奇斯选人的原因不放
<23-3,Foreman>He was only obsessed with how she reflected on Chase.

764
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,560
<23-3,Foreman>陈医生是他唯一给过回应的候选人
<23-3,Foreman>Dr. Cheng is the only candidate he's actually responded to.

765
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,740
<23-3,Foreman>你不是想让豪斯经手吗
<23-3,Foreman>You wanted House invested.

766
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,330
<23-5,Foreman>他已经经手了  雇她吧
<23-5,Foreman>He is. Hire her.

767
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,600
<23-4,Taub>你推理半天  还说我想太多
<23-4,Taub>And you think I'm over-thinking this?

768
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,700
<23-5,Foreman>别念叨了  就雇她吧
<23-5,Foreman>Shut up and hire her.

769
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
<23-6,Taub>看
<23-6,Taub>Look.

770
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,650
<23-7,Foreman>燕麦形细胞肺癌
<23-7,Foreman>Oat cell lung cancer.

771
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,320
<23-8,Taub>她患了两种癌症
<23-8,Taub>She has two cancers?

772
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,820
<23-9,Taub>癌能治癌
<23-9,Taub>Cancer treating cancer?

773
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,730
<24-1,Taub>你患了肺癌
<24-1,Taub>You have lung cancer.

774
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,260
<24-2,Abbey>我不是得了皮肤癌吗
<24-2,Abbey>I thought I had skin cancer.

775
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,670
<24-3,Taub>听上去匪夷所思  但你同时患有两种癌症
<24-3,Taub>As unlikely as it sounds, you have both.

776
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,340
<24-4,Foreman>事实上  肺癌正在治疗皮肤癌
<24-4,Foreman>Actually, the lung cancer is basically treating the skin cancer.

777
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,070
<24-4,Foreman>所以你没有感觉到病痛  你的血能让孩子好转
<24-4,Foreman>It's why you're not feeling sick and why your blood's helping your baby.

778
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,040
<24-5,Taub>发现及时  应该在可治范围
<24-5,Taub>We found it early, so it should be treatable.

779
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,980
<24-5,Taub>某种程度上说  是你女儿救了你
<24-5,Taub>In a way, your daughter saved your life.

780
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,210
<24-5,Taub>我们会给你安排手术  然后开始化疗
<24-5,Taub>We'll get you set up for the surgery and start you on chemo.

781
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,950
<24-6,Abbey>那Kayla呢
<24-6,Abbey>What about Kayla?

782
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,690
<24-7,Taub>她只需做化疗
<24-7,Taub>She'll only need the chemo.

783
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,690
<24-8,Abbie>继续给她输我的血不行吗
<24-8,Abbie>Can't you just keep giving her my blood?

784
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,160
<24-9,Taub>肿瘤切除之后
<24-9,Taub>Not once we cut out the tumor

785
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,830
<24-9,Taub>你的身体会停止产生抗体
<24-9,Taub>your body will stop making the antibodies

786
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,000
<24-9,Taub>你的血就不会让她好转了
<24-9,Taub>that are keeping your baby healthy.

787
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,500
<24-10,Abbey>我的手术可以推迟吗
<24-10,Abbey>Can you hold off on my surgery?

788
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,200
<24-11,Foreman>过去一天之内你孩子的肿瘤缩小了百分之十五
<24-11,Foreman>Over the last day, your baby's liver tumors have shrunk 15%.

789
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,440
<24-11,Foreman>据此推算  完全消灭掉她的癌细胞
<24-11,Foreman>Projecting forward, it would take eight or nine days

790
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,970
<24-11,Foreman>需要八九天时间
<24-11,Foreman>to completely eradicate her cancer cells.

791
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,240
<24-12,Abbey>那就再等八九天
<24-12,Abbey>So let's take the eight or nine days...

792
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,250
<24-13,Foreman>等上八九天癌症确实不太可能扩散
<24-13,Foreman>The cancer probably won't spread in the next nine days,

793
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,010
<24-13,Foreman>但有其他风险
<24-13,Foreman>but there are other risks.

794
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,820
<24-13,Foreman>癌变使你的血液变粘稠  易形成血栓
<24-13,Foreman>Cancer thickens your blood, which could cause clots.

795
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,050
<24-14,Abbey>给我的孩子化疗会有什么风险
<24-14,Abbey>What are the risks to putting my baby on chemo?

796
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,740
<24-15,Taub>化疗可能会造成脑损伤或影响发育
<24-15,Taub>It could damage her brain or affect her development,

797
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,130
<24-15,Taub>但相对于延缓癌症治疗对你的影响而言
<24-15,Taub>but these risks are small compared to the risks

798
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,330
<24-15,Taub>化疗的风险微乎其微
<24-15,Taub>that you would be taking by leaving your cancers untreated.

799
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,670
<24-16,Abbey>-我想等  -妈
<24-16,Abbey>- I want to wait. - Mom.

800
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,200
<24-17,Justine>你没听见吗  这太危险了
<24-17,Justine>Are you listening? This is way too dangerous.

801
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,010
<24-18,Abbey>我愿意冒险
<24-18,Abbey>I'll take the risks.

802
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,710
<24-18,Abbey>我选对我女儿最有利的方案
<24-18,Abbey>I want what's best for my daughter.

803
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,240
<24-19,Justine>我也是你的女儿呀
<24-19,Justine>I'm your daughter too.

804
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,180
<24-20,Abbey>-她是个婴儿  你已经成年了  -那又怎样
<24-20,Abbey>- She's a baby. You're an adult. - So what?

805
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,520
<24-21,Justine>我成年了就再也不需要母亲了吗
<24-21,Justine>I don't need my mom anymore?

806
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,820
<24-22,Abbey>不  你向来不需要我
<24-22,Abbey>No. You never did.

807
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,520
<24-22,Abbey>因为我从来都不够关心你
<24-22,Abbey>'Cause I wasn't there for you.

808
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,520
<24-22,Abbey>可是你看  你现在多好
<24-22,Abbey>But look at you. You turned out great.

809
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,960
<24-23,Justine>你才不知道我好不好
<24-23,Justine>Oh, you don't know if I'm great.

810
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,620
<24-23,Justine>你根本都不了解我
<24-23,Justine>You don't know me at all.

811
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,860
<24-23,Justine>我不会让你为了两天大的婴儿牺牲自己
<24-23,Justine>And I'm not gonna let you martyr yourself for a two-day-old infant

812
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,700
<24-23,Justine>只因为你觉得当初没能照顾好我心存内疚
<24-23,Justine>just because you feel guilty because you weren't around for me.

813
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,200
<24-24,Abbey>我不是在牺牲自己  不过9天而已
<24-24,Abbey>I'm not martyring myself. It's nine days.

814
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,740
<24-24,Abbey>推迟手术吧
<24-24,Abbey>Let's hold off on the surgery.

815
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,320
<25-1,Wilson>你居然带了吃的来
<25-1,Wilson>You brought food?

816
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,090
<25-1,Wilson>这是医疗程序  不是晚餐约会
<25-1,Wilson>This is a medical procedure, not a dinner date.

817
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,590
<25-2,House>我知道这是医疗程序
<25-2,House>I'm aware that this is a delicate procedure.

818
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,420
<25-2,House>我还知道我的手在抖
<25-2,House>I'm also aware that my hands are shaking

819
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,290
<25-2,House>因为我一整天没吃饭血糖很低
<25-2,House>from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day.

820
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,390
<25-2,House>所以我此举虽然貌似不够体贴礼貌
<25-2,House>So while this may seem insensitive,

821
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,570
<25-2,House>这份木须肉却是至关重要的回春
<25-2,House>this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo--

822
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,240
<25-4,Wilson>我的煎饼呢
<25-4,Wilson>where are my extra pancakes?

823
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,540
<25-2,House>该死  我点的木须肉外加煎饼没给
<25-2,House>Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes

824
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,580
<25-2,House>只要那个挑染蓝头发的新服务员一接电话
<25-2,House>Every time that new girl with the blue streak

825
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,740
<25-2,House>肯定有东西错
<25-2,House>in her hair answers the phone, they screw up.

826
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,920
<25-3,House>你那天取外卖的时候也是她当班吗
<25-3,House>Was she there when you picked up the food?

827
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,220
<25-4,Wilson>那天你也点了外加煎饼
<25-4,Wilson>You ordered extra pancakes?

828
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,090
<25-4,Wilson>外加煎饼多少钱
<25-4,Wilson>How much did they cost?

829
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,330
<25-5,House>5角5一张
<25-5,House>55 cents.

830
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,360
<25-5,House>我点了两张
<25-5,House>And there were two.

831
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,770
<25-6,Wilson>那么所有东西加起来应该是
<25-6,Wilson>So that means the total on the last bill was--

832
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,600
<25-7,House>应该是
<25-7,House>was--

833
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,440
<25-8,House>-18元4角2  -18元4角2
<25-8,House>- $18.42. - $18.42.

834
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,240
<25-8,House>Rachel不可能吃了角币
<25-8,House>Rachel couldn't have eaten a dime

835
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,110
<25-9,Wilson>因为没有多余的角币了
<25-9,Wilson>because there was no extra dime.

836
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,350
<25-10,Wilson>太好了
<25-10,Wilson>Yeah.

837
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:35,250
<25-10,Wilson>那么我们在超声波图像上看到的
<25-10,Wilson>So the image that we saw on the ultrasound--

838
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,290
<25-11,House>明显就是一团气泡  我早说了
<25-11,House>was obviously just a pocket of air, like I said all along.

839
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,230
<25-11,House>可你还是往最坏处想
<25-11,House>But you saw the worst case scenario,

840
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,500
<25-11,House>像所有患得患失毫无理性的父母一样
<25-11,House>like every irrational, worried parent.

841
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,170
<25-11,House>你当不了好妈妈
<25-11,House>You'd make a terrible mommy.

842
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,570
<25-12,Wilson>不给我份饺子吗
<25-12,Wilson>Want to give me some dumplings?

843
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,120
<26-1,Justine>妈妈  我给你带了些
<26-1,Justine>Mom, I brought you some--

844
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,850
<26-1,Justine>妈妈
<26-1,Justine>Mom?

845
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,920
<26-1,Justine>妈妈
<26-1,Justine>Mom!

846
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,360
<26-1,Justine>妈妈
<26-1,Justine>Mom.

847
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,500
<26-1,Justine>来人  快来救命
<26-1,Justine>We need help in here! Somebody help us!

848
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,910
<26-1,Justine>大规模肺栓塞
<26-1,Justine>Massive pulmonary embolism.

849
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,540
<27-1,Taub>她几秒内就死了
<27-1,Taub>She died in seconds.

850
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,980
<27-2,Cheng>如果她让我们切除肿瘤就不会这样
<27-2,Cheng>Wouldn't have happened if she let us remove the tumor.

851
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,650
<27-3,Taub>应该不会
<27-3,Taub>Probably not.

852
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,580
<27-3,Taub>尸检之后  我们采了她的血
<27-3,Taub>Postmortem, we were able to harvest all of her blood.

853
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,550
<27-3,Taub>足够治疗婴儿了
<27-3,Taub>It's enough to treat the baby.

854
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,520
<27-4,Cheng>也算死得其所
<27-4,Cheng>That's something.

855
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,960
<27-5,Taub>很神奇的一个病例
<27-5,Taub>Pretty amazing case.

856
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,760
<27-5,Taub>多谢你的帮助
<27-5,Taub>Thanks for your help.

857
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,730
<27-6,Cheng>有机会与你们共事我很开心
<27-6,Cheng>I was glad for the chance to work it with you.

858
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,260
<27-7,Taub>我考虑过了
<27-7,Taub>I've thought about it,

859
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,340
<27-7,Taub>我现在正式请你接受这份工作
<27-7,Taub>and I'd like to formally offer you the job.

860
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,710
<27-8,Cheng>真好笑  我本来很想在豪斯的团队做事
<27-8,Cheng>It's funny, I wanted to work on House's team,

861
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,610
<27-8,Cheng>现在合作做之后却不想了
<27-8,Cheng>until I started working with his team.

862
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,280
<27-9,Taub>我知道  奇斯和福曼有时候有点儿
<27-9,Taub>Yeah, I know. Chase and Foreman can get a little...

863
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,650
<27-10,Cheng>其实  是因为你
<27-10,Cheng>Actually, it's you.

864
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,680
<27-10,Cheng>豪斯做事混蛋我明白  至少他有资本
<27-10,Cheng>I get that House is an ass, but at least he owns it.

865
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,850
<27-11,Taub>你不明白
<27-11,Taub>You don't understand.

866
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,620
<27-11,Taub>这件事不过是豪斯的一个游戏
<27-11,Taub>This whole thing was just a game to House.

867
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,660
<27-11,Taub>我别无选择
<27-11,Taub>I didn't have a choice.

868
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,230
<27-12,Cheng>你是个大人  陶博医生
<27-12,Cheng>You're a grown man, Dr. Taub.

869
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,160
<27-12,Cheng>你怎样选择完全由你做主
<27-12,Cheng>You can make whatever choices you want,

870
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,430
<27-12,Cheng>豪斯说你可以雇用我的时候  你不但没有
<27-12,Cheng>and instead of hiring me when he said you could,

871
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,400
<27-12,Cheng>反而怕得要死  疑神疑鬼像个小孩子
<27-12,Cheng>you chose to act like a paranoid, scared little kid.

872
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,700
<27-12,Cheng>我讨厌小孩
<27-12,Cheng>I hate kids.

873
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,940
<27-12,Cheng>陶博医生  再会
<27-12,Cheng>Good-bye, Dr. Taub.

874
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,090
<27-13,Justine>我一定会让你永远不会忘记她
<27-13,Justine>I'll make sure you never forget her

875
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,040
<27-13,Justine>和她为你做的一切
<27-13,Justine>and what she did for you.

876
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,700
<27-13,Justine>她一直努力成为世上最好的妈妈
<27-13,Justine>She was just trying to be the best mom in the world.

877
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,270
<27-13,Justine>她就是最好的妈妈
<27-13,Justine>She was.

878
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,230
<28-1,House>这回该你了
<28-1,House>This one's all yours.

879
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,630
<28-2,Cuddy>不帮忙了吗
<28-2,Cuddy>What happened to helping out?

880
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,530
<28-3,House>帮过了
<28-3,House>I did.

881
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,490
<28-3,House>是谁便便了哦
<28-3,House>Did someone go poopie?

882
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,360
<28-3,House>怎么回事  你怎么会吃下一枚角币
<28-3,House>What? How did you eat a dime?

883
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,800
<28-3,House>豪斯
<28-3,House>House.
