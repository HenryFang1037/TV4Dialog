<2-6,Chase>豪斯在躲一个人
<2-6,Chase>House is on the lam from someone.

<2-6,Chase>陶博赌是威尔森
<2-6,Chase>Taub's got his money on Wilson,

39

<2-7,Foreman>真是傻瓜的赌注  外头到处都是
<2-7,Foreman>Fool's bet. There's a whole world of

<2-7,Foreman>愤怒的病人  债主
<2-7,Foreman>angry patients, creditors...

42
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,210
<2-8,Cuddy>她需要医生
<2-8,Cuddy>She needs a doctor.

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,250
<2-9,House>当然  不过不是我
<2-9,House>Yes, just not me.

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,950
<2-9,House>你母亲都六十五了
<2-9,House>Your mom is a 65-year-old woman

46
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,630
<2-10,Cuddy>那巨红细胞性贫血是怎么回事
<2-10,Cuddy>What about the macrocytic anemia?

47
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,410
<2-11,House>只低于正常范围一点
<2-11,House>Borderline,

48
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,640
<2-11,House>这种测试结果几乎可以算是想象出来的病
<2-11,House>which is the lab equivalent of imaginary, which,

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,110
<2-11,House>她病史上的症状都这德性
<2-11,House>by the way, matches the rest of her medical history.

50
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,750
<2-12,Cuddy>你真觉得
<2-12,Cuddy>You really think

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,570
<2-12,Cuddy>她把自己吓成心房颤动了吗
<2-12,Cuddy>she's psyching herself into atrial fibrillation?

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,330
<2-13,House>那就给她找个心脏病医生
<2-13,House>So get her a cardiologist.

53
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,480
<2-13,House>你又不想拉我下水
<2-13,House>You don't want me involved.

54
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,430
<2-13,House>你自己都不想牵涉其中
<2-13,House>You don't want you involved.

55
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,870
<2-13,House>我从不理会的伦理道德
<2-13,House>All that ethics stuff that I don't give a crap about

56
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,140
<2-13,House>现在好像还有点道理啊
<2-13,House>suddenly makes sense.

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,940
<2-13,House>如果你感情用事
<2-13,House>If you're emotionally invested,

58
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,420
<2-13,House>就无法理性行事
<2-13,House>you cannot make rational decisions.

59
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,680
<2-13,House>你知道后果不堪设想
<2-13,House>You know this would be a disaster.

60
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,580
<2-14,Cuddy>这可是我母亲啊

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,710
<3-1,House>没有出现胸痹或缺血性胸痛
<3-1,House>no chest discomfort or ischemia.

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,450
<3-1,House>心律失常应该会自行恢复
<3-1,House>The abnormal rhythm will probably resolve itself,

64
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,890
<3-1,House>不然  每天一颗小药丸将会控制病情
<3-1,House>and if not, a daily pill will keep it under control.

65
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,290
<3-1,House>稍候我会继续跟进
<3-1,House>I will follow up later today.

66
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,160
<3-2,Arlene>这和我其它的病症有关联吗
<3-2,Arlene>Is it connected to my other symptoms?

<3-4,Arlene>真怨不得她
<3-4,Arlene>Aye... Not her fault.

69
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,470
<3-4,Arlene>这个"医学院院长"的头衔

71
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,570
<3-4,Arlene>但她都忘了怎样当个真正的医生
<3-4,Arlene>But she's forgotten how to be a real doctor.

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,240
<3-4,Arlene>我的病历上都写着呢
<3-4,Arlene>It's all in my file.

<3-6,Arlene>But isn't this what you do for a living?

76
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,020
<3-7,House>那么  我们要找出
<3-7,House>So... we're looking for a disease

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,200
<3-7,House>而多年的血液检查

<3-7,House>X射线和核磁共振都查无所获
<3-7,House>X-rays, and MRIs.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,010
<3-7,House>刚巧我正好想到一个

<4-2,Taub>Have you seen Cuddy's high-school yearbook?

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,960
<4-3,Masters>这明显跟这案子没关系
<4-3,Masters>Okay, that is clearly not related to the case.

96
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,230
<4-4,Taub>本来就不存在什么案子
<4-4,Taub>There is no case.

98
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,140
<4-4,Taub>他觉得是因为她有所隐瞒
<4-4,Taub>so he figures there's something to hide.

<4-4,Taub>有什么好猜的  不就是

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,360
<5-8,Arlene>一个朋友在用的
<5-8,Arlene>A friend uses it.

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,340
<5-9,Cuddy>一位朋友  妈
<5-9,Cuddy>A friend? Mom...

135
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,680
<5-9,Cuddy>就算是出于医学原因  你也该告诉我的
<5-9,Cuddy>Just for medical reasons, you should have told me.

136
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,660
<5-9,Cuddy>如果你还很有性趣
<5-9,Cuddy>If you're sexually active--

137
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,770
<5-10,Arlene>在我这般年纪  他才是主动的那个
<5-10,Arlene>At my age, he's more the active one.

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,450
<5-11,Cuddy>妈妈有风流韵事呢
<5-11,Cuddy>Mom's having a fling.

139
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,150
<5-12,Julia>我知道
<5-12,Julia>I know.

140
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,410
<5-13,Cuddy>什么
<5-13,Cuddy>You do?

141
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,160
<5-14,Arlene>五年来  她一直给我提供扫兴的劝告
<5-14,Arlene>She's been giving me lousy advice about it for five years.

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,520
<5-15,Julia>-我有生理需求  -他是有妇之夫
<5-15,Julia>- I have physical needs. - He's a married man, mom.

143
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,930
<5-16,Arlene>她不想跟他亲热
<5-16,Arlene>She doesn't want sex with him.

144
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,280
<5-16,Arlene>我可愿意跟他滚床单呢
<5-16,Arlene>I do want to have sex with him.

145
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,680
<5-16,Arlene>你倒是告诉我  对谁不利了
<5-16,Arlene>Tell me, who's being hurt?

146
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,770
<5-17,Cuddy>慢点  有五年了
<5-17,Cuddy>Hold on. Five years?

147
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,920
<5-17,Cuddy>-你为什么不告诉我  -我不知道
<5-17,Cuddy>- Why didn't you tell me about it? - I don't know.

148
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,860
<5-18,Arlene>我们没到能交心的地步吧
<5-18,Arlene>We don't have that kind of relationship.

149
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,600
<5-18,Arlene>这让你很惊讶吗
<5-18,Arlene>Does that really surprise you?

150
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,720
<5-18,Arlene>你不租房子吗
<5-18,Arlene>You're not renting?

151
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,320
<6-1,Foreman>你说有两个人会帮你搬东西的
<6-1,Foreman>You said you had two guys helping you move.

152
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,810
<6-2,Taub>他们抽不开身
<6-2,Taub>They couldn't get out of work.

153
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,480
<6-2,Taub>我得尽量节省开支
<6-2,Taub>I'm trying to economize.

154
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,010
<6-2,Taub>这家宾馆更实惠
<6-2,Taub>This hotel's cheap.

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,250
<6-3,Rachel>好啊
<6-3,Rachel>Hi.

156
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,910
<6-3,Rachel>不好意思  我就是送几封信过来
<6-3,Rachel>I'm sorry. I just wanted to drop off some mail

157
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,380
<6-3,Rachel>顺便跟你谈点事
<6-3,Rachel>and talk to you about something.

158
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,230
<6-4,Taub>进来吧
<6-4,Taub>Of course.

159
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,720
<6-5,Taub>瑞秋
<6-5,Taub>Rache...

160
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,190
<6-6,Rachel>克里斯  我不是为这个来的
<6-6,Rachel>Chris, that's not why.

161
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,400
<6-6,Rachel>我们得向前走了
<6-6,Rachel>We got to move on.

162
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,540
<6-7,Taub>这话什么意思
<6-7,Taub>What does that mean?

163
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,110
<6-7,Taub>你已经向前走了吗
<6-7,Taub>Have you moved on?

164
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,740
<6-7,Taub>和谁  那个菲尔吗
<6-7,Taub>With who? Is it Phil?

165
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,280
<6-8,Rachel>我不想谈这个
<6-8,Rachel>I don't want to talk about this.

166
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,710
<6-8,Rachel>我知道你现在手头有点紧
<6-8,Rachel>I know that you're worried about money.

167
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,670
<6-9,Taub>-你想扯开话题  -对
<6-9,Taub>- You're trying to change the subject. - Yeah,

168
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,150
<6-10,Rachel>我刚才说过
<6-10,Rachel>which you could have gleaned from,

169
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,220
<6-10,Rachel>"我不想谈这个"
<6-10,Rachel>"I don't want to talk about this."

170
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,760
<6-10,Rachel>我给你争取了一次试用机会
<6-10,Rachel>I got you a tryout

171
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,790
<6-10,Rachel>兼职法律诉讼的医学顾问
<6-10,Rachel>to be a part-time medical consultant on lawsuits.

172
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,760
<6-11,Taub>等等  跟你兄弟共事吗
<6-11,Taub>Wait, with your brother?

173
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,280
<6-11,Taub>我们上回见面的情形你都忘了吗
<6-11,Taub>Have you completely forgotten the last time I saw him?

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,910
<6-12,Rachel>都是五年前的事了
<6-12,Rachel>Yeah. That was five years ago.

175
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,680
<6-12,Rachel>杰米那时刚得知你背叛我
<6-12,Rachel>Jamie had just found out that you'd been cheating on me

176
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,920
<6-12,Rachel>勾搭你合伙人的女儿
<6-12,Rachel>with your partner's daughter.

177
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,510
<6-12,Rachel>他当时有点反应过度了  我
<6-12,Rachel>So it's a little overreaction. My--

178
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,750
<6-13,Taub>他打断了我的鼻子还说我
<6-13,Taub>He broke my nose and then called me

179
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,640
<6-13,Taub>是他这辈子见过最差劲的人
<6-13,Taub>the most horrible person he's ever met.

180
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,210
<6-14,Rachel>他不该打断你鼻子的
<6-14,Rachel>He shouldn't have broken your nose.

181
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,170
<7-1,House>现在  短信  来电和邮件
<7-1,House>You know, texts, calls, and emails

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,310
<7-1,House>一个神奇的小机器就都有了
<7-1,House>all go to the same magic device these days.

183
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,590
<7-1,House>而你只需择其一发一条就行了
<7-1,House>You only got to send one.

184
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,260
<7-2,Arlene>那这就更奇怪了
<7-2,Arlene>Then it's even weirder

185
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,610
<7-2,Arlene>从楼上下来怎么要花你那么久的时间呢
<7-2,Arlene>it took you so long to get down here.

186
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,520
<7-3,House>这个嘛  是个令人抓狂的奥秘
<7-3,House>Yeah, that's a crazy mystery.

187
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,480
<7-3,House>好像我没有个部门要管理似的
<7-3,House>It's not like I got a department to run.

188
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,790
<7-4,Arlene>另一台神奇小机器告诉我  铅中毒
<7-4,Arlene>This other magic device tells me that lead poisoning

189
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,890
<7-4,Arlene>-不会引起我所有的症状  -没错
<7-4,Arlene>- wouldn't cause all my symptoms. - True.

190
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,060
<7-5,House>但它会引起其中5%的真实症状
<7-5,House>But it could cause the 5% that are real.

191
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,870
<7-6,Arlene>你认为我是疑病症患者
<7-6,Arlene>You think I'm a hypochondriac?

192
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,100
<7-7,House>不如我这么回答你吧  或许你只是
<7-7,House>Well, let me answer this way-- maybe you're imagining

193
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,900
<7-7,House>在想像我认为你是疑病症患者
<7-7,House>that I think you're a hypochondriac.

194
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,410
<7-8,Arlene>看  我的手开始颤抖了
<7-8,Arlene>Look, my hand just started to shake.

195
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,210
<7-8,Arlene>这是这些关节炎药的副作用
<7-8,Arlene>It's a side effect of these arthritis pills.

196
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,580
<7-8,Arlene>会读标签吗
<7-8,Arlene>Read the label.

197
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,720
<7-9,House>在我把它打出来的时候看到了
<7-9,House>I did... when I was typing it up,

198
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,420
<7-9,House>然后把它贴在了一瓶糖罐上
<7-9,House>right before I slapped it on a bottle of sugar pills.

199
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,090
<7-10,Arlene>你打了张假标签
<7-10,Arlene>You printed a fake label

200
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,460
<7-10,Arlene>就为了证明我是疑病症患者吗
<7-10,Arlene>just to prove I'm a hypochondriac?

201
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,930
<7-11,House>有效吗
<7-11,House>Did it work?

202
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,000
<7-12,Arlene>有效地把你自己给炒了  你个蠢货
<7-12,Arlene>It got you fired, you schmuck.

203
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,830
<8-1,Cuddy>我花了一个小时才让她妥协配合考夫曼医生
<8-1,Cuddy>An hour to convince her to go with Dr. Kaufman,

204
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,040
<8-1,Cuddy>还只因为他主治的是内科
<8-1,Cuddy>and only then because he runs internal medicine.

205
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,670
<8-1,Cuddy>她都不想待在这家医院了
<8-1,Cuddy>She wanted to leave the hospital entirely.

206
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,910
<8-2,House>上帝  身体好转的女士
<8-2,House>My God, a woman getting better

207
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,850
<8-2,House>干嘛不想出院
<8-2,House>wants to leave the hospital?

208
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,070
<8-3,Cuddy>如果她真是有所好转  那也不是因为
<8-3,Cuddy>If she's getting better, it's not because you made her

209
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,080
<8-3,Cuddy>-你把她当傻子耍  -还能因为什么
<8-3,Cuddy>- feel like a fool. - It couldn't be more because.

210
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,580
<8-4,House>如果我没那么做  她会自我诊断出
<8-4,House>If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed herself

211
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,750
<8-4,House>六种新式肿瘤
<8-4,House>with six new forms of cancer.

212
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,550
<8-4,House>她就永远出不了院了
<8-4,House>She'd never leave.

213
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,090
<8-5,Cuddy>应付我生病的母亲已经够我烦的了
<8-5,Cuddy>It's hard enough dealing with my mom being sick.

214
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,290
<8-5,Cuddy>你的这种幼稚行为
<8-5,Cuddy>This juvenile--

215
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:29,860
<4-2,Taub>请说
<4-2,Taub>Yeah?

216
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,110
<8-5,Cuddy>丽莎  你先别紧张
<8-5,Cuddy>Lisa, it's gonna be okay,

217
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,640
<8-6,Kaufman>-她出现心房颤动  心率升至170次  -天
<8-6,Kaufman>- but she's in a-fib at 170. - Oh, God.

218
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,870
<8-8,Kaufman>我觉得我们得趁她没昏倒前做心脏复率
<8-8,Kaufman>I think we should cardiovert while she's unsedated.

219
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,230
<8-9,Cuddy>我马上就过去
<8-9,Cuddy>I'll be right there.

220
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,760
<8-9,Cuddy>房颤  心率170
<8-9,Cuddy>A-fib's at 170.

221
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,980
<8-9,Cuddy>等等
<8-9,Cuddy>Wait.

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,460
<8-10,House>很抱歉她真的病了
<8-10,House>I'm sorry she's sick.

223
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,030
<8-10,House>但我下岗了可不是我的错
<8-10,House>I'm not sorry I'm off the case.

224
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,360
<8-11,Cuddy>你没下岗
<8-11,Cuddy>You're not off the case.

225
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,830
<8-12,House>你不会以为你能说服她...
<8-12,House>You don't think you can convince her--

226
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,600
<8-13,Cuddy>当然不  你继续跟进
<8-13,Cuddy>No, no. You are staying on.

227
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,050
<8-13,Cuddy>她不知道就成
<8-13,Cuddy>She just can't know about it.

228
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,630
<9-1,House>早上好  考夫曼医生
<9-1,House>Top of the morning, Dr. Kaufman.

229
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,370
<9-1,House>你看这样如何
<9-1,House>Here's the deal.

230
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,100
<9-1,House>你把所有图像拷给我
<9-1,House>You copy me on all the imaging.

231
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,940
<9-2,Kaufman>-我来让我的人做测试  -不
<9-2,Kaufman>- I'll have my guys run the lab tests. - No.

232
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,240
<9-3,House>我以为你已经跟卡迪交流过了
<9-3,House>I thought you spoke to Cuddy.

233
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,440
<9-4,Kaufman>没错  我又跟年长版卡迪交流了下
<9-4,Kaufman>Yeah. Then I spoke to the elder Cuddy,

234
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,010
<9-4,Kaufman>她特别强调不要让你参与进来
<9-4,Kaufman>who specifically requested you not be involved.

235
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,380
<9-5,House>听着  考考  你完全能胜任你的工作
<9-5,House>Listen, Kauffy, you are perfectly competent,

236
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,720
<9-5,House>几乎算得上不错了
<9-5,House>bordering on good, even.

237
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,390
<9-5,House>不过你知道我更出色
<9-5,House>But you know I'm better.

238
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,890
<9-5,House>当然你可以把这归结为
<9-5,House>If you want, we can pretend it's 'cause

239
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,390
<9-5,House>我有团队和资源优势
<9-5,House>I got a team and more resources.

240
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,590
<9-5,House>不管怎样  无视我的建议都太疯狂了
<9-5,House>Either way, it'd be crazy to ignore my advice.

241
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,230
<9-6,Kaufman>你不会满足于只提些建议的
<9-6,Kaufman>It's not gonna stop at advice.

242
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,830
<9-6,Kaufman>你会把我排除在外
<9-6,Kaufman>You're gonna start cutting me out,

243
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,230
<9-6,Kaufman>背着我去找你女朋友商量
<9-6,Kaufman>go behind me to your girlfriend.

244
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,630
<9-6,Kaufman>而一旦有什么差池
<9-6,Kaufman>And if something goes wrong,

245
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,000
<9-6,Kaufman>我还得独自面对医疗事故调查
<9-6,Kaufman>still me standing up there alone at the M&M.

246
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,600
<9-6,Kaufman>求你了...
<9-6,Kaufman>Please...

247
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,740
<9-6,Kaufman>离我病人远点
<9-6,Kaufman>Stay away from my patient.

248
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,480
<9-6,Kaufman>哪个按钮
<9-6,Kaufman>Which button?

249
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,080
<9-6,Kaufman>你右手那个
<9-6,Kaufman>The one by your right hand

250
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,480
<9-6,Kaufman>挨着床还有上下
<9-6,Kaufman>with the design of the bed next to it and the arrows

251
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,560
<10-1,Taub>-指示箭头的那个  -你安了窃听器
<10-1,Taub>- pointing up or down. - You bugged the room?

252
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,050
<10-2,House>我问心无愧地承认
<10-2,House>I absolutely, without apology, will admit

253
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,260
<10-2,House>某人确实这样做了
<10-2,House>that someone may have allegedly done so.

254
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,960
<10-3,Masters>看来我们从不道德直接转为违法了
<10-3,Masters>Guess we can pass unethical and skip straight to illegal.

255
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,930
<10-4,House>详情请参加高法最新案例
<10-4,House>Not according to the recent Supreme Court case

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,760
<10-4,House>"不服来咬我啊"
<10-4,House>of bite versus me.

257
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,270
<10-4,House>考夫曼医生还是单身
<10-4,House>Dr. Kaufman's single.

258
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,100
<10-4,House>你知道他是哈佛医学院毕业的吗
<10-4,House>Did you know he went to Harvard Medical School?

259
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,440
<10-4,House>妈  您就消停一会儿行不行
<10-4,House>Mom, stop yenta-ing for one minute!

260
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,540
<10-5,House>如果你喜欢阴郁的调调和不敢负责的软蛋
<10-5,House>If you want gloomy and unable to commit,

261
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,140
<10-5,House>你就和那异教徒混在一起吧
<10-5,House>then stick with the goyishe one.

262
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,210
<10-5,House>这真不道德  我们为啥要听这些
<10-5,House>This is completely unethical. Why are we listening to this?

263
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,550
<10-6,Masters>我知道我很烦  但是我没办法
<10-6,Masters>I know I'm a pain, but it's impossible

264
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,340
<10-6,Masters>-和你们共事如果...  -好吧好吧
<10-6,Masters>- for me to work with you if you-- - Fine, fine!

265
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,190
<10-7,House>就算不听现场  我二十分钟后也会
<10-7,House>Instead of a live stream, I'll get a recap from Cuddy

266
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,190
<10-7,House>从卡迪那知道的--谢谢你拯救了美国
<10-7,House>20 minutes later-- thank you for saving America.

267
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,650
<10-8,Chase>可能是白血病
<10-8,Chase>Could be leukemia.

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,360
<10-8,Chase>肿瘤侵袭骨髓导致贫血
<10-8,Chase>Anemia from taking over the marrow,

<10-8,Chase>肿瘤侵袭心肌导致房颤
<10-8,Chase>a-fib from infiltrating cardiac muscle.

270
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,830
<10-9,Foreman>听上去不错
<10-9,Foreman>Sounds good.

271
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,530
<10-9,Foreman>是啊
<10-9,Foreman>Yeah.

272
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
<10-10,House>我其实希望有别的诊断
<10-10,House>I was really hoping for a different diagnosis--

273
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,900
<10-10,House>某个考夫曼还没想到的
<10-10,House>One that Kaufman hadn't already come up with.

274
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,310
<10-10,House>他刚开始做骨髓活检
<10-10,House>He just started a bone-marrow biopsy.

275
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,440
<10-11,Masters>-那我们就什么都不用做了  -我不用
<10-11,Masters>- So we don't need to do anything. - I don't.

276
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,540
<10-12,House>但你用  去住院部给我们找个新病例来
<10-12,House>You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case.

277
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,620
<10-12,House>过来
<10-12,House>Psst! Whaa!

278
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,800
<10-13,House>鉴别诊断
<10-13,House>Ddx.

279
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,500
<10-14,Foreman>我们刚做完
<10-14,Foreman>Um, we just did it.

280
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,330
<10-15,House>不  我们刚做了个假的
<10-15,House>No, we just did the fake one.

281
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,870
<10-15,House>知道我干嘛让真理仙子知道窃听器的事吗
<10-15,House>Why do you think I let the truth fairy know about the bug?

282
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,910
<10-15,House>我在考验她  她没通过
<10-15,House>I was testing her. She failed.

283
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,410
<10-15,House>她还跟缉毒刑警一样
<10-15,House>She's still a narc.

284
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,440
<10-15,House>硫胺素缺乏症比白血病更符合
<10-15,House>Thiamine deficiency fits better than leukemia.

285
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,910
<10-16,Taub>你觉得她是个酒鬼
<10-16,Taub>You think she's an alcoholic?

286
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,680
<10-17,House>我和艾琳娜吃过饭  我想给她杯金汤力
<10-17,House>I had dinner with Arlene. I mixed her a gin and tonic.

287
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,020
<10-17,House>不过我正好没汤力酒了
<10-17,House>And I'd run out of the tonic,

288
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,920
<10-17,House>我就加了点安眠药
<10-17,House>so I substituted sleeping pills.

289
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,590
<10-17,House>第二天早上  她以为
<10-17,House>Next morning, she assumed

290
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,020
<10-17,House>她意识缺失是因为喝多了
<10-17,House>the blackout was from the drinking.

291
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,360
<10-17,House>有多少老妇人会习惯于
<10-17,House>How many old ladies are used to

292
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,890
<10-17,House>喝晕过去
<10-17,House>passing out from boozing?

293
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,860
<10-17,House>只有酒鬼
<10-17,House>The answer is the boozers.

294
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,600
<10-17,House>我们得偷偷给她吃点硫胺素
<10-17,House>We're gonna have to slip her the thiamine pills.

295
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,800
<10-18,Foreman>那我们得跟卡迪说一声
<10-18,Foreman>We've got to run this by Cuddy.

296
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,980
<10-19,House>我不正为这事儿烦着呢嘛
<10-19,House>Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood?

297
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,480
<11-1,Cuddy>酗酒
<11-1,Cuddy>Alcoholic?

298
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,490
<11-2,House>治疗方法简单  又安全
<11-2,House>Treatment's very easy, safe.

299
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,860
<11-2,House>其实就是些维他命药片嘛
<11-2,House>It's literally a few vitamin pills.

300
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,530
<11-2,House>不仅能修复心脏问题
<11-2,House>It'll fix her heart,

301
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,260
<11-2,House>还不会影响到考夫曼进行的活检
<11-2,House>and it won't interfere with the biopsy Kaufman's running.

302
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,570
<11-2,House>把它们放在抗酸药的药瓶里
<11-2,House>Put 'em in an antacid bottle.

303
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,080
<11-2,House>就告诉她是治胃病的
<11-2,House>Just tell her it's for stomach problems.

304
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,840
<11-3,Cuddy>我得问问她
<11-3,Cuddy>I have to ask her about this.

305
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,110
<11-3,Cuddy>当然  完全同意
<11-3,Cuddy>Of course. Absolutely.

306
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,450
<11-4,House>你问了  她否认
<11-4,House>You'll ask. She'll deny.

307
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,280
<11-4,House>你再问  她觉得被冒犯了
<11-4,House>You'll push it. She'll get offended.

308
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,720
<11-4,House>这和现在情况一模一样
<11-4,House>You'll be exactly where you are now,

309
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,390
<11-4,House>只不过想治她更难了
<11-4,House>except it'll be harder to treat.

310
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,620
<11-4,House>真是个绝妙的主意
<11-4,House>You've absolutely got to do that.

311
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,920
<11-5,Cuddy>她不会骗我的
<11-5,Cuddy>I don't think she'll lie to me.

312
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,990
<11-6,House>过去的五年中
<11-6,House>She just spent the last five years

313
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,790
<11-6,House>她差点就奔向南面墨西哥边境了
<11-6,House>going south of the border down Mexico way.

314
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,900
<11-7,Cuddy>我们是有问题  但是自从父亲过世以后
<11-7,Cuddy>We have our issues, but since dad died,

315
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,970
<11-7,Cuddy>只要直接问  我们都会实话实说的
<11-7,Cuddy>we tell each other the truth when asked directly.

316
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,400
<11-7,Cuddy>这点对我们很重要
<11-7,Cuddy>It's important to us.

317
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,110
<11-8,House>瘾君子没实话
<11-8,House>Addicts lie.

318
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,930
<12-1,Cuddy>我能跟妈单独聊下吗
<12-1,Cuddy>Can I speak to mom alone?

319
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,330
<12-1,Cuddy>为什么
<12-1,Cuddy>Why?

320
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,200
<12-2,Arlene>你吓到我了  丽莎
<12-2,Arlene>You're scaring me, Lisa.

321
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,570
<12-3,Cuddy>妈  我认为你的心脏问题是酗酒造成的
<12-3,Cuddy>Mom, I think your drinking is causing your heart problems.

322
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,940
<12-4,Julia>你是说那杯香槟  她要了...
<12-4,Julia>Is this about the champagne? She ordered--

323
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,150
<12-5,Cuddy>帕特茜和安妮跟我说上周
<12-5,Cuddy>Patsy and Anne told me last week

324
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,250
<12-5,Cuddy>你在博物馆午宴上喝多了
<12-5,Cuddy>you lost control at the museum luncheon.

325
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,820
<12-6,Arlene>你居然背着我去问我朋友
<12-6,Arlene>You're talking to my friends behind my back.

326
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,260
<12-7,Cuddy>我们是关心你  实话实说...
<12-7,Cuddy>We are all concerned. Just tell me honestly...

327
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
<12-7,Cuddy>你最近到底喝了多少酒
<12-7,Cuddy>How much have you been drinking?

328
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,830
<12-8,Arlene>我也许是你的病人  但我还是你妈
<12-8,Arlene>I may be your patient, but I am still your mother.

329
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,370
<12-8,Arlene>我告诉你  我不是酒鬼
<12-8,Arlene>And I'm telling you I am not a drunk.

330
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,480
<12-8,Arlene>好吧
<12-8,Arlene>Okay.

331
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,760
<12-9,Cuddy>这是治胃痛的
<12-9,Cuddy>For your stomach pains.

332
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,520
<13-1,Cuddy>如果再有那样的事
<13-1,Cuddy>If something like that comes up again, just...

333
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,950
<13-1,Cuddy>该做什么就做什么吧
<13-1,Cuddy>Do what you need to do.

334
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,490
<13-2,House>-不用告诉你吗  -是
<13-2,House>- And keep you out of it?  - Yeah.

335
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,330
<13-3,Cuddy>我现在畏首畏尾
<13-3,Cuddy>I am being a coward,

336
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,230
<13-3,Cuddy>这正是为什么医生不应该
<13-3,Cuddy>which is exactly why doctors shouldn't treat

337
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,800
<13-3,Cuddy>治疗自家人的原因
<13-3,Cuddy>their own families.

338
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,360
<13-3,Cuddy>恭喜
<13-3,Cuddy>Congratulations.

339
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,970
<13-3,Cuddy>你又对了
<13-3,Cuddy>You were right, as usual.

340
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,110
<14-1,Jamie>打了你是我考虑欠佳
<14-1,Jamie>The hitting you was not optimal.

341
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,880
<14-1,Jamie>我那时正处理自己的离婚问题
<14-1,Jamie>I was going through my own divorce at the time.

342
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,680
<14-1,Jamie>我这些年一直在做心理治疗
<14-1,Jamie>I have had years of therapy.

343
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,080
<14-1,Jamie>现在我生气时
<14-1,Jamie>Now when I get mad,

344
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,080
<14-1,Jamie>我会做做深呼吸  攥攥压力球
<14-1,Jamie>I do some deep breathing, squeeze my stress ball.

345
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,190
<14-2,Taub>我也算应得的
<14-2,Taub>Hey, I kind of deserved it.

346
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,620
<14-3,Jamie>那肯定
<14-3,Jamie>That's for sure.

347
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,660
<14-3,Jamie>你看这样行不行
<14-3,Jamie>Here's the deal.

348
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,960
<14-3,Jamie>我是做医疗过失保险的
<14-3,Jamie>I do a lot of med-mal insurance.

349
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,660
<14-3,Jamie>我需要一个新的不作证专家
<14-3,Jamie>I need a new non-testifying expert.

350
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,230
<14-3,Jamie>我会给你个案例测试一下
<14-3,Jamie>I'll give you one case as a tryout.

351
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,630
<14-3,Jamie>你做得好我们就签协议
<14-3,Jamie>You kick ass, I put you on retainer.

352

<14-3,Jamie>平均一周15小时  一年的报酬五开头
<14-3,Jamie>Average 15 hours a week, it's 50 a year.

353
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,940
<14-4,Taub>五什么
<14-4,Taub>50 what?

354
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,840
<14-5,Jamie>当然是五万
<14-5,Jamie>You kidding? $50,000.

355
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,910
<14-6,Taub>我接受
<14-6,Taub>I'll take it.

356
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,080
<14-7,Jamie>你也没得讨价还价
<14-7,Jamie>You drive a soft bargain.

357
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,840
<14-7,Jamie>你得签保密协定
<14-7,Jamie>You got to sign an N.D.A.

358
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,050
<14-8,Taub>当然
<14-8,Taub>Sure.

359
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,310
<14-8,Taub>这是...
<14-8,Taub>Is this...?

360
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,420
<14-9,Jamie>这案子我就要处理完了
<14-9,Jamie>Uh, that's a case I'm about to settle.

361
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,990
<14-9,Jamie>我代表一家批萨外送公司
<14-9,Jamie>I rep a giant pizza-delivery company.

<14-9,Jamie>司机撞了个孩子  把他腿撞坏了
<14-9,Jamie>Driver hit that kid, messed up his legs.

363
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,260
<14-10,Taub>还导致了微量脑出血吗
<14-10,Taub>And gave him a microbleed in his brain, right?

364
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,790
<14-11,Jamie>什么  当然没
<14-11,Jamie>What? No.

365
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,330
<14-12,Taub>这个小白点
<14-12,Taub>This little white mark.

366
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,200
<14-13,Jamie>你的前任和那孩子的医生都查过了
<14-13,Jamie>Your predecessor checked, so did the kid's doctors.

367
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,170
<14-13,Jamie>我不知道那是什么  不过孩子没事
<14-13,Jamie>I don't know what that is, but he's fine.

368
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,540
<14-14,Taub>也许  不过如果有任何疑问...
<14-14,Taub>Probably. But if there's any doubt--

369
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,940
<14-15,Jamie>这个案子涉及数百万美元
<14-15,Jamie>It's a multimillion-dollar case.

370
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,410
<14-15,Jamie>我们两天内就要谈妥了
<14-15,Jamie>We're settling in two days.

371
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,140
<14-15,Jamie>别管它了  好吗
<14-15,Jamie>Lay off it, okay?

372
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,150
<14-16,Taub>好  你说的对
<14-16,Taub>Okay. You're right.

373
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,510
<14-16,Taub>我不管了
<14-16,Taub>I'm off.

374
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,930
<15-1,Cuddy>她开始发烧了  38.9度
<15-1,Cuddy>She spiked a fever. It's 102.

375
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,670
<15-2,House>也就是说不是硫胺素缺乏症
<15-2,House>That means I was wrong about the thiamine deficiency.

376
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,630
<15-3,Cuddy>也不是酗酒
<15-3,Cuddy>You were wrong about the alcoholism.

377
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,500
<15-4,House>顶一个
<15-4,House>True dat.

378
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,910
<15-4,House>确实越来越像白血病了
<15-4,House>It's actually looking more and more like leukemia.

379
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,580
<15-5,Cuddy>考夫曼加急了活检  不是癌症
<15-5,Cuddy>Kaufman rushed the biopsies. It's not cancer.

380
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,080
<15-6,House>那还是有好的一面嘛...
<15-6,House>So there's a bright side...

381
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,810
<15-6,House>考夫曼也错了
<15-6,House>Kaufman was wrong too.

382
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,560
<16-1,House>-鉴别诊断  -好吧...
<16-1,House>- Ddx. - Okay...

383
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,640
<16-2,Chase>什么病把卡迪母亲变成了
<16-2,Chase>What disease can turn Cuddy's mother

384
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,280
<16-2,Chase>这位名叫斯图尔特的植物人呢
<16-2,Chase>into a coma patient named Stewart?

385
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,320
<16-3,House>狼疮
<16-3,House>Lupus?

386
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,490
<16-3,House>她妈妈不归我们管了  生活还得继续
<16-3,House>We got fired from that case. We're moving on.

387
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,760
<16-4,Taub>-我们早就下岗了  -那只是病人说的
<16-4,Taub>- We were already fired. - By the patient.

388
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,620
<16-5,House>这次卡迪放话了  这是真下岗了
<16-5,House>This time by Cuddy, so it's real.

389
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,980
<16-5,House>她终于意识到
<16-5,House>She somehow realized that

390
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,660
<16-5,House>她那不可行的做法
<16-5,House>her completely unworkable system

391
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,560
<16-5,House>确实不可行
<16-5,House>was completely unworkable.

392
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,230
<16-5,House>好了  随堂检测
<16-5,House>Okay, pop quiz, hot shots--

393
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,170
<16-5,House>我选植物人小斯不是没有道理的
<16-5,House>I chose vegetable Stew for a reason.

394
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,740
<16-5,House>给你们六十秒  没有提示哦
<16-5,House>You got 60 seconds, no "Hintsies."

395
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,940
<16-6,Foreman>你不跟我们说话了吗
<16-6,Foreman>You're not gonna talk to us?

396
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,920
<16-7,House>没错  你们要 -- 嘿
<16-7,House>Exactly. You're gonna have to -- hey!

397
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,400
<16-7,House>你可以啊
<16-7,House>You're good.

398
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,180
<16-8,Masters>这就是个测验吗
<16-8,Masters>So this is just a test?

399
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,550
<16-9,Foreman>瞳孔静止扩张
<16-9,Foreman>Pupils fixed and dilated--

400
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,540
<16-9,Foreman>瘾君子
<16-9,Foreman>an addict,

401
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,990
<16-9,Foreman>被发现时身边有一瓶空的安眠药
<16-9,Foreman>found with an empty bottle of phenobarb next to him.

402
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,990
<16-9,Foreman>这有什么神秘的  服药过量而已
<16-9,Foreman>How is this a mystery? It's an overdose.

403
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,090
<16-9,Foreman>苯乙哌啶酮
<16-9,Foreman>Glutethimide!

404
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,920
<16-10,Masters>去年开的药
<16-10,Masters>Script filled last year.

405
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,760
<16-10,Masters>可能造成类似瞳孔静止扩张却不会脑死亡
<16-10,Masters>Could mimic fixed and dilated without the brain death...

406
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,630
<16-10,Masters>但他只能自己好起来
<16-10,Masters>Except he'll just get better on his own,

407
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,770
<16-10,Masters>那我们为什么要接这病例
<16-10,Masters>so why would you take this case?

408
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,270
<16-11,Chase>因为豪斯不关心治疗方法
<16-11,Chase>Because House doesn't care about the treatment

409
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,850
<16-11,Chase>只要这病例有趣
<16-11,Chase>as long as the case is interesting.

410
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,210
<16-12,Masters>我抽点血
<16-12,Masters>I'll do a blood draw

411
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,410
<16-12,Masters>然后把苯乙哌啶酮加入到毒素检测当中
<16-12,Masters>and put glutethimide on the tox screen.

412
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,350
<16-12,Masters>真的吗
<16-12,Masters>Really?

413
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,650
<17-1,House>你觉得那病例有意思吗
<17-1,House>You thought that case was interesting?

414
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
<17-2,Chase>看来我们其实没下岗
<17-2,Chase>Oh, guess we're still on Arlene.

415
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,190
<17-3,Foreman>还有其它方法能让马斯特斯别挡道吗
<17-3,Foreman>Aren't there other ways of keeping Masters occupied?

416
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,790
<17-4,House>我的性骚扰学会表示无能为力
<17-4,House>Not according to my sexual harassment seminar.

417
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,100
<18-1,Taub>也许不是多疑病
<18-1,Taub>Maybe it's not hypochondria.

418
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,530
<18-1,Taub>她说她常起疹子
<18-1,Taub>She said she gets a lot of rashes.

419
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,730
<18-1,Taub>加上发烧
<18-1,Taub>Add the fever--

420
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,430
<18-1,Taub>听上去像免疫病  系统性红斑狼疮症
<18-1,Taub>Sounds like autoimmune, S.L.E.

421
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,600
<18-2,House>恭喜恭喜  你终于学会像半瓶醋直晃荡的
<18-2,House>Congratulations, you can think exactly like

422
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,540
<18-2,House>内科医生那样诊断病人
<18-2,House>a semi-competent internist.

423
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,140
<18-2,House>考夫曼正要开始给她用强的松
<18-2,House>Kaufman's starting her on prednisone.

424
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,500
<18-2,House>但她最先出现的是心脏问题
<18-2,House>But the heart problems were first.

425
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,080
<18-3,Foreman>会不会是心内膜炎
<18-3,Foreman>Endocarditis.

426
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,310
<18-4,Chase>听诊时没有杂音吗
<18-4,Chase>With no murmurs?

427
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,730
<18-5,House>通常晚期才会出现杂音
<18-5,House>It's usually a late sign.

428
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,280
<18-6,Chase>心脏超声显示瓣膜完全正常
<18-6,Chase>Echo showed pristine valves.

429
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,550
<18-7,House>只能说明其异常程度不高于仪器分辨率
<18-7,House>Below the resolving threshold.

430
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,520
<18-8,Foreman>考夫曼用强的松治疗
<18-8,Foreman>Kaufman's prednisone

431
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,890
<18-8,Foreman>将抑制她的免疫系统  她也许会有生命危险
<18-8,Foreman>will suppress her immune system--could kill her.

432
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,200
<18-9,Taub>你得告诉他有可能是心内膜炎
<18-9,Taub>You got to tell him it's endocarditis.

433
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,220
<18-10,House>去听听窃听器就知道了
<18-10,House>Check the wiretap.

434
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,430
<18-10,House>给他设计智力的家伙一直在跟他理论呢
<18-10,House>His I.D. guy's been putting the same argument to him.

435
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,870
<18-10,House>如果他说服不了他  你觉得我有可能吗
<18-10,House>He can't convince him. You think I got a better shot?

436
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,130
<18-11,Taub>那我们怎么办
<18-11,Taub>So what do we do?

437
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,710
<18-12,House>我们给她换药
<18-12,House>We switch her meds.

438
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,380
<18-12,House>去找点广谱抗生素的溶液
<18-12,House>We get a solution of broad-spectrum antibiotics,

439
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,850
<18-12,House>注射到一个标着"强的松"的输液袋里
<18-12,House>stick it in an I.V. bag marked for prednisone.

440
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,520
<18-12,House>考夫曼一天也去不了几次
<18-12,House>Kaufman can only be there a few times a day.

441
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,880
<18-12,House>告诉艾琳你是药剂科的  直接把药换了
<18-12,House>Tell Arlene you're from the pharmacy, switch 'em out.

442
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,350
<18-13,Foreman>你疯了吗  把事情搞得太复杂了
<18-13,Foreman>This is nuts. This is way too complicated.

443
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,340
<18-14,House>只是挂一袋点滴而以
<18-14,House>It's hanging an I.V. Bag!

444
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,980
<18-15,Foreman>如果主治医生不知道给她用的是什么药
<18-15,Foreman>If the attending doesn't know what she's on,

445
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,360
<18-15,Foreman>出现用药反应的风险
<18-15,Foreman>the risk of drug reaction--

446
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,540
<18-16,House>哪有什么风险  我们知道他下的所有处方
<18-16,House>What risk? We know how he's treating her.

447
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,380
<18-16,House>我们连窃听器都装了
<18-16,House>We bugged the room.

448
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,030
<18-17,Foreman>这不仅仅涉及能不能掌握信息
<18-17,Foreman>This is not about information!

449
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,860
<18-17,Foreman>我们要做的事情违反医德  违反法律
<18-17,Foreman>We're talking ethical and legal violations

450
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,630
<18-17,Foreman>如此严重的错误  连你都应该觉得恶心
<18-17,Foreman>on a scale that should make even you puke!

451
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,340
<18-18,House>她要死了
<18-18,House>She's dying!

452
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,800
<18-19,Foreman>那我们也不能为了救她统统进监狱
<18-19,Foreman>That doesn't mean we should all go to jail to save her!

453
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,610
<18-19,Foreman>你现在情绪失控
<18-19,Foreman>You're losing control because...

454
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,350
<18-19,Foreman>因为病人是你丈母娘
<18-19,Foreman>this is your girlfriend's mom.

455
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,150
<18-20,Chase>你要跟卡迪商量一下吗
<18-20,Chase>You gonna run this by Cuddy?

456
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,550
<18-20,Chase>不
<18-20,Chase>No.

457
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,490
<18-21,House>她说了不要牵扯到她
<18-21,House>She said to keep her out of it.

458
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,370
<18-21,House>该怎么办就直接去办
<18-21,House>Do what we need to do.

459
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,090
<18-21,House>我知道我要你们去干的事情
<18-21,House>Look, I know what I'm suggesting

460
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,060
<18-21,House>完完全全不靠谱
<18-21,House>is completely screwed up.

461
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,330
<18-21,House>这也是因为出现了现在这种
<18-21,House>That's because this situation

462
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,160
<18-21,House>彻底不靠谱的情况
<18-21,House>is completely screwed up.

463
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,200
<18-21,House>要么干  要么卷铺盖走人
<18-21,House>Do it, or you're fired.

464
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,140
<18-22,Foreman>我们团结一致  他总不能解雇我们所有人
<18-22,Foreman>We stick together, he can't fire all three of us.

465
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
<18-23,Chase>给我一本处方笺
<18-23,Chase>Give me a prescription pad.

466
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,180
<18-24,Foreman>你要那东西干什么
<18-24,Foreman>Why are you doing this?

467
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,430
<18-25,Chase>因为我觉得她得了心内膜炎
<18-25,Chase>Because I think it's endocarditis,

468
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,050
<18-25,Chase>而且我认为强的松会置她于死地
<18-25,Chase>and I think the prednisone will kill her.

469
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,550
<18-25,Chase>我忘带我自己的处方笺了
<18-25,Chase>Now, I forgot my prescription pad.

470
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,230
<19-1,Taub>我是不是人品有问题
<19-1,Taub>Am I a horrible person?

471
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,330
<19-1,Taub>我曾经因为义务参加志愿者活动而获奖
<19-1,Taub>I used to win awards for volunteer work.

472
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
<19-1,Taub>我曾经去危地马拉做腭裂修补手术
<19-1,Taub>I went to Guatemala and fixed cleft palates.

473
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,670
<19-1,Taub>可现在我们却躲在这儿  让奇斯承担风险
<19-1,Taub>Now we're sitting back letting Chase do our dirty work.

474
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,140
<19-2,Foreman>我们选择不参与其中
<19-2,Foreman>We're doing the right thing--

475
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,910
<19-2,Foreman>-是对的  -我分不清对错
<19-2,Foreman>- stay out of it. - I don't know.

476
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,910
<19-3,Taub>我好像对任何事情都无法分清对错
<19-3,Taub>I don't know about anything anymore.

477
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,280
<19-3,Taub>但现在那个小孩的事  瑞秋她兄弟
<19-3,Taub>Then this thing with the kid, Rachel's brother--

478
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,790
<19-4,Foreman>那件事情你也别参和
<19-4,Foreman>Stay out of that too.

479
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,670
<19-5,A>首先  放射科医生说没有出血
<19-5,A>A, radiologists experts,

480
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,920
<19-5,A>人家是专家  跟你不同
<19-5,A>unlike you, said no bleed.

481
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,720
<19-6,B>第二  你自己也不能断定
<19-6,B>B, you yourself said it's probably not.

482
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,090
<19-7,C>第三  你不是那个小孩子的医生
<19-7,C>C, you've got no doctor-patient relationship.

483
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,830
<19-8,D>第四  你会丢掉这份当顾问的工作
<19-8,D>D, you'll lose your consulting job.

484
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,360
<19-9,E>第五  你前妻会杀了你
<19-9,E>E, your ex will kill you.

485
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,270
<19-10,F>第六  我快数不过来了
<19-10,F>F, I'm running out of alphabet here.

486
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,340
<19-11,Foreman>你干好了
<19-11,Foreman>You do it?

487
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,340
<19-12,Chase>我正拿着输液袋往病房走
<19-12,Chase>Had the bag, walking towards the room,

488
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,910
<19-12,Chase>卡迪妹妹跟我打招呼  "奇斯医生你好"
<19-12,Chase>and Cuddy's sister says, "Hey, Dr. Chase."

489
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,940
<19-12,Chase>去年的一次慈善活动上我见过她
<19-12,Chase>I met her at that charity event last year.

490
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,440
<19-12,Chase>这事只能你们两个去干了
<19-12,Chase>One of you two has got to do this.

491
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,610
<19-13,Foreman>那次我也在
<19-13,Foreman>I met Arlene at the same benefit.

492
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,880
<19-13,Foreman>这借口真不错
<19-13,Foreman>Conveniently.

493
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,920
<19-14,Taub>省省吧  别指望我
<19-14,Taub>Come on, don't ask me.

494
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,680
<19-14,Taub>我都不知道我自己怎么想的  是不是
<19-14,Taub>I don't even know if I believe it's endo--

495
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,150
<19-14,Taub>该死  是瑞秋的兄弟
<19-14,Taub>Damn it. It's Rachel's brother.

496
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,790
<19-14,Taub>有个新案子  他想让我帮忙看看
<19-14,Taub>He wants me to check out some new case.

497
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,860
<19-15,Foreman>这借口也很不错呀
<19-15,Foreman>Conveniently.

498
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,060
<19-16,Taub>这是次试用机会  我需要这份工作
<19-16,Taub>It's a tryout. I need this job.

499
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,800
<19-16,Taub>我必须得去
<19-16,Taub>I got to do this.

500
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,330
<19-17,Foreman>你打算撇下我们不管  临阵脱逃
<19-17,Foreman>So you're just gonna ditch us, run off,

501
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,470
<19-17,Foreman>去研究你那个案子
<19-17,Foreman>and work on some other case?

502
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,110
<20-1,Taub>你是帝莫西的妈妈吧
<20-1,Taub>Are you Timothy's mom?

503
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,460
<20-2,Taub>-是呀  -我叫克里斯托弗·陶博
<20-2,Taub>- Yeah. - My name is Christopher Taub.

504
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,350
<20-2,Taub>我是普林斯顿普雷斯波罗医院的医生
<20-2,Taub>I'm a doctor at Princeton Plainsboro.

505
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,820
<20-2,Taub>我看过你儿子的病志
<20-2,Taub>I saw your son's file.

506
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,620
<20-2,Taub>我觉得他可能有一处小范围的脑出血
<20-2,Taub>I think he might have a very small bleed in his brain.

507
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,290
<20-2,Taub>等等  你说你看过他的病志
<20-2,Taub>Wait, you-- you saw his file?

508
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,100
<20-3,Taub>你怎么能知道我们的情况  我从没
<20-3,Taub>H-how do you even know who we are? I never--

509
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,900
<20-3,Taub>你儿子有可能因脑出血而死去
<20-3,Taub>Your son could die of a brain hemorrhage.

510
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,700
<20-3,Taub>今天他得去做个脑血管造影检查
<20-3,Taub>He needs a cerebral angiogram today.

511
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,300
<20-3,Taub>立即开车带他去医院  我在那儿等你
<20-3,Taub>Get in your car and meet me at the hospital.

512
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,340
<20-3,Taub>帝莫西  我们得去趟医院
<20-3,Taub>Timothy, we're gonna go see the doctor.

513
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,320
<21-1,House>一道脑筋急转弯
<21-1,House>Another pop quiz.

514
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,380
<21-1,House>换一袋点滴需要几个愚蠢的医生才能完成
<21-1,House>How many idiot doctors does it take to switch an I.V.?

515
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,390
<21-1,House>我们等的时间越长
<21-1,House>The longer we wait,

516
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,900
<21-1,House>强的松抑制她免疫系统的时间也就越长
<21-1,House>the more the prednisone is gonna kill her immune system.

517
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,500
<21-1,House>现在也别装什么药剂师了
<21-1,House>Forget playing pharmacist.

518
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,110
<21-1,House>丈母娘每天下午都要睡觉
<21-1,House>Mom naps every afternoon.

519
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,740
<21-1,House>在病房门口等着
<21-1,House>Wait by the room.

520
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,670
<21-1,House>等她睡着  想办法把妹妹支开
<21-1,House>When she falls asleep, get the sister out somehow.

521
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,040
<22-1,Masters>卡迪医生你好  有时间吗  我想跟你谈谈
<22-1,Masters>Hi, Dr. Cuddy, is now a good time to talk?

522
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,260
<22-2,Cuddy>我忙着呢
<22-2,Cuddy>Not really.

523
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,150
<22-3,Masters>你还记得你之前找我们去会诊
<22-3,Masters>So, um, you know how you had us consulting

524
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,920
<22-3,Masters>然后又禁止我们继续参诊的事吧
<22-3,Masters>and then stopped having us consult?

525
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,490
<22-4,Cuddy>你怎么还没走
<22-4,Cuddy>Why are you still here?

526
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,320
<22-5,Masters>我感觉你的禁令
<22-5,Masters>Um, well, I think the stopping

527
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,960
<22-5,Masters>似乎不起作用了
<22-5,Masters>might have stopped.

528
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,760
<22-5,Masters>豪斯让我负责一个奇怪的病例
<22-5,Masters>House put me on this weird case

529
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,330
<22-5,Masters>可已没有可用的治疗了
<22-5,Masters>where there's no treatment--

530
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,290
<22-5,Masters>我觉得他是在分散我的注意力
<22-5,Masters>I think maybe to distract me.

531
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
<22-5,Masters>而且他们最近行动很诡秘
<22-5,Masters>Uh, and they've been acting odd.

532
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,200
<22-6,Cuddy>我会去调查一下
<22-6,Cuddy>I'll look into it.

533
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,900
<22-6,Cuddy>谢谢你来告诉我
<22-6,Cuddy>Thank you for coming to me.

534
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,470
<22-7,Masters>我来是因为我担心他打算
<22-7,Masters>Because I'm--I'm worried that he's switching

535
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,290
<22-7,Masters>偷偷换掉你母亲的药物
<22-7,Masters>your mother's medications.

536
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
<22-7,Masters>我问过药剂科了
<22-7,Masters>I checked with the pharmacy--

537
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,110
<22-7,Masters>奇斯医生给我的昏迷病人开了强的松
<22-7,Masters>Dr. Chase got prednisone and antibiotics

538
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,410
<22-7,Masters>和抗生素  显然对他不起作用
<22-7,Masters>for my coma patient, which wouldn't treat him,

539
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,860
<22-7,Masters>但能用来治疗可以导致...
<22-7,Masters>but could treat conditions that cause...

540
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,820
<22-7,Masters>心衰的疾病
<22-7,Masters>heart failure.

541
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,300
<23-1,House>你让我别牵扯到你
<23-1,House>You told me to keep you out of it,

542
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,360
<23-1,House>我该怎么办就怎么办
<23-1,House>do what I needed to do.

543
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,360
<23-1,House>不然那话还有什么意思
<23-1,House>What the hell did you think that meant?

544
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,240
<23-2,Cuddy>我说的是  如果你要偷偷给她
<23-2,Cuddy>I meant, like, if you had to slip her

545
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,020
<23-2,Cuddy>喂几片维生素之类  当然可以
<23-2,Cuddy>a few more vitamin pills or something.

546
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,530
<23-2,Cuddy>现在这可是要出人命的
<23-2,Cuddy>This is life-threatening!

547
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,500
<23-2,Cuddy>是违法的
<23-2,Cuddy>It's illegal.

548
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,140
<23-2,Cuddy>我没想到你会做出这样的事来
<23-2,Cuddy>I wasn't expecting something like this.

549
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,540
<23-3,House>没想到是因为你故意不往那方面想
<23-3,House>Only because you intentionally weren't thinking about it

550
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,670
<23-3,House>因为你不想做任何艰难的决定
<23-3,House>'cause you don't want to make any tough decisions.

551
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,950
<23-4,Cuddy>你肯定是心内膜炎吗
<23-4,Cuddy>Are you completely sure it's endocarditis?

552
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,320
<23-5,House>这算什么问题
<23-5,House>That's not a real question.

553
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,050
<23-5,House>相比较而言  心内膜炎更符合她的症状
<23-5,House>Endocarditis fits better than the alternatives.

554
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,300
<23-5,House>我们想给她用正确的药  但遇到了点困难
<23-5,House>We're having a little trouble hanging the right I.V.

555
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,100
<23-5,House>最快的解决办法是请你来帮忙
<23-5,House>The fastest way is with you help.

556
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,980
<24-1,Cuddy>茱莉娅去哪儿了
<24-1,Cuddy>Where'd Julia go?

557
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,300
<24-2,Arlene>她有一家子人等着照顾呢
<24-2,Arlene>She's got a family.

558
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,180
<24-3,Cuddy>我也有一家子人要照顾呀
<24-3,Cuddy>I've got a family.

559
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,620
<24-4,Arlene>三个孩子加一个老公  这才叫一家子
<24-4,Arlene>Three kids and a husband-- that's a family.

560
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,550
<24-5,Cuddy>你对我的标准总是比茱莉娅高
<24-5,Cuddy>You were always tougher on me than Julia.

561
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,380
<24-5,Cuddy>-这是为什么呀   -我没有
<24-5,Cuddy>- Why is that? - I'm not.

562
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,830
<24-6,Arlene>我还记得你逼着我去争取
<24-6,Arlene>I was thinking about when you made me run

563
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,030
<24-7,Cuddy>学年纪念册的编辑职位  我根本不想去
<24-7,Cuddy>for yearbook editor-- I didn't want to.

564
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,000
<24-7,Cuddy>高三整整一年我没参加任何社交活动
<24-7,Cuddy>I didn't have a social life my whole senior year.

565
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,700
<24-7,Cuddy>你允许茱莉娅做任何她喜欢的事情
<24-7,Cuddy>You let Julia do whatever she wanted.

566
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,350
<24-8,Arlene>我们一定要现在争论你高三的事情吗
<24-8,Arlene>We're debating 12th grade now?

567
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,680
<24-9,Cuddy>就像现在跟那时候不一样似的
<24-9,Cuddy>Like anything's changed.

568
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,340
<24-10,Arlene>丽莎  你到底想要什么
<24-10,Arlene>What do you want, Lisa?

569
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,410
<24-10,Arlene>你想让我告诉你我对你们的爱是一样的
<24-10,Arlene>Do you want to hear I love you both the same?

570
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,580
<24-10,Arlene>这是当然的
<24-10,Arlene>Of course I do.

571
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,620
<24-11,Cuddy>好吧
<24-11,Cuddy>Okay.

572
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,480
<24-12,Arlene>但每到这种时候
<24-12,Arlene>But times like this,

573
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,650
<24-12,Arlene>当我们吵架的时候  总让我感到
<24-12,Arlene>when we argue, it reminds me...

574
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,090
<24-12,Arlene>我跟她更合得来
<24-12,Arlene>I have more in common with her.

575
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,030
<24-12,Arlene>她对我更好
<24-12,Arlene>She's nicer to me.

576
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,100
<24-12,Arlene>我同样地爱你们两个
<24-12,Arlene>I love you both...

577
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,000
<24-12,Arlene>但我更喜欢她
<24-12,Arlene>But I like her more than you.

578
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,750
<25-1,Foreman>我给你打了三个电话
<25-1,Foreman>I called you three times.

579
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,850
<25-2,Taub>我的电话没开
<25-2,Taub>My phone wasn't exactly on.

580
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,520
<25-2,Taub>我准备好在放射科送来血管造影报告后
<25-2,Taub>I figure I'll be getting some angry calls

581
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,580
<25-2,Taub>接到多通骂人的电话
<25-2,Taub>once radiology sends back the angiogram.

582
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,990
<25-3,Foreman>结果已经送回来了
<25-3,Foreman>They already did.

583
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,760
<25-3,Foreman>在这儿呢
<25-3,Foreman>Here...

584
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,430
<25-3,Foreman>你看到的就是这个
<25-3,Foreman>This is what you saw.

585
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,530
<25-3,Foreman>是一处头骨的解剖变异
<25-3,Foreman>It's an anatomical variant of the skull--

586
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,370
<25-3,Foreman>这块骨头紧挨着一条血管
<25-3,Foreman>the bone in proximity to a blood vessel.

587
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,870
<25-3,Foreman>他没什么问题
<25-3,Foreman>There was nothing wrong with him.

588
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,370
<25-3,Foreman>这是第七个原因
<25-3,Foreman>That was reason "G."

589
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,180
<25-4,Taub>对他来说  真是好消息
<25-4,Taub>That's good news for him.

590
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,360
<26-1,Cuddy>-肺子正常吗  -弥散性喘鸣音
<26-1,Cuddy>- Lungs clear? -Diffuse wheezing,

591
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,690
<26-2,Kaufman>胸闷  皮肤瘙痒
<26-2,Kaufman>tightness, pruritis.

592
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,060
<26-3,Cuddy>发生了过敏反应
<26-3,Cuddy>It's an allergic reaction.

593
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,000
<26-4,Kaufman>看起来像是  但这说不通呀
<26-4,Kaufman>Looks like. Doesn't make any sense.

594
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,830
<26-4,Kaufman>给他用着强的松呢
<26-4,Kaufman>She's on prednisone.

595
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,770
<26-4,Kaufman>她怎么可能出现过敏反应
<26-4,Kaufman>How could she get an allergic reaction?

596
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,410
<26-4,Kaufman>我把抗生素换掉了
<26-4,Kaufman>I switched out the antibiotics,

597
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,620
<26-4,Kaufman>重新给她用上了强的松  她呼吸正常了
<26-4,Kaufman>put her back on prednisone-- her breathing's normal.

598
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,450
<27-1,Cuddy>但房颤的症状又出现了  体温也变得更高
<27-1,Cuddy>But the a-fib's back, and her fever's up.

599
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,050
<27-2,Taub>过敏肯定是因为我们给她用的抗生素
<27-2,Taub>Allergy's got to be due to our antibiotics.

600
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,250
<27-3,House>考夫曼知道我们干的这些事吗
<27-3,House>Does Kaufman know what we did?

601
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,440
<27-4,Cuddy>-很好  -不  糟糕极了
<27-4,Cuddy>- That's good. - No, that is terrible!

602
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,120
<27-4,Cuddy>他不知道她情况变差是由于抗生素的原因
<27-4,Cuddy>He doesn't know that she got worse on antibiotics,

603
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,660
<27-4,Cuddy>所以现在他会考虑心内膜炎的可能
<27-4,Cuddy>so now he's thinking endocarditis.

604
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,300
<27-4,Cuddy>他会再一次给她注射
<27-4,Cuddy>He'll put her back on the antibiotics

605
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,900
<27-4,Cuddy>几乎让她窒息的抗生素
<27-4,Cuddy>that almost suffocated her.

606
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,910
<27-4,Cuddy>我们该怎么办
<27-4,Cuddy>What do we do?

607
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,390
<27-5,House>坚持到底
<27-5,House>We push through this.

608
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,970
<27-5,House>一切症状都是心脏引起的
<27-5,House>It started in the heart.

609
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,880
<27-5,House>心内膜炎依旧符合病情
<27-5,House>Endocarditis still fits.

610
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,190
<27-5,House>只是可能是由真菌引起的
<27-5,House>It's just got to be fungal.

611
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,060
<27-5,House>我们得把考夫曼开的抗生素换成
<27-5,House>We have to switch Kaufman's antibiotics

612
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,120
<27-5,House>两性霉素B
<27-5,House>for amphotericin B.

613
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,920
<27-6,Foreman>我不知道你的判断是否正确  无所谓对错
<27-6,Foreman>I don't know if you're right. I don't care.

614
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,420
<27-6,Foreman>如果我们还要继续偷偷换药
<27-6,Foreman>But we are gonna end up killing this woman

615
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,170
<27-6,Foreman>而误导她的主治医生
<27-6,Foreman>if we keep confusing her attending

616
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,150
<27-6,Foreman>她早晚得被我们害死
<27-6,Foreman>with these secret meds.

617
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,800
<27-7,House>我不管她的主治医生有没有被误导
<27-7,House>I don't care about confusing the attending!

618
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,680
<27-7,House>我只要这个病人
<27-7,House>I want this woman--

619
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,080
<27-8,Foreman>我们现在讨论的已不是简单的抗生素了
<27-8,Foreman>We're not talking about simple antibiotics anymore.

620
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,100
<27-8,Foreman>两性霉素B本身就很危险
<27-8,Foreman>Amphotericin B is dangerous in itself.

621
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,200
<27-8,Foreman>它就是种毒药  所以才能杀死真菌
<27-8,Foreman>It's a poison. That's why it kills fungi.

622
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,980
<27-8,Foreman>会让她发烧  打寒颤
<27-8,Foreman>It'll give her fever, chills--

623
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,280
<27-9,House>她已经有这些症状了
<27-9,House>Which she already has,

624
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,490
<27-9,House>正好可以帮助我们隐瞒
<27-9,House>which will help us hide it.

625
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,650
<27-10,Cuddy>我觉得我不能冒这么大的风险
<27-10,Cuddy>I don't think I can take a risk like that.

626
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,730
<27-11,House>那你最开始就不应该让她炒我鱿鱼
<27-11,House>Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me!

627
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,530
<27-11,House>听着  你只要再去换一下她的输液袋
<27-11,House>Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.S again.

628
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
<27-12,Cuddy>这样做已经出过一次状况了
<27-12,Cuddy>This has blown up on you once already.

629
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,080
<27-13,Taub>-他说得对  -是呀
<27-13,Taub>- He's right. - Yep.

630
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,570
<27-14,Chase>给你们惹上这样的麻烦  真对不起
<27-14,Chase>I'm so sorry I got you guys into this.

631
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,780
<27-15,Cuddy>你们可以走了
<27-15,Cuddy>You should go.

632
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,040
<27-16,House>-我是对的  -我知道
<27-16,House>- I'm right. - I know.

633
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,050
<27-17,Cuddy>我会照你说的做  可是
<27-17,Cuddy>And I'll do it, but...

634
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,300
<28-1,Masters>我同意  是真菌性心内膜炎
<28-1,Masters>I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits.

635
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,470
<28-1,Masters>但我们还是要告知你母亲
<28-1,Masters>But we still have to tell your mother.

636
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,500
<28-1,Masters>我不想告诉她  真的不想
<28-1,Masters>I don't want to tell her, not at all.

637
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,350
<28-1,Masters>但病人才是最重要的
<28-1,Masters>But the patient is the highest priority.

638
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,130
<28-2,House>我要把你从你自己的办公室里驱逐出去
<28-2,House>I'm kicking you out of your office.

639
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,250
<28-2,House>没错  就是你
<28-2,House>Yes, you.

640
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,800
<28-2,House>这里还不是她的办公室呢
<28-2,House>This is not her office yet.

641
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,190
<28-2,House>你敢透露给任何人
<28-2,House>If you tell anyone,

642
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,320
<28-2,House>我就让医学院开除你
<28-2,House>I will get you thrown out of med school,

643
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,540
<28-2,House>毁掉你的职业前途
<28-2,House>and I will destroy your career.

644
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,510
<28-3,Masters>我考虑过了
<28-3,Masters>I've thought about that.

645
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,680
<28-3,Masters>撒谎害我
<28-3,Masters>Lying about me...

646
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,540
<28-3,Masters>是没用的
<28-3,Masters>won't work.

647
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,180
<28-3,Masters>所有人都知道你的作风
<28-3,Masters>Everybody knows your reputation.

648
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,010
<28-3,Masters>没错
<28-3,Masters>True...

649
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
<28-4,House>可我用不着撒谎
<28-4,House>But I won't have to lie.

650
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,750
<28-4,House>在你那位昏迷病人厚厚的资料中
<28-4,House>Buried in your coma patient's big, big file

651
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,420
<28-4,House>有一张表
<28-4,House>is a form that doesn't allow treatment

652
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:11,750
<28-4,House>写着未经家属同意不得治疗
<28-4,House>without the expressed consent of the relatives.

653
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,070
<28-6,House>-等等  -你抽了他的血
<28-6,House>- Wait... - You drew blood.

654
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,910
<28-6,House>这可不止是医疗失误
<28-6,House>And that's not just a screwup.

655
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,040
<28-6,House>而是伤害罪
<28-6,House>It's criminal assault.

656
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,720
<28-8,House>-可你让我  -我没有  你该记得的
<28-8,House>- But you told me - No. As you may recall...

657
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,090
<28-9,Masters>你陷害我
<28-9,Masters>You set me up?

658
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,060
<28-9,Masters>为什么
<28-9,Masters>Why?

659
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,600
<28-10,House>因为这位病人对我至关重要
<28-10,House>Because this patient is the highest priority.

660
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,240
<29-1,Jamie>你让她以为我隐瞒了她儿子的病情
<29-1,Jamie>You made her think i was hiding her son being sick!

661
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,990
<29-1,Jamie>她撕毁协议  还向律师协会告发我
<29-1,Jamie>She scuttled the settlement. She reported me to the bar.

662
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,350
<29-1,Jamie>我现在官司缠身
<29-1,Jamie>I got to deal with that crap now.

663
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,590
<29-1,Jamie>我要告你诽谤  侵权干扰
<29-1,Jamie>I will sue you for slander, for tortious interference,

664
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,820
<29-1,Jamie>用所有我能想到的手段毁了你
<29-1,Jamie>and anything else I can use to destroy you.

665
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:50,150
<29-1,Jamie>还有  瑞秋说她不想见到你
<29-1,Jamie>Oh, and my sister says stay out of her life...

666
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,450
<29-1,Jamie>你这败类
<29-1,Jamie>You failure.

667
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,000
<29-1,Jamie>五年的理疗白费了
<29-1,Jamie>Five years of therapy.

668
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,580
<29-1,Jamie>考夫曼医生
<29-1,Jamie>Dr. Kaufman?

669
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,980
<30-1,Masters>我需要跟你和病人单独谈谈
<30-1,Masters>I need to speak with you and the patient alone.

670
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,220
<30-1,Masters>我要越过审查委员会
<30-1,Masters>I'm skipping the credentials committee.

671
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,990
<30-1,Masters>直接向州管理局
<30-1,Masters>I'm going straight to the State Board

672
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,170
<30-1,Masters>举报你的...
<30-1,Masters>and reporting you for...

673
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,950
<31-1,Kaufman>你所作所为如此恶劣
<31-1,Kaufman>what you've done is so off the spectrum,

674
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,690
<31-1,Kaufman>我都不知道该怎么形容
<31-1,Kaufman>I don't know there's a specific name for it.

675
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
<31-2,House>他好像是在跟你说话
<31-2,House>I think he's talking to you.

676
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,090
<31-3,Cuddy>马帝  冷静
<31-3,Cuddy>Marty, calm down.

677
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,890
<31-4,Kaufman>还有你  你更过分
<31-4,Kaufman>And you--what you did is worse.

678
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,340
<31-4,Kaufman>他是精神失常的疯子
<31-4,Kaufman>He's an insane lunatic.

679
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,840
<31-4,Kaufman>可你是院长啊
<31-4,Kaufman>You're the Dean of Medicine!

680
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,130
<31-5,Arlene>我不许你再插手我的治疗
<31-5,Arlene>I want you off my case.

681
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,800
<31-6,Kaufman>这就对了
<31-6,Kaufman>That's exactly right.

682
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,360
<31-7,Arlene>别高兴得太早  你也给我走人
<31-7,Arlene>Don't get excited. You're fired too.

683
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,380
<31-9,Arlene>-什么  -只要我留在这家医院
<31-9,Arlene>- What? - I'll never get away from House or my daughter

684
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,700
<31-9,Arlene>就永远别想摆脱我女儿和豪斯
<31-9,Arlene>if I stay here.

685
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,620
<31-9,Arlene>把我转到普林斯顿综合医院
<31-9,Arlene>Transfer me to Princeton General.

686
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,080
<31-9,Arlene>妈
<31-9,Arlene>Mom...

687
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,020
<31-10,Cuddy>你病得很重  而且极度气恼
<31-10,Cuddy>You're very ill, and you're very angry.

688
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,590
<31-10,Cuddy>你觉得现在
<31-10,Cuddy>You really think now is the right time

689
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,860
<31-10,Cuddy>做这种决定合适吗
<31-10,Cuddy>to make a decision like this?

690
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,290
<31-11,Arlene>你欺骗背叛了我
<31-11,Arlene>You lied to me and betrayed me.

691
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,510
<31-11,Arlene>你觉得
<31-11,Arlene>Do you think I really care

692
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,920
<31-11,Arlene>我会在乎你的意见吗
<31-11,Arlene>what you consider a good idea anymore?

693
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,150
<31-12,Cuddy>我去安排救护车
<31-12,Cuddy>I'll get the ambulance.

694
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,150
<31-13,House>高兴了吗
<31-13,House>Happy?

695
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,450
<32-1,Cuddy>怎么会这样
<32-1,Cuddy>I can't believe it.

696
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,020
<32-1,Cuddy>这是怎么回事
<32-1,Cuddy>What just happened?

697
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,480
<32-2,House>你刚刚害死了她
<32-2,House>You just killed her.

698
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,620
<32-3,Cuddy>你还怪我
<32-3,Cuddy>Are you blaming me?

699
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,870
<32-3,Cuddy>全都是因为你的傲慢自负
<32-3,Cuddy>This is all because you're so arrogant,

700
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,440
<32-3,Cuddy>是你刺激她炒掉你的
<32-3,Cuddy>you goaded her into firing you!

701
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,440
<32-4,House>事实上  我的错误是从被炒掉之后开始的
<32-4,House>Actually, my mistakes started a little after that,

702
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,650
<32-4,House>我错就错在同意了你的天才决定
<32-4,House>when I agreed to your brilliant scheme

703
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,190
<32-4,House>在被炒掉之后仍然越俎代庖
<32-4,House>to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it.

704
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,250
<32-5,Cuddy>不这样她可能会转院
<32-5,Cuddy>She would have left the hospital.

705

<32-6,House>要你同意她才能转  就像刚才那样
<32-6,House>Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now.

<32-7,Cuddy>你以为我控制得了她

<32-10,House>她伤害你  你就跟我抱怨
<32-10,House>She insults you, you complain to me.

<32-10,House>宴会上我给她下药  你没告诉她
<32-10,House>I drug her at dinner, you never let her know.
