<7-3,House>我看起来像在干嘛? 挑战恶势力
<7-3,House>What does it look like I'mabcdoing? Fighting the power.

119
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,590
<7-3,House>感觉得到吗? 很不错吧?
<7-3,House>Feel that? How cool is that?

120
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,140
<7-4,Ellie>很显然你的母亲abc并不在乎你失去了些什么
<7-4,Ellie>Apparently your momabcdoesn't care what you're missing.

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,020
<7-4,Ellie>你是个混蛋
<7-4,Ellie>You're an ass.

122
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,410
<7-4,Ellie>他说他的腰部感觉到了振动abc而不是手
<7-4,Ellie>He says he feels the vibrationsabcin his abdomen, but not his hands.

123
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,240
<7-4,Ellie>这意味着什么?
<7-4,Ellie>What does that mean?

124
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,840
<7-5,House>这是一种新的症状 神经病变
<7-5,House>It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.

125
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,770
<7-6,Amber>我以为你要去睡一会
<7-6,Amber>Thought you were gonna get some sleep.

126
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,750
<7-7,House>病例变有趣了
<7-7,House>Case got interesting.

127
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,530
<8-1,House>多像个动物园
<8-1,House>Like the zoo.

128
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,160
<8-1,House>除了可以在玻璃上随便敲之外
<8-1,House>Except you can bang on theabcglass as much as you want.

129
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,720
<8-2,Foreman>你怎么会知道神经病变的?
<8-2,Foreman>How did you know about the neuropathy?

130
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,860
<8-3,House>真是个好问题
<8-3,House>Good question.

131
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,790
<8-4,Foreman>别打哑谜了
<8-4,Foreman>Enough with the riddles.

132
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,060
<8-5,House>告诉我
<8-5,House>Tell me about it.

133
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,670
<8-6,Amber>想想"摔跤记录"
<8-6,Amber>Think "wrestling record."

134
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,410
<8-7,House>欺诈
<8-7,House>Juggling.

135
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,860
<8-7,House>不 双肩着地 三次双肩着地
<8-7,House>No, pins. Three pins.

136
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,640
<8-7,House>病人在过去的三场比赛中abc都被对手双肩压地
<8-7,House>Patient was pinned inabchis last three matches.

137
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,610
<8-7,House>导致了他的比分
<8-7,House>Leading up to that,he was 15 and 0.

138
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,800
<8-7,House>我猜感觉敏感度降低使得他丧失了平衡
<8-7,House>I figured his balance wasabcoff from diminished sensation.

139
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,310
<8-8,Foreman>可能是脑瘤导致的颅内压升高
<8-8,Foreman>Could be increasedabcicp from a brain tumor.

140
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,010
<8-9,House>在头部CT里漏看了这个?
<8-9,House>That we missed on the head ct?

141
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,390
<8-10,Thirteen>为摔跤减肥可能导致横纹肌溶解
<8-10,Thirteen>Cutting weight for wrestlingabccould have led to rhabdomyolysis.

142
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,480
<8-11,House>他三个月前刚刚提升了一个重量级
<8-11,House>He just went up a weightabcclass three months ago.

143
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,720
<8-12,Amber>Foreman是对的
<8-12,Amber>Foreman's right.

144
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,290
<8-13,House>实际上 颅内压升高可以解释问题
<8-13,House>Actually, increased icp could make sense.

145
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,970
<8-15,House>- 你刚才说...abc- 我当时在思考
<8-15,House>- You just said--abc- I was processing.

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,990
<8-16,Amber>这也使一个新症状浮现出来
<8-16,Amber>It also puts a new symptom on the table.

147
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,310
<8-17,House>他的失聪
<8-17,House>His deafness.

148
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,600
<8-17,House>如果是Ⅱ型神经纤维瘤abc而不是他小时候得的脑膜炎导致的呢?
<8-17,House>What if it was caused by nf2 cancerabcinstead of his childhood meningitis?

149
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,440
<8-18,Foreman>那么说脑膜炎是一种巧合?
<8-18,Foreman>So meningitis was a coincidence?

150
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,840
<8-19,House>或者是肿瘤抑制免疫系统后的副产品
<8-19,House>Or a byproduct of theabccancer suppressing his immune system.

151
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,830
<8-19,House>给他做头部的核磁共振
<8-19,House>Mri his head.

152
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,070
<8-20,Taub>如果按你说的是神经纤维瘤病Ⅱ型abc他的耳聋也许可治
<8-20,Taub>If you're right about nf2,hisabcdeafness may be reversible.

153
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,410
<8-20,Taub>我安排好 跟病人谈谈
<8-20,Taub>I'll set it up and talk to the patient.

154
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,240
<8-21,House>你俩... 有空不?
<8-21,House>You two... doing anything?

155
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,670
<9-1,Foreman>你知道什么是"破碎牛仔"?
<9-1,Foreman>You know what a broken cowboy is?

156
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,720
<9-1,Foreman>House列的任务清单上有
<9-1,Foreman>It was on house's list of requirements.

157
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,450
<9-2,Thirteen>我想到三种可能
<9-2,Thirteen>I have three theories.

158
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,510
<9-3,Foreman>为什么House如此上心abc这个单身派对的事?
<9-3,Foreman>Why is house so into thisabcbachelor party thing?

159
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,400
<9-4,Thirteen>他对单身派对着迷还需要理由?
<9-4,Thirteen>He needs to have a reason toabcbe into a bachelor party?

160
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,710
<9-5,Foreman>他做很多事都是有理由的
<9-5,Foreman>He needs a reason to be into anything.

161
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,880
<9-6,Thirteen>把你钱包给我
<9-6,Thirteen>Give me your wallet.

162
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,170
<9-7,Foreman>House可能是想怂恿Chase出轨abc害他们分手
<9-7,Foreman>House could be trying to temptabcchase into cheating. Break them up.

163
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,660
<9-8,Thirteen>你认为House喜欢Cameron?
<9-8,Thirteen>You think house is into cameron?

164
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,180
<9-9,Foreman>我认为House喜欢Cameron喜欢他
<9-9,Foreman>I think house is intoabccameron being into him.

165
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,990
<9-9,Foreman>她嫁给Chase就会粉碎这个幻想
<9-9,Foreman>Marrying chase wouldabcshatter that fantasy.

166
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,500
<9-10,Thirteen>如果Chase真出轨abc那他们本就不该结婚
<9-10,Thirteen>If chase cheats, then they shouldn'tabcbe gettingvmarried in the first place.

167
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,380
<9-11,Foreman>这么说你觉得 House灌醉Chaseabc鼓动他犯错 没有问题?
<9-11,Foreman>So you're okay with house getting chaseabcsmashed enough to make a stupid mistake?

168
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,410
<9-12,Thirteen>醉酒不会改变你abc只会显出你的本性
<9-12,Thirteen>Being drunk doesn'tvchange whoabcyou are. It just reveals it.

169
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,680
<9-13,Foreman>你觉得她能做"破碎牛仔"不?
<9-13,Foreman>You think she can do the broken cowboy?

170
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,400
<9-14,Thirteen>老天 但愿她能
<9-14,Thirteen>God, I hope so.

171
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,820
<10-1,Taub>神经纤维瘤病Ⅱ型是种极其慢性的癌症abc可治愈性很大
<10-1,Taub>Nf2 is an extremelyvslow-grongabccancer, which makes it very treatable.

172
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,830
<10-1,Taub>如果诊断正确 取出肿瘤后abc你也许能恢复听力
<10-1,Taub>If we're right,taking out the tumor meansabcthere's a chance you'll regain your hearing.

173
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,580
<10-3,Ellie>不 他说你必须做
<10-3,Ellie>No. He said you have to.

174
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,230
<10-4,Taub>怎么了?
<10-4,Taub>What's wrong?

175
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,440
<10-5,Ellie>他希望你治疗癌症 但让他保持耳聋
<10-5,Ellie>He wants you to treat theabccancer, but leave him deaf.

176
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,390
<10-6,Taub>呃 抱歉 不是想怎样就怎样的
<10-6,Taub>Uh, sorry. Doesn't work like that.

177
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,210
<10-7,Laura>没事的
<10-7,Laura>It'll be okay

178
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,900
<10-8,Seth>我会不得不转校
<10-8,Seth>I'd have to change schools.

179
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,150
<10-8,Seth>很可能再见不到你
<10-8,Seth>I'd barely see you.

180
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,070
<10-9,Laura>如果不治好病
<10-9,Laura>You won't see me at all

181
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,990
<10-9,Laura>你可能根本见不到我了
<10-9,Laura>unless you get better

182
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,650
<11-1,Taub>照影显示颅内压稍高abc但神经附近无异物
<11-1,Taub>Imaging shows slightly elevated icp,abcbut no masses on or around the nerves.

183
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,390
<11-1,Taub>不是癌症
<11-1,Taub>It's not cancer.

184
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,830
<11-2,House>第四脑室壁有轻微弯折
<11-2,House>Slight bowing in theabcwall of the fourth ventricle.

185
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,060
<11-2,House>还是有肿瘤的可能
<11-2,House>Could still indicate a tumor.

186
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,490
<11-3,Foreman>我们拍了照
<11-3,Foreman>We brought pictures.

187
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,810
<11-4,Thirteen>你让我做这个侦察任务--
<11-4,Thirteen>The fact that you sentabcme on a scouting mission--

188
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,040
<11-5,Amber>不准有女人
<11-5,Amber>No skirts.

189
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,480
<11-6,House>没邀请你
<11-6,House>You're not on the guest list.

190

<11-6,House>单身派对是古老又神圣的男性仪式
<11-6,House>Bachelor parties are an ancient andabcsacred male ritef passage.

191
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,600
<11-7,Taub>脑室弯折可能是原本存在的结构异常
<11-7,Taub>The ventricle bowing is most likelyabca pre-existing anatomical anomaly,

192
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,800
<11-7,Taub>而非肿瘤的迹象
<11-7,Taub>not the indication of a tumor.

193
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,720
<11-8,Thirteen>不做脑部活检就不可能确诊
<11-8,Thirteen>No way to know forabcsure without a brain biopsy.

194
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,160
<11-8,Thirteen>如果喝够多酒abc我很可能会上一个脱衣舞女
<11-8,Thirteen>If I get drunk enough,there's a chance Iabcmight make out with one of the strippers.

195
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,170
<11-8,Thirteen>或者成为一个
<11-8,Thirteen>Or become one.

196
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,220
<11-9,House and Amber>成交
<11-9,House and Amber>Sold.

197
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,310
<11-10,Taub>我们不能仅凭直觉就在病人脑袋上打洞
<11-10,Taub>We can't just drill into ourabcpatient's brain on a hunch.

198
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,640
<11-11,House and Amber>哦 老天 不要她
<11-11,House and Amber>Oh, god, not her.

199
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,320
<11-12,House>就是她害我上了麦道夫的当
<11-12,House>She's the one that gotabcme hooked in with madoff.

200
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,030
<11-13,Foreman>Taub是对的 不是癌症
<11-13,Foreman>Taub's right. It's not cancer.

201
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,520
<11-14,House>是 不惜一切 放弃一个诊断abc就因为它难以被证明
<11-14,House>Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnosticabctheory because it's difficult to prove.

202
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,940
<11-14,House>做活检 我们需要看到abc第四脑室更清晰的图像
<11-14,House>Do a biopsy. We need to take aabcbetter look at his fourth ventricle.

203
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,420
<11-15,Amber>或者只是早先的图像
<11-15,Amber>Or an older look.

204
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,440
<11-16,Taub>他母亲绝不可能在毫无缘由的情况下abc同意我们开脑
<11-16,Taub>The mom's never gonna let us touchabchis brain without some evidence.

<11-17,Amber>Patient broke his nose years ago.abcHospital could have done an mri.

206
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,060
<11-18,House>好吧
<11-18,House>Okay.

207
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,140
<12-1,Wilson>我第三个妻子和我私奔abc主要是为了逃避House办的单身派对
<12-1,Wilson>The main reason my third wife and Iabceloped was to avoid house's bachelor party.

208
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,280
<12-1,Wilson>你看过"罗马帝国情艳史"没?
<12-1,Wilson>Have you seen caligula?

209
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,540
<12-2,House>我病人现在的大脑图像...
<12-2,House>My patient's brain now...

210
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,560
<12-2,House>和3年前的比对 任何差异?
<12-2,House>versus three yearsabcago. See any difference?

211
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,260
<12-2,House>他在说服你不要这个派对?
<12-2,House>Is he telling you to avoid the party?

212
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,060
<12-3,Wilson>我宣誓过不做任何伤害
<12-3,Wilson>I took an oath to do no harm.

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,670
<12-4,House>好啊 那就别来
<12-4,House>Sure, don't come.

214

<12-4,House>如果你希望你的婚礼誓言变得毫无意义
<12-4,House>If you want your weddingabcvows to be meaningless.

215
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
<12-5,Chase>这话另有深意啊
<12-5,Chase>This should be interesting.

216
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,660
<12-6,House>你将向一个特别的女人许诺终身abc这很美好
<12-6,House>You are going to commit to that oneabcspecial woman forever, which is beautiful.

217
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,400
<12-6,House>但如果你的许诺在婚礼前后并无区别
<12-6,House>But if your commitment the day after the weddingabcis the same as your commitment the day before,

218
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,190
<12-6,House>那婚礼的意义何在
<12-6,House>then the wedding meant nothing.

219
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,110
<12-6,House>这里没有任何逻辑问题abc所以如果你希望你的婚姻有所意义
<12-6,House>So, and I seeno logical way aroundabcthis, if you want your marriage to matter,

220
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,510
<12-6,House>你必须在婚前变成一个abc肆无忌惮 尽情放纵 淤泥覆盖的混球
<12-6,House>you have to be a wanton,trolling,abcmuck-covered pig the day before.

221
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,770
<12-7,Chase>你个恶魔 回见
<12-7,Chase>You're evil. See ya.

<12-8,Wilson>第四脑室壁改变了abc老图像中 它没有弯折
<12-8,Wilson>The wall of the ourth ventricle changed.abcIt isn't bowed in the older scan.

223
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,530
<12-9,House>说明是神经纤维瘤病Ⅱ型 对吧?
<12-9,House>Evidence of nf2, right?

224
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,400
<12-10,Wilson>你需要做个脑部活检确诊
<12-10,Wilson>You'd need to do aabcbrain biopsy to confirm.

225
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,990
<12-10,Wilson>嗯 我不会去那个单身派对abc每次参加你举办的派对
<12-10,Wilson>Uh, I'm not going to the bachelorabcparty.Every time I go to one of your parties,

226

227
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,160
<12-11,House>和鸭子那事 很难说是难以预见啊

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,250
<25-3,Amber>实际上 我们挽救了他的性命
<25-3,Amber>Actually, I think we just saved it.

453
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,860
<25-4,House>看看这个 心律不齐
<25-4,House>Look at that. Arrhythmia.

454
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,910
<25-4,House>你关于心脏的判断是对的
<25-4,House>You were right about the heart.

455
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,850
<26-1,Foreman>当初应该听你的
<26-1,Foreman>Should have listened to you.

456
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,590
<26-2,House>正确的说法是 "啥时都该听你的"
<26-2,House>The correct phrasing would be,abc"I should always listen to you."

457
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,300
<26-3,Taub>他全身都有问题 什么东西会到处跑?
<26-3,Taub>He's got problems everywhere.abcWhat goes everywhere?

458
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,130
<26-4,Thirteen>血液 可能是血小板增多症
<26-4,Thirteen>Blood. Could be thrombocythemia.

459
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,250
<26-4,Thirteen>过多的血小板在全身形成凝块
<26-4,Thirteen>Excess platelets lead toabcclotting throughout the body.

460
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,620
<26-5,Foreman>血小板计数正常
<26-5,Foreman>Not with a normal platelet count.

461
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,730
<26-6,Taub>那么说凝块最先不是出现在血液abc而是出现在肺部-- 肺血管栓塞
<26-6,Taub>So the clotting doesn't start in the blood,abcit starts in the lungs--pulmonary embolism.

462
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,750
<26-7,Foreman>得做个肺通气灌注扫描abc看看他的肺有没问题
<26-7,Foreman>Should do a vq scan,seeabcif his lungs are clear.

463
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,230
<26-8,House>去吧
<26-8,House>Go.

<27-1,House>You sure I did this at wilson's party?

465
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,360
<27-2,Amber>上次你用的是谷酒而不是茴香酒
<27-2,Amber>The last time,you used grainabcalcohol instead of the sambuca.

466
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,720
<27-3,House>那也行?
<27-3,House>And it worked?

467
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,840
<27-6,Amber>难怪那天晚上我眉毛少一截
<27-6,Amber>Explains my lack of eyebrows byabcthe end of the evening.

468
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,240
<27-3,House>万能天神 赐我力量 我--abc漫画"太空超人"
<27-3,House>By the power ofabcgrey skull, I--

<27-4,Amber>你有没想过 每次病人abc病情加重时都发生了什么事?
<27-4,Amber>Ever wonder what's happeningabcevery time our patient gets sicker?

471
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,500
<27-5,House>- 要想也不是现在!abc- 首个症状在他摔跤时出现
<27-5,House>- Not right now!abc- First symptom, wrestling.

472

<27-6,Amber>接下来 是在癫痫实验室的灯光下
<27-6,Amber>Then, under the lights ofabcthe seizure lab--

473
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,110
<27-7,House>你有结论麻烦赶紧说 因为这感觉--
<27-7,House>Are you going somewhere withabcthis, because this feels--

<27-8,Amber>接下来 是处在失明的压力下
<27-8,Amber>Then, under the stress of blindness...

476
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,210
<27-8,Amber>还有术后发烧
<27-8,Amber>and post-op fever.

477
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,550
<27-8,Amber>这些症状有什么共同点?
<27-8,Amber>What do all the symptoms have in common?

478
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,930
<27-9,House>发热
<27-9,House>Heat.

479
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,300
<27-9,House>要是没你 这点子该直接跳进我脑袋
<27-9,House>See, if you hadn't been here, thatabcwould have just popped into my head.

480
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,810
<27-9,House>那样的话就显得我酷多了
<27-9,House>Which actually wouldabchave been way cooler.

481

<27-11,House>Not before I've added "chemicalabcburns" to this guy's cause of death.
