00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,270
<5-26,Taub>我们会盯着的 他不会再回来了
<5-26,Taub>We'll keep an eye out.He's not getting back into the hospital.

115
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,400
<5-27,Valerie>这些都是他编出来的 你知道对吗?
<5-27,Valerie>He's making all that up.You know that,right?

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,750
<5-28,Bill>是的 当然
<5-28,Bill>Yeah,of course.

117
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,290
<6-2,House>- 你在那里? - 不可泄露地点
<6-2,House>- Where are you? - Undisclosed location.

118
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,680
<6-3,Taub>你在躲谁?
<6-3,Taub>Who are you hiding from?

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,940
<6-3,Taub>Wilson
<6-3,Taub>Wilson.

120
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,980
<6-4,House>还有那个午餐约会 Wilson肯定在努力促成
<6-4,House>And the lunch date that wilson is,no doubt,right now trying to sic on me.

121
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,620
<6-4,House>但在我们这场伟大的棋局似的关系中
<6-4,House>But in the great game of chess that is our relationship,

122
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,880
<6-4,House>Wilson只能看到下一步 我却能看到下几十步
<6-4,House>wilson sees only one move ahead.I see dozens.

123
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,710
<6-4,House>那也是为什么他永远配不上我
<6-4,House>That is why   he will never mate me.

124
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,160
<6-4,House>这是象棋词汇
<6-4,House>That's a chess term.

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,820
<6-5,Foreman>好极了 一名同事当面对质我们的病人
<6-5,Foreman>That's great.A co-worker confronted our patient.

126
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,670
<6-5,Foreman>精神不稳定 指责她对他下毒
<6-5,Foreman>Altered mental status.Basically accused her of poisoning him.

127
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,600
<6-5,Foreman>我们认为他把自己投射到她身上
<6-5,Foreman>We think he was projecting.

128
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,370
<6-6,House>所以是他对她下毒
<6-6,House>So he's poisoning her.

129
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,480
<6-7,Chase>他能弄到什么药物导致室上性心跳过速?
<6-7,Chase>What could he get his hands on to cause supraventricular tachycardia?

130
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,200
<6-8,House>他皮肤干燥吗? 眉毛稀疏?
<6-8,House>Does he have dry skin?Thin eyebrows?

131
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,710
<6-8,House>如果你们正瞠目结舌 请大声一点
<6-8,House>If you're sharing an amazed look,please do it louder.

132
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,520
<6-9,Taub>- 好像是有 - 你怎么知道的?
<6-9,Taub>- he might have. - How did you know that?

133
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,880
<6-10,House>如果他有甲状腺功能减退 而他把他的药放在她的咖啡里
<6-10,House>If he has hypothyroidism and he dumped his meds in her coffee,

134
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,580
<6-10,House>那会让她的心脏狂跳 往死里跳
<6-10,House>that would make her heart go boom.In a bad way.

135
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,630
<6-11,Foreman>我们给她用β-受体阻滞药
<6-11,Foreman>We'll treat with beta blockers.

136
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,060
<6-12,Thirteen>对不起 但我完全不同意
<6-12,Thirteen>I'm sorry,but I totally disagree.

137
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,420
<6-13,Chase>- 不同意什么? - 所有一切
<6-13,Chase>- With what? - With everything.

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,690
<6-14,Thirteen>为什么我们假设他在说谎而她在讲真话?
<6-14,Thirteen>Why are we assuming he's lying and she's telling the truth?

139
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,290
<6-15,Foreman>因为她很个成功的 婚姻幸福的高级顾问
<6-15,Foreman>Because she's a successful,happily married consultant,

140
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,520
<6-15,Foreman>而他是个疯疯颠颠 醉醺醺的古怪人 我们刚才把他赶出了医院
<6-15,Foreman>and he's a crazy,drunk weirdo who we just tossed out of the hospital.

141
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,020
<6-17,Thirteen>- 而且她很辣 - 也许就是因为他脆弱她才选择他
<6-17,Thirteen>- And she's hot. - Maybe she picked him   because he's vulnerable.

142
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,550
<6-17,Thirteen>她一定有问题 我能感觉到
<6-17,Thirteen>There's something off about her,I  can feel it.

143
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,780
<6-18,Foreman>如果你有任何证据 那就--
<6-18,Foreman>If you had any evidence,I t would be--

144
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,440
<6-19,Thirteen>为什么她没告诉我们 就在她发作前 一个同事呕吐在她的鞋上?
<6-19,Thirteen>why didn't she tell us a co-worker puked on her shoes right before she collapsed?

145
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,540
<6-20,Foreman>因为这和医学无关 他喝醉了 她病了
<6-20,Foreman>Because it's medically irrelevant.He was drunk,she was sick.

146
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,940
<6-21,Thirteen>你不觉得她连她丈夫也没告诉 这点很可疑吗?
<6-21,Thirteen>You don't think   it's suspicious   she didn't even   mention it to her husband?

147
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,210
<6-22,House>Foreman 你为什么和13分手?
<6-22,House>Yeah,foreman.Why did you break up with thirteen?

148
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,110
<6-22,House>不 等等 她说得这么直白 干嘛?
<6-22,House>Oh,no,wait,the non-subtextual thing she was saying,why that?

149
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,420
<6-23,Thirteen>我们在讨论病例 可不是你在幻想的 我和Foreman之间的事
<6-23,Thirteen>This is about the case,not some imaginary issue that you think foreman and I have.

150
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,030
<6-24,House>很好 给她服用β阻断剂
<6-24,House>Great,start her on beta blockers.

151
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,410
<6-25,Foreman>你去吧?
<6-25,Foreman>You'll do it?

152
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,420
<6-26,Thirteen>我可不觉得他是对我说的
<6-26,Thirteen>I don't think he was talking to me.

153
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,580
<6-27,Foreman>但我在对你说
<6-27,Foreman>Well,I  am.

154
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,420
<6-28,Thirteen>这里就我认为你是错的
<6-28,Thirteen>I'm the only one who thinks you're wrong.

155
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,820
<6-29,Foreman>也许这正是我让你负责此事的原因
<6-29,Foreman>Maybe that's why I'm asking you to do it.

156
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,100
<6-30,Wibberly>你是Greg吧?
<6-30,Wibberly>Greg?

157
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,270
<6-30,Wibberly>我是Lorenzo Wibberly.
<6-30,Wibberly>Lorenzo wibberly.

158
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,800
<6-30,Wibberly>Wilson医生说你在这 你还好吗?
<6-30,Wibberly>Dr. Wilson said you'd be here.How ya been?

159
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,960
<6-31,House>将杀
<6-31,House>Check and mate.

160
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,890
<7-1,Wibberly>听着...也许我来这儿会有点尴尬
<7-1,Wibberly>Look... I'm sorry this is awkward or whatever.

161
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,980
<7-1,Wibberly>但我只是觉得 你能写那封信真是太好了
<7-1,Wibberly>I just thought it was nice of you to write that letter,

162
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,990
<7-1,Wibberly>我想告诉你 你不必觉得内疚
<7-1,Wibberly>and I wanted to tell you that you don't have to feel bad.

163
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,060
<7-1,Wibberly>谢谢
<7-1,Wibberly>Thanks.

164
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,650
<7-2,House>你现在在哪工作?
<7-2,House>So where are you working these days?

165
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,890
<7-2,House>是自己开了诊所还是在医院工作?
<7-2,House>You got your own practice or you at a hospital?

166
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,650
<7-3,Wibberly>我还以为你知道呢
<7-3,Wibberly>I thought you knew.

167
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,990
<7-3,Wibberly>我在DanI's工作 是一家有机食品连锁超市
<7-3,Wibberly>DanI's,the organic supermarket chain.

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,900
<7-4,House>作为驻店医生?
<7-4,House>As an in house doctor?

169
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,070
<7-5,Wibberly>其实我根本没拿到行医执照
<7-5,Wibberly>I actually never got licensed.

170
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,950
<7-5,Wibberly>我没能从医学院毕业
<7-5,Wibberly>I didn't graduate med school.

171
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,460
<7-5,Wibberly>我曾想过回学校重读 但我父亲病了
<7-5,Wibberly>I planned on going back,and then my father got sick

172
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,750
<7-5,Wibberly>我得照顾他 运气欠佳
<7-5,Wibberly>and I had to  take care of him  and had some bad luck.

173
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,550
<7-6,House>你怎么会没毕业的?
<7-6,House>Why didn't you graduate?

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,440
<7-7,Wibberly>我挂了一门课 当时也已经被留校察看了 所以...
<7-7,Wibberly>I was one credit short.And I was sort of already on academic probation.So...

175
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,240
<7-8,House>哪门课?
<7-8,House>Which credit?

176
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:30,300
<7-9,Wibberly>我... 就是你换了我论文的那门挂了
<7-9,Wibberly>I got a,um... He failed me on that paper you switched.

177
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,540
<7-9,Wibberly>我还以为你知道的
<7-9,Wibberly>I thought you knew.

178
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,350
<7-10,House>我猜你是这个连锁超市的CEO吧?
<7-10,House>So I'm guessing you're the ceo of this supermarket chain?

179
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,430
<7-11,Wibberly>我负责给食物装袋
<7-11,Wibberly>I bag groceries.

180
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,660
<7-11,Wibberly>人生有时就是这么不可思议
<7-11,Wibberly>Life works out weird sometimes.

181
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,620
<8-1,Valerie>因为他父母的缘故 我们本来是打算在圣巴巴拉市结婚的
<8-1,Valerie>We were gonna do it in santa barbara because of his parents.

182
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,880
<8-1,Valerie>但后来我在蒙塔克 找到了一家很美的旅馆 所以...
<8-1,Valerie>But then I found this beautiful hotel in montauk and--

183
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,260
<8-2,Foreman>你在检查她是不是有脑瘤?
<8-2,Foreman>you're testing her  for a brain tumor?

184
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,630
<8-3,Thirteen>这只不过是我的说辞而已 你看过检测仪之后再怪我也不迟
<8-3,Thirteen>That's what I told her.You can chastise me after you look at the monitor.

185
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,950
<8-3,Thirteen>看看哪块区域变亮了
<8-3,Thirteen>Look what's   lighting up.

186
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,140
<8-4,Foreman>侧额叶 布若卡氏区 怎么了?
<8-4,Foreman>Lateral frontal cortex.Broca's area--so what?

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,580
<8-5,Thirteen>我告诉她 做核磁共振时 常常通过说话来放松
<8-5,Thirteen>I told her it was customary to talk during mris,to relax.

188
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,550
<8-5,Thirteen>这半小时内我一直在问她喜欢什么
<8-5,Thirteen>I spent the last 30 minutes   asking her about   everything in life   that she loves,

189
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,220
<8-5,Thirteen>讨厌什么 随便什么感情有波动的事
<8-5,Thirteen>then hates,then feels any emotion about at all.

190
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,160
<8-6,Foreman>缘叶旁系统 杏仁核没有反应
<8-6,Foreman>There's nothing in the paralimbic system,amygdala.

191
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,640
<8-7,Thirteen>因为她使用的是大脑的语言区域 绕过了情感区
<8-7,Thirteen>Because she's using the language part of her brain and bypassing the emotional.

192
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,040
<8-7,Thirteen>她可以理解喜爱 痛苦和同情 但她完全感受不到
<8-7,Thirteen>She can understand   love and pain and empathy,but she can't feel them at all.

193
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,090
<8-7,Thirteen>她精神变态
<8-7,Thirteen>She's a psychopath.

194
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,600
<9-1,Thirteen>你为什么那么想见她?
<9-1,Thirteen>Why do you want to meet her so badly?

195
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,850
<9-2,House>精神病患者一直很能吸引我
<9-2,House>Psychopaths always fascinate me.

196
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,810
<9-2,House>我觉得是因为他们注重文化传承 而且有强烈的家庭观
<9-2,House>I think it's their cultural literacy and strong family values.

197
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,100
<9-2,House>要么那是犹太人?
<9-2,House>Or is that jews?

198
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,150
<9-3,Foreman>要是想不到办法让她丈夫离开 我们没法解读真实的她
<9-3,Foreman>We're not gonna be able to get an honest read on her unless we figure out a way to get the husband out of there.

199
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,960
<9-4,House>我有办法
<9-4,House>I got an idea.

200
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,850
<9-4,House>你能出去吗?
<9-4,House>Can you get out of here?

201
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,340
<11-22,Wilson>谢谢
<11-22,Wilson>Thanks.

202
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,320
<9-4,House>起作用的是那句"谢谢"
<9-4,House>It was the "thanks" that did it.

203
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,870
<9-5,House>嗨 我是House医生
<9-5,House>Hi,I 'm dr. House.

204
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,420
<9-5,House>你患精神病多久了?
<9-5,House>How long have you been a psychopath?

205
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,990
<9-6,Valerie>- 你在开玩笑吧? - 他没有
<9-6,Valerie>- Are you kidding? - He's not.

206
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,670
<9-8,Valerie>你是说我是Ted Bundy这种人吗? (连环杀人犯 患有精神疾病)
<9-8,Valerie>Are you saying I'm like ted bundy or something?

207
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,750
<9-9,House>精神变态的名声不太好
<9-9,House>Psychopathy  can get a bad rap.

208
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,640
<9-9,House>但这并不代表你有暴力倾向
<9-9,House>It doesn't necessarily mean you're violent.

209
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,840
<9-9,House>你只不过完全没有善恶观 缺乏正常的感情
<9-9,House>Just that you're completely without conscience,you lack any normal emotion,

210
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,180
<9-9,House>操纵身边的人 滥交 病理性地说谎
<9-9,House>you manipulate everyone around you,you're promiscuous,you lie pathologically.

211
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,440
<9-9,House>和你像吗?
<9-9,House>Any of this ringing bells?

212
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,350
<9-10,Valerie>这是你问我那些奇怪问题的原因吗?
<9-10,Valerie>Is that why you were asking me all those weird questions?

213
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,860
<9-11,House>对 不过你得感谢达尔文
<9-11,House>Yeah--though you have darwin to thank for that.

214
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,850
<9-11,House>她跟你接触觉得惊慌
<9-11,House>She got the creeps around you.

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,020
<9-11,House>奇怪的是 这确是精神变态者 在周遭会引发的医学现象
<9-11,House>Which oddly,I s an actual medical phenomenon around psychopaths.

216
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,170
<9-11,House>也许是弱者进化出对掠食者的本能反应
<9-11,House>Probably an evolved response   to predators.

217
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,760
<9-12,Valerie>抱歉 你真的吓到我了 我完全不明白...
<9-12,Valerie>I'm sorry,you're really freaking me out.I have no idea what--

218
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,990
<9-13,House>放松点 我们有义务替你保密
<9-13,House>relax.We have a duty of confidentiality.

219
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,740
<9-13,House>你还有个尚未查明的心脏问题 很可能会随时害死你
<9-13,House>And you have an undiagnosed heart problem that could kill you at any moment.

220
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,850
<9-13,House>我们认为你的精神异常 和生理病症有关
<9-13,House>We believe that your mental abnormality is related to your physical one.

221
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,210
<9-13,House>所以 如果你想继续掠食
<9-13,House>So if you want to keep on predating...

222
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,420
<9-14,Valerie>你想知道什么?
<9-14,Valerie>What do you want to know?

223
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,550
<9-15,Thirteen>你同事说的是真的 你下毒害他
<9-15,Thirteen>Your co-worker's story was true.You poisoned him.

224
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,380
<9-16,Valerie>不是 我给他服了点安定和催吐剂
<9-16,Valerie>No.I gave him a little valium and an emetic.

225
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,590
<9-17,House>你真明白"不是"这个词的含义吗?
<9-17,House>You sure you understand what the word "no" means?

226
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,170
<9-18,Valerie>- 我以前就同时吃过 他为什么不能? - 这么说你是在帮他了?
<9-18,Valerie>- I've had them both before,why can't he? - So you were just helping him out?

227
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,300
<9-19,Thirteen>我猜他对被色诱 被炒鱿鱼的事都不在乎?
<9-19,Thirteen>And I assume he was cool with the whole seducing and firing part too?

228
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,300
<9-20,Valerie>Russ很清楚利益交换
<9-20,Valerie>Russ knew what he was getting into.

229
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,380
<9-20,Valerie>他每周四晚都能和我上床 而他的好创意归我
<9-20,Valerie>He got sex every thursday night,and I got to take credit for his best ideas.

230
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,640
<9-21,Foreman>你能从婚姻得到什么好处?
<9-21,Foreman>And what are you getting out of your marriage?

231
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,370
<9-22,Valerie>和你从工作中得到的一样
<9-22,Valerie>Same thing you get out of your job.

232
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,340
<9-22,Valerie>Bill有个信托基金
<9-22,Valerie>Bill has a trust fund.

233
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,310
<9-22,Valerie>他父母逼我签了婚前协议
<9-22,Valerie>And I have a prenup his parents made me sign.

234
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,350
<9-23,House>都说他有钱了 她没那么奇怪
<9-23,House>Told you he was rich.She's not that weird.

235
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,440
<9-24,Valerie>我和别人没太大区别
<9-24,Valerie>I'm not so different than anybody else.

236
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,110
<9-24,Valerie>我所认识的所有人 家人 同学 同事...
<9-24,Valerie>Everyone I've ever known-- my family,my classmates,the people I work with--

237
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,650
<9-24,Valerie>他们都是为了自己 区别在于 我肯承认这点
<9-24,Valerie>they're all out for themselves.Difference is,I  could admit it to myself.

238
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,320
<9-25,Thirteen>她有点让我想起了某人
<9-25,Thirteen>She kind of reminds me of someone I know.

239
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,870
<9-26,House>还用你说
<9-26,House>Tell me about it.

240
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,220
<9-26,House>我的一些同事还会当面羞辱人
<9-26,House>Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces.

241
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,200
<9-26,House>你这样多久了?
<9-26,House>How long have you been this way?

242
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,990
<9-27,Valerie>我从来如此
<9-27,Valerie>Just how I am.

243
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,710
<9-27,Valerie>你现在肯治疗我的心脏问题了吗?
<9-27,Valerie>Are you gonna cure my heart problems now?

244
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,210
<10-1,House>精神变态加上心率不齐 说吧
<10-1,House>So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia.Go.

245
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,270
<10-2,Thirteen>我还以为你恐吓是想套话呢 你真觉得两者有关系?
<10-2,Thirteen>I thought you were bluffing to get information.You really think they're connected?

246
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,010
<10-3,House>病人同时有两个罕见的病症 这么假设很正常
<10-3,House>Two rare conditions in one patient,I t's a fair assumption they are.

247
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,100
<10-4,Thirteen>神经病通常都是遗传性的 对此我们也无能为力
<10-4,Thirteen>Psychopathy is generally just genetic.Nothing you can do about it.

248
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,600
<10-4,Thirteen>出生三十年后突发的问题 两者不会有关系的
<10-4,Thirteen>Something that hits 30 years after birth isn't gonna be connected.

249
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,060
<10-5,House>她的病可没法潜伏那么久
<10-5,House>Her disease isn't gonna lie dormant that long.

250
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,770
<10-5,House>会不会是心脏导致大脑异常?
<10-5,House>Did her heart warp her brain?

251
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,360
<10-7,House>- 有许多病症都能 - 我们要是能找出来 那一定很酷
<10-7,House>- Maybe a handful of diseases. - It'll be super awesome when we find it.

252
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,290
<10-8,Foreman>三期梅毒会导致 伪精神病并发症和心肌炎
<10-8,Foreman>Tertiary syphilis can cause pseudopsychopathic syndrome  and cardiomyopathy.

253
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,570
<10-9,House>很合理 给她用盘尼西林 排除威尔森氏症和桥本病
<10-9,House>Fits best.Start her on penicillin,and rule out wilson's and hashimoto's.

254
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,910
<10-9,House>这就是你说的一堆病 也不是很难诊断 对吧?
<10-9,House>There's your handful.Wasn't so hard,was it?

255
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,470
<10-10,Foreman>你得约束一下13 她藐视你我的权威
<10-10,Foreman>You've gotta do something about thirteen.She flouted both my authority and yours.

256
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,930
<10-11,House>对 但她是对的 你是错的
<10-11,House>Yes,and she got it right and you got it wrong.

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
<10-12,Foreman>这只会教情况恶化 她还会故技重施的
<10-12,Foreman>Which just aggravates the problem.She'll do it again.

258
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,380
<10-12,Foreman>下次可就没这么好运了
<10-12,Foreman>Next time it won't work out so well.

259
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,520
<10-12,Foreman>你得处罚她
<10-12,Foreman>You gotta punish her.

260
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,210
<10-13,House>你才是她的上司
<10-13,House>You're her boss.

261
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,090
<10-13,House>在某种含糊无效的定义下 得由你处罚她
<10-13,House>In some vague,never to be usefully defined way.You punish her.

262
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,780
<10-14,Foreman>我也是她的前男友 你知道的 这把事情搞得有点复杂了
<10-14,Foreman>I'm also her ex,which,as you know,makes it a little complicated.

263
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,040
<10-15,House>你炒了她的事更让事态 从有点复杂变成了有点白痴
<10-15,House>The fact that you also fired her takes it from a little complicated to a little moronic.

264
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,750
<10-16,Foreman>- 只有这样我才能... - 这并不是因为你太爱她
<10-16,Foreman>- It was the only way I could-- it wasn't because you were too in love with her.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,150
<10-17,House>而是因为你太爱你的事业了
<10-17,House>It was because you were too in love with your career.

266
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,200
<10-17,House>快到我这层了 我总结一下
<10-17,House>We're almost at my floor so I'll summarize.

267
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,800
<10-17,House>这是你的问题 不是我的
<10-17,House>Your problem,not mine.

268
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,820
<11-1,Cuddy>你剪坏了的照片 我只有一张
<11-1,Cuddy>You cut up my only copy of that photo.

269
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,250
<11-2,House>那张用银版法拍摄的罕见相片
<11-2,House>That rare daguerreotype.

270
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,320
<11-2,House>你从硬盘再影印一张耗费的气力 算我账上
<11-2,House>You can charge me for the effort it takes to search your hard drive for a new copy.

271
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,830
<11-3,Cuddy>我不是说和Lucas的那张合照
<11-3,Cuddy>Not the one of me and lucas.

272
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,360
<11-3,Cuddy>是厄瓜多尔的那张
<11-3,Cuddy>The one from ecuador.

273
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,690
<11-4,House>没错 我忘记你对狐猴的深厚感情了
<11-4,House>Right.I had forgotten your deep emotional attachment to lemurs.

274
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,250
<11-5,Cuddy>是对我的爸爸
<11-5,Cuddy>To my dad.

275
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,820
<11-6,House>- 你遗传了他的尾巴? - 照片是他拍的
<11-6,House>- You got his tail. - He was holding the camera.

276
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,060
<11-7,Cuddy>那是我们最后一次共同旅行
<11-7,Cuddy>That was the last trip we ever took together.

277
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,250
<11-7,Cuddy>而且我没有数码的副本
<11-7,Cuddy>And I don't have a digital copy.

278
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,330
<11-8,House>我可以花整天时间站在这道歉 但我宁愿用心工作来赎罪
<11-8,House>Well,I  could stand here all day apologizing,but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work.

279
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,120
<11-9,House>你无视我的短信?
<11-9,House>You ignoring my texts?

280
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,140
<11-10,Wilson>你是指那些你毁了同窗的一生 指望我让你感觉好受些的短信?
<11-10,Wilson>The crazy ones you sent trying to get me to make you feel better about destroying your classmate's life?

281
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,200
<11-10,Wilson>没 我没收到
<11-10,Wilson>No,I  never got those.

282
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,230
<11-11,Jose>他是谁?
<11-11,Jose>Y este quién es?

283
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,220
<11-12,Wilson>是个医师
<11-12,Wilson>Él es un doctor de medición

284
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,480
<11-12,Wilson>还是个医生
<11-12,Wilson>Él es un doctor de medición

285
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,400
<11-13,House>Wilson医生叫我来会诊 Wibberly有企图
<11-13,House>Dr. Wilson...  Wibberly's got some agenda.

286
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,470
<11-14,House>也许是想让我感到内疚 好让我给他找一个好工作
<11-14,House>Probably trying to guilt me into getting him a better job.

287
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,140
<11-15,Wilson>- 他有多生气? - 完全不生气
<11-15,Wilson>- How pissed was he? - Not at all.

288
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,140
<11-16,House>所以我才知道他有所企图
<11-16,House>That's how I know he's got an agenda.

289
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,610
<11-17,Jose>好痛
<11-17,Jose>Me duele mucho

290
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,370
<11-18,House>那你就不该敲上去
<11-18,House>Entonces no te lo hubieras golpeado

291
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,140
<11-19,Jose>我的工作环境很危险
<11-19,Jose>Trabajo en condiciones muy peligrosas

292
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,330
<11-20,Wilson>如果你觉得内疚就该帮帮他
<11-20,Wilson>If you feel guilty,you should do something to help.

293
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,870
<11-20,Wilson>这的确是你的责任
<11-20,Wilson>You are responsible.

294
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,650
<11-21,House>别担心 Wilson医生是个很好的医师
<11-21,House>No te preocupes.  El Dr. Wilson es un muy buen médico.

295
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,450
<11-22,Wilson>谢谢
<11-22,Wilson>Thanks.

296
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,230
<11-23,House>他对自身性功能障碍的抗争
<11-23,House>Who has enormous empathy towards patients

297
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,330
<11-24,Wilson>使得他对病人移情甚深
<11-24,Wilson>which stems from his own crippling battle with male sexual dysfunction.

298
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,140
<11-24,Wilson>什么?
<11-24,Wilson>What?

299
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,630
<11-25,House>我只需对换论文的可预见性结果负责
<11-25,House>All I'm responsible for is the foreseeable consequences of switching papers.

300
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,610
<11-25,House>差一些的成绩或者一个不眠之夜 最多就是补考
<11-25,House>A bad grade or a sleepless night,worst case,a retest.

301
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,690
<11-25,House>我怎么知道一份期末论文 会毁了这个白痴的一生
<11-25,House>There was no way to know that one seminar paper was gonna destroy this idiot's life.

302
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,550
<11-26,Wilson>如果有因果报应的话 或许他比你快乐
<11-26,Wilson>If there's any karma  n all this,he's probably happier than you are.

303
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,880
<11-27,House>有道理
<11-27,House>Good point.

304
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,250
<11-27,House>如果他更高兴了 那我就没造成什么伤害 我去查查看
<11-27,House>If he's happier,there's no harm done.I'll go find out.

305
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,830
<11-28,Wilson>我可不是这意思
<11-28,Wilson>That is absolutely not what I said.

306
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,150
<11-29,House>这家伙一直很谦虚
<11-29,House>Always with the modesty,this one.

307
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,520
<11-30,House>下次还想在工作时嗑药
<11-30,House>Next time you want to get secretly stoned at work

308
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,670
<11-30,House>错把拇指当成钉子吗? 眼药水这招不错
<11-30,House>and mistake your thumb for a nail?  Eyedrops are a good call,

309
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:05,240
<11-30,House>不过别用得太多 你这么频繁掉眼泪就是由此引起的
<11-30,House>but use less,  that's why you're tearing up so much.

310
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,970
<11-31,Wilson>他说什...
<11-31,Wilson>What did--

311
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,220
<11-31,Wilson>他说你是个很好的医生
<11-31,Wilson>He says you are a very good doctor.

312
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,710
<12-1,Wibberly>你想吃点什么吗?
<12-1,Wibberly>you want something to eat?

313
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,850
<12-2,House>不必了
<12-2,House>I'm cool.

314
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,990
<12-2,House>工作如何?
<12-2,House>How's work?

315
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,050
<12-2,House>你喜欢吗?
<12-2,House>You happy with it?

316
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,390
<12-3,Wibberly>你明白的... 就是份工作而已
<12-3,Wibberly>You know... It's a job.

317
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,840
<12-3,Wibberly>至少我不用带工作回家
<12-3,Wibberly>I don't need to take any work home with me at least.

318
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,900
<12-4,House>空暇时间... 如果你是医生的话就没有了
<12-4,House>Free time... Wouldn't have any of that if you were a doctor.

319
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,890
<12-4,House>对 没错
<12-4,House>Yeah.True.

320
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,130
<12-5,Wibberly>你喜欢辣椒吗? 我可以给你重新加热一点
<12-5,Wibberly>You like chili?I could reheat some.

321
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,490
<12-6,House>这是你的院子吗?
<12-6,House>Is that your yard?

322
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
<12-6,House>挺不错的
<12-6,House>That's nice.

323
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,440
<12-6,House>对
<12-6,House>Yeah.

324
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,650
<12-7,Wibberly>那棵糖枫树有100... 150岁了
<12-7,Wibberly>That sugar maple,100,150 years old.

325
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,720
<12-7,Wibberly>在秋天叶子可漂亮了
<12-7,Wibberly>Most beautiful leaves in the fall.

326
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,350
<12-7,Wibberly>坐在底下的长凳上... 感觉就像身处天堂
<12-7,Wibberly>Sitting underneath on the bench-- it's like paradise.

327
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,180
<12-8,House>我没有院子
<12-8,House>I don't have a yard,myself.

328
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,450
<12-8,House>你过得不错
<12-8,House>You got a good thing going.

329
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,750
<12-10,House>- 我知道 - 这些盒子是干什么用的?
<12-10,House>- I know. - So what are the boxes for?

330
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,380
<12-11,Wibberly>我要搬家了
<12-11,Wibberly>I'm moving.

331
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,710
<12-12,House>离开天堂?
<12-12,House>From paradise?

332
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,930
<12-13,Wibberly>我父亲的医药费 加上我是个白痴 签了可调利率的抵押贷款
<12-13,Wibberly>Well,my dad's medical bills and me being one of those idiots that got an adjustable mortgage.

333
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,520
<12-14,House>- 所以... - 你的房子要被收走了?
<12-14,House>- So... - You're losing your home?

334
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,580
<12-15,Wibberly>嘿 事情可能会更糟的 对吧?
<12-15,Wibberly>Hey,I t could be worse,right?

335
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,380
<12-16,House>怎么可能?
<12-16,House>How?

336
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,180
<13-1,Taub>即便测试结果呈阳性 你也不必担心
<13-1,Taub>Even if the tests are positive,you don't have to worry.

337
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,560
<13-2,Bill>- 你测试的是梅毒 可不是感冒 - 宝贝...
<13-2,Bill>- You're testing for syphilis,not a cold. - Honey...

338
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,520
<13-4,Taub>对这个阶段来说 可能并不会传染
<13-4,Taub>At this stage,I t's probably   not communicable.

339
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,300
<13-5,Bill>你觉得我是在担心自己? 我只希望我太太能好起来
<13-5,Bill>You think I'm worried about myself?I just want my wife   to get better.

340
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,820
<13-6,Thirteen>她也许在出生时就患上了 这并不能证明她在外偷情
<13-6,Thirteen>She might have caught it at birth.So it doesn't prove she was cheating.

341
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,990
<13-6,Thirteen>- 如果担心这点的话 - 当然不
<13-6,Thirteen>- If you were worried about that. - Of course not.

342
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,830
<13-8,Valerie>我得在这待几周...
<13-8,Valerie>How many weeks am I gonna have to--

343
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,220
<13-9,Bill>还好吗? 她为什么在咳嗽?
<13-9,Bill>you okay?Why    she coughing?

344
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,710
<13-10,Taub>我不知道 你想喝水吗?
<13-10,Taub>I don't know.Do you want some water?

345
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,420
<13-12,Valerie>你感觉到我威胁你吗?
<13-12,Valerie>Are you threatened by me?

346
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,720
<13-13,Thirteen>完全没有
<13-13,Thirteen>Not at all.

347
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,240
<13-13,Thirteen>你应该有这感觉
<13-13,Thirteen>Well,you should be.

348
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,000
<13-14,Valerie>如果你向他告密 我不仅要让你执照报销
<13-14,Valerie>You let him know what I told you,I  will not only have your license pulled,

349
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,140
<13-14,Valerie>我离婚失去的一切 都会从你身上讨回来
<13-14,Valerie>i will sue you for everything I lose in the divorce.

350
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,870
<13-14,Valerie>揭发我得到的乐趣 值得1900万美元吗?
<13-14,Valerie>So the fun you get out of making those snotty little comments,I s it worth $19 million?

351
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,340
<13-14,Valerie>慢 保持这个表情
<13-14,Valerie>Oh,wait,will you hold that look?

352
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,710
<13-14,Valerie>我不擅长表露情绪 你看这个如何?
<13-14,Valerie>I'm really bad at showing emotions.How's this?

353
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,330
<13-15,Valerie>谢了 宝贝
<13-15,Valerie>Thanks,baby.

354
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,160
<13-16,Thirteen>手臂伸给我好吗?
<13-16,Thirteen>Can I have your arm please?

355
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,760
<13-17,Valerie>我的手臂! 你把它拗断了!
<13-17,Valerie>My arm!You broke it!

356
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,060
<14-1,Thirteen>我不知道这怎么回事
<14-1,Thirteen>I don't know what happened.

357
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,500
<14-2,House>我也不知道 但我知道结果
<14-2,House>Neither do i,but I know what happened after.

358
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,450
<14-2,House>她打给Cuddy 要把你踢出这病例
<14-2,House>She called cuddy and demanded that I kick you off the case.

359
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,560
<14-2,House>我替你说话了 因为我信得过你
<14-2,House>I backed you up,because I trust you.

360
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,060
<14-2,House>你得好好表现 别辜负我
<14-2,House>But you're gonna have to earn that trust now.

361
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,470
<14-3,Thirteen>谢谢
<14-3,Thirteen>Thanks.

362
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,450
<14-4,Taub>实际上 他替你说话 是因为新的血尿素氮和肌酐指数
<14-4,Taub>Actually,he backed you up because of the new b.U.N.Creatinine numbers.

363
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,510
<14-4,Taub>骨质脆弱是肾脏衰竭导致
<14-4,Taub>Brittle bones were from kidney failure.

364
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,040
<14-5,House>- 被揭穿了 那么说 心脏加肾脏 - 还有脑子
<14-5,House>- There is that.So heart and kidneys. - And brain.

365
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,640
<14-7,House>- 不 精神变态不是症状 - 你昨天还说是
<14-7,House>- Nope.Psychopathy is not a symptom. - It was yesterday.

366
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,170
<14-9,House>但肾衰竭排除了梅毒 检查排除了其它与此相关的诊断
<14-9,House>In the meantime,kidney failure ruled out syphilis and testing ruled out the other ideas that would've fit.

367
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,390
<14-10,Foreman>蛋白质水平 肾脏 心律不齐
<14-10,Foreman>Protein levels,kidneys,arrhythmia.

368
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,490
<14-10,Foreman>可能是副肿瘤综合症 我说是淋巴癌
<14-10,Foreman>Could be paraneoplastic.I'd say lymphoma.

369
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,890
<14-11,House>给她上放射性疗法
<14-11,House>Get her to radiotherapy.

370
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,240
<14-12,Thirteen>在做尿液免疫测定前 不能开始放射性治疗
<14-12,Thirteen>We can't start radiation without immunoassays on her urine.

371
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,560
<14-13,Foreman>那好 你施法把她的肾治好 我们好取尿液做检查
<14-13,Foreman>Great,so you cast a spell and magically fix her kidney  so she can give us   some urine to test.

372
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,750
<14-14,Thirteen>- 她入院时取的还有剩 - 量太少 结果不够准确
<14-14,Thirteen>- We have some left over from admission. - Not enough for a completely accurate reading.

373
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,440
<14-16,Thirteen>部分准确也好啊
<14-16,Thirteen>Then how about partially accurate?

374
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,430
<14-17,House>那些没有一起睡过的人 可以离场了
<14-17,House>Those of you who haven't slept together,you can go.

375
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,610
<14-17,House>其他人留下
<14-17,House>Everyone else,stay behind.

376
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,010
<14-17,House>对不起
<14-17,House>Sorry.

377
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,400
<14-18,Taub>这是我们的秘密
<14-18,Taub>That was our secret,right?

378
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,150
<14-19,House>- 开房去吧 - 不用 谢谢
<14-19,House>- Go have sex. - No,thanks.

379
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,080
<14-21,House>好吧 伟哥和润滑剂算我的 把收据给我就好
<14-21,House>Fine,I 'll cover the viagra and the lubricants.Just get me a receipt.

380
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,740
<14-22,Foreman>我们之间毫无感觉了
<14-22,Foreman>We have zero feelings for each other.

381
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,380
<14-23,House>杯具了 因为你们睡在一起时 情况比现在好得多
<14-23,House>Well,that's too bad,'cause things worked much better when you did.

382
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,690
<14-23,House>如果我和她上床会有帮助吗?
<14-23,House>Would it help if I slept with her?

383
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,040
<14-24,Thirteen>- 我们在进行诊断 - 不 我们已经得出了诊断
<14-24,Thirteen>- We were getting to a diagnosis. - No,we were already at the diagnosis.

384
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,520
<14-25,House>你们为一个不相干的检查争论不休 因为你们无法忍受对方
<14-25,House>***'Cause you can't stand to be around each other.

385
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,400
<14-25,House>要么上床 要么干一架 要么走人 随便你们
<14-25,House>So have sex,fight or quit,I  don't care.

386
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,490
<14-25,House>反正这样下去行不通
<14-25,House>Whatever you're doing now isn't working.

387
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,140
<15-1,Thirteen>你没事吧?
<15-1,Thirteen>You okay?

388
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,970
<15-1,Thirteen>没事
<15-1,Thirteen>Yeah.

389
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,160
<15-2,Bill>我知道治疗很紧急 但放疗?
<15-2,Bill>Look,I  get that you gotta act fast-- radiation?

390
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,830
<15-2,Bill>你们彻底排除了其它可能性?
<15-2,Bill>You definitely ruled out everything else?

391
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,480
<15-2,Bill>对不起 但...
<15-2,Bill>I'm sorry,but...

392
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,390
<15-3,Thirteen>我们还可以检查环境毒素
<15-3,Thirteen>We could still check for environmental toxins.

393
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,780
<15-3,Thirteen>她多数时间待在哪里?
<15-3,Thirteen>Where does she spend most of her time?

394
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,210
<15-4,Bill>- 大部分时间在工作 家里 - 爱好?
<15-4,Bill>- Mostly at work,at home-- hobbies?

395
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,290
<15-5,Thirteen>经常进行室外活动?
<15-5,Thirteen>Recurring activities outside the home?

396
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,010
<15-6,Bill>没有 她参加了一个园艺班
<15-6,Bill>No,not really.She took a landscaping class.

397
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,080
<15-6,Bill>在基督教青年会
<15-6,Bill>At the y.

398
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,630
<15-7,Thirteen>他们什么时候上课?
<15-7,Thirteen>When did it meet?

399
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,960
<15-8,Bill>这个夏天每周四晚上
<15-8,Bill>Every thursday night this summer.

400
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,210
<15-9,Thirteen>你挖掘泥土时 可能会接触 杀虫剂 重金属等有害物质
<15-9,Thirteen>You dig in soil,you can be exposed to pesticides,heavy metals,lots of bad things.

401
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,650
<15-9,Thirteen>你能查出她上课的 具体地点等细节吗?
<15-9,Thirteen>Can you find out all about her landscaping class,where it was,details like that?

402
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,480
<15-10,Bill>好 我现在就去
<15-10,Bill>Yeah,I 'll do it now.

403
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,060
<16-1,House>你看星球大战时支持哪一边?
<16-1,House>So when you watch  star wars,which side do you root for?

404
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,460
<16-2,Valerie>House医生
<16-2,Valerie>Dr. House.

405
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,920
<16-2,Valerie>你想干什么?
<16-2,Valerie>What are you doing?

406
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,880
<16-3,House>观察你的放射性治疗
<16-3,House>Just checking in on your radiotherapy.

407
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,450
<16-4,Valerie>据我所知 你从不探访病人
<16-4,Valerie>From what I hear,you never visit patients.

408
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,710
<16-4,Valerie>但迄今你已经找我谈了两次
<16-4,Valerie>And now,you've come to chat with me twice.

409
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,800
<16-5,House>我想问问你 做管理顾问感觉如何?
<16-5,House>I want to know how you like being a management consultant.

410
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,600
<16-5,House>我在考虑转行
<16-5,House>I'm thinking of getting into it.

411
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,940
<16-5,House>做这个 或全职心理变态
<16-5,House>That or psychopathy,maybe.

412
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,070
<16-5,House>哪个比较好赚?
<16-5,House>Which pays better?

413
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,510
<16-6,Valerie>我想你已是其中之一了
<16-6,Valerie>I think you're already into one of them.

414
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,910
<16-6,Valerie>Hadley医生昨天开玩笑说 我听起来就像是你
<16-6,Valerie>Dr. Hadley   made a joke yesterday.She said I sound like you.

415
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,090
<16-7,House>我肯定你理解"玩笑"的意思
<16-7,House>I'm sure you understand what joke means.

416
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,350
<16-8,Valerie>难道你做的一切不是为自己?
<16-8,Valerie>So you're not just   out for yourself?

417
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:14,800
<16-8,Valerie>比方说 你不会为满足一己好奇 而干扰一个病重女人的治疗?
<16-8,Valerie>For example,you would never interrupt a sick woman's treatment just because of some personal obsession?

418
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,920
<16-9,House>没错 我很自私自利 我们都这样 天性如此
<16-9,House>Of course I'm self-interested.We all are.We're born that way.

419
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,190
<16-9,House>但我们天性里也有良知
<16-9,House>The rest of us are born with consciences.

420
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,400
<16-10,Valerie>你似乎为此感到很欣喜
<16-10,Valerie>Which is something  you just sound ecstatic about.

421
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,020
<16-11,House>我不是说这合乎情理 但无可否认是人类本性
<16-11,House>I'm not saying it's logical.I'm just saying it's human.

422
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,620
<16-12,Valerie>如果你知道你的良知不过是动物本能 就不必受约束了
<16-12,Valerie>So if you know your conscience is just an animal instinct,you don't need to follow it.

423
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,040
<16-12,Valerie>你想必深知这一点
<16-12,Valerie>I think you realize that.

424
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,280
<16-12,Valerie>否则也不会和我谈
<16-12,Valerie>That's why   you're talking to me.

425
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,060
<17-1,Bill>园艺课是你编出来的
<17-1,Bill>You lied about your landscaping class.

426
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,350
<17-1,Bill>Hadley医生认为 土壤里可能有毒素
<17-1,Bill>Dr. Hadley thought the soils might be poisoned.

427
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,470
<17-2,Valerie>你告诉他了?
<17-2,Valerie>You told him that?

428
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,030
<17-4,Bill>- 我只是-- - Russ说你们有一腿
<17-4,Bill>- I just thought--  russ said you were having an affair.

429
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,360
<17-4,Bill>这就是你的掩饰?
<17-4,Bill>Was that your cover?

430
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,580
<17-4,Bill>每个星期四晚上 你--
<17-4,Bill>Every thursday night   you'd--

431
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,950
<17-5,Valerie>- 对不起 - 天啊
<17-5,Valerie>-  I'm so sorry. - Oh,god.

432
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,080
<17-7,Valerie>事情不是你想的那样
<17-7,Valerie>It's not   what you think.

433
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,190
<17-7,Valerie>记得我告诉过你 去年失去一个电信案子吗?
<17-7,Valerie>Do you remember that telecom case I said that we didn't get last year?

434
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,560
<17-7,Valerie>其实我们谈拢了 我为这事忙坏了
<17-7,Valerie>In fact,we did,and I was swamped.

435
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,730
<17-7,Valerie>每周五早上我都要 和伦敦那边开电话会议
<17-7,Valerie>Every friday morning we had a conference call with london,

436
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,700
<17-8,Bill>- 所以前一天晚上-- - 这是你的借口?
<17-8,Bill>- so the night before I would--  that's   your excuse?

437
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,060
<17-8,Bill>你以为我会相信你在办公室?
<17-8,Bill>You expect me to believe that you were at the office?

438
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,210
<17-9,Valerie>我们吵过最激烈是哪一次?
<17-9,Valerie>What's the biggest argument we've ever had?

439
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,830
<17-9,Valerie>你说我花太多时间在外面
<17-9,Valerie>You said   I spend too much time  away from home.

440
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,580
<17-9,Valerie>你说我根本不需要工作 你会照顾我
<17-9,Valerie>That I don't need a job,that you would take care of me.

441
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,600
<17-10,Bill>我是发自内心的
<17-10,Bill>Yeah,that's all true.

442
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,480
<17-11,Valerie>你朝我大嚷了
<17-11,Valerie>You yelled at me.

443
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,230
<17-11,Valerie>你让我觉得 你不尊重我做的一切
<17-11,Valerie>You made me feel like you didn't value anything that I did.

444
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,740
<17-11,Valerie>我需要这份工作 让我觉得自己有所成就
<17-11,Valerie>I need this job  to feel like I'm accomplishing something on my own.

445
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,890
<17-11,Valerie>所以我才会向你撒谎
<17-11,Valerie>That's why I lied to you.

446
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,820
<17-12,Bill>如果我明天打到你办公室 发现--
<17-12,Bill>If I call your office tomorrow and I check--

447
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,290
<17-13,Valerie>尽管打给我办公室 我秘书 我的客户--
<17-13,Valerie>call my office,call my secretary,call my clients--

448
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,330
<17-13,Valerie>打断他们的晚餐 把他们吵醒好了 我不在乎
<17-13,Valerie>interrupt their dinner,wake them up,I  don't care.

449
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,170
<17-13,Valerie>我只想你知道真相
<17-13,Valerie>I just want you to know the truth.

450
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,040
<17-13,Valerie>你知道的 我爱你
<17-13,Valerie>You know I love you.

451
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,800
<17-13,Valerie>过来
<17-13,Valerie>Come here.

452
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,720
<17-13,Valerie>求你了
<17-13,Valerie>Please.

453
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,080
<17-13,Valerie>没事的
<17-13,Valerie>It's okay.

454
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,960
<18-1,Valerie>开除她
<18-1,Valerie>Fire her.

455
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,580
<18-2,Thirteen>为什么? 你的如簧巧舌已经让你开脱了
<18-2,Thirteen>What for?You seemed to have lied your way out of any trouble.

456
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,540
<18-3,Valerie>如果Bill调查一下就露馅了
<18-3,Valerie>Until bill checks up on my cover.

457
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,610
<18-3,Valerie>我又得编另一个谎话来掩盖这一个
<18-3,Valerie>And I have to create a whole new one to cover that one up.

458
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,400
<18-3,Valerie>虽然我曾经这样做 但很难受
<18-3,Valerie>I've done it before but it's a pain.

459
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,670
<18-3,Valerie>Hadley医生让我难受 我也不会让她好过
<18-3,Valerie>And I would like dr. Hadley to share that pain.

460
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,020
<18-4,Cuddy>她没有泄露任何病人隐私
<18-4,Cuddy>She didn't reveal any confidences,

461
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
<18-4,Cuddy>她有正当的医学理由 去查问你园艺班的事
<18-4,Cuddy>and she had a valid medical reason to ask about your landscaping class.

462
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,100
<18-5,Valerie>我们姑且看陪审团怎么说
<18-5,Valerie>We can see what a jury says about that.

463
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,860
<18-6,Cuddy>还可以看你如何向丈夫坦白? 你不会告我们的
<18-6,Cuddy>And admit to your husband the truth?You're not gonna sue us.

464
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,830
<18-6,Cuddy>- 我们将中止Hadley医生和病人接触 - 什么?
<18-6,Cuddy>- We will remove dr. Hadley from all patient contact. - What?

465
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,540
<18-7,Thirteen>但这是为了Hadley医生的利益着想 而不是为了你
<18-7,Thirteen>But it's for dr. Hadley's benefit,not yours.

466
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,650
<18-8,Cuddy>- 我们没义务打压她来迁就你 - 那好
<18-8,Cuddy>- **** - Fine.

467
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,910
<18-9,Valerie>但不妨告诉你 这不是为你着想
<18-9,Valerie>But just so you know,this is not for your benefit.

468
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,310
<18-9,Valerie>Cuddy医生很光火 你差点让医院吃官司
<18-9,Valerie>Dr. Cuddy's furious that you put her hospital at risk.

469
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,530
<18-9,Valerie>但她不想在我面前承认
<18-9,Valerie>She just knows   it's a bad idea to admit it   in front of me.

470
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,070
<18-10,Cuddy>随便你怎么想 护工就在外头
<18-10,Cuddy>Think what you want.By the way,your orderly's outside.

471
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,540
<18-10,Cuddy>但要是我 会再等10分钟
<18-10,Cuddy>But I'd wait about another ten minutes

472
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,050
<18-10,Cuddy>好让你丈夫以为 你在进行放射治疗
<18-10,Cuddy>if you really want your husband to think you're having radiation treatments.

473
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,550
<18-11,Valerie>Hadley医生 你要哭了吗?
<18-11,Valerie>Dr. Hadley,are you by chance gonna cry?

474
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,020
<18-11,Valerie>我从来都哭不出来
<18-11,Valerie>'Cause that's one I just can't do.

475
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,960
<19-1,Thirteen>喂?
<19-1,Thirteen>Hello?

476
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,250
<19-1,Thirteen>我是Hadley医生
<19-1,Thirteen>This is dr. Hadley.

477
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,330
<19-1,Thirteen>什么?
<19-1,Thirteen>What?

478
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,530
<20-1,Thirteen>你打给医学委员会?
<20-1,Thirteen>You called the medical board?

479
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,750
<20-2,Valerie>你在说什么?
<20-2,Valerie>What is she talking about?

480
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,610
<20-3,Thirteen>投诉我性骚扰 你以为我不知道是你?
<20-3,Thirteen>Accusations   of sexual harassment.You don't think I know it's you?

481
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,550
<20-4,Chase>13 冷静点
<20-4,Chase>Thirteen,come on.

482
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,180
<20-5,Thirteen>你已经把我踢出了这病例 你还想怎样?
<20-5,Thirteen>You already got me fired from the case.What else do you want?

483
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,410
<20-5,Thirteen>Hadley医生
<20-5,Thirteen>Dr. Hadley.

484
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,780
<20-6,Foreman>马上出来
<20-6,Foreman>Get out here now.

485
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,280
<21-2,Thirteen>- 你的行为简直愚不可及 - 她想害我丢执照!
<21-2,Thirteen>- You're acting like an idiot. - She's trying to make me lose my license.

486
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,370
<21-3,Foreman>她办不到 除非你蠢得 跑到她房间去大喊大叫
<21-3,Foreman>And she'll fail,unless you're stupid enough  to go in there   and scream at her.

487
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,710
<21-4,Thirteen>性骚扰是非常严重的投诉
<21-4,Thirteen>Sexual harassment accusations are incredibly serious.

488
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,840
<21-5,Foreman>如果她匿名投诉 这案子铁定会销掉
<21-5,Foreman>If she made them anonymously,the case goes away.

489
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,250
<21-5,Foreman>如果她具名投诉 有我们给你作证 还是会销掉
<21-5,Foreman>If she used her name,we all back you up,I t goes away.

490
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,900
<21-5,Foreman>你反应过激了
<21-5,Foreman>You're completely overreacting.

491
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,180
<21-6,Thirteen>换作是你也没法忍
<21-6,Thirteen>You'd be pissed off too if you were me.

492
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,720
<21-6,Thirteen>也许不会 谁知道呢 你和她一样冷酷无情
<21-6,Thirteen>Or maybe not,I  don't know.You're just about as emotional as she is.

493
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,050
<21-7,Foreman>- 我这是在帮你 - 我知道
<21-7,Foreman>- I'm doing you a favor. - I know.

494
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,280
<21-8,Thirteen>即便你是在做好事 听起来也像个混蛋
<21-8,Thirteen>And even when you try to do something nice,you sound like a jerk.

495
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,020
<21-9,Foreman>对不起
<21-9,Foreman>I'm sorry.

496
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,020
<21-10,Thirteen>为什么?
<21-10,Thirteen>For what?

497
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,550
<21-11,Foreman>我把你开除了
<21-11,Foreman>For firing you.

498
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,340
<21-12,Thirteen>别说这个 两件事根本不相干
<21-12,Thirteen>Don't do that,that's not what this is about.

499
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,620
<21-13,Foreman>我还是要道歉
<21-13,Foreman>Then I'll   apologize anyway.

500
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,820
<21-13,Foreman>我这么做是为了我 不是为你
<21-13,Foreman>I did it for me.Not for you.

501
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,250
<21-13,Foreman>刚把你开除 我就意识到这点了
<21-13,Foreman>I realized that right after I fired you.

502
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,690
<21-13,Foreman>但我没有勇气承认
<21-13,Foreman>But I couldn't admit it.

503
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,010
<21-13,Foreman>把一切都搞砸了
<21-13,Foreman>Screwed everything up.

504
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,940
<21-13,Foreman>我希望我们还能一起工作
<21-13,Foreman>I hope that we can still work together.

505
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,020
<22-1,Foreman>她的肝出问题了
<22-1,Foreman>something's wrong with her liver.

506
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,260
<22-1,Foreman>血液倒流 涌入食道
<22-1,Foreman>Blood flow is backing up,spilling into her esophagus.

507
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,100
<22-2,Bill>- 因为癌症? - 这不是淋巴癌
<22-2,Bill>- from the cancer? - This isn't lymphoma.

508
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,910
<22-2,Bill>我们不知道病因
<22-2,Bill>We don't know what it is.

509
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,830
<22-3,Foreman>我们可以给血管止血 但出血太严重 可能不管用
<22-3,Foreman>*******That might not work.

510
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,120
<22-3,Foreman>我要采用叫"Tips"的疗法 使血液绕过肝脏的分流术
<22-3,Foreman>I want to try something called a "tips," a shunt that makes the blood bypass the liver.

511
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,480
<22-4,Bill>这--可以救她?
<22-4,Bill>That--that'll save her?

512
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,100
<22-5,Foreman>可以保住她的肝脏和心脏
<22-5,Foreman>It should help preserve her liver and heart.

513
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,250
<22-5,Foreman>肝脏将毒素清出 分流时间长了 可能会造成脑损伤甚至生命危险
<22-5,Foreman>The liver cleans out toxins,bypass it too long,she'll get brain damage,eventually die.

514
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,640
<22-5,Foreman>但也许还是好过流血不止
<22-5,Foreman>That's still probably less dangerous than bleeding out now.

515
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,090
<22-5,Foreman>也许?
<22-5,Foreman>Probably?

516
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,750
<22-6,Bill>一向是Valerie作决定
<22-6,Bill>Valerie usually makes the decisions.

517
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,200
<22-7,Foreman>你现在得站出来
<22-7,Foreman>You gotta step up now.

518
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,180
<22-8,Bill>她对我不忠吗?
<22-8,Bill>Was she cheating on me?

519
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,040
<22-10,Bill>- 我不能说-- - 就告诉我她是否在撒谎
<22-10,Bill>- I can't discuss-- just tell me she wasn't lying.

520
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,580
<22-10,Bill>告诉我
<22-10,Bill>Just tell me that.

521
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,250
<22-10,Bill>我应该做这个决定?
<22-10,Bill>I'm supposed to make this decision?

522
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,930
<22-10,Bill>我连她是什么人都不知道
<22-10,Bill>I don't even know who she is anymore.

523
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,820
<22-11,Foreman>无论如何 你必须马上决定
<22-11,Foreman>Either way,you gotta do it right now.

524
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,420
<22-12,Bill>你认为对就去做吧
<22-12,Bill>Do whatever you think is right.

525
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,890
<23-1,Chase>她只能活一天 顶多两天
<23-1,Chase>I'd give her a day.Two days at the most.

526
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,060
<23-2,House>太棒了 你负责演时钟
<23-2,House>Great.You be the clock.

527
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,570
<23-2,House>其他人负责扮医生
<23-2,House>Everyone else will be the doctors.

528
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,530
<23-2,House>心脏 肾 现在是肝
<23-2,House>Heart,kidneys,now liver.

529
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,350
<23-4,Chase>- 淀粉样变性病? - MRI没发现斑点
<23-4,Chase>- Amyloidosis? - No speckles on the mri.

530
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,320
<23-4,Chase>α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症?
<23-4,Chase>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?

531
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,570
<23-5,Foreman>肾衰竭太严重了
<23-5,Foreman>Too much kidney failure.

532
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,550
<23-6,Taub>肝纤维化?
<23-6,Taub>Primary hepatic fibrosis?

533
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,590
<23-7,House>这是最靠谱的猜测了 给她上类固醇
<23-7,House>That's our best guess.Start her on steroids.

534
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,620
<23-8,Chase>即便我们猜对了 肝的损伤太严重
<23-8,Chase>Even if we're right,the liver's probably too scarred.

535
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,230
<23-8,Chase>- 我们得登记给她找个新肝 - 就凭一个不确定的诊断?
<23-8,Chase>- We've got to list her for a new one. - With an unconfirmed diagnosis?

536
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,970
<23-10,Foreman>- 不可能获得通过 - 家属捐赠呢?
<23-10,Foreman>- Not gonna happen. - How about   a family member?

537
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,420
<23-11,Chase>我想她丈夫血型不一样
<23-11,Chase>I don't think the husband is   the right blood type.

538
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,730
<23-11,Chase>即便吻合 他现在也不愿捐了
<23-11,Chase>Even if he was,he's not gonna give his liver now.

539
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,740
<23-12,Thirteen>- 他离开她了 我猜? - 还没有
<23-12,Thirteen>- He left her,I  assume? - not yet.

540
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,390
<23-13,Taub>说是不会在她病重时抛弃她
<23-13,Taub>Says he won't abandon her while she's sick.

541
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,400
<23-13,Taub>她没别的亲人了么?
<23-13,Taub>She have any   other family members?

542
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,380
<23-14,Thirteen>没人会冒生命危险去救她
<23-14,Thirteen>No one's gonna risk their life to save hers.

543
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,000
<23-15,House>天 一精神病人不过打打你小报告 你就变得如此刻薄了
<23-15,House>Man,one false accusation from a psychopath,and you turned out to be a real bummer.

544
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,470
<23-15,House>我去看看Wilson还有没肝剩的
<23-15,House>I'm gonna go see if wilson has the liver left.

545
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280
<24-1,Wilson>你在干什么?
<24-1,Wilson>What are you doing?

546
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,530
<24-2,House>替Wibberly还几个月的房贷
<24-2,House>Paying wibberly's mortgage for a few months.

547
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,820
<24-2,House>恭喜恐吓战术又成功了
<24-2,House>Congratulations on another successful round of hectoring.

548
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,150
<24-3,Wilson>慢着 这是一张真的支票?
<24-3,Wilson>Wait a minute,I s that actually a check for him?

549
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,270
<24-4,House>不 这是一张保管中奖的彩票
<24-4,House>No.It's a giant novelty item for winning the lottery.

550
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,290
<24-4,House>你站太远 瞅不清啊?
<24-4,House>You're just standing really far away.

551
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,310
<24-5,Wilson>这么多人需要帮助 为何偏偏选这家伙?
<24-5,Wilson>Of all the people to go the extra mile for,why this guy?

552
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,970
<24-6,House>不知道 大概因为他喷儿香而且总逗我乐
<24-6,House>I don't know.He just kinda smells good and makes me laugh.

553
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,270
<24-7,Wilson>为什么不是Cuddy? 你还没为剪坏她照片道歉
<24-7,Wilson>Why not cuddy?You never apologized after you defaced her photo.

554
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,790
<24-8,House>大概因为我觉得把人整得无家可归
<24-8,House>Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poor house

555
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,680
<24-8,House>比篡改照片更严重
<24-8,House>is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.

556
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,310
<24-9,Wilson>不 因为你对Cuddy有感觉
<24-9,Wilson>No,I t's because cuddy actually means something to you,

557
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,620
<24-9,Wilson>所以很难开口向她道歉
<24-9,Wilson>which makes it much harder to apologize.

558
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,520
<24-10,House>唉
<24-10,House>Oy.

559
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,660
<24-10,House>如果能让你闭嘴 我会为照片的事向她道歉
<24-10,House>If it will make you shut up,I  will tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

560
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,010
<24-11,Wilson>别提照片的事 House 她这些年一直爱着你
<24-11,Wilson>Forget the photo.House,she was in love with you.

561
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,130
<24-11,Wilson>换回的却是你的羞辱
<24-11,Wilson>And all she got in return was abuse.

562
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,860
<24-11,Wilson>这么多年戏弄她的感情
<24-11,Wilson>For years you toyed with her emotions.

563
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,090
<24-12,House>她才没有爱我
<24-12,House>She wasn't in love with me.

564
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,740
<24-13,Wilson>你抵死不承认 更加证明了我的观点
<24-13,Wilson>The fact that you   **

565
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,910
<24-13,Wilson>那你到底想怎样?
<24-13,Wilson>***

566
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,160
<24-14,House>搭救那家伙是你的主意
<24-14,House>helping the guy was your idea.

567
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,420
<24-15,Wilson>不 尽管帮他 爱咋咋地...
<24-15,Wilson>No,help the guy,whatever...

568
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,220
<24-15,Wilson>我只是想指出
<24-15,Wilson>I'm just pointing out that it's much easier

569
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,940
<24-15,Wilson>通过给一个陌生人砸钱 来摆脱内疚
<24-15,Wilson>to soothe your guilt by throwing money at a stranger

570
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,690
<24-15,Wilson>比补偿一个你真正在乎的人 要容易得多
<24-15,Wilson>than by making amends  to a person you actually cared about.

571
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,150
<24-16,House>原来你一直把我当叫花子打发
<24-16,House>You had me at "much easier.

572
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,330
<24-16,House>我要假装埋头工作了
<24-16,House>" I'm gonna pretend to go to work now.

573
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,400
<24-16,House>Bing!
<24-16,House>Bing!

574
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,710
<25-1,Thirteen>Sarah?
<25-1,Thirteen>Sarah?

575
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,070
<25-1,Thirteen>我是Hadley医生 抱歉打扰你 听说你是Valerie的姐姐?
<25-1,Thirteen>I'm dr. Hadley.I'm--I'm sorry to bother you,but I was told you're valerie's sister?

576
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,390
<25-1,Thirteen>我很意外你会来看她
<25-1,Thirteen>I was just surprised you came to visit.

577
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,050
<25-2,Sarah>我家人也很意外
<25-2,Sarah>So istststste of my family.

578
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,100
<25-3,Thirteen>我更意外的是 你去做捐赠者检查了
<25-3,Thirteen>I was even more surprised you got tested as a donor.

579
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,410
<25-4,Sarah>血型不一致
<25-4,Sarah>Wrong blood type.

580
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,340
<25-5,Thirteen>但为什么? 你明知她是什么人
<25-5,Thirteen>But why?I mean,you know what she's like.

581
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,310
<25-6,Sarah>她其实没那么坏
<25-6,Sarah>She's not that bad.

582
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,920
<25-7,Thirteen>她就这么坏
<25-7,Thirteen>Yes,she is.

583
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,240
<25-8,Sarah>我们父亲是个粗暴的酒鬼
<25-8,Sarah>Our dad was a mean drunk.

584
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,930
<25-8,Sarah>我是最年长的姐姐
<25-8,Sarah>I was the older sister.

585
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,280
<25-8,Sarah>我有责任保护她 而不是反过来
<25-8,Sarah>I was supposed way around.

586
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,070
<25-9,Thirteen>她小时候曾保护你?
<25-9,Thirteen>R she protected you when you were kids?

587
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:15,830
<25-10,Sarah>但突然之间 他的粗暴 他的虐待...
<25-10,Sarah>Yeah,and then all of the sudden... All of his crap and all his abuse...

588
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,340
<25-10,Sarah>改变了她
<25-10,Sarah>It just changed her.

589
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,250
<25-10,Sarah>使她变得铁石心肠
<25-10,Sarah>It made her cold.

590
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,140
<25-11,Thirteen>什么时候?
<25-11,Thirteen>When?

591
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,880
<26-1,Thirteen>我们搞错了 精神变态是一个症状
<26-1,Thirteen>We were wrong.Psychopathy is a symptom.

592
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,130
<26-1,Thirteen>我和她姐姐聊了
<26-1,Thirteen>I spoke to her sister.

593
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,320
<26-1,Thirteen>她并非向来如此
<26-1,Thirteen>She wasn't always like this.

594
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,130
<26-1,Thirteen>她变了 就在她青春期
<26-1,Thirteen>She changed,and right around adolescence.

595
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:44,870
<26-2,House>那么说 肝 心脏 脑子 一度潜伏 青春期开始病发
<26-2,House>So liver,heart,brain,can lie dormant,and it starts at puberty.

596
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,350
<26-2,House>是粗粮食谱导致病发...果仁里富含铜
<26-2,House>The raw food diet made it go fulminant... Nuts are high in copper.

597
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,030
<26-2,House>是威尔森氏病
<26-2,House>It's wilson's disease.

598
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,270
<26-3,Thirteen>我们已经排除那个了 没有凯-费环
<26-3,Thirteen>We ruled that out.No keyser-fleischer rings.

599
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,200
<26-4,House>还有一个症状
<26-4,House>There is one other sign.

600
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,050
<26-4,House>我知道有女同性恋用唇膏 (指女同性恋的女生角色)
<26-4,House>I know there are lipstick lesbians.

601
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,240
<26-4,House>不知道双性恋用不用洗甲水?
<26-4,House>Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?

602
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,160
<27-1,Bill>她不该来的
<27-1,Bill>She's not supposed to be here.

603
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:20,800
<27-2,House>作为医生她不能来  你们可没质疑过她作化妆助理的资质
<27-2,House>As a doctor.You didn't say anything   about her capacity as a beautician's assistant.

604
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,760
<27-3,Bill>她的指甲是蓝的?
<27-3,Bill>Her fingernail's blue?

605
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,040
<27-3,Bill>是的
<27-3,Bill>Yep.

606
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,350
<27-4,House>给她上鏊合剂
<27-4,House>Start her on chelation.

607
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,260
<27-5,Valerie>刚刚发生了什么?
<27-5,Valerie>What just happened?

608
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,570
<27-6,Thirteen>你会好起来了
<27-6,Thirteen>You're gonna get better.

609
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,590
<27-6,Thirteen>你的身体无法代谢铜
<27-6,Thirteen>Your body has an inability to process copper.

610
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,980
<27-6,Thirteen>引起了所有问题
<27-6,Thirteen>It caused all of your problems.

611
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,950
<27-6,Thirteen>甚至你大脑的问题
<27-6,Thirteen>Even what's wrong with your brain.

612
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,310
<27-7,Bill>这个也会改善吗?
<27-7,Bill>And that's gonna change too?

613
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,660
<27-8,Thirteen>也许病症已经永久性改变了她的神经通路
<27-8,Thirteen>It's probably rewired her neurons permanently by now.

614
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,050
<27-9,Valerie>不过还是有可能的?
<27-9,Valerie>But it's possible?

615
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,200
<27-9,Valerie>有可能
<27-9,Valerie>Maybe.

616
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,060
<27-10,Thirteen>我要去准备鏊合剂治疗的设备
<27-10,Thirteen>I have to go get the chelation equipment.

617
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,560
<27-10,Thirteen>Bill 我要你签一些表
<27-10,Thirteen>Bill,I  need you to sign some forms.

618
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,780
<27-11,Thirteen>你还不明白她在做什么吗?
<27-11,Thirteen>You don't see what she's doing?

619
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,280
<27-11,Thirteen>她在做铺垫 准备好在治疗之后
<27-11,Thirteen>She's laying the groundwork to get her treatment,

620
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,290
<27-11,Thirteen>转变成另一个人 这样你和你的钱都还属于她
<27-11,Thirteen>wake up a completely different person,so that you and all of your money stay with her.

621
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,190
<27-11,Thirteen>这是个谎言
<27-11,Thirteen>It's a lie.

622
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,530
<27-12,Bill>你说有可能的
<27-12,Bill>You said there was a chance.

623
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,340
<27-13,Thirteen>是的 可能性很小
<27-13,Thirteen>Okay,there's a teeny chance.

624
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,880
<27-13,Thirteen>但即使治好了她 还是无法让她爱上你
<27-13,Thirteen>But even if it cures her,I t's not going to make her love you.

625
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,370
<27-14,Bill>我之前很幸福...
<27-14,Bill>I was happy before...

626
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:47,740
<27-15,Thirteen>我知道 很抱歉 但这不是真的
<27-15,Thirteen>I know.And I'm sorry,but it wasn't real.

627
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,660
<27-16,Bill>但感觉很真实
<27-16,Bill>It felt real.

628
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,480
<27-16,Bill>我不知道...
<27-16,Bill>I don't know...

629
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,470
<27-16,Bill>可能那样就足够了
<27-16,Bill>Maybe that can be enough.

630
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,660
<28-1,Wibberly>你真的要为我这么做?
<28-1,Wibberly>You're really doing this for me?

631
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,940
<28-2,House>能帮我减税的
<28-2,House>Tax shelter.

632
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,190
<28-2,House>我现在能吃点辣椒了
<28-2,House>I'll take some of that chili now.

633
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,750
<28-3,Wibberly>我不能接受
<28-3,Wibberly>I can't accept this.

634
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,010
<28-4,House>好吧 不吃辣椒了
<28-4,House>Fine.Forget the chili.

635
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,210
<28-4,House>拜拜 Wibberly
<28-4,House>Bye,wibberly.

636
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,910
<28-5,Wibberly>用你的文章我得了A+
<28-5,Wibberly>I got an "a"-plus with your paper.

637
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,280
<28-5,Wibberly>我在纽约Mercy医院做了 十年整形外科医生
<28-5,Wibberly>I was an orthopedic surgeon for ten years at new york mercy.

638
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,110
<28-5,Wibberly>我赌博成瘾
<28-5,Wibberly>I had a gambling problem.

639
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,410
<28-5,Wibberly>我试图通过多收医保病人的医疗费还赌债 丢了执照
<28-5,Wibberly>I tried to cover it  by over-billing some medicare patients.Lost my license.

640
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,150
<28-5,Wibberly>是我沦落至此的原因 不是因为你
<28-5,Wibberly>That's why I'm here.Not because of you.

641
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,710
<28-6,House>为什么你现在告诉我这些?
<28-6,House>Why are you telling me this now?

642
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,610
<28-7,Wibberly>因为我以为你还跟医学院那会儿一样混蛋 但是...
<28-7,Wibberly>Because I thought you'd be the same bastard you were in med school,but,uh...

643
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,450
<28-8,House>拿着
<28-8,House>Keep it.

644
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,490

<28-9,Wibberly>No,I  can get another place.

645
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,150
<28-10,House>拿着 我耍了你
<28-10,House>Just take it.I screwed you over.

646
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,980
<28-11,Wibberly>你让我得了A+
<28-11,Wibberly>You got me an "a"-plus.

647
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,900
<28-12,House>- 拿着 - 不要!
<28-12,House>- Take it. - No!

648
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,860
<28-13,Wibberly>一定要我塞进你喉咙啊?
<28-13,Wibberly>Do I have to shove it down your throat?

649
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,220
<28-14,House>拿着他妈的支票!
<28-14,House>Take the damn check!

650
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,940
<29-1,Thirteen>你的指标好转了
<29-1,Thirteen>Your vitals are up.

651
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,920
<29-2,Valerie>治疗起作用了?
<29-2,Valerie>Treatment's working?

652
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,820
<29-3,Thirteen>我不确定能否治好你的肝脏 但肯定能安排你换个新的
<29-3,Thirteen>I'm not sure we can fix your liver,but we can  definitely list you for a new one.

653
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,670
<29-4,Bill>等你好一点了 我们去度个长假
<29-4,Bill>When you're better,we're gonna take a long vacation.

654
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,670
<29-4,Bill>你想去越南 在那儿的沙滩 我们可以住在小木屋里
<29-4,Bill>You wanna go to vietnam,one of the beaches,we're gonna get a hut.

655
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,140
<29-4,Bill>只有你和我 什么都不用担心
<29-4,Bill>Just you and me,nothing to worry about.

656
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,030
<29-5,Valerie>你真可悲
<29-5,Valerie>You're pathetic.

657
