<2-2,Coach>这儿需要医生
<2-2,Coach>Get a doctor!

10
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,380
<3-2,House>-嘿  -把门关上
<3-2,House>- Hey.  - Close the door.

11
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,830
<3-2,House>快把门关上
<3-2,House>Close the door.

12
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,550
<3-3,Wilson>卡迪是不是在跟你玩躲猫猫呢啊
<3-3,Wilson>Is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?

13
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,520
<3-4,House>她知道我在这儿  在门诊
<3-4,House>She knows I'm in here, in the clinic,

14
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,760
<3-4,House>正像她指示的那样
<3-4,House>as she commanded.

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,110
<3-4,House>她只是不知道我没看病人
<3-4,House>She just doesn't know I'm alone.

16
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,000
<3-5,Wilson>候诊室都人满为患了
<3-5,Wilson>Well, you've got a full waiting room.

17
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,000
<3-5,Wilson>-你还要无视他们多久  -我四点下班
<3-5,Wilson>- How long do you think you can ignore them?  - I'm off at 4:00.

18
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,620
<3-7,Wilson>你这样做就为了逃避5分钟的工作啊
<3-7,Wilson>You're doing this to avoid five minutes of work?

19
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,440
<3-8,House>如果我出去看病
<3-8,House>If I go out there,

20
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,020
<3-8,House>我将面对一个流鼻涕的小朋友
<3-8,House>I get assigned a kid with a runny nose.

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,300
<3-8,House>也就是花30秒医好他的鼻子
<3-8,House>That's 30 seconds looking at the nose,

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,230
<3-8,House>再花25分钟和忧心忡忡的母亲聊天
<3-8,House>25 minutes talking to a worried mom.

23
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,490
<3-8,House>直到让她相信
<3-8,House>who won't leave until she's sure

24
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,050
<3-8,House>孩子得的不是脑膜炎或癌症才肯离开
<3-8,House>it's not meningitis or a tumor.

25
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,140
<3-9,Wilson>是啊  瞎操心的家长真烦人啊
<3-9,Wilson>Yes. Concerned parents can be so annoying.

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,050
<3-9,Wilson>直接告诉卡迪你有重病患者
<3-9,Wilson>Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,900
<3-9,Wilson>需要提前结束门诊就完了
<3-9,Wilson>You had to leave early.

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,870
<3-10,House>那可是在说谎
<3-10,House>That would be lying.

29
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,100
<3-11,Wilson>说谎话不好是吧
<3-11,Wilson>And that would be wrong.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,250
<3-11,Wilson>而且好在"轻重"是一个相对概念
<3-11,Wilson>But luckily the definition of"urgent" is fungible.

31
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,840
<3-12,House>但是患者是绝对概念
<3-12,House>Not the definition of"case" though.

32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,120
<3-13,Wilson>你没有患者吗
<3-13,Wilson>You have no cases?

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,200
<3-13,Wilson>一个患者都没有吗
<3-13,Wilson>You have no cases?

34
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,550
<3-13,Wilson>你精挑细选了一批精英级医生
<3-13,Wilson>You've got handpicked doctors-specialists-

35
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,730
<3-13,Wilson>为你工作  就让他们百无聊赖吗
<3-13,Wilson>working for you,and they're sitting on their hands?

36
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,440
<3-14,House>卡梅隆在帮我回复邮件
<3-14,House>Cameron's answering my mail.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,370
<3-15,Wilson>真是相当充分的利用了时间
<3-15,Wilson>Oh, time well spent, I'm sure.

38
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,710
<3-15,Wilson>福曼和奇斯呢
<3-15,Wilson>Foreman and Chase?

<4-4,House>Please write that down.

44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,800
<4-5,House>-豪斯医生吗  -抱歉  今天下班了
<4-5,House>- Dr. House.  - Sorry. Done for the day.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,670
<4-5,House>会有很多其它医生给你看病

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,290
<4-7,House>很棒的试探  但是这是个免费门诊
<4-7,House>Nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic,

48
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,430
<4-7,House>也就是说没有预约制度
<4-7,House>which means there are no appointments.

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,360
<4-7,House>免费门诊  进来填表  就有医生给你看病
<4-7,House>You walk in, sign the chart,and a doctor will see you.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,430
<4-7,House>只不过不是我
<4-7,House>Just not me.

51
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,850
<4-8,Dad>您的邮件上说你会给我们看病的
<4-8,Dad>Your letter says that we'd see you.

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,490
<4-9,House>-我不怎么写信  -你看
<4-9,House>- Not a big letter writer.  - Here.

55
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,520
<4-13,House>上边的怎么会写出一个圈圈来呢
<4-13,House>See how it makes a big loop on top?

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,960
<4-13,House>看起来根本不像我的字体  知道怎么想吗
<4-13,House>Doesn't even look like my handwriting. Think I have something?

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,270
<4-13,House>给一个像初中女生一样写G的人
<4-13,House>What's the differential diagnosis for

<4-13,House>writing G's like a junior high school girl?

59
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,430
<4-14,Cameron>想通过正常渠道找你看病简直是不可能
<4-14,Cameron>It's impossible to get to you through normal channels.

60
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,950
<4-14,Cameron>电话  邮件  他们都试过了
<4-14,Cameron>They have called, e-mailed.

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,440
<4-15,House>坚持不懈并不等于值得关注
<4-15,House>Perseverance does not equal worthiness.

62
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,660
<4-15,House>下次再想吸引我注意
<4-15,House>Next time you want to get my attention,

<4-16,Cameron>- The kid's been to two neurologists, and he  -Night terrors?

<4-22,House>九成情况下  不用和患者谈话
<4-22,House>Nine times out of 10,there's no reason to talk to a patient.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,870
<4-22,House>但是一个16岁的孩子夜惊
<4-22,House>But night terrors in a 16-year-oldis a very good reason

73
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,970
<4-22,House>是一个去和他家人聊一聊非常好的理由
<4-22,House>to talk to this family.

<4-22,House>干得好

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,190
<5-4,Mom>这说明什么
<5-4,Mom>What does that tell you?

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,740
<5-5,House>什么都说明不了  看他眨眼睛挺好玩的
<5-5,House>Nothing. It's just fun watching him blink.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,790

<5-8,Dad>What does that tell you?

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,730
<5-9,House>说明两个问题  神经系统正常
<5-9,House>Proves two things: No neurological damage,

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,710
<5-9,House>你儿子不可能当厨师了
<5-9,House>and your son is never gonna be chief fry cook.

88
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,940
<5-9,House>十多岁孩子夜惊只可能有两种原因
<5-9,House>In teens, there are two likely causes of night terrors.

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,270
<5-9,House>外伤造成的压力

<5-9,House>-最近在学校火拼了吗  -没有
<5-9,House>- Any recent shoot-outs at your high school?  - No.

91
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,000
<5-11,House>-那么戴夫  -是丹
<5-11,House>- Well then, Dave  - Dan.

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,260
<5-11,House>如果没有外伤
<5-11,House>If there's no trauma,

93
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,160
<5-12,Cameron>那么另一个原因就是  性侵犯
<5-12,Cameron>the other cause is... sexual abuse.

94
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,280
<5-12,Cameron>有谁性骚扰你吗  老师
<5-12,Cameron>So who's molesting you? Teacher?

95
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,800
<5-12,Cameron>份外友好的邻居吗
<5-12,Cameron>Extra-friendly neighbor?

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,980
<5-12,Cameron>我想问你俩是帮凶吗
<5-12,Cameron>I'd ask if either of you were involved,

97
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,840
<5-13,Dad>但是你们肯定不会承认的
<5-13,Dad>but you'd deny it.

98
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,390
<5-13,Dad>我们绝对不会伤害丹的
<5-13,Dad>We would never do anything to hurt Dan.

99
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,900
<5-14,House>我这边儿刚说完  那边儿就映证了
<5-14,House>I say it here, it comes out there.

100
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,140
<5-14,House>失去反应和性虐待有关
<5-14,House>This lack of response is consistent with abuse.

101
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,030
<5-15,Dan>从没有过这种事情好吗  我发誓
<5-15,Dan>There's no one, okay? I- I swear.

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,240
<5-15,Dan>有外伤  我在长曲棍球赛中头部受伤了
<5-15,Dan>There was trauma. I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.

103
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,510
<5-16,House>你知道他头部受伤吗
<5-16,House>Did you know that he got hit in the head?

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,720
<5-17,Cameron>他们从来没提过
<5-17,Cameron>They didn't mention it. No.

105
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,650
<5-18,House>是啊  这点小事儿何必一提呢
<5-18,House>Yeah. Why bother?

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,770
<5-19,Dad>不对  不对  比赛之后
<5-19,Dad>No, no. We took him to the E.R.

107
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,420
<5-19,Dad>我们送他去急诊室了
<5-19,Dad>After the game.

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,150
<5-19,Dad>医生为他做了扫描  说他没事儿
<5-19,Dad>He was scanned. They tested him. They said he was fine.

109
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,740
<5-19,Dad>没有脑震荡  肯定是其它别的什么原因
<5-19,Dad>No concussion. It's gotta be something else.

110
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,790
<5-20,House>你吵着要我给你诊断  又质疑我的诊断
<5-20,House>You hound me for my opinion, and then you question my diagnosis.

111
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,810
<5-20,House>好吧  急诊室显然搞错了  孩子脑震荡了
<5-20,House>Cool. E.R. obviously screwed up. Kid's got a concussion.

112
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,470
<5-21,Dan>在被撞击前我看东西也会重影
<5-21,Dan>I had double vision before I was hit.

113
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,870
<5-22,House>很好  那样的话一切都不同了
<5-22,House>Well, that changes everything.

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,580
<5-22,House>你需要戴眼镜了
<5-22,House>You need glasses.

115
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,830
<5-21,Dan>那才是重影的原因
<5-21,Dan>That's why you had double vision,

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,010
<5-22,House>也是你被撞击的原因
<5-22,House>which is why you got hit,

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,300
<5-22,House>也是你脑震荡的原因
<5-22,House>which is why you have a concussion,

118
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,910
<5-22,House>和夜惊的原因
<5-22,House>which is why you have night terrors.

119
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,780
<5-22,House>你需要去看眼科专家  而且我不是
<5-22,House>You need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.

120
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,410
<5-23,Cameron>你很喜欢这样子
<5-23,Cameron>You enjoyed that.

121
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,320
<5-23,Cameron>我给你送来了一个不错的病例
<5-23,Cameron>I brought a reasonable case to your attention,

122
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,230
<5-23,Cameron>而你当面解决掉  是想羞辱我吧
<5-23,Cameron>and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.

123
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,390
<5-25,Cameron>-你是独生女吧  -为什么这么说
<5-25,Cameron>- You're an only child, aren't you?  - Why would you say that?

124
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,820
<5-26,House>因为你总是以自己为中心
<5-26,House>Because everything is about you.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,620
<5-26,House>这个话题也许极富争议
<5-26,House>This may seem incredibly controversial,

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
<5-26,House>但是我认为性侵犯总是不好的
<5-26,House>but I think sexual abuse is bad.

127
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,360
<5-26,House>我只是想确定
<5-26,House>I just wanted to make sure

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,560
<5-26,House>他不是被他爸爸或者妈妈侵犯了
<5-26,House>he wasn't being diddled by Daddy- or Mommy.

129
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,440
<5-26,House>其它的部分只能算作是意外收获了
<5-26,House>Anything else is just a bonus.

130
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
<5-27,Cameron>-我不是独生女  -有意思
<5-27,Cameron>- I'm not an only child.  - Interesting.

131
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,150
<5-29,Cameron>-什么  -别动
<5-29,Cameron>- What?  - Don't move.

132
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,520
<5-30,House>我是不是让你觉得很无聊呢
<5-30,House>Did I bore you in there?

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,310
<5-31,Dan>什么  没有  真没有
<5-31,Dan>What? Uh, no. Not- Not really.

134
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,250
<5-32,House>你累吗
<5-32,House>Are you tired?

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,900
<5-34,Dad>-时而  -他一点儿觉没睡  当然疲劳了
<5-34,Dad>- Sometimes.  - He never sleeps. Of course he's tired.

136
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,920
<5-35,House>现在  此时此刻
<5-35,House>Right now. At this moment.

137
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,050
<5-32,House>-你累吗  -不 不累
<5-32,House>- Are you tired?  - No. No.

138
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,070
<5-37,House>那让你腿部抽动  你感觉到了吗
<5-37,House>That twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?

139
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,570
<5-39,Dad>-不疼吗  -他的腿抽搐  我不明白这
<5-39,Dad>- Didn't hurt.  - His leg twitched. I don't see what-

140
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,950
<5-40,House>这是种叫做肌阵挛的现象
<5-40,House>It's called a myoclonic jerk.

141
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,030
<5-40,House>很常见  经常发生在睡眠时候
<5-40,House>It's very common when you're falling asleep.

142
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,340
<5-40,House>呼吸率下降
<5-40,House>Respiration rate falls,

143
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,100
<5-40,House>大脑以为身体在衰竭而作出的条件反射
<5-40,House>and the brain sometimes interprets this as the body dying,

144
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,480
<5-40,House>释放出醒来的讯号
<5-40,House>so it sends a pulse to wake it up.

145
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,030
<5-42,House>-那又怎样  -所以他睡不着觉
<5-42,House>- So?  - So, he's not asleep.

146
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,310
<5-42,House>一直醒着
<5-42,House>He's awake.

147
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,890
<5-42,House>收他住院
<5-42,House>Admit him.

148
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,060
<6-1,House>我认得那个圈圈G
<6-1,House>I recognize that loopy "G. '"

149
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,790
<6-1,House>那么  混蛋是怎么说的
<6-1,House>So, what does the jerk tell us?

150
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,710
<6-2,Foreman>没什么好消息  大脑在丧失对身体的控制
<6-2,Foreman>Nothing good. The brain's losing control of the body.

151
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,980
<6-2,Foreman>不能控制眼睛聚焦
<6-2,Foreman>Can't order the eyes to focus,

152
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,800
<6-2,Foreman>也不能控制正常的睡眠模式以及肌肉
<6-2,Foreman>regulate sleep patterns or control muscles.

153
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,290
<6-3,House>不是运动功能紊乱就是脑功能衰竭
<6-3,House>A movement disorder or a degenerative brain disease.

154
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,800
<6-3,House>不管是哪种病
<6-3,House>Either way,

155
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,700
<6-3,House>这孩子都将要穿着尿布
<6-3,House>this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers

156
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,880
<6-3,House>坐着轮椅去领毕业证书了
<6-3,House>and a wheelchair.

157
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,020
<6-4,Chase>可能没那么严重  或许只是感染了
<6-4,Chase>Maybe not that bad. Could be an infection.

158
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,910
<6-5,House>一厢情愿  没有发烧  也没有白细胞增长
<6-5,House>You wish. No fever, no white count.

159
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,100
<6-5,House>有人认为这个鉴别诊断可能会有问题吗
<6-5,House>Anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised

160
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,800
<6-6,Cameron>因为我们没有病人准确的家庭患病史
<6-6,Cameron>because we don't have an accurate family history?

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,590
<6-6,Cameron>我拿到了准确的家庭患病史
<6-6,Cameron>I took an accurate family history.

162
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,780
<6-7,House>你甚至没见到准确的家庭
<6-7,House>You didn't even take an accurate family.

163
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,570
<6-8,Chase>-他父亲不是生父  -为什么这么说
<6-8,Chase>- His father's not his father.  - Why would you say that?

164
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,990
<6-9,House>大约有百分之三十的父亲
<6-9,House>Thirty percent of all dads

165
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,090
<6-9,House>不知道自己养了别人的孩子
<6-9,House>don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.

166
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,190
<6-10,Foreman>错误的父子关系大概只有一成左右
<6-10,Foreman>False paternity's more like 10%.

167
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,600
<6-11,House>妈妈更喜欢这种说法
<6-11,House>That's what our moms would like us to believe.

168
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,100
<6-11,House>有什么关系呢
<6-11,House>Who cares?

169
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,890
<6-12,Cameron>如果是从他父母那儿遗传过来的
<6-12,Cameron>If he got it from his parents,

170
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,980
<6-12,Cameron>父母应该都已经死掉了
<6-12,Cameron>they'd both be dead.

171
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,850
<6-12,Cameron>我们可以继续这个鉴别诊断了吗
<6-12,Cameron>Can we get on with the differential diagnosis?

172
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,170
<6-13,House>50块钱赌我是对的
<6-13,House>Fifty bucks says I'm right.

173
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,980
<6-14,Foreman>-我一定赢你  -说到你痛处了吗
<6-14,Foreman>- I'll take your money.  - Hit a nerve?

174
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,020
<6-15,House>别担心  我确定抚养你长大的是你亲生父亲
<6-15,House>Don't worry. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in was your daddy.

175
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,900
<6-16,Foreman>加注到100块
<6-16,Foreman>Make it a hundred.

176
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,260
<6-17,Cameron>16岁得脑白质病的想法怎么样
<6-17,Cameron>What about leukoencephalopathy in a 16-year-old?

177
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,300
<6-18,Chase>不一定非得是重病
<6-18,Chase>It doesn't necessarily have to be that bad.

178
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,780
<6-18,Chase>如果不考虑夜惊  可能是一种系统疾病
<6-18,Chase>If we exclude the night terrors, it could be something systemic.

179
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,970
<6-18,Chase>他的肝脏  肾脏
<6-18,Chase>His liver, kidneys.

180
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,580
<6-18,Chase>-除了大脑意外的器官  -好样的
<6-18,Chase>- Something outside the brain.  - Yes.

181
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,800
<6-19,House>排除所有的症状  你的工作就轻松了
<6-19,House>Feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.

182
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,680
<6-20,Chase>夜惊可能是杜撰出来的症状
<6-20,Chase>Night terrors were anecdotaly.

183
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,660
<6-20,Chase>他可能是做了一个噩梦而已
<6-20,Chase>He could've had a bad dream.

184
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,380
<6-21,Cameron>不对  他的家长说在夜惊的时候他意识清醒
<6-21,Cameron>No Parents said he was conscious during

185
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,570
<6-21,Cameron>之后就什么都不记得了
<6-21,Cameron>and didn't remember anything afterwards.

186
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,720
<6-22,Chase>-那正是夜惊  -家长说的吗
<6-22,Chase>- That's a night terror.  - Parents said?

187
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,640
<6-23,House>说的好
<6-23,House>That's a good point.

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,040
<6-23,House>在我们判决这个孩子之前
<6-23,House>Before we condemn this kid,

189
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,700
<6-23,House>或许我们首先应该认同一下
<6-23,House>maybe we should entertain

190
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,850
<6-23,House>奇斯医生的怀疑精神
<6-23,House>Dr. Chase's skepticism.

191
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,410
<6-23,House>我想要一个份详细的睡眠记录
<6-23,House>I want a detailed polysomnograph.

192
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,700
<6-23,House>如果他真的夜惊
<6-23,House>If he's having night terrors,

193
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,840
<6-23,House>我要亲眼所见
<6-23,House>I want to see them.

194
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,940
<7-1,Dan>通常夜惊时我不会乱动的
<7-1,Dan>I usually don't move during night terrors.

195
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,850
<7-2,House>不是因为那个把你捆起来的
<7-2,House>I'm not restraining you for them.

196
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,140
<7-2,House>脑电图显示了你脑中的异常情况
<7-2,House>E.E.G. revealed abnormalities in your brain-

197
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,760
<7-2,House>导致你的脚趾神经受损
<7-2,House>caused nerve damage in your toes.

198
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,770
<7-3,Dan>你要做什么
<7-3,Dan>What are you doing?

199
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,530
<7-5,Dan>-修好它  -我能和我爸妈谈谈吗
<7-5,Dan>- Fixing it.  - Can I talk to my parents?

200
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,420
<7-6,House>他们已经同意了
<7-6,House>Oh, they know all about this.

201
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,870
<7-7,Dan>我特别想见见他们
<7-7,Dan>I'd really like to see them.

202
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,400
<7-7,Dan>求你了  我特别希望他们能在这儿
<7-7,Dan>Please. I'd really like them here.

203
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,910
<7-8,House>会很疼的  丹
<7-8,House>This is gonna hurt, Dan.

204
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,960
<7-9,Dan>哦  天啊
<7-9,Dan>Oh. Oh, God.

205
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,060
<8-1,Chase>那是夜惊的症状
<8-1,Chase>That's a night terror.

206
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,400
<8-2,Foreman>我们做了CT透视
<8-2,Foreman>We did a C. T.,

207
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,730
<8-2,Foreman>核磁共振  全部血细胞计数
<8-2,Foreman>M.R.I., C.B.C.,

208
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,400
<8-2,Foreman>血液电解质测试  还有胸部X光透视
<8-2,Foreman>CHEM-7 and chest X-ray.

209
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
<8-2,Foreman>所有这些测试结果显示正常
<8-2,Foreman>All the tests came back normal.

210
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,050
<8-2,Foreman>无法解释他的症状
<8-2,Foreman>There's nothing to explain his symptoms.

211
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,070
<8-3,House>好吧  那咱们只能假设出问题了
<8-3,House>Okay, but let's pretend there's something and go from there.

212
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,200
<8-3,House>谁能看出核磁共振图像上有什么异常之处
<8-3,House>Who sees something on this M.R.I.?

213
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,420
<8-4,Cameron>白质没有损伤  也没有结构异常
<8-4,Cameron>No lesions in the white matter. No structural abnormalities.

214
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,340
<8-6,Cameron>没有无压迫性肿块
<8-6,Cameron>No space-occupying tumors.

215
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,570
<8-7,House>他才16岁  大脑未发育完全
<8-7,House>He's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain.

216
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,400
<8-7,House>最小的异常都有问题
<8-7,House>The smallest thing is abnormal.

217
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,080
<8-8,Chase>脑膜增生
<8-8,Chase>Meningeal enhancement.

218
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,430
<8-8,Chase>-我认为是病毒性脑膜炎  -很好
<8-8,Chase>- My bet is viral meningitis. - Excellent.

219
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,280
<8-9,House>你们看见人家怎么做的了吗
<8-9,House>Do you see what he did there?

220
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,010
<8-9,House>根据一点证明是神经问题的小线索
<8-9,House>Took a small clue that there's a neurological problem

221
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,480
<8-9,House>进行大胆地猜想
<8-9,House>and wasn't afraid to run with it.

222
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,690
<8-10,Foreman>核磁共振没有显示脑膜炎的症状
<8-10,Foreman>There's no evidence of meningitis on that M.R.I.

223
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,750
<8-11,House>没错  是没有  他完全说错了
<8-11,House>No, there's not. He's completely wrong.

224
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,870
<8-12,Cameron>那你说的线索是哪个
<8-12,Cameron>Then what clue are you talking about?

225
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,730
<8-13,House>他知道我从核磁共振上看出了些问题
<8-13,House>He knew that I saw something on the M.R.I.,

226
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,160
<8-13,House>所以他觉得一定是有问题  于是就猜了猜
<8-13,House>so he figured there must be something there and took a guess.

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,370
<8-14,Chase>-聪明  反被聪明误  -那你发现了什么
<8-14,Chase>- Clever, but also pathetic.  - So what did you find?

228
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,600
<8-15,House>仔细看看胼胝体
<8-15,House>Take a close look at the corpus callosum.

229
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,710
<8-16,Chase>-没问题啊  -咱们看的是同一个东西吗
<8-16,Chase>- Looks okay.  - Are we all looking at the same thing?

230
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,040
<8-17,House>两亿个脑半球之间的神经元
<8-17,House>Two hundred million interhemispheric nerve fibers.

231

<8-17,House>连接左右脑的华盛顿桥
<8-17,House>The George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain.

232
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,870
<8-17,House>很精巧的
<8-17,House>It's subtle.

233
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
<8-18,Chase>胼胝体有些弯曲  就在那
<8-18,Chase>There's some bowing. There.

234
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,310
<8-18,Chase>-向上拱起  -你是猜的吗
<8-18,Chase>- An upward arch. - Are you guessing?

235
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,320
<8-20,Chase>是
<8-20,Chase>Yes.

236
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,380
<8-21,House>-很遗憾  猜对了  -他可能只是动了一下
<8-21,House>- Too bad. You're right. - He probably just moved.

237
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,610
<8-22,Foreman>整个核磁共振检查中没人能保持完全静止
<8-22,Foreman>Nobody stays perfectly still for the entire M.R.I.

238
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,140
<8-23,House>对  估计他躺得不耐烦了然后把自己
<8-23,House>Yeah. Probably got restless and shifted

239
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,980
<8-23,House>一侧的脑半球移到了个更舒服的位置
<8-23,House>one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position.

240
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,720
<8-23,House>有东西压住了胼胝体
<8-23,House>Something is pushing on it.

241
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,200
<8-24,Foreman>如果有弯曲的话  可能是肿瘤
<8-24,Foreman>If there was bowing, could be a tumor.

242
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
<8-25,House>你在核磁共振上看见肿瘤了吗
<8-25,House>Do you see a tumor on this M.R.I.?

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,840
<8-26,Foreman>没有  可我也没看见弯曲
<8-26,Foreman>No, but I don't see any bowing either.

244
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,400
<8-27,House>没有肿瘤  只是阻塞导致颅内压力
<8-27,House>There's no tumor. Just a blockage causing pressure

245
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
<8-27,House>然后出现症状
<8-27,House>causing symptoms.

246
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,260
<8-27,House>今天是夜惊  明天就是眼睛出血
<8-27,House>Today, night terrors. Tomorrow, he's bleeding out of his eyes.

247
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,770
<8-27,House>给他做一个放射核甘脑池显像图
<8-27,House>Get him a radionucleotide cisternogram.

248
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,620
<8-27,House>保证你们会看到阻塞
<8-27,House>I guarantee you'll see a blockage.

249
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,400
<8-27,House>没事的
<8-27,House>Okay.

250
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,620
<9-3,Dad>放松
<9-3,Dad>Easy.

251
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,010
<9-1,Dad>乖  抓住我的手
<9-1,Dad>Okay. Squeeze my hand.

252
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,710
<9-1,Dad>没事的  抓紧
<9-1,Dad>All right. Squeeze hard.

253
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,380
<9-1,Dad>没事的
<9-1,Dad>All right.

254
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,090
<9-2,Foreman>我在注射一种以放射性同位素
<9-2,Foreman>Now I'm injecting a material that's

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,490
<9-2,Foreman>为标记的物质
<9-2,Foreman>tagged with a radioisotope.

256
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,210
<9-2,Foreman>它会进入你的脊椎  流入大脑
<9-2,Foreman>It's gonna enter your spine and travel up to your brain.

257
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,790
<9-2,Foreman>它会让你思维变得深沉
<9-2,Foreman>It'll make you able to think deep thoughts,

258
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,070
<9-2,Foreman>每小时跑100米
<9-2,Foreman>run a hundred miles an hour.

259
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,490
<9-3,Dad>放松
<9-3,Dad>Easy.

260
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,030
<9-4,Foreman>他们眼睛的颜色不同  不过眼睛里那个斑点
<9-4,Foreman>Their eyes aren't the same color, but that fleck in the eyes-

261
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,810
<9-4,Foreman>他们不是亲生父子的几率有十分之一
<9-4,Foreman>That's maybe a one-in-10 chance if they're not related?

262
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,800
<9-5,Chase>没戏  豪斯才不会因为这点理论就认输
<9-5,Chase>No. House isn't gonna pay you based on that.

263
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,600
<9-6,Foreman>怎么才能让他们做个基因测试
<9-6,Foreman>Any excuse we can give the folks to justify a D.N.A. test?

264
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,130
<9-7,Chase>我们可以说他得了亨丁顿氏舞蹈症
<9-7,Chase>We could tell them he's got Huntington's-

265
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,580
<9-7,Chase>全家人都要测试  不然就有生命危险
<9-7,Chase>whole family should be tested or they'll all die.

266
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,300
<9-8,Foreman>嗨
<9-8,Foreman>Hey.

267
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,660
<9-9,Foreman>确实有很多阻塞
<9-9,Foreman>There's a lot of blockage.

268
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
<9-10,Chase>我已经安排他进行手术了
<9-10,Chase>I've scheduled him for surgery.

269
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,670
<9-10,Chase>我们会将分流通管放入其中一个脑室
<9-10,Chase>We're gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles

270
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,410
<9-10,Chase>使脑脊液流出
<9-10,Chase>to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.

271
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,760
<9-11,Foreman>消除了颅内压力  一切恢复正常
<9-11,Foreman>No more pressure, everything goes back to normal.

272
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,530
<9-12,House>你们当他的医生  他真是三生有幸
<9-12,House>He's lucky to have you as his doctors.

<10-1,Young Mother>不喝配方奶  只喝健康自然的母乳
<10-1,Young Mother>No formula. Just Mommy's healthy, natural breast milk.

274

<10-2,House>美味
<10-2,House>Yummy.

275
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,280
<10-3,Young Mother>一夜之间她的脸就肿成这样了
<10-3,Young Mother>Her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.

276
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,710
<10-4,House>没有发烧

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,610
<10-5,Young Mother>我不会让她接种疫苗的
<10-5,Young Mother>We're not vaccinating.

279
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,390
<10-7,House>觉得疫苗没用是吗
<10-7,House>Think they don't work?

280
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,900
<10-8,Young Mother>我觉得是某些国际制药公司
<10-8,Young Mother>I think some multinational pharmaceutical company

281
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,330
<10-8,Young Mother>想让我以为疫苗有用
<10-8,Young Mother>wants me to think they work-

282
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,440
<10-8,Young Mother>好让他们赚钱
<10-8,Young Mother>pad their bottom line.

283
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,070
<10-9,House>-可以吗  -当然
<10-9,House>- May I? - Sure.

284
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,520
<10-10,Young Mother>全天然  不含化工染料  真是好做的生意
<10-10,Young Mother>Yeah. All-natural, no dyes is a good business.

<10-11,House>玩具公司  他们不会随便涨价
<10-11,House>Toy companies- they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs.

287
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,570
<10-11,House>也不会在研究和开发的花销上做文章
<10-11,House>They don't lie about how much they spend on research and development.

288
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,680
<10-11,House>一个玩具公司  最糟的情况不过是
<10-11,House>The worst that a toy company

289
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,340
<10-11,House>因为做了个无聊的青蛙而被人指控罢了
<10-11,House>could be accused of is making a really boring frog.

<10-12,House>母乳里的抗体只能保护小孩6个月
<10-12,House>The antibodies in yummy Mummy only protect the kid for six months,

295
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,740
<10-12,House>所以这些公司才觉得他们能从你那捞一笔
<10-12,House>which is why these companies think they can gouge you.

296
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,560
<10-12,House>他们觉得
<10-12,House>They think

297
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,830
<10-12,House>为了让自己孩子活下去  你不惜付出一切
<10-12,House>that you'll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive.

<10-12,House>想改变现状吗  证明他们错了
<10-12,House>Want to change things? Prove 'em wrong.

307
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,740
<11-3,Foreman>不过我们取了一瓶脑脊液  做了测试
<11-3,Foreman>But we took a vial of C.S.F. And tested it.

308
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,560
<11-4,House>是嘛
<11-4,House>Really?

309
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,310
<11-5,Foreman>结果显示弯曲并不是病因  是症状
<11-5,Foreman>Turns out the bowing wasn't the cause of his problems. It was a symptom.

310
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,320
<11-5,Foreman>寡克隆带弯曲
<11-5,Foreman>Oligoclonal bands

311

<11-6,Chase>而且脊髓腔内免疫球蛋白G数量增加
<11-6,Chase>and increased intrathecal IgG.

312
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,270
<11-7,House>意味着是多发性硬化症
<11-7,House>Which means multiple sclerosis.

313
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,070
<11-7,House>还有为什么你们三个一起来通知我
<11-7,House>And the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?

314
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,420
<11-8,Cameron>因为在多发性硬化症问题上我们意见不合
<11-8,Cameron>Because we're having a disagreement about whether or not it is M.S.

315
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,790
<11-9,Chase>核磁共振并没有显示病灶
<11-9,Chase>No lesions on the M.R.I.

316
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,720
<11-10,Foreman>还太早  他才患病2周左右
<11-10,Foreman>It's early. He's had the disease for maybe two weeks.

317
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,440
<11-11,Cameron>麦克唐纳诊断标准要求用六个月来确诊
<11-11,Cameron>McDonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.

<11-15,Foreman>视觉诱发电位检查显示出大脑运转减速
<11-15,Foreman>The V.E.P. indicates slowing of the brain.

323
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,220
<11-16,Cameron>没有病灶  我们不能确定
<11-16,Cameron>Without the lesions, we can't be sure.

324
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,990
<11-16,Cameron>如果是的话
<11-16,Cameron>Well, if it is,

325

<11-17,House>三周内从0升到60
<11-17,House>it's gone from zero to 60 in three weeks,

326
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,850
<11-17,House>说明是急性进展型多发性硬化症
<11-17,House>which would indicate rapidly progressive M.S.

327
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,130
<11-17,House>不是那个病患只需坐轮椅还能拿着气球
<11-17,House>Not the fun M.S. with the balloons and

<11-18,Cameron>-我们应该等到  -现在开始进行治疗
<11-18,Cameron>- We should wait until- - Start treating him now,

330
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,370
<11-19,House>说不定他还能多活个5年
<11-19,House>maybe he can walk for another couple of years,

331
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,660
<11-19,House>2年内还能正常行走
<11-19,House>maybe live for another five.

<11-19,House>去通知家属  我要回家了
<11-19,House>Break it to the family. I'm going home.

333
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,200
<12-1,Chase>确诊的话需要几个月的时间
<12-1,Chase>It'll take months for a definitive diagnosis.

334
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,650
<12-2,Dan>那我会怎么样
<12-2,Dan>What'll happen to me?

335
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,980
<12-3,Chase>多发性硬化症是种极其多变的疾病
<12-3,Chase>M.S. is an incredibly variable disease.

336
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,590
<12-3,Chase>即使确诊了
<12-3,Chase>If it is M.S.,

337
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,050
<12-3,Chase>我们也不能百分百肯定
<12-3,Chase>and we're not a hundred percent sure.

338
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,570
<12-4,Dad>你觉得会出现什么症状
<12-4,Dad>What do you think is gonna happen?

339
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,990
<12-5,Chase>有一些治疗方案可以控制病发
<12-5,Chase>There are some medications to manage the symptoms,

340
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,760
<12-5,Chase>不过随着病情恶化  问题会逐渐严重
<12-5,Chase>but as the disease progresses, the problems will become more severe.

341
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,660
<12-5,Chase>排泄功能障碍

<12-6,Dan>So it's gonna hurt?

344
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,140
<12-7,Chase>大脑就像一团电线
<12-7,Chase>The brain's like a big jumble of wires.

345
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,330
<12-7,Chase>多发性硬化症使之失去绝缘层  神经死亡
<12-7,Chase>M.S. strips them of the insulation, and the nerves die.

346
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,700
<12-7,Chase>大脑认知为疼痛
<12-7,Chase>Brain interprets it as pain.

347
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,190
<12-7,Chase>疗程开始时
<12-7,Chase>But by starting treatment,

348
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,890
<12-7,Chase>我们会尽量避免这种情况发生
<12-7,Chase>we're gonna prevent that for as long as possible.

349
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,900
<12-7,Chase>我们在咨询一些专家
<12-7,Chase>We're looking into a couple of specialists,

350
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,490
<12-7,Chase>在一切准备就绪之前
<12-7,Chase>and until we get you squared away,

351
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,070
<12-7,Chase>你留在这里  好吗
<12-7,Chase>you'll stay here, okay?

352
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,110
<13-1,Cameron>保安检查了医院所有外围监控录像
<13-1,Cameron>Security checked the videotapes from all perimeter cameras.

353
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,390
<13-1,Cameron>-他一定还在医院里面  -奇斯呢
<13-1,Cameron>- He's still gotta be in the hospital. - Where's Chase?

354
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,390
<13-4,Foreman>-在主层  -你去食堂和董事办公区方向找
<13-4,Foreman>- Main floor. - Okay. You take the cafeteria and administration.

355
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,220
<13-4,Foreman>我去研究部门那边找然后我会和你汇合
<13-4,Foreman>I'll hit the research annex and work my way back to you.

356
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,010
<13-4,Foreman>丹
<13-4,Foreman>Dan?

357
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,930
<13-4,Foreman>我不在家  请留言
<13-4,Foreman>I'm not here. Leave a message.

358
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,290
<13-4,Foreman>卡迪医生  行头不错
<13-4,Foreman>Dr.Cuddy. Great outfit.

359
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,590
<15-1,House>你怎么回来了  有病人吗
<15-1,House>What are you doing back here? Patient?

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,330
<15-2,Cuddy>不是  是妓女
<15-2,Cuddy>No. Hooker.

361
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,980
<15-3,House>本来要去我家结果来我办公室了
<15-3,House>Went to my office instead of my home.

362
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,300
<15-3,House>豪斯医生
<15-3,House>Dr.House.

363
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,340
<16-1,Foreman>-丹不见了  -我知道  你在留言里说了
<16-1,Foreman>- Dan's missing. - Yeah. I got that part from the message.

364
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,590
<16-2,House>你说这儿急需我帮忙
<16-2,House>You said I was needed immediately.

365
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,270
<16-3,Foreman>刚做完腰椎穿刺他不该走动的
<16-3,Foreman>He shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.

366
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,490
<16-4,House>是啊  他会有严重头疼症状
<16-4,House>I agree. He's gonna have a very nasty headache.

367
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,170
<16-4,House>如果明早会诊  我持相同观点
<16-4,House>That would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.

368
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,650
<16-5,Foreman>我们想通知你
<16-5,Foreman>We wanted to keep you informed.

369
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,860
<16-5,Foreman>他听到了一些很不乐观的消息
<16-5,Foreman>He heard some pretty heavy news.

370
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,010
<16-6,House>这又不是刚会走的小孩在百货公司乱逛
<16-6,House>This is not a toddler wandering around a department store.

371
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,290
<16-6,House>他都16了  你们会找到他的
<16-6,House>He's 16. You'll find him.

372
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,400
<16-6,House>我要回家了
<16-6,House>I'm going home.

373
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,300
<16-7,Foreman>所以你说"有需要尽管给我打电话"
<16-7,Foreman>So when you say, "Call me if you need anything,"

374
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,980
<16-7,Foreman>意思就是不要打吗
<16-7,Foreman>you mean don't call?

375
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,050
<16-8,House>不是  我是说我能帮上忙的话再打给我
<16-8,House>No, I mean call me if I could do something.

376
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,830
<16-8,House>我不擅长搜索救援组的工作
<16-8,House>I'm bad at search parties, and I'm bad at sitting around

377
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,100
<16-8,House>也不擅长干坐在这看着别人慌慌张张的
<16-8,House>looking nervous, doing nothing.

378
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,880
<16-9,Foreman>那他父母呢  要打电话通知他们吗
<16-9,Foreman>What about his parents? Should we call them?

379
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,220
<16-9,Foreman>怎么  你觉得他们把他藏起来了
<16-9,Foreman>Why? Do you think they're hiding him?

380
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,530
<16-10,House>找人去屋顶看看
<16-10,House>Make sure someone checks the roof.

381
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,280
<16-10,House>有些清洁工把门撑着留条缝好方便偷抽烟
<16-10,House>Some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.

382
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,600
<16-10,House>丹  你没事吧
<16-10,House>Dan. You okay?

383
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,060
<17-1,Chase>有实验性疗程  正在进行的研究
<17-1,Chase>There are experimental treatments. Ongoing research.

384
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,630
<17-1,Chase>也许一两年之后会有所突破
<17-1,Chase>Who knows what they'll discover in a year or two.

385
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,510
<17-2,Dan>这就是我掉球的地方
<17-2,Dan>This is where I dropped the ball.

386
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,140
<17-3,Chase>丹  我们是站在医院的屋顶上
<17-3,Chase>Dan, we're standing on the roof of the hospital.

387
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,230
<17-3,Chase>丹
<17-3,Chase>Dan.

388
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,590
<17-3,Chase>丹  你不是在球场上
<17-3,Chase>Dan, you're not on the field.

389
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,520
<18-2,Foreman>-他不知道自己在哪  -丹
<18-2,Foreman>- He doesn't know where he is. - Dan.

390
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,590
<18-3,Chase>福曼
<18-3,Chase>Foreman.

391
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,400
<18-4,Chase>丹
<18-4,Chase>Dan.

392
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,490
<18-5,Cameron>-丹  -丹  不要
<18-5,Cameron>- Dan? - Dan, no!

393
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,110
<18-6,Foreman>福曼医生
<18-6,Foreman>Dr.Foreman.

394
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,430
<19-1,House>看来你们找到那孩子了
<19-1,House>I assume you found the kid.

395
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,640
<19-2,Foreman>-他差点从屋顶掉下去  -想自杀吗
<19-2,Foreman>- He almost walked off the roof. - Suicidal?

396
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,350
<19-4,Foreman>不是  他以为在曲棍球场呢
<19-4,Foreman>No, he thought he was on his lacrosse field.

397
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,870
<19-4,Foreman>听着  我正要回家  冲凉  换衣服
<19-4,Foreman>Look, I was gonna run home, shower, change-

398
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,430
<19-5,House>-神志清醒吗  -对
<19-5,House>- Conscious? - Yeah.

399
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,010
<19-7,House>你是怎么劝他下来的
<19-7,House>How'd you talk him down?

400
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,610
<19-8,Foreman>其实  奇斯抱住了他
<19-8,Foreman>Actually, Chase tackled him.

401
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,620
<19-9,House>怎么不是你呢
<19-9,House>How come you didn't do it?

402
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,810
<19-10,Foreman>是呀  我是黑人  但他更近些
<19-10,Foreman>Right. Well, I am black, but he was closer.

403
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,410
<19-11,House>来吧  和我一起上去
<19-11,House>Come on. You can ride up with me.

404
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,760
<20-1,House>他们知道儿子差点坠楼了吗
<20-1,House>Anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof?

405
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,690
<20-1,House>一定给吓坏了
<20-1,House>They must be thrilled.

406
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,110
<20-2,Cameron>他们没有起诉  我看是因为奇斯请求
<20-2,Cameron>They're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked-

407
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,720
<20-3,House>为何总以为我在挖苦
<20-3,House>Why does everybody always think I'm being sarcastic?

408
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,470
<20-3,House>好消息  不是多发性硬化
<20-3,House>This is great news. He doesn't have M.S.

409
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,610
<20-3,House>父母应该很高兴  至少母亲是
<20-3,House>Parents should be thrilled. The mom anyway.

410
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,400
<20-3,House>当然  父亲可能还不知道
<20-3,House>Of course, the dad probably doesn't know-

411
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,220
<20-4,Foreman>为什么不是多发性硬化
<20-4,Foreman>Why doesn't he have M.S.?

412
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,260
<20-5,House>因为他在屋顶  幻觉在曲棍球场
<20-5,House>He was on the roof, thinking he was on a lacrosse field.

413
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,570
<20-5,House>神志清醒  所以不是夜惊
<20-5,House>Conscious, and therefore not a night terror.

414
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,740
<20-5,House>-你来点吗  -对  行
<20-5,House>- You want some of this? - Yeah, sure.

415
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,620
<20-7,House>他当时处在急性精神混乱状态
<20-7,House>He was in an acute confusional state,

416
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,150
<20-7,House>和多发性硬化等神经髓鞘剥落类疾病不符
<20-7,House>which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like M.S.

417
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,780
<20-8,Foreman>-脑脊液寡克隆区带  -是存在的
<20-8,Foreman>- Oligoclonal bands - Were real.

418
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,120
<20-8,Foreman>不过  反映的不是多发性硬化
<20-8,Foreman>They just mean something

419
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,990
<20-8,Foreman>而是其它原因
<20-8,Foreman>other than M.S.

420
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,710
<20-9,Chase>那么  是什么呢
<20-9,Chase>So, what are they telling us?

421
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,950
<20-9,Chase>-免疫系统正常  -对
<20-9,Chase>- That the immune system is working? - Right.

422
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,100
<20-10,House>他脑部有感染
<20-10,House>He has an infection in his brain.

423
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,140
<20-11,Cameron>会不会和性有关[来做爱吧]
<20-11,Cameron>What about sex?

424
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,010
<20-12,House>会很复杂的  我们是同事
<20-12,House>Well, it might get complicated. I mean, we work together.

425
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,820
<20-12,House>而且我又有点老  不过或许正对你胃口
<20-12,House>I'm older, certainly, but maybe you like that.

426
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,470
<20-13,Cameron>我是说可能是神经性梅毒
<20-13,Cameron>I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.

427
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,140
<20-14,House>欲盖弥彰
<20-14,House>Huh. Nice cover.

428
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,740
<20-15,Chase>对不住  梅毒快速血浆反应素是阴性
<20-15,Chase>Sorry. R.P.R. Was negative.

429
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,700
<20-16,House>我们不需要定性检测来确诊
<20-16,House>We don't need a definitive test to confirm.

430
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,570
<20-17,Cameron>对  也不需要结果来确诊多发性硬化
<20-17,Cameron>Sure. Didn't need one to confirm M.S.

431
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,560
<20-18,House>那就等你测完1400种病毒做浓度测试之后
<20-18,House>Okay. Let's wait for you to run titers on 1,400 viruses

432
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,340
<20-18,House>这孩子的脑子也差不多了
<20-18,House>while this kid's brain turns to mush.

433
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,090
<20-19,Foreman>事实是  他不是多发性硬化症
<20-19,Foreman>So the fact that he doesn't have M.S.,

434
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,420
<20-19,Foreman>这个  其实算不上好消息
<20-19,Foreman>it's- it's really not good news after all.

435
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,090
<20-20,House>如果是神经性梅毒的话  就算个好消息
<20-20,House>Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis.

436
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,410
<20-20,House>梅毒检测的假阴性率是30%
<20-20,House>The likelihood of a false negative on an R.P.R. Test: 30%.

437
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,040
<20-20,House>16岁少年做爱的概率大概是120%
<20-20,House>Likelihood of a 16-year-old having sex: Roughly 120%.

438
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,380
<20-21,Cameron>我会开始青霉素静脉滴注
<20-21,Cameron>I'll start him on I.V. Penicillin.

439
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,710
<20-22,House>我们等不了
<20-22,House>We're not gonna wait for that.

440
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,400
<20-22,House>最有效给药途径是经脊柱注射进脑部
<20-22,House>The most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.

441
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,550
<20-23,Foreman>不能这么做  在如大脑一样的狭小空间
<20-23,Foreman>We can't. In a cramped space like the brain,

442
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,440
<20-23,Foreman>青霉素类高容积药物导致的颅内压增高
<20-23,Foreman>increased intracranial pressure from a high-volume drug like penicillin

443
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,690
<20-23,Foreman>可能会使脑干破裂
<20-23,Foreman>could herniate his brain stem.

444
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,820
<20-23,Foreman>那会杀了他的
<20-23,Foreman>It'd kill him.

445
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,080
<20-23,Foreman>正常的神经科医生都不会这么建议的
<20-23,Foreman>No neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.

446
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,280
<20-24,House>举手投票  谁认为我不正常
<20-24,House>Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?

447
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,820
<20-25,House>谁认为我连这点神经学基本理论都不懂
<20-25,House>And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?

448
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,370
<20-26,House>谁认为还有其它办法
<20-26,House>Who thinks there's a third option?

449
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,070
<20-27,House>很好  是什么
<20-27,House>Very good. What's the third choice?

450
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,470
<20-28,Chase>不知道  你只是问是否觉得有
<20-28,Chase>No idea. You just asked if I thought there was one.

451
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,650
<20-29,Foreman>病人脑部有分流器  脑压不会增高
<20-29,Foreman>The patient has a shunt in his brain. There'll be no increased pressure.

452
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,910
<20-29,Foreman>我们想用多少青霉素都没有问题
<20-29,Foreman>We can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.

453
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,560

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,400

<21-1,Foeman>I'm ready. Go.

457
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,480
<21-2,Dad>如果没有过性生活  他会感染上梅毒吗
<21-2,Dad>He could get syphilis... even if he's not sexually active?

458
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,560
<21-3,Foreman>的确不太寻常  不过还是可能的
<21-3,Foreman>Well, it's- it's unusual, but it's possible.

459
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,480
<21-3,Foreman>好  放松
<21-3,Foreman>Okay. Relax.

460
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,140
<22-1,House>感染了  有个挺大的口子
<22-1,House>It's infected, with a really big hole,

461
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,210
<22-1,House>象是你敲了个钉子进去  释放压力
<22-1,House>like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure.

462
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,660
<22-2,House>-我不会那么做  -尽管伤口不规则
<22-2,House>- I wouldn't do that. - Although the wound is irregular.

463
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,010
<22-2,House>不是圆柱形的  像是三角形的
<22-2,House>It's not cylindrical. It's shaped like a triangle.

464
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,000
<22-2,House>那么就不是钉子
<22-2,House>So, not a nail.

465
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,850
<22-3,Funsten>-餐刀吗  -我老婆的指甲挫
<22-3,Funsten>- Steak knife? - Wife's nail file.

<22-4,House>疼痛会让你做蠢事

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,970
<22-7,Funsten>你家人在普林斯顿吗
<22-7,Funsten>So, you have family here in Princeton?

471
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,440
<22-8,House>-没有  -因为工作吗
<22-8,House>- No. - Here on work?

472

<22-10,House>-不是  为什么你  -你的阴茎疼吗
<22-10,House>- No. Why are you - Does your penis hurt?

473
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,980
<22-11,Funsten>不疼  干嘛  应该疼的吗
<22-11,Funsten>No. What? Should it?

474
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,160
<22-12,House>没有  就是想问个不该问的问题
<22-12,House>No. Just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question.

475
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,230
<22-12,House>你的律师会很喜欢
<22-12,House>Your lawyer's gonna love it.

476
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,290
<22-13,Funsten>我为什么要告你  我需要你治好我
<22-13,Funsten>Why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.

477
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,580
<22-14,House>-你来自新泽西  梅普尔伍德  -对
<22-14,House>- You're from Maplewood, New Jersey, right? - Yeah.

478
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,910
<22-15,Funsten>那么  为什么驱车70英里
<22-15,Funsten>Now, why would you drive 70 miles...

479
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,790
<22-16,House>就为了治疗一个9岁小孩都能诊断的症状
<22-16,House>to get treatment for a condition that a nine-year-old could diagnose?

480
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,350
<22-16,House>流脓了  是个提示
<22-16,House>It's the free-flowing pus that's the tip-off.

481
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,040
<22-17,Funsten>-我在城里  -不为家人  也不为工作
<22-17,Funsten>- I was in town. - Not for family. Not for work.

482
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,930
<22-17,Funsten>你驱车70英里  来到免费门诊
<22-17,Funsten>You drove 70 miles to a walk-in clinic.

483
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,830
<22-18,House>沿途错过两家医院
<22-18,House>You passed two hospitals on the road.

484
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,370
<22-18,House>要么你对那些医院有看法
<22-18,House>Now, either you've got a problem with those hospitals,

485
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,140
<22-18,House>要么他们对你有看法
<22-18,House>or they have a problem with you.

486
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,790
<22-18,House>我猜你已把梅普尔伍德一半的医生给告了
<22-18,House>My guess is you've sued half the doctors in Maplewood,

487
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,860
<22-18,House>剩下的医生拒绝给你帮助
<22-18,House>and the rest are now refusing to help you.

488
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,710
<22-18,House>讽刺  不是吗  像那个起诉狼的男孩
<22-18,House>It's ironic, isn't it? Sort of like the boy who sued wolf.

489
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,770
<22-18,House>知道吗  我打赌我们有个医生叫'狼'
<22-18,House>You know, I bet we have a doctor here named Wolf.

490
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,110
<22-18,House>该多完美啊
<22-18,House>How perfect would that be?

491
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,110
<22-19,Funsten>-我现在传呼他  -多谢了
<22-19,Funsten>- I'm gonna page him. - Okay. You know what? Thank you.

492
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,270
<22-19,Funsten>我会找到医生来处理这个的
<22-19,Funsten>I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.

493
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,380
<22-20,House>我没说我不治你
<22-20,House>I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.

494
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,900
<22-20,House>我们会引流清理膝部
<22-20,House>We'll drain your knee,

495
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,610
<22-20,House>做些实验室检查  把你治好
<22-20,House>run some lab work. Fix you up.

496
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,660
<22-21,Funsten>你为什么这么做
<22-21,Funsten>Why would you do that?

497
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
<22-22,House>我以人为本呗
<22-22,House>I'm a people person.

498
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,120
<23-1,Wilson>你真的给他治疗了吗
<23-1,Wilson>You actually treated him?

499
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,840
<23-2,House>我只知道他起诉了几个医生
<23-2,House>All I know is he sued some doctors.

500
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,830
<23-2,House>我怎么知道他们不是活该自找的
<23-2,House>Who am I to assume they didn't have it coming to them?

<23-4,House>她要当医院领导了  但讨厌给别人找茬
<23-4,House>She was gonna be hospital administrator, but just hated having to screw people like that.

<23-5,Cuddy>我听说你在屋顶找到她的
<23-5,Cuddy>Heard you found her on the roof.

<23-8,House>适当的时候  当然会
<23-8,House>In due course, of course.

511

<23-9,Cuddy>是否还有个关于父亲是否生父的打赌呢
<23-9,Cuddy>And is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient?

512
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,430
<23-10,House>听着不想我的为人
<23-10,House>Doesn't sound like me.

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,530
<23-11,Wilson>就是你  但不代表你有罪
<23-11,Wilson>Well, it does, actually, but doesn't mean you're guilty.

622
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,590
<26-4,House>还是为了好玩  亲自拿来
<26-4,House>or is it just more fun this way?

00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,650
<26-5,Funsten>我已经想好解决办法了

00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,490
<26-8,House>但既然你在这儿  我想就不用再检查了
<26-8,House>but since you're here, I'll just go with the first.

<28-5,Dad>You, on the other hand, accused us of molesting our son.

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,750
<28-7,House>他俩的错误更严重
<28-7,House>Theirs is bigger

<28-7,House>你们根本不是丹的父母
<28-7,House>You're not Dan's parents.

658
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,540
<28-8,Mom>我们是他的父母

<28-9,Dad>他是我们领养的  他不需要知道这点
<28-9,Dad>He was adopted. He doesn't need to know.

660
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,310
<28-10,House>我要知道
<28-10,House>I do.

661
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,880
<28-11,Dad>我们把他当亲生...
<28-11,Dad>Adoption makes us just as much-

662
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,900
<28-12,House>那我问你
<28-12,House>Listen.

663
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,590
<28-12,House>当被问到病史时  你们有没有一点疑惑呢
<28-12,House>When we were taking his medical history, were you confused?

664
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,530
<28-12,House>你不知道我们一直在基因方面找线索吗
<28-12,House>Did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition,

665
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,620
<28-12,House>难道你们觉得  我会关心世上谁最爱他吗
<28-12,House>or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world?

666
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,730
<28-13,Cuddy>你怎么发现的
<28-13,Cuddy>How did you find out about this?

667
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,100
<28-14,House>我取了他们的DNA化验
<28-14,House>I sampled their D.N.A.

<28-15,Dad>我们没给你
<28-15,Dad>We didn't give you any D.N.A.

<28-16,House>是自助餐厅的杯子上留下的
<28-16,House>Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.

670
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,000
<28-17,Cuddy>你不能这么做
<28-17,Cuddy>You can't do that.

671
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,960
<28-18,House>又来了  为什么要纠结我的行为
<28-18,House>Again, why are we getting hung up on what I did?

672
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,370
<28-18,House>你们的病史压根没用
<28-18,House>Your medical history is useless.

673
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,350
<28-19,Dad>不  我们提供的是他生母的详细资料
<28-19,Dad>No. We gave you a detailed history of his biological mother.

674
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,790
<28-20,Mom>她的资料  不吸烟  身体健康
<28-20,Mom>Her history. Nonsmoker, good health,

675
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,540
<28-20,Mom>低胆固醇  没有血压上的毛病
<28-20,Mom>low cholesterol, no blood pressure problems.

676
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,830
<28-21,Dad>在丹出生两周的时候  就被我们领养了
<28-21,Dad>Dan was adopted two weeks after he was born.

677
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,460
<28-21,Dad>你有他所有的资料  我们已经知无不言
<28-21,Dad>You have his history. There's nothing you need to know that we didn't tell you.

678
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,330
<28-22,Cuddy>很有道理
<28-22,Cuddy>Sounds reasonable.

679
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,890
<28-22,Cuddy>那么  如果你们想给他办转院  也可以
<28-22,Cuddy>Well, if you want to transfer your boy, that is your choice.

680
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,230
<28-22,Cuddy>但我还是觉得这不太好
<28-22,Cuddy>I still think it's the wrong-

681
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,360
<28-23,House>她打过疫苗吗
<28-23,House>Was she vaccinated?

682
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,310
<28-23,House>我是说他的生母  小时候打过疫苗吗
<28-23,House>The biological mother. When she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?

683
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,750
<28-24,Dad>丹六个月大的时候  就打过疫苗
<28-24,Dad>Dan was vaccinated. At six months.

684
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,450
<28-25,House>是啊  那你知道为什么小孩
<28-25,House>Mm-hmm. Do you know why kids

685
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,210
<28-24,Dad>要在6个月时打疫苗呢
<28-24,Dad>get vaccinated at six months?

686
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,140
<28-25,House>因为在此之前  生母的免疫系统
<28-25,House>Because before that they are protected...

687
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,780
<28-25,House>能保护他们
<28-25,House>by their biological mother's immune system.

688
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,180
<28-23,House>所以  她打疫苗了吗
<28-23,House>So, was she vaccinated?

689
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,770
<28-23,House>婴儿染上麻疹病毒
<28-23,House>An infant picks up a regular old measles virus.

690
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,360
<28-23,House>会有皮疹
<28-23,House>Gets a rash.

691
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,140
<28-23,House>他会觉得很难受  发高烧
<28-23,House>He's extremely uncomfortable, has a wicked fever,

692
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,310
<28-23,House>但不会危及生命
<28-23,House>but he lives.

693
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,890
<28-23,House>但是有不定因素
<28-23,House>Here's the kicker.

694
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,850
<28-23,House>病毒突变的几率
<28-23,House>Once every million or so times,

695
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,410
<28-23,House>是百万分之一
<28-23,House>the virus mutates.

696
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,850
<28-23,House>丹没有发烧或皮疹
<28-23,House>Instead of Dan having a fever and a rash,

697
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,780
<28-23,House>是因为病毒潜入他的大脑中  隐藏起来
<28-23,House>the virus travels to his brain and hides,

698
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,460
<28-23,House>就像一颗定时炸弹
<28-23,House>like a time bomb.

699
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,890
<28-23,House>在这个病例中  它潜藏了16年
<28-23,House>In this case, for 16 years.

700
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,370
<29-1,Foreman>亚急性硬化全脑炎
<29-1,Foreman>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

701
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,190
<29-2,House>我知道  在过去的30年里
<29-2,House>I know. There's only been 20 cases in the United States

702
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,230
<29-2,House>全国只发现过20例
<29-2,House>in the last 30 years.

703
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,440
<29-3,Foreman>你是想说  这孩子还处于第一期吧
<29-3,Foreman>I suppose you could make an argument the kid's still in stage I.

704
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,480
<29-3,Foreman>一旦亚急性硬化全脑炎进入第二期
<29-3,Foreman>Once S.S.P.E. Moves to stage II, it's-

705
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,100
<29-4,House>恶化速度加快  第二期通常是致命的
<29-4,House>Boom. Stage II is universally fatal.

706
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,460
<29-5,Cameron>可谁都不知道  他什么时候会进入第二期
<29-5,Cameron>I assume its impossible to know when he might move into stage II.

707
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,390
<29-6,House>他已经有第二期的一些症状了
<29-6,House>He's already started showing symptoms.

708
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,230
<29-6,House>可能是一个月后  也可能是今晚
<29-6,House>Could be a month. Could be tonight.

709
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,170
<29-7,Cameron>-能治好吗  -问神经病学家吧
<29-7,Cameron>- Can we treat it? - Ask the neurologist.

710
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,880
<29-9,Foreman>脑室内注入干扰素
<29-9,Foreman>Intraventricular interferon.

711
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,530
<29-10,Chase>没确诊前  又不能在脑袋上钻洞  注干扰素
<29-10,Chase>Not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.

712
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,670
<29-11,House>抽脑脊液看看
<29-11,House>Tap him.

713
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,740
<29-12,Foreman>我们无法从他的脑脊液中得到可靠的麻疹抗体
<29-12,Foreman>We won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his C.S.F.

714
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,100
<29-12,Foreman>在我们对他进行的这一系列治疗之后不行
<29-12,Foreman>Not after everything we've given him.

715
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,890
<29-13,House>所以  错误的疗法毁了诊断正确的希望
<29-13,House>So the wrong treatment kills any hope of the right diagnosis.

716
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,240
<29-13,House>他们为什么要骗我呢
<29-13,House>Why do people lie to me?

717
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,230
<29-13,House>这可能会杀了他的
<29-13,House>Could also kill him.

718
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,790
<29-13,House>看你的了  福曼
<29-13,House>Your ball, Foreman.

719
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,180
<29-13,House>应该不用做大脑活组织切片检查吧
<29-13,House>Tell me I don't have to biopsy his brain.

720
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,940
<29-14,Foreman>好吧  还有另一个方法
<29-14,Foreman>Well, there is one other way.

721
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,240
<30-1,Dan>这个真的不疼吗
<30-1,Dan>You sure this isn't gonna hurt?

722
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,710
<30-2,Foreman>当然  这只是有点可怕
<30-2,Foreman>Yeah. It's just scary as hell.

723
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,820
<30-2,Foreman>它会从你的瞳孔穿入
<30-2,Foreman>See, we go through the pupil.

724
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,620
<30-2,Foreman>你不会觉得疼  因为眼睛已经麻醉了
<30-2,Foreman>But you won't feel it. The eye's been paralyzed.

725
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,370
<30-2,Foreman>针会穿到你的眼睛后方
<30-2,Foreman>The needle travels to the back of the eye,

726
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,780
<30-2,Foreman>我们想在你的视网膜上  施行活组织检查
<30-2,Foreman>which is where we'll perform the biopsy on your retina.

727
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,940
<30-2,Foreman>已经确诊了  问题就出在这个变异的病毒上
<30-2,Foreman>So we've confirmed that the problem is this mutated virus.

728
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,610
<30-2,Foreman>治疗亚急性硬化脑炎是在脑室内注射干扰素
<30-2,Foreman>The treatment for S.S.P.E. Is intraventricular interferon.

729
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,420
<31-1,Foreman>我们会在头皮下植入奥马耶贮器
<31-1,Foreman>We implant an ommaya reservoir under the scalp,

730
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,600
<31-1,Foreman>与心室导管相连
<31-1,Foreman>which is connected to a ventricular catheter...

731
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,650
<31-1,Foreman>心室导管会将抗病原体直接输送至左脑
<31-1,Foreman>that delivers the antiviral directly to the left hemisphere.

732
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,240
<31-2,Dad>你想让我同意手术吗
<31-2,Dad>You want us to consent to this?

733
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,820
<31-2,Dad>都不知道你在说什么
<31-2,Dad>I don't even understand what you're talking about.

734
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,740
<31-3,Foreman>好吧  抗病原体...
<31-3,Foreman>Well, the antiviral-

735
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,650
<31-3,Foreman>好吧  对不起
<31-3,Foreman>Look. I'm sorry.

736
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,320
<31-3,Foreman>我会尽我所能跟您解释
<31-3,Foreman>I can explain this as best I can,

737
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,650
<31-3,Foreman>但要完全理解治疗过程
<31-3,Foreman>but the notion that you're gonna fully understand your son's treatment...

738
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,850
<31-3,Foreman>并作出决定  是...
<31-3,Foreman>and make an informed decision is-

739
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,700
<31-3,Foreman>是不可能的
<31-3,Foreman>is kind of insane.

740
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,070
<31-3,Foreman>你们要知道的是
<31-3,Foreman>Here's what you need to know.

741
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,050
<31-3,Foreman>治疗过程很危险
<31-3,Foreman>It's dangerous.

742
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,860
<29-6,House>有可能致命
<29-6,House>It could kill him.

743
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,710
<29-6,House>但必须去做
<29-6,House>You should do it.

744
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,750
<29-6,House>还需要什么吗
<29-6,House>Did you need something else?

745
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,770
<32-1,Cuddy>你不能就为了打赌而花2300元去做DNA比对
<32-1,Cuddy>You can't order a $3,200 D.N.A. Test to win a bet.

746
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,970
<32-2,House>又不是实际成本
<32-2,House>It's not an actual cost.

747
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,930
<32-2,House>我不知道你是否清楚  但医院有DNA测序仪器
<32-2,House>I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine.

748
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,690
<32-3,Cuddy>我说真的
<32-3,Cuddy>I'm serious.

749
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,750
<32-4,House>那跟家长说  把账单寄给保险公司好了
<32-4,House>Tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance.

750
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,650
<32-5,Cuddy>保险公司才不会为了你们打赌付账呢
<32-5,Cuddy>Insurance is not gonna pay for a bet.

751
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,890
<32-6,House>会的  如果没有打赌  那孩子就死了
<32-6,House>Should. We don't make that bet, the kid dies.

752
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,450
<32-6,House>如果没有打赌  我就不会提取他们的DNA
<32-6,House>If not for the paternity bet, I never would have taken their D.N.A.

753
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,870
<32-6,House>这样  我们也不会发现丹是被领养的
<32-6,House>Without their D.N.A., we never would have discovered that Dan was adopted,

754
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,110
<32-6,House>这可是解决这个案子的关键
<32-6,House>which was the key to this case.

755
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,610
<32-6,House>你就是不想付赌债罢了
<32-6,House>You just don't want to pay your end.

756
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,910
<32-6,House>大错特错  我的人知道有个人...
<32-6,House>Big mistake. My guy knows a guy.

757
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,200
<32-7,Cuddy>好吧  我免去你一周的门诊
<32-7,Cuddy>Fine. I will let you out of clinic duty for one week,

758
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,550
<32-7,Cuddy>不过你要先付了基因扩增测试的3200元
<32-7,Cuddy>after you pay the 3,200 for the P.C.R. Test.

759
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,770
<32-9,House>好吧  这一百是你欠我的
<32-9,House>Well, now, there's the hundred you owe me.

760
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,660
<32-9,House>这一百是我从卡梅隆那里赢回来的
<32-9,House>Here's a hundred I won from Cameron.

761
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,970
<32-9,House>从福曼这里赢了两百
<32-9,House>200 I took off of Foreman.

762
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,780
<32-9,House>六百
<32-9,House>And 600...

763
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,670
<32-9,House>威尔森的
<32-9,House>I got from Wilson.

764
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,100
<32-9,House>真是苦涩啊
<32-9,House>Very bitter.

765
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,170
<33-1,Cameron>早上好啊
<33-1,Cameron>Hey. Good morning.

766
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,640
<33-2,Foreman>脑电图显示正常  治疗有效果了
<33-2,Foreman>Good news on your E.E.G. Treatment is working.

767
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,390
<33-3,Cameron>免疫系统也有反应了
<33-3,Cameron>And your immune system is responding.

768
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,390
<33-4,Foreman>虽然早了点  还是让我看一下
<33-4,Foreman>I know it's early, but I just want to take a look.

769
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,120
<33-4,Foreman>好啦  现在看看脑子还灵不灵
<33-4,Foreman>All right.Let's see what that brain of yours can do.

770
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,060
<33-4,Foreman>"o"开头的动物  有多少说多少
<33-4,Foreman>Name as many animals as you canthat start with the letter "O."

771
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,150
<33-5,Dan>鸵鸟
<33-5,Dan>Ostrich.

772
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,170
<33-5,Dan>公牛
<33-5,Dan>Ox.

773
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,820
<33-5,Dan>老象
<33-5,Dan>Old elephant.

774
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,320
<33-6,Cameron>比上次好多了
<33-6,Cameron>Well, that's too better than last time.

775
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,910
<33-6,Cameron>关于领养的事  你还好吧
<33-6,Cameron>How you doing with the whole adoption thing?

776
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,710
<33-7,Dan>我五年级的时候就知道了
<33-7,Dan>I knew since fifth grade.

777
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,610
<33-8,Foreman>你怎么知道
<33-8,Foreman>How's that?

778
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,910
<33-9,Dan>颏裂
<33-9,Dan>Cleft chin.

779
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,470
<33-9,Dan>我有  但是爸爸没有
<33-9,Dan>I have one. My dad doesn't.

780
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,410
<33-9,Dan>上网查了一下  颏裂是显性遗传
<33-9,Dan>Looked it up on the Internet. It's one of those trait things.

781
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,740
<33-10,Forman>是啊  常染色体显性遗传
<33-10,Forman>That's right. It's autosomal dominant.

782
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,850
<33-10,Forman>因为你的父母都没有颏裂
<33-10,Forman>Since neither of your parents have cleft chins,

783
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,060
