00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,280
<30-4,House>就是电脑
<30-4,House>It's called a computer.

<1-1,Jack>or do I need to find something else to read?

7
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,640
<1-2,Alice>今天就这些
<1-2,Alice>I'm done.

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,650
<1-2,Alice>这书写完了
<1-2,Alice>It's done.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,360
<1-4,Jack>不是吧  写完了吗
<1-4,Jack>No way. It's finished?

10
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,130
<1-4,Jack>怎么收尾的
<1-4,Jack>Well, how--how's it end?

00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,400
<1-4,Jack>你得给我看看
<1-4,Jack>I mean, you got to let me read it.

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,550
<1-5,Alice>这次就算了吧
<1-5,Alice>Not this time.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,410
<1-6,Jack>至少你要告诉我发什么了什么事
<1-6,Jack>W--you at least got to tell me what happens.

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,080
<1-6,Jack>说呀
<1-6,Jack>Come on.

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,800
<1-6,Jack>你不告诉我结局  下一本书  我该怎么做
<1-6,Jack>How am I supposed to help with the next book if you don't--

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,740
<1-7,Alice>不会有下一本了
<1-7,Alice>There isn't going to be a next book.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,900
<1-8,Jack>你不是来真的吧  为什么
<1-8,Jack>You can't be serious. Why?

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,580
<1-9,Alice>你不会懂的
<1-9,Alice>You wouldn't understand.

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,020
<1-10,Jack>试试
<1-10,Jack>Try me.

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,200
<1-11,Alice>我只是继续不下去了
<1-11,Alice>I just can't do it anymore.

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,920
<1-11,Alice>我不像你那么勇敢
<1-11,Alice>I'm not brave like you.

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,200
<1-12,Jack>但写作是你的全部
<1-12,Jack>But writing' your whole life.

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,270
<1-12,Jack>不写作  你能去做什么呢
<1-12,Jack>What are you gonna do without it?

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,780
<1-13,Alice>做我几年前就该做的事
<1-13,Alice>What I should have done years ago.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,270
<1-13,Alice>你要做什么
<1-13,Alice>What are you doing?

26
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,700
<1-14,Jack>把枪放下  不然我
<1-14,Jack>Put it down, or I'll--

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,090
<1-14,Jack>我会逼你放下的
<1-14,Jack>I'll make you.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,900
<1-15,Alice>你怎么做  杰克
<1-15,Alice>How, Jack?

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,950
<1-15,Alice>你根本不存在
<1-15,Alice>You don't even exist.

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,840
<1-15,Alice>我很抱歉
<1-15,Alice>I'm sorry.

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,610
<1-16,Christina>唐纳小姐
<1-16,Christina>Miss Tanner.

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,850
<1-16,Christina>唐纳小姐
<1-16,Christina>Miss Tanner.

33
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,960
<1-16,Christina>上帝啊
<1-16,Christina>Oh, dear god.

34
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,780
<1-16,Christina>字幕
<1-16,Christina>??

35
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,750
<2-1,House>哪个更代表  我想和你上床
<2-1,House>Which of these says "I want to sleep with you" more?

36
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,240
<2-1,House>企鹅  还是海狸
<2-1,House>Penguin or beaver?

37
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,080
<2-1,House>海狸  海狸  海狸
<2-1,House>Beaver. Beaver. Beaver.

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,990
<2-1,House>你是对的  太幼稚了
<2-1,House>You're right. It's too high school.

39
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,650
<2-2,Wilson>你又惹卡迪生气了吗
<2-2,Wilson>What did you do to piss Cuddy off?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,180
<2-3,House>我不能浪漫点吗
<2-3,House>I can't be romantic?

41
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,870
<2-4,Wilson>豪斯  你要偷一个陷入昏迷的女人的东西
<2-4,Wilson>House, you're stealing from a woman in a coma.

42
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,330
<2-5,House>没事  没见过她比现在更开心的
<2-5,House>We're fine. Never seen her happier.

43
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,360
<2-6,Wilson>是吗  那你呢
<2-6,Wilson>Yeah? How about you?

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
<2-7,House>我...很担心
<2-7,House>I'm...worried.

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
<2-8,Wilson>因为她开心吗
<2-8,Wilson>Because she's happy?

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,160
<2-9,House>不  因为我开心了
<2-9,House>No, because I am.

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,040
<2-10,Wilson>豪斯  这
<2-10,Wilson>House, that's--

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,580
<2-11,House>很讽刺吗  诡异还是疯狂呢
<2-11,House>Ironic? Weird? Crazy?

49
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,780
<2-12,Wilson>我是想说这很正常
<2-12,Wilson>I was going to say normal.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,230
<2-13,House>眼下是这样
<2-13,House>For now.

51
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,000
<2-13,House>我们还处于热恋阶段
<2-13,House>We're in the honeymoon period.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,550
<2-13,House>我们的大脑充满了内啡肽
<2-13,House>Our brains are flooded with endorphins.

53
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,950
<2-13,House>一旦她不受其影响
<2-13,House>Once she snaps out of it,

54
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,980
<2-13,House>我们会发生什么呢
<2-13,House>where does that leave us?

55
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,920
<2-14,Wilson>成人恋爱关系
<2-14,Wilson>In an adult relationship.

56
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,690
<2-15,House>除了工作之外  说说我和卡迪的一个共同点
<2-15,House>Name one thing that Cuddy and I have in common besides work.

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,590
<2-16,Wilson>这...
<2-16,Wilson>There's...

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,390
<2-16,Wilson>你们两个都...
<2-16,Wilson>You're both...

59
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,340
<2-16,Wilson>等下
<2-16,Wilson>Wait.

60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,070
<2-16,Wilson>的确没有共同点
<2-16,Wilson>Exactly.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,960
<2-17,House>长期关系要能容忍对方
<2-17,House>Long-term relationships are based on compatibility,

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,970
<2-17,House>目前为止  只有做爱符合要求
<2-17,House>And right now we only have sex.

63
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,570
<2-18,Wilson>豪斯  难道你真以为
<2-18,Wilson>House, you don't actually think

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,340
<2-18,Wilson>她会因为你不做瑜伽之类的事
<2-18,Wilson>she'd dump you because you, what,

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,910
<2-18,Wilson>而甩了你吗
<2-18,Wilson>don't do yoga?

66
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,010
<2-18,Wilson>还是因为你喜欢听B-52的起飞声音
<2-18,Wilson>Listen to the B-52s?

67
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,350
<2-19,House>没那么快
<2-19,House>Not right away.

68
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,360
<2-19,House>我们会吵架  用做爱来弥补
<2-19,House>We'll fight, makeup sex,

69
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,180
<2-19,House>然后吵架  也许还会做爱
<2-19,House>Fight, maybe sex,

70
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,920
<2-19,House>直到她甩了我
<2-19,House>And then she'll dump me.

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,320
<2-19,House>也许还会来次告别做爱
<2-19,House>With possible goodbye sex.

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,620
<2-20,Wilson>也就是说  你没有享受热恋阶段
<2-20,Wilson>So, instead of enjoying the honeymoon phase,

73
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,820
<2-20,Wilson>决定直接跳过去
<2-20,Wilson>You've decided to skip it entirely.

74
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,320
<2-21,House>我需要找些在一起的时候
<2-21,House>I need to find something that we both like doing

75
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,880
<2-21,House>我们都喜欢的事情
<2-21,House>besides each other.

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,130
<2-22,Wilson>对  或者你可以直接和她谈谈
<2-22,Wilson>Right. Or you could just talk to her about it.

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,330
<2-23,House>不  那样的话她会装作喜欢那些
<2-23,House>No, then she'll start pretending to like things

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
<2-23,House>她原本不喜欢的事  让我好过
<2-23,House>that she really doesn't just to make me feel better,

79
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,830
<2-23,House>这会让她觉得更糟
<2-23,House>which will make her feel even worse,

80
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,600
<2-23,House>这不是我的错  所以我会对她不满
<2-23,House>which won't be my fault, so I'll resent her,

81
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,810
<2-23,House>这也不是她的错  所以她会对我不满
<2-23,House>and that won't be her fault, so she'll resent me.

82
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,040
<2-23,House>至少实施我的计划
<2-23,House>At least with my plan

83
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,180
<2-23,House>会让我过着讽刺的一天  直到欢喜收场
<2-23,House>I get my one a day with iron till the bitter end.

84
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,810
<2-23,House>你跟着我有什么理由吗
<2-23,House>Is there a reason why you're following me?

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,550
<2-23,House>是的
<2-23,House>Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,710
<2-24,Wilson>刚刚有人来看急诊  说出来是谁你肯定不信
<2-24,Wilson>You're not gonna believe who just checked into the ER.

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,390
<3-1,Nurse>医生还没有为你做检查
<3-1,Nurse>The doctor hasn't examined you yet.

88
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,550
<3-2,Alice>我没事
<3-2,Alice>There's nothing wrong with me.

89
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,490
<3-2,Alice>我的佣人反应过大了
<3-2,Alice>My maid just overreacted.

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
<3-3,House>太好了
<3-3,House>Great.

91
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,530
<3-3,House>不会占用你太长时间
<3-3,House>This won't take long then.

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
<3-4,Nurse>急诊医生发现她昏迷不醒
<3-4,Nurse>EMTs found her unconscious.

93
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,830
<3-4,Nurse>她的佣人说她发生了癫痫
<3-4,Nurse>Her maid said she had a seizure.

94
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,240
<3-5,Alice>我昏过去了
<3-5,Alice>I fainted.

95
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,170
<3-6,House>顺便说下  我是杰克·加农超级粉丝
<3-6,House>Huge Jack Cannon fan, by the way.

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,140
<3-6,House>我喜欢你的书
<3-6,House>Love your books.

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
<3-6,House>真的吗
<3-6,House>Really?

98
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,310
<3-7,Alice>我的书迷一般都是十多岁的吵闹小女孩
<3-7,Alice>My fans tend to be overly-annoying teenaged girls.

99
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,580
<3-7,Alice>我知道
<3-7,Alice>I know.

100
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,510
<3-8,House>她们就只在乎谁更帅一些
<3-8,House>All they care about is who's hotter,

101
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,680
<3-8,House>杰克还是迪肯
<3-8,House>Jack or Deacon.

102
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,380
<3-8,House>就像萨拉无法两者都爱一样
<3-8,House>Like Sarah can't love both of them.

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,820
<3-8,House>我可能是一两个在线书迷俱乐部的会员
<3-8,House>I may belong to one or two online fan clubs.

104
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,690
<3-8,House>新书进展如何
<3-8,House>How's the new book coming along?

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,690
<3-9,Alice>我不讨论自己的作品
<3-9,Alice>I don't talk about my work.

106
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,920
<3-9,Alice>好的
<3-9,Alice>Okay.

107
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,490
<3-10,House>点头回答我几个
<3-10,House>How about nodding your head

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,000
<3-10,House>是非问题怎么样
<3-10,House>to a few yes/no questions?

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,110
<3-11,Alice>但我可以跟你做笔交易
<3-11,Alice>But I'll make you a deal.

110
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,100
<3-11,Alice>你快点完成检查
<3-11,Alice>You finish this exam quickly,

111
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,800
<3-11,Alice>我回答你一个问题
<3-11,Alice>and I'll answer one question.

112
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,110
<3-12,House>任何问题都可以
<3-12,House>About anything?

113
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,310
<3-12,House>任何都可以
<3-12,House>Anything.

114
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,910
<3-13,Alice>谁是杰克的亲生父亲
<3-13,Alice>Who was Jack's real father,

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,810
<3-13,Alice>谁绑架了他叔叔之类
<3-13,Alice>who kidnapped his uncle...

116
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,110
<3-13,Alice>成交
<3-13,Alice>Deal.

117
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,580
<3-14,House>我更想知道
<3-14,House>I will have to go with

118
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,560
<3-14,House>你为什么要自杀
<3-14,House>why'd you try to kill yourself?

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,180
<3-14,House>你侧脸的灼伤
<3-14,House>Burn on the side of your face

120
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,790
<3-14,House>是火药留下的
<3-14,House>is caused by gunpowder,

121
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,290
<3-14,House>你是最后一刻改变想法了呢
<3-14,House>So change your mind at the last second,

122
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,100
<3-14,House>还是枪法太逊呢
<3-14,House>or you just a lousy shot?

123
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,360
<3-15,Alice>我要离开这儿
<3-15,Alice>I'm out of here.

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,050
<3-16,House>还不能走  我们有笔交易没完成
<3-16,House>Can't. We had a deal.

125
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,890
<3-17,Alice>你拦着我试试

<4-13,House>喂

182
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,550
<7-2,Alice>就在刚才
<7-2,Alice>A while ago.

183
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,870
<7-2,Alice>我不喜欢医生
<7-2,Alice>I don't like doctors.

<7-3,Taub>今天之前有癫痫史吗

<7-7,Taub>You're evading every question we ask.

192
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,040
<7-8,Alice>为什么这么说
<7-8,Alice>Why do you say that?

193
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,810
<7-9,Taub>正是如此

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,780
<7-10,Alice>我可没求你们帮我
<7-10,Alice>I didn't ask for help.

195
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,980
<7-11,Taub>准备好自杀的姿势可不是这个意思啊
<7-11,Taub>Committing a suicidal gesture says otherwise.

196
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,620
<7-12,Alice>那可不是做做样子而已
<7-12,Alice>It wasn't a gesture.

197
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,200
<7-12,Alice>就在我把枪塞到嘴里之前
<7-12,Alice>I had the damn seizure

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,680
<7-12,Alice>这该死的癫痫发作了

199
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,200
<7-13,Foreman>想不想告诉我们原因
<7-13,Foreman>You want to tell us why?

<7-14,Alice>你想知道我人生历程吗
<7-14,Alice>You want to know my life story,

201
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,610
<7-14,Alice>我深藏于心的痛苦吗
<7-14,Alice>my secret inner pain?

202
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,260
<7-14,Alice>也许如果我稍微敞开心扉
<7-14,Alice>Maybe if I just open up a little,

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,260
<7-14,Alice>你们就能拯救我吗

207
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,730
<7-17,Taub>你又回避问题了
<7-17,Taub>And back to being evasive.

208
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,770
<7-18,Alice>这是我当病人的权利
<7-18,Alice>It's my right as a patient.

209
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,330
<7-18,Alice>所以请你们出去  立刻出去

211
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,540
<7-20,Alice>你们真以为我傻到
<7-20,Alice>You really think I'm stupid enough

212
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,680
<7-20,Alice>在医院自杀吗
<7-20,Alice>to try and kill myself in a hospital?

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,250
<7-21,Foreman>是看你会不会再次发作癫痫
<7-21,Foreman>To see if you have another seizure.

214
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,760
<7-21,Foreman>我们会在那边守着

<7-21,Foreman>除非有情况  不然不会打扰你
<7-21,Foreman>and we won't disturb you unless there's a problem.

216
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,900
<7-21,Foreman>你看这样可以吗
<7-21,Foreman>That work for you?

217
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,000
<7-22,Alice>只要你们离开这儿就可以
<7-22,Alice>Whatever it takes to get you out of here.

218
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,360
<8-1,Cuddy>豪斯  克里斯蒂娜同意不通知警方
<8-1,Cuddy>House, Christina has agreed to not call the police.

219
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,170
<8-2,House>她很可能是非法移民
<8-2,House>She's probably illegal.

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,500
<8-2,House>这也是她不上报自杀的原因
<8-2,House>Same reason she didn't report the suicide attempt.

221
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,300
<8-3,Christina>我拨了911
<8-3,Christina>I call 911.

222
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,030
<8-3,Christina>但唐纳小姐醒来的时候
<8-3,Christina>But when Miss Tanner woke up,

223
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,170
<8-3,Christina>她说如果我提到枪的事
<8-3,Christina>she say she will fire me

224
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
<8-3,Christina>她就解雇我
<8-3,Christina>if I say anything about the gun.

225
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,150
<8-4,House>如果她了结了自己  你还能有工作吗
<8-4,House>And if she whacks herself, what happens to your job?

226
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,140
<8-5,Christina>我觉得她是个情绪非常低落的人
<8-5,Christina>I think she's a very depressed person.

227

<8-5,Christina>她从不出门

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,120
<8-7,Christina>她一直都把成稿锁在那儿
<8-7,Christina>She always locks up her writing in there.

233
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,090
<8-8,Cuddy>她抱怨过
<8-8,Cuddy>Has she ever complained

234
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,820
<8-8,Cuddy>身体方面的疼痛或者压力吗
<8-8,Cuddy>about physical pain or stress?

<8-11,Christina>Sometimes I hear her cry at night.

240
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,300
<8-11,Christina>她以为这时候没人能听到
<8-11,Christina>When she thinks nobody's listening.

241
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,370
<8-11,Christina>我本该做些什么的
<8-11,Christina>I should have done something.

<9-5,House>只是还不知道为什么会这样
<9-5,House>Just not sure how yet.

259
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,110
<10-1,Chase>早上好  先生们
<10-1,Chase>Good morning, gentlemen.

260
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,300
<10-1,Chase>如果说出来能让你们得到安慰
<10-1,Chase>Well, if it's any consolation,

261
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,860
<10-1,Chase>其实我也没怎么睡

<10-2,Taub>她还承认了她曾经自杀
<10-2,Taub>She also admitted she tried to kill herself,

265
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,490
<10-2,Taub>但是不告诉我们原因
<10-2,Taub>but won't tell us why.

266
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,410
<10-3,Foreman>豪斯搜了她家
<10-3,Foreman>House searched her home,

267
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,400
<10-3,Foreman>发现她几年来每天都吃两盒金枪鱼罐头
<10-3,Foreman>found she's been eating two cans of tuna a day for years.

268
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,540
<10-4,Chase>汞中毒

<10-5,House>能够说明癫痫
<10-5,House>Explains the seizures,

270
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,960
<10-5,House>背部和手疼

<10-6,Foreman>除了事实  说明了一切
<10-6,Foreman>Explains everything except the fact that it's not.

273
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,570
<10-6,Foreman>我们取回了她的尿样和血样
<10-6,Foreman>We got her urine and blood samples back.

274
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,490
<10-6,Foreman>都是正常的
<10-6,Foreman>They're normal.

275
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,010
<10-7,Chase>如果低含量水平
<10-7,Chase>If it's low level,

276
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,360
<10-7,Chase>抽查时就不会发现
<10-7,Chase>it might not show up in a spot check.

<10-7,Chase>我们需要继续测试找出病因
<10-7,Chase>We need to run continuous testing to find it.

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,820
<10-8,Taub>没办法了  她要求换成女医生
<10-8,Taub>We can't. She wants a female doctor.

279
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,020
<10-9,Foreman>她要求女医生只是在浪费时间而已
<10-9,Foreman>She only asked for a woman to waste time.

280
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,860
<10-9,Foreman>她配合我们只是想结束精神监控而已
<10-9,Foreman>She's cooperating just enough to get through the psych hold.

281
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,890
<10-10,House>让奇斯涂上口红  开始螯合疗法
<10-10,House>Put some lipstick on Chase and start chelation therapy.

284
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,010
<10-10,House>我和去卡迪谈谈
<10-10,House>I'll go talk to Cuddy.

285
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,490
<10-10,House>也许她能再借我们一条裙子
<10-10,House>Maybe she'll let us borrow a dress, too.

286
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,230
<11-2,Cuddy>我就是我无视你的时候
<11-2,Cuddy>This would be me ignoring you.

287
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,060
<11-2,Cuddy>如果昨晚我们被逮捕了怎么办
<11-2,Cuddy>What if we got arrested last night?

288
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,970
<11-2,Cuddy>怎样才能让我们的
<11-2,Cuddy>And whatever happened to keeping

289
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,080
<11-2,Cuddy>工作和生活分开呢
<11-2,Cuddy>our professional and personal lives separate?

290
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,440
<11-3,House>我不是工作时间讨论我们私人关系的人
<11-3,House>I'm not the one talking about our relationship at work.

291
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,120
<11-4,Cuddy>你背后藏着什么
<11-4,Cuddy>What's behind your back?

292
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,050
<11-5,House>和平企鹅
<11-5,House>Peace penguin.

293
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,490
<11-6,Cuddy>我要把这还给哪个病房
<11-6,Cuddy>What room should I return it to?

294
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,790
<11-7,House>243号

<11-7,House>她需要借一个"女"医生
<11-7,House>She wants a vagina.

297
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,530
<11-8,Cuddy>我和我的女性特征紧密相连
<11-8,Cuddy>I'm pretty attached to mine.

298
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,760
<11-8,Cuddy>两周之前
<11-8,Cuddy>I told you

299
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,460
<11-8,Cuddy>我就告诉你找个人临时代替十三
<11-8,Cuddy>to hire a temporary replacement for thirteen two weeks ago.

300
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,800
<11-9,House>-我一直在忙  -忙着干吗
<11-9,House>- I've been busy. - Doing what?

301
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,840
<11-10,Cuddy>和你的事
<11-10,Cuddy>You.

302
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,970
<11-11,House>那你来劝她别这样吗
<11-11,House>So you'll talk her out of it?

303
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,480
<11-12,Cuddy>你雇不雇女医生
<11-12,Cuddy>You'll hire a woman doctor?

304
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,610
<11-13,House>莫非你以为没有美妞在旁  我们就会
<11-13,House>You think we just sit around talking sports

305
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,960
<11-13,House>无所事事  大侃体育  打嗝放屁了
<11-13,House>and belching and farting when the chicks aren't around?

306
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,260
<11-13,House>时间期限
<11-13,House>By when?

307
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,210
<11-14,Cuddy>下周前
<11-14,Cuddy>Next week.

308
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,450
<11-15,House>那就下周前
<11-15,House>Next week it is.

309
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,390
<12-1,Alice>你们为什么认为是汞中毒
<12-1,Alice>What makes you think it's mercury?

310
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,590
<12-2,Cuddy>你的症状
<12-2,Cuddy>Your symptoms.

311
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,380
<12-2,Cuddy>如果你仍坚持要女医生
<12-2,Cuddy>Now I can perform the procedure yourself

312
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,500
<12-2,Cuddy>我可以为你治疗
<12-2,Cuddy>if you still prefer a woman doctor,

313
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,600
<12-2,Cuddy>但为你工作的团队是最棒的
<12-2,Cuddy>but the team you have is our best.

314
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,030
<12-3,Alice>你用的香水真有趣
<12-3,Alice>That's an interesting perfume you're wearing.

315
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,000
<12-4,Cuddy>是礼物
<12-4,Cuddy>It was a gift.

316
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,960
<12-5,Alice>豪斯医生送的
<12-5,Alice>From Dr. House?

317
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,450
<12-5,Alice>昨晚他身上都是这个味道
<12-5,Alice>It was all over him last night.

318
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,170
<12-6,Cuddy>如果你想换一位女性医生
<12-6,Cuddy>If you'd prefer another female doctor,

319
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,440
<12-6,Cuddy>我也可以安排
<12-6,Cuddy>I can arrange that as well.

320
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,680
<12-7,Alice>我刚刚还在其他人身上闻到过这个味道
<12-7,Alice>I also smelled it somewhere else more recently.

321
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,080
<12-7,Alice>很淡  但不会错认
<12-7,Alice>Faint, but unmistakable.

322
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,980
<12-7,Alice>克里斯蒂娜  你今早该换一件羊毛衫才是
<12-7,Alice>You should have worn a different cardigan this morning, Christina.

323
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,430
<12-7,Alice>有什么事要告诉我吗  亲爱的
<12-7,Alice>Something you'd like to tell me, dear?

324
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,230
<12-8,Christina>昨天发现你的时候
<12-8,Christina>When I found you yesterday,

325
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,270
<12-8,Christina>我以为已经太迟了
<12-8,Christina>I thought I was too late.

326
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,110
<12-8,Christina>我希望你好起来  所以跟他们谈了
<12-8,Christina>I talked to them so I could help you get better.

327
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,770
<12-8,Christina>我不想再看你受苦
<12-8,Christina>I just don't want to see you suffer anymore.

328
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,270
<12-9,Alice>不会了
<12-9,Alice>That won't be a problem.

329
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,330
<12-9,Alice>你被解雇了
<12-9,Alice>You're fired.

330
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,510
<12-10,Cuddy>她关心你
<12-10,Cuddy>This woman cares about you.

331
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,540
<12-10,Cuddy>如果没有她
<12-10,Cuddy>If it weren't for her...

332
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,960
<12-11,Alice>我活不到现在  是不是
<12-11,Alice>I wouldn't be here now, would I?

333
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,680
<12-11,Alice>我昨天就该解雇她
<12-11,Alice>I should have done it yesterday.

334
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,510
<12-12,Cuddy>你正承受着痛苦  我明白
<12-12,Cuddy>I understand that you're in pain,

335
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,780
<12-12,Cuddy>但出语伤人不是解决之道
<12-12,Cuddy>but lashing out isn't the answer.

336
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,080
<12-12,Cuddy>治疗才是
<12-12,Cuddy>Treatment is.

337
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,220
<12-13,Alice>我同意
<12-13,Alice>I agree.

338
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,180
<12-13,Alice>把男医生换回来
<12-13,Alice>Send the men back.

339
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,140
<12-13,Alice>至少他们不会天真兮兮  哭天抹泪
<12-13,Alice>At least they're not a bunch of dewy-eyed cry-babies.

340
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,750
<13-1,Wilson>拿的什么
<13-1,Wilson>What's that?

341
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,960
<13-2,House>最新一本杰克·加农小说
<13-2,House>It's the new Jack Cannon novel.

342
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,070
<13-2,House>有建议吗
<13-2,House>Suggestions?

343
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,780
<13-2,House>有
<13-2,House>Yeah.

344
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,730
<13-3,Wilson>放弃吧
<13-3,Wilson>Stop.

345
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,880
<13-3,Wilson>你这是行不通的
<13-3,Wilson>It can't be done.

346
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,970
<13-4,House>难怪你从来没治愈过癌症
<13-4,House>People wonder why you've never cured cancer.

347
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,330
<13-5,Wilson>什么时候拿的  跟卡迪约会前还是约会后
<13-5,Wilson>Did you get this before or after your date with Cuddy?

348
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,980
<13-6,House>你或许还有一个更明智的时段可以选
<13-6,House>Eh, probably would have been a wiser choice.

349
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,930
<13-7,Wilson>豪斯  这其实是好事
<13-7,Wilson>This is actually good, House.

350
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,020
<13-7,Wilson>她在违法
<13-7,Wilson>She's committing crimes.

351
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,090
<13-7,Wilson>你有何见解
<13-7,Wilson>What does that tell you?

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,360
<13-8,House>近墨者黑  我害人不浅
<13-8,House>I'm a horrible influence.

353
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,000
<13-8,House>没错
<13-8,House>True.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,310
<13-8,House>可她依然要接近你
<13-8,House>A horrible influence she's reaching out to.

355
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,380
<13-9,Wilson>她在寻求同你交流的途径
<13-9,Wilson>She's looking for ways to connect.

356
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,760
<13-9,Wilson>纯然是自虐  幼稚  疯狂的举动
<13-9,Wilson>Sure, they're self-destructive, juvenile, and insane,

357
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,840
<13-9,Wilson>可你也自虐  幼稚  疯狂
<13-9,Wilson>But so are you.

358
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,650
<13-9,Wilson>你们有了共同点
<13-9,Wilson>You do have something in common.

359
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,440
<13-9,Wilson>你们都在试图挖掘彼此的共通之处
<13-9,Wilson>You're both trying to find things you have in common.

360
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,940
<13-10,House>而且都没成功
<13-10,House>And not finding them.

361
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,900
<14-1,Jack>你看起来不太高兴
<14-1,Jack>You don't look so hot.

362
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,060
<14-1,Jack>想谈谈吗
<14-1,Jack>Want to talk about it?

363
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,950
<14-2,Alice>我们谈心的时光已经过去了
<14-2,Alice>Those days are over.

364
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,070
<14-3,Chase>你刚才在和谁说话
<14-3,Chase>Who were you talking to?

365
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,270
<14-4,Alice>我自己
<14-4,Alice>Myself.

366
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,400
<14-5,Taub>如果你有幻觉
<14-5,Taub>If you're seeing things,

367
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,400
<14-5,Taub>那可能是一种症状
<14-5,Taub>It could be another symptom.

368
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,090
<14-5,Taub>不是
<14-5,Taub>It's not.

369
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,400
<14-6,Alice>只是我的想象而已
<14-6,Alice>It's only in my imagination.

370
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
<14-6,Alice>我以虚构人物为生的
<14-6,Alice>I make things up for a living.

371
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,490
<14-7,Chase>还跟虚构人物讲话呢
<14-7,Chase>And talking to them?

372
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,410
<14-8,Alice>这是作家的通病
<14-8,Alice>It's a writer thing.

373
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
<14-8,Alice>作家还善于识人
<14-8,Alice>We're also good at reading people.

374
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,360
<14-8,Alice>比如说你
<14-8,Alice>Like you, for instance.

375
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,390
<14-8,Alice>刚刚离婚
<14-8,Alice>Recently divorced.

376
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,260
<14-8,Alice>昨晚和某女春宵一度
<14-8,Alice>You slept with a girl last night.

377
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,120
<14-8,Alice>在她家不在你家
<14-8,Alice>Her place, not yours.

378
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,900
<14-8,Alice>而你八成不会回她电话
<14-8,Alice>You probably won't return her calls.

379
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,620
<14-8,Alice>神了
<14-8,Alice>That...

380
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,270
<14-9,Chase>怎么看出来的
<14-9,Chase>How?

381
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,500
<14-10,Alice>你手指上戴过婚戒  白印还在
<14-10,Alice>The tan line from your former wedding ring.

382
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,610
<14-10,Alice>满身都是烟味
<14-10,Alice>You stink of smoke,

383
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,510
<14-10,Alice>但是牙齿和手指都没有变黄
<14-10,Alice>but no yellow on your fingers or teeth

384
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,380
<14-10,Alice>说明烟是她吸的
<14-10,Alice>means she's the smoker.

385
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,880
<14-10,Alice>烟味说明你不是没洗澡就是没换衣服
<14-10,Alice>And you either didn't shower or change.

386
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,030
<14-10,Alice>不管哪样  都证明是她家
<14-10,Alice>Either way, her place.

387
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,190
<14-11,Chase>看看他
<14-11,Chase>Do him.

388
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,860
<14-12,Taub>我们正在浪费时间
<14-12,Taub>We're wasting time,

389
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,880
<14-12,Taub>这才是她的目的
<14-12,Taub>which is her main goal here.

390
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,210
<14-12,Taub>伸胳膊
<14-12,Taub>Need your arm for this.

391
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,360
<14-13,Alice>你让我想起我前夫
<14-13,Alice>You remind me of my ex-husband.

392
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,200
<14-13,Alice>人不错  只是总是婚外恋
<14-13,Alice>A cute man, but problems in the bedroom department.

393
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,740
<14-14,Taub>根本不挨边
<14-14,Taub>Not even close.

394
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,530
<14-15,Alice>他数次被我捉奸在床
<14-15,Alice>The ones I caught him in.

395
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,370
<14-15,Alice>只要有机会  他就会找外遇
<14-15,Alice>He cheated on me every chance he could.

396
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,010
<14-15,Alice>第一次是跟我最好的朋友
<14-15,Alice>The first time with my best friend.

397
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,110
<14-15,Alice>第二次
<14-15,Alice>The second...

398
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,750
<14-15,Alice>那个混蛋
<14-15,Alice>The bastard.

399
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,550
<14-16,Taub>血压心率急速上升
<14-16,Taub>BP and heart rate are spiking.

400
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,170
<14-17,Chase>一定是对螯合剂过敏
<14-17,Chase>Must be an allergic reaction to the chelation agent.

401
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,830
<14-18,Taub>我还没给她注射呢
<14-18,Taub>I didn't give it to her yet.

402
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,710
<15-1,Chase>疼痛  癫痫  多汗
<15-1,Chase>Pain, seizures, hyperhidrosis,

403
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,300
<15-1,Chase>突发急性高血压
<15-1,Chase>and sudden onset of radically high blood pressure.

404
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,270
<15-2,Foreman>她的后续血检和尿检结果回来了
<15-2,Foreman>Her continuous blood and urine test came back.

405
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,570
<15-2,Foreman>明显不是汞中毒  阴性
<15-2,Foreman>It's definitely not mercury poisoning. Clean.

406
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,210
<15-3,Chase>可能是溶血性尿毒症
<15-3,Chase>Could be hemolytic uremic syndrome.

407
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,160
<15-4,Foreman>不是  尿中无血也无蛋白质标记
<15-4,Foreman>It's not. There weren't any blood or protein markers in her urine, either.

408
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,430
<15-5,Taub>我们刚才还发现她在自言自语
<15-5,Taub>We also caught her talking to herself.

409
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,420
<15-5,Taub>可能是妄想症状
<15-5,Taub>She could be delusional.

410
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,600
<15-6,Foreman>她是个隐居的作家
<15-6,Foreman>She's a writer and a recluse.

411
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,080
<15-6,Foreman>不自言自语才更奇怪
<15-6,Foreman>I'd be more surprised if she didn't talk to herself.

412
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,830
<15-6,Foreman>打字带玩够了没
<15-6,Foreman>You done playing with your ribbon?

413
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,110
<15-7,House>她当时在做什么
<15-7,House>What was she doing when it happened?

414
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,220
<15-8,Chase>坐在床上
<15-8,Chase>Sitting in bed.

415
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,740
<15-8,Chase>她说交谈对象只是她的想象
<15-8,Chase>She claims it was only in her imagination,

416
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,000
<15-8,Chase>可也难说
<15-8,Chase>but still.

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
<15-9,House>她血压飙升的时候呢
<15-9,House>When her BP spiked?

418
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,150
<15-10,Chase>把陶博比作她前夫
<15-10,Chase>Comparing Taub to her ex-husband.

419
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,550
<15-10,Chase>她真的恨她前夫
<15-10,Chase>She really hated the guy.

420
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,020
<15-11,House>第一个症状
<15-11,House>Her first symptom

421
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,000
<15-11,House>出现在她用枪指着自己头的时候
<15-11,House>was when she had a gun to her head.

422
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,410
<15-11,House>肾上腺素过量可以解释癫痫和血压飙升
<15-11,House>Excess adrenaline could explain seizures and skyrocketing BP.

423
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,970
<15-12,Taub>嗜铬细胞瘤
<15-12,Taub>A pheochromocytoma.

424
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,620
<15-13,House>做磁共振把它找出来
<15-13,House>Get an MRI and find it.

425
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,040
<15-14,House>拿着这个好吗
<15-14,House>Would you hold this?

426
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,510
<15-15,House>我的意思是马上
<15-15,House>I meant now.

427
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,950
<16-1,Alice>我有没有说过  我有幽闭恐怖症
<16-1,Alice>Have I mentioned I'm claustrophobic?

428
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,400
<16-2,Taub>我有没有说过  我们不在乎
<16-2,Taub>Have I mentioned we don't care?

429
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,930
<16-4,Chase>怎么回事
<16-4,Chase>What's wrong?

430
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,320
<16-5,Alice>没什么  腿抽筋而已
<16-5,Alice>Nothing. Just a leg cramp.

431
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,460
<16-6,Foreman>把她推出去  她腿里有金属
<16-6,Foreman>Get her out of here. She's got metal in her leg.

432
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,630
<16-6,Foreman>因为一次滑雪事故  她右腿植入三根螺钉
<16-6,Foreman>She has three screws in her right leg

433
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,890
<17-1,Foreman>她没告诉我们
<17-1,Foreman>from a skiing accident she didn't tell us about.

434
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,280
<17-1,Foreman>磁共振的磁场将金属螺钉加热至高温
<17-1,Foreman>The MRI's magnetic field super heated the metal,

435
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,810
<17-1,Foreman>造成三度烧伤
<17-1,Foreman>causing third-degree burns.

436
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,080
<17-1,Foreman>这些位置的皮肤因体内高温高压裂开
<17-1,Foreman>Skin ruptured from internal heat pressure here.

437
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,470
<17-2,Taub>不是我们的错
<17-2,Taub>It's not our fault.

438
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,870
<17-2,Taub>她签过同意书
<17-2,Taub>She signed the consent forms,

439
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,180
<17-2,Taub>否认体内有任何金属
<17-2,Taub>denied there was any metal...

440
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,590
<17-3,House>一般情况下我会说出来
<17-3,House>Normally I'd say it.

441
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,690
<17-3,House>不过或许这样你们才能真正理解
<17-3,House>Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.

443
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,080
<17-3,House>她想求死
<17-3,House>She wants to die.

444
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,610
<17-4,House>不要相信她说的任何话
<17-4,House>You cannot trust anything she says.

445
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,060
<17-5,Foreman>治疗她腿上的软组织损伤
<17-5,Foreman>Treating the soft tissue injuries in her leg

446
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,500
<17-5,Foreman>就会花掉这一天中的大部分时间
<17-5,Foreman>cost us most of the day.

447
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,710
<17-5,Foreman>我们还要更换螺钉
<17-5,Foreman>We also had to replace the screws.

448
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,800
<17-6,Chase>不用磁共振  找嗜铬细胞瘤可能需要一周之久
<17-6,Chase>And finding a pheochromocytoma without using the MRI could take us a week.

449
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,490
<17-7,Taub>如果她不停止对我们说谎  会更久
<17-7,Taub>Longer, if she doesn't stop lying to us.

450
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,430
<17-7,Taub>她的精神状态监控还剩39小时
<17-7,Taub>Or we could figure out a way to find it

451
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,890
<17-7,Taub>或许我们可以在此期间想出其他方法
<17-7,Taub>in the 39 hours left on her psych hold.

452
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,540
<17-8,House>我们需要让她配合
<17-8,House>We need to make her cooperate.

453
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,970
<17-8,House>我们必须提出她想要的条件
<17-8,House>We have to offer her something she wants.

454
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,840
<17-9,Foreman>豪斯  她想要自杀
<17-9,Foreman>She wants to kill herself, House.

455
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,840
<17-10,House>我可以配合
<17-10,House>I can work with that.

456
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,570
<18-1,House>我想要你写更多的书
<18-1,House>I want you to write more books.

457
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,910
<18-2,Alice>我对杰克·加农奇遇的写作已经终结
<18-2,Alice>I'm done writing Jack Cannon's adventures.

458
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,010
<18-2,Alice>等我离开这里之后
<18-2,Alice>And when I get out of here,

459
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,460
<18-2,Alice>我也就终结了
<18-2,Alice>I'll just be done.

460
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,290
<18-3,House>别这么说嘛  你这下流姑娘
<18-3,House>Now don't you say that, you dirty birdie.

461
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,320
<18-3,House>朝自己脑袋开枪 或者扯断一条腿
<18-3,House>You know, there are easier ways to go than shooting yourself in the head

462
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,550
<18-3,House>可都不是自杀的好方法
<18-3,House>or tearing apart a limb.

463
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,910
<18-3,House>这里有一个好方法
<18-3,House>And this is one of them.

464
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,730
<18-3,House>最妙的是  你会飘飘欲仙
<18-3,House>The best part, you'll feel so good,

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,960
<18-3,House>压根注意不到自己死了
<18-3,House>you won't even notice you're dead.

466
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,200
<18-4,Alice>你指望我相信
<18-4,Alice>You expect me to believe

467
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,460
<18-4,Alice>你会协助我自杀
<18-4,Alice>you're going to help me kill myself?

468
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,740
<18-5,House>洞悉人心的是你
<18-5,House>You're the perceptive one.

469
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,040
<18-5,House>你来说
<18-5,House>You tell me.

470
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,900
<18-6,Alice>为什么
<18-6,Alice>Why?

471
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,250
<18-7,House>你不配合  我们就不能及时找到肿瘤
<18-7,House>We can't find your tumor in time without your cooperation.

472
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,760
<18-7,House>所以我要让你来选
<18-7,House>So I'm giving you a choice.

473
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,600
<18-7,House>给我们一个治好你的机会
<18-7,House>Give us a chance to make you better,

474
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,380
<18-7,House>或者把针管随便一扎一推
<18-7,House>or stick this anywhere and push.

475
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,800
<18-8,Alice>你为什么在乎我
<18-8,Alice>Why do you care about me?

476
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,330
<18-8,Alice>你以为你读了我的书就了解我了
<18-8,Alice>You think you know me because you read my books?

477
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,380
<18-8,Alice>不
<18-8,Alice>No.

478
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,350
<18-9,House>我了解疼痛
<18-9,House>I know pain.

479
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,120
<18-9,House>你以为自己应付得来
<18-9,House>Think you can handle it,

480
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,090
<18-9,House>可终有一天你无法忍受
<18-9,House>and one day you can't.

481
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,400
<18-9,House>无法再忍的时候
<18-9,House>When that happens,

482
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,130
<18-9,House>你可能找到理由坚持下去  也可能找不到
<18-9,House>you either find reasons to go on, or you don't.

483
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,480
<18-10,Alice>我  我再也找不到理由了
<18-10,Alice>I'm... I'm all out of reasons.

484
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,410
<18-10,Alice>暂时而已
<18-10,Alice>Now.

485
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,900
<18-11,House>等疼痛消失
<18-11,House>When you're pain free,

486
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,470
<18-11,House>你会想要活下去重新开始写作的
<18-11,House>you're gonna want to live and start writing again.

487
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,610
<18-11,House>而且如果我错了
<18-11,House>And if I'm wrong,

488
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,960
<18-11,House>你也有备选方案可以带走
<18-11,House>got a backup plan to take home with you.

489
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,850
<18-12,Alice>好
<18-12,Alice>Okay.

490
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,090
<18-13,House>明智之选
<18-13,House>Good choice.

491
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,420
<18-13,House>如果我是你
<18-13,House>If I were you,

492
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,650
<18-13,House>不想被收走就把它藏起来
<18-13,House>I'd hide that if you want to keep it.

493
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,970
<18-14,Alice>我知道扎哪里最好
<18-14,Alice>I know the perfect place.

494
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,100
<19-1,House>宝贝儿  早上好
<19-1,House>Morning, sunshine.

495
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,340
<19-2,Alice>你真是个混蛋
<19-2,Alice>You're a real bastard.

496
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,310
<19-3,House>你应该选生路的
<19-3,House>You were supposed to choose life.

497
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,310
<19-4,Alice>你还是个出色的骗子
<19-4,Alice>You're also an excellent liar.

498
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,650
<19-5,House>可以治愈那部分不是骗你
<19-5,House>Wasn't lying about the cure.

499
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,580
<19-5,House>如果我们找到并且切除
<19-5,House>If we find and remove that pesky,

500
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,880
<19-5,House>那个分泌肾上腺素的讨厌瘤
<19-5,House>adrenaline-secreting tumor,

501
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,150
<19-5,House>你就能好起来
<19-5,House>you'll get better.

502
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,400
<19-6,Alice>你们最好快点
<19-6,Alice>You better hurry.

503
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,930
<19-6,Alice>明天这个时候  我的律师就能让我出院了
<19-6,Alice>My lawyer will have me out of here this time tomorrow.

504
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,500
<19-7,House>没错  说到这个
<19-7,House>Yeah, about that,

505
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,470
<19-7,House>你昨晚好像是发现并给自己注射了一种
<19-7,House>it seems that last night you found and self-administered

506
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,370
<19-7,House>你认为可以致命的药物
<19-7,House>what you thought was a potentially lethal narcotic.

507
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,490
<19-7,House>你的精神状态监控被延长了24小时
<19-7,House>Your psych hold has been extended an additional 24 hours.

508
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,460
<19-7,House>我知道  真令人颓丧  是不是
<19-7,House>I know. Bummer, right?

509
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,140
<19-8,Alice>想知道我新书里写了什么吗
<19-8,Alice>You want to know something about my book?

510
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,270
<19-9,House>当然
<19-9,House>Sure.

511
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,460
<19-10,Alice>杰克·加农死了
<19-10,Alice>Jack Cannon dies.

512
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
<19-10,Alice>我知道
<19-10,Alice>I know.

513
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,810
<19-10,Alice>真令人颓丧  是不是
<19-10,Alice>Bummer, right?

514
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,870
<20-1,Taub>昨晚的正电子发射层析扫描分析好了
<20-1,Taub>We finished analyzing the PET scans from last night.

515
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,420
<20-1,Taub>没有肿瘤的迹象
<20-1,Taub>There's no sign of a tumor.

516
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,160
<20-2,Foreman>我们在六处分别采血
<20-2,Foreman>We sampled blood from six different areas

517
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,420
<20-2,Foreman>寻找肾上腺素高点
<20-2,Foreman>looking for any spikes in adrenaline.

518
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
<20-2,Foreman>结果全是阴性
<20-2,Foreman>All of them were negative.

519
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,760
<20-3,Taub>如果她早告诉我们症状
<20-3,Taub>If she told us her symptoms,

520
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,730
<20-3,Taub>疼痛开始的时候从哪里发起
<20-3,Taub>where it hurts, when the pain first started,

521
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,900
<20-3,Taub>我们至少可以有个搜索的范围
<20-3,Taub>We could at least focus on a specific area.

522
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,940
<20-4,Chase>或者可以避开的范围
<20-4,Chase>Or use them to rule areas out.

523
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,990
<20-5,Foreman>她不会说真话
<20-5,Foreman>She'll only lie.

524
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,760
<20-5,Foreman>我们不和她交谈还更好一些
<20-5,Foreman>We're better off not even talking to her.

525
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,680
<20-6,Chase>你能让她再自杀一次吗
<20-6,Chase>You think you can get her to try to kill herself again?

526
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,160
<20-6,Chase>我们需要更多时间
<20-6,Chase>We're gonna need more time.

527
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,110
<20-7,House>或许有不必问她就能知道病情的办法
<20-7,House>There might be a way to get her symptoms without asking her.

528
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,150
<20-7,House>作家只写自己了解的东西
<20-7,House>If writers write what they know.

529
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,530
<20-8,Foreman>你不是说主人公是少年侦探吗
<20-8,Foreman>I thought you said it was about a boy detective.

530
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,190
<20-9,House>还有他的良师益友  海伦姨妈
<20-9,House>And his mentor, aunt Helen,

531
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,120
<20-9,House>碰巧与爱丽丝年龄相仿
<20-9,House>who happens to be around the same age as Alice.

532
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,730
<20-9,House>答案可能就在书里
<20-9,House>Answers could be in the book.

533
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,960
<20-10,Taub>很好  那条打字带读完了吗
<20-10,Taub>Great. You finish reading your typewriter ribbon yet?

534
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,320
<20-11,House>用超声波查找肿瘤
<20-11,House>Look for the tumor with the ultrasound.

535
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,840
<21-1,Sam>我开车从城那边过来就是治疗打字带的
<21-1,Sam>I drove across town to treat a ribbon?

536
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,150
<21-2,House>这就是我更喜欢撒谎的原因
<21-2,House>That's why I prefer lying.

537
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,340
<21-2,House>谎言让你更轻松
<21-2,House>It makes things easier.

538
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,860
<21-3,Wilson>不论他让你做的是什么  赶快停下
<21-3,Wilson>Whatever he has you doing, stop.

539
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,820
<21-4,House>你告诉他了
<21-4,House>You told him?

540
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,840
<21-5,Sam>我们两个住在一起的
<21-5,Sam>We do live together.

541
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,330
<21-5,Sam>我来他工作的地方自然要告诉他
<21-5,Sam>I generally tell him when I show up at his work.

542
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,410
<21-6,Sam>豪斯说这事关生死
<21-6,Sam>He told me it was a matter of life and death.

543
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,290
<21-6,Sam>的确
<21-6,Sam>It is.

544
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,790
<21-7,House>病人试图自杀
<21-7,House>Patient wants to kill herself.

545
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,200
<21-8,Wilson>他是在试图读小说
<21-8,Wilson>He's just trying to read a book,

546
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,580
<21-8,Wilson>最新一部《杰克·加农:少年侦探》
<21-8,Wilson>the latest Jack Cannon: boy detective.

547
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,370
<21-9,Sam>爱丽丝·唐纳是你的病人吗
<21-9,Sam>Alice Tanner is your patient?

548
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,950
<21-10,House>你也是坎粉吗
<21-10,House>You're a "Fannon" Too?

549
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,240
<21-11,Sam>我支持迪肯
<21-11,Sam>I'm team Deacon.

550
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,550
<21-12,House>不是吧
<21-12,House>Oh, come on.

551
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,130
<21-12,House>她就不能两个都爱么
<21-12,House>Why can't she love them both?

552
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,370
<21-13,Sam>打字机应该在打字带上留下了印迹
<21-13,Sam>The typewriter keys should have left impressions on these ribbon fibers.

553
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,900
<21-13,Sam>而且也会磨掉一层墨
<21-13,Sam>They would also remove a layer of ink.

554
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,760
<21-13,Sam>只要调调软件就好  简单
<21-13,Sam>It's just a question of tweaking the software, really.

555
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,520
<21-14,Wilson>卡迪知道你在用磁共振做这个吗
<21-14,Wilson>Does Cuddy know you're using the MRI for this?

556
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,710
<21-15,House>就当她知道
<21-15,House>Let's say yes.

557
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,380
<21-16,Sam>你觉得这本书里杰克会和萨拉好上吗
<21-16,Sam>So do you think Jack finally hooks up with Sarah in this one?

558
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,470
<21-17,House>不会  黛比·赖特才是他的真爱
<21-17,House>No. Debbie Wright is his true love.

559
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,690
<21-18,Sam>-她死了  -推测而已
<21-18,Sam>- She's dead. - Presumed!

560
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,350
<21-19,House>我们能确知的只不过
<21-19,House>All we really know is...

561
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,290
<21-20,Wilson>有真正的病人等着用磁共振呢
<21-20,Wilson>There are actual patients waiting to use this machine.

562
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,430
<21-21,Sam>恭喜
<21-21,Sam>Congratulations.

563
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,270
<21-21,Sam>书出来了
<21-21,Sam>It's a book.

564
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,300
<22-1,Cuddy>威尔森刚跟我说  他和山姆
<22-1,Cuddy>Wilson just told me we're going on a double date

565
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,310
<22-1,Cuddy>今晚跟我们出去四人约会
<22-1,Cuddy>with him and Sam tonight.

566
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,680
<22-2,House>你不喜欢四人约会吗
<22-2,House>You don't like double dates?

567
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,070
<22-3,Cuddy>我喜欢你事先问问我
<22-3,Cuddy>I'd just like if you'd ask me first.

568
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,610
<22-4,House>你不喜欢惊喜吗
<22-4,House>You don't like surprises?

569
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,470
<22-5,Cuddy>这是爱丽丝的书吗
<22-5,Cuddy>Is this Alice's book?

570
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,710
<22-6,House>山姆重编程磁共振  读出了爱丽丝的打字带
<22-6,House>Sam reprogrammed the MRI to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.

571
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,390
<22-7,Cuddy>你动用了一台价值三百万美元的医疗设备
<22-7,Cuddy>You used a $3 million piece of hospital equipment

572
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,760
<22-7,Cuddy>就为了读小说
<22-7,Cuddy>so you could read a novel?

573
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,660
<22-8,House>帅呆了  是不是
<22-8,House>Cool, right?

574
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,870
<22-9,Cuddy>作为你女友的我  由衷折服
<22-9,Cuddy>Well, as your girlfriend, I'm impressed.

575
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,120
<22-9,Cuddy>作为你上司的我  认为你是个浑球
<22-9,Cuddy>As your boss, you're a jackass.

576
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,080
<22-9,Cuddy>以后别这么干了
<22-9,Cuddy>Don't do it again.

<22-10,House>作为你男友的我  感谢你
<22-10,House>As your boyfriend, I thank you.

578
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,080
<22-10,House>作为你下属的我  鄙视你
<22-10,House>As your employee, I resent you,

579
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,330
<22-10,House>因为这是病例需要
<22-10,House>because I need this for my case.

580
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,510
<22-11,Cuddy>作为你上司的我  要你下周多看六小时门诊
<22-11,Cuddy>As your boss, you just got six more clinic hours next week.

<22-13,Cuddy>挑一个我俩都喜欢的就好
<22-13,Cuddy>Just pick something we'd both enjoy.

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,490
<22-14,House>我们都喜欢什么呢
<22-14,House>Yeah? And what would that be exactly?

585
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,720
<22-15,Cuddy>我说不好  你知道我的喜好
<22-15,Cuddy>I don't know. You know what I like.

586
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,050
<22-15,Cuddy>我得回去工作了
<22-15,Cuddy>I got to get back to work.

587

<23-1,Chase>有发现
<23-1,Chase>Found something.

588
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,170
<23-1,Chase>不是肿瘤
<23-1,Chase>It's not a tumor.

589
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,990
<23-1,Chase>不知是什么  包裹在心周
<23-1,Chase>Whatever it is, it's encased around her heart.

590
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,530
<23-1,Chase>她心包渗液
<23-1,Chase>She has a pericardial effusion.

591
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,170
<24-1,Chase>昨晚做正电子发射层析扫描时

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,220
<24-2,Taub>还没有出现
<24-2,Taub>when we did the PET scan.

593
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,240
<24-3,Foreman>她的病情在恶化
<24-3,Foreman>She's getting worse,

594
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,230
<24-3,Foreman>但不是嗜铬细胞瘤

597
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,770
<24-4,Chase>也可能是癌症引起的
<24-4,Chase>Or maybe a cancer.

598
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,870
<24-5,Foreman>豪斯  我们需要你的意见
<24-5,Foreman>We could use your opinion, House,

599
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,230
<24-5,Foreman>至少听听我们的说法
<24-5,Foreman>or at least your attention.

600
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,940
<24-6,House>杰克·加农没有死
<24-6,House>Jack Cannon is not dead.

601
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,700
<24-6,House>这更糟
<24-6,House>It's worse.

602
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,550
<24-6,House>写了十本书  结局是最终对决
<24-6,House>Ten books leading up to a final confrontation.

603
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,580
<24-6,House>掉人胃口
<24-6,House>She ends it on a cliffhanger.

604
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,720
<34-13,House>谁会干这种事
<34-13,House>I mean, who does that?

605
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,660
<24-7,Taub>想卖给你第十一本书的人
<24-7,Taub>People who want to sell you the 11th.

606
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,760
<24-8,House>她想自杀
<24-8,House>She was gonna kill herself.

607
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,430
<24-8,House>没有第十一本杰克·加农了
<24-8,House>This is the final Jack Cannon.

608
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,130
<24-8,House>什么答案都没有
<24-8,House>Nothing gets resolved.

609
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,530
<24-8,House>他爸是谁  他兄弟是谁杀的
<24-8,House>Who's his father? Who killed his brother?

610
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,870
<24-8,House>他脸上的疤是怎么来的
<24-8,House>How'd he get that damn scar on his cheek,

611
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,340
<24-8,House>他为什么喜欢玩溜溜球
<24-8,House>and why is he obsessed with yo-yos?

612
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,470
<24-9,Chase>书里的内容和我们的案子有关系吗
<24-9,Chase>Is there anything in it that pertains to our case?

613
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,100
<24-9,Chase>当然有
<24-9,Chase>Yeah.

614
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,830
<24-10,House>我知道她为什么要自杀
<24-10,House>I know why she wanted to kill herself.

615
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,330
<24-11,House>海伦·拉瑟福德  他的导师
<24-11,House>His mentor, Helen Rutherford,

616
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,120
<24-11,House>身患重病
<24-11,House>has contracted a serious illness

617
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,950
<24-11,House>包括关节疼痛
<24-11,House>which consists of joint paint,

618
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,520
<24-11,House>疲劳  感光灵敏
<24-11,House>fatigue, sensitivity to light,

619
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,190
<24-11,House>还有抑郁症
<24-11,House>and depression.

620
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,940
<24-12,Foreman>我们怎么知道导师就是爱丽丝的真实写照
<24-12,Foreman>How do we know this mentor character's really Alice?

621
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,560
<24-13,House>在这本书中海伦死了
<24-13,House>Helen dies halfway through the book.

622
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,330
<24-13,House>她崩了自己的脑袋
<24-13,House>Shoots herself in the head...

623
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,500
<24-13,House>好不成为杰克的累赘
<24-13,House>to save Jack from having to care for her.

624
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,540
<24-14,Taub>如果把这些和我们观察到的症状联系在一起
<24-14,Taub>If we add those to the symptoms we've seen

625
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,550
<24-14,Taub>加上心包积液  这是红斑狼疮
<24-14,Taub>and the pericardial effusion...it's lupus.

626
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,500
<24-15,House>不可能是红斑狼疮
<24-15,House>Can't be lupus.

627
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,290
<24-16,Chase>为什么
<24-16,Chase>Why not?

628
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,860
<24-17,House>那是绝症
<24-17,House>It isn't curable.

629
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,650
<24-18,Foreman>你还是没有解释原因
<24-18,Foreman>That's...not an answer.

630
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,590
<24-18,Foreman>这病是可以治疗的
<24-18,Foreman>It's treatable.

631
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,820
<24-18,Foreman>我们会开始测试
<24-18,Foreman>We'll start testing to see which drugs

632
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,100
<24-18,Foreman>看哪种药对她最有效
<24-18,Foreman>she best responds to.

633
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,150
<24-19,House>我们没办法带走她的疼痛
<24-19,House>We're not gonna be able to take her pain away.

634
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,050
<24-19,House>一旦她明天离开这里
<24-19,House>She's still gonna kill herself

635
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,780
<24-19,House>她还是会自杀
<24-19,House>as soon as she gets released tomorrow.

636
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,810
<24-19,House>我不能让杰克·加农的故事就这么完了
<24-19,House>Can't let Jack Cannon end this way.

637
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,850
<24-20,Chase>我们在医治病人  不是小说
<24-20,Chase>We're treating a patient... not a book.

638
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,290
<24-21,House>重新测试以确诊
<24-21,House>Retest to confirm.

639
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,890
<25-1,Cuddy>卡丁车  你认真的吗
<25-1,Cuddy>Go-carts? Really?

<25-3,House>你妈妈说你喜欢卡丁车
<25-3,House>Your mom said you loved go-carts.

00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,380
<25-4,Cuddy>你给我妈打过电话了
<25-4,Cuddy>You called my mother.

643
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,430
<25-4,Cuddy>我12岁的时候才喜欢玩卡丁车
<25-4,Cuddy>I loved them when I was 12.

644
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,310
<25-5,Sam>这太棒了

<25-5,Sam>12岁以后我就没再玩过了
<25-5,Sam>I haven't done this since I was 12!

646
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,710
<25-5,Sam>赢家有权挑饭店
<25-5,Sam>Winner picks the restaurant.

647
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,930
<25-6,Wilson>对此我有不好的预感
<25-6,Wilson>I have a very bad feeling about this.

648
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,230
<26-1,Fun Stop Attendant>准备好了吗  赛车手们
<26-1,Fun Stop Attendant>Are we ready, racers?

<27-4,House>这不怨我  威尔森就爱疯女人
<27-4,House>It's not my fault Wilson's attracted to psychos.

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,410
<27-5,Cuddy>地方是你选的
<27-5,Cuddy>You picked the place.

677
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,610
<27-6,Wilson>那都是气话
<27-6,Wilson>That's just the pain talking.

678
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,950
<27-7,House>我怎么没想到

679
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,130
<28-1,House>你的伤是车祸造成的
<28-1,House>It was a car crash.

680
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,570
<28-1,House>不是滑雪意外
<28-1,House>Not a skiing accident.

681
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,570
<28-2,Alice>你说什么
<28-2,Alice>What?

682
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,970
<28-3,House>你的腿伤是车祸造成的
<28-3,House>Screws in your leg.

683
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,440
<28-4,Alice>你答对了
<28-4,Alice>Ya got me.

684
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,110
<28-4,Alice>我现在要接着睡了
<28-4,Alice>I'll be going back to sleep now.

685
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,470
<28-5,House>车祸中肩带切进你的脖子
<28-5,House>You damaged your thyroid gland in the crash

686
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,810
<28-5,House>破坏了甲状腺
<28-5,House>when the shoulder strap cut into your neck.

687
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
<28-5,House>你没得红斑狼疮
<28-5,House>You don't have lupus.

688
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,180
<28-5,House>我们可以治好你的病
<28-5,House>What you have is curable.

689
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,620
<28-6,Alice>走开
<28-6,Alice>Go away.

690
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,690
<28-7,House>我看过你的书了
<28-7,House>I read your book.

691
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,690
<28-7,House>告诉你  糟透了
<28-7,House>Sucks, by the way.

692
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,490
<28-8,Alice>得了吧  你不可能看过
<28-8,Alice>Nice try, but impossible.

693
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,260
<28-9,House>海伦·拉瑟福德自杀身亡
<28-9,House>Helen Rutherford kills herself

694
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,930
<28-9,House>因为她自感无用
<28-9,House>because she feels useless

695
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,060
<28-9,House>同时她不想成为
<28-9,House>and doesn't want to be a burd--

696
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,770
<28-10,House>跟你现在的情形一样
<28-10,House>Just like you do now.

697
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,940
<28-10,House>你只是甲状腺机能减退
<28-10,House>You have hypothyroidism.

698
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
<28-10,House>所以你才疲惫不堪
<28-10,House>That's why you feel so tired and worn out.

699
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,570
<28-10,House>接受药物治疗能让你感觉年轻20岁
<28-10,House>With medication, you'll feel 20 years younger.

700
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,840
<28-10,House>或者是回到
<28-10,House>Or whatever age you were

701
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,440
<28-10,House>你不想自杀时候的年龄
<28-10,House>the last time you didn't want to kill yourself.

702
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,650
<28-12,House>-你是怎么  -你应该给故事写个结尾
<28-12,House>- How did you... - You can finish the story the right way...

703
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,380
<28-12,House>杰克·加农应有的结局
<28-12,House>the way Jack Cannon deserves.

704
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,350
<28-13,Alice>你以为杰克该有怎样的结局
<28-13,Alice>You think you know what Jack deserves?

705
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,390
<28-14,House>我知道至少该比你给他安排的要好
<28-14,House>I know that he deserves better than what you gave him.

706
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,690
<28-15,Alice>你一点都不了解他
<28-15,Alice>You don't know anything about him!

707
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,890
<28-15,Alice>你为什么就不能让我
<28-15,Alice>Why can't you just leave me--

708
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,300
<28-16,Alice>你对我做了什么
<28-16,Alice>What did you do to me?

709
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,430
<28-16,Alice>我动不了了
<28-16,Alice>I can't move.

710
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,870
<28-16,Alice>哪里都动不了
<28-16,Alice>I can't move anything.

711
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,920
<29-1,House>我怎么会半对半错呢
<29-1,House>How can I be right and wrong?

712
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,750
<29-1,House>我推断出是车祸
<29-1,House>I deduced the car accident

713
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,560
<29-1,House>因为甲状腺能解释症状
<29-1,House>because thyroid fit the symptoms.

714
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,530
<29-1,House>但甲状腺受损不能解释瘫痪
<29-1,House>But a damaged thyroid wouldn't explain the paralysis.

715
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,060
<29-1,House>我怎么会猜错病因
<29-1,House>How can I be wrong about the thyroid

716
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,500
<29-1,House>却答对祸根呢
<29-1,House>but right about the accident?

717
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,100
<29-2,Taub>如果不是甲状腺呢
<29-2,Taub>What if you're not?

718
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,170
<29-3,House>很高兴你能这么想  孩子
<29-3,House>I like the way you think, kid.

719
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,900
<29-4,Taub>至少不全是甲状腺的原因
<29-4,Taub>At least not completely.

720
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,110
<29-4,Taub>可能是15年前的车祸造成的创伤后脊髓空洞症
<29-4,Taub>Post traumatic syringomyelia from a 15-year-old car crash.

721
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,270
<29-4,Taub>多年来逐渐形成病灶
<29-4,Taub>Slowly growing over the years,

722
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,800
<29-4,Taub>压迫脊柱
<29-4,Taub>pressing against her spinal column.

723
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,420
<29-4,Taub>会引起疼痛  血压不稳以及癫痫
<29-4,Taub>Causes pain, fluctuating blood pressure, seizures.

724
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,860
<29-5,Foreman>如果未得到治疗
<29-5,Foreman>And if untreated,

725
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,960
<29-5,Foreman>最终将导致瘫痪死亡
<29-5,Foreman>eventually leads to paralysis and death.

726
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,490
<29-6,Taub>我们找到病灶进行治疗
<29-6,Taub>We find it and remove it.

727
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,250
<29-6,Taub>系统功能应该能恢复
<29-6,Taub>She should be able to regain full function.

728
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,890
<29-7,Chase>如果我们能拿到她当时的医疗记录
<29-7,Chase>If we can get her medical records from back then,

729
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,780
<29-7,Chase>就能确定病灶的位置
<29-7,Chase>we can use them to pinpoint the location.

730
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,360
<29-8,House>去找记录
<29-8,House>Do it.

731
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,760
<29-9,Taub>我们已经筋疲力尽了
<29-9,Taub>We're dead on our feet.

732
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,730
<29-9,Taub>我差不多四天没睡了
<29-9,Taub>I've barely slept in four days.

733
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,160
<29-10,House>真可怜
<29-10,House>Aw...that's sad.

734
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,870
<29-10,House>你知道还有什么比这更糟的吗
<29-10,House>You know what's even sadder?

735
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,830
<29-10,House>十三才是我手下唯一一个男人
<29-10,House>Thirteen was the only man on my team.

736
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,170
<29-11,Foreman>是啊  你得抓紧雇人
<29-11,Foreman>Yeah, it'd be nice if you hurry up

737
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,370
<29-11,Foreman>顶上她的空位
<29-11,Foreman>and hire someone to fill her spot.

738
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,110
<29-11,Foreman>那就去招人
<29-11,Foreman>Do it.

739
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,310
<29-12,House>卡迪要个女的
<29-12,House>Cuddy wants it to be a girl.

740
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,190
<29-13,Foreman>是有些人
<29-13,Foreman>There are a couple of people--

741
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,050
<29-14,House>我在跟奇斯说话
<29-14,House>I was talking to Chase.

742
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,110
<29-14,House>我看着你不过是想耍你
<29-14,House>I was just looking at you to screw with you.

743
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,990
<30-1,House>我在沉思
<30-1,House>I'm meditating.

744
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,290
<30-2,Foreman>在我们看来  像是在睡觉
<30-2,Foreman>From where we're standing, it looked like sleeping.

745
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,530
<30-3,Chase>我们找不到她过去的医疗记录
<30-3,Chase>We can't find her old medical records.

746
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,900
<30-4,House>你叫醒我就为这事
<30-4,House>You woke me up for that?

747
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,130
<30-5,Foreman>我们叫醒你因为这无关紧要
<30-5,Foreman>We woke you up because it doesn't matter.

748
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,300
<30-5,Foreman>爱丽丝拒绝接受其他治疗
<30-5,Foreman>Alice is refusing any more treatment.

749
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,500
<30-5,Foreman>她不想做手术
<30-5,Foreman>She doesn't want the surgery.

750
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,370
<30-6,Taub>她把我们轰出来了
<30-6,Taub>She kicked us out.

751
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,710
<30-7,House>她为什么要隐瞒车祸
<30-7,House>Why would she lie about the accident?

752
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,380
<30-8,Taub>每个人都会说谎
<30-8,Taub>Everybody lies.

753
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,550
<30-9,House>每个人都有说谎的原因
<30-9,House>Everybody has a reason.

754
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,990
<30-9,House>我听说了
<30-9,House>I know.

755
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,290
<31-1,Cuddy>爱丽丝拒绝做手术
<31-1,Cuddy>Alice is refusing surgery.

756
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,130
<31-2,House>不做手术她几天后就要死了
<31-2,House>She'll be dead in a few days without it.

757
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,630
<31-3,Cuddy>所以我花了四小时时间
<31-3,Cuddy>Which is why I've spent the last four hours

758
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,500
<31-3,Cuddy>想找到不经她同意进行手术的合法途径
<31-3,Cuddy>trying to find a legal way to do it without her permission.

759
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,400
<31-3,Cuddy>以失败告终  抱歉
<31-3,Cuddy>Unsuccessfully. I'm sorry.

760
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,240
<31-4,House>作为你的男友  我很感激你这么尽心尽力
<31-4,House>As your boyfriend, I'm grateful for the effort.

761
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,740
<31-4,House>作为你的雇员
<31-4,House>As your employee,

762
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,340
<31-4,House>我很失望你办事效率低下
<31-4,House>I'm disappointed at your ineffectiveness.

763
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,610
<31-5,House>她为什么不告诉我们腿上有钉子
<31-5,House>Why would she not tell us about the pins in her leg?

764
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,380
<31-6,Cuddy>因为她想寻死
<31-6,Cuddy>'cause she wants to die.

765
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,850
<31-7,House>就先把自己的腿给搞残废吗
<31-7,House>By having her leg ripped off?

766
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,850
<31-7,House>她是为了成名前
<31-7,House>She wants to punish herself...

767
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,160
<31-7,House>在她开始写作前发生的事
<31-7,House>for something that happened before she was famous,

768
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,890
<31-7,House>在惩罚自己
<31-7,House>before she even started to write.

769
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,760
<31-7,House>我想答案就在
<31-7,House>I think the answer's

770
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,160
<31-7,House>她过去的医疗记录里
<31-7,House>in her old medical records.

771
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,260
<31-7,House>但是那三个又脏又困的混蛋找不到
<31-7,House>But dopey, sleazy, and uptighty can't find them.

772
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,370
<31-8,Cuddy>或许爱丽丝·唐纳只是她的笔名
<31-8,Cuddy>Maybe Alice Tanner's just her pen name.

773
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,370
<31-9,House>你男友真是个白痴
<31-9,House>Your boyfriend is an idiot.

774
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,540
<31-10,Cuddy>我联系下全国档案部
<31-10,Cuddy>I'll contact the national records archive

775
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,210
<31-10,Cuddy>识别她腿上螺丝的型号
<31-10,Cuddy>and run the type of screws in her leg

776
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,910
<31-10,Cuddy>根据她的血型  年龄确定她的身份
<31-10,Cuddy>against blood type, age, and anything else I think of.

777
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,510
<31-11,House>她可能叫海伦
<31-11,House>Her first name could be Helen.

778
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,550
<31-12,Cuddy>谢谢
<31-12,Cuddy>Even better.

779
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,620
<32-1,House>不劳烦您起来了
<32-1,House>Don't bother to get up.

780
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,390
<32-1,House>你对杰克的描写
<32-1,House>You know, the way you write Jack

781
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,530
<32-1,House>栩栩如生
<32-1,House>always made him feel real to me.

782
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,800
<32-1,House>现在我知道原因了
<32-1,House>Now I know why.

783
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,800
<32-2,Alice>因为我是个出色的作家
<32-2,Alice>Because I'm a good writer.

784
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,870
<32-3,House>他很厉害  但有些笨拙
<32-3,House>He's cool, but he's awkward.

785
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,970
<32-3,House>他很聪明  但偶尔犯错
<32-3,House>He's brilliant. He makes mistakes.

786
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,510
<32-3,House>他很有趣  但有时会玩过火
<32-3,House>He's funny, but sometimes he takes it too far.

787
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,480
<32-3,House>听起来像个了不起的孩子
<32-3,House>Sounds like a great kid.

788
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,550
<32-4,Alice>求求你
<32-4,Alice>Please.

789
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,450
<32-4,Alice>让我一个人呆着
<32-4,Alice>Just leave me alone.

790
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,280
<32-5,House>发生车祸时你不是一个人
<32-5,House>You weren't alone in the car crash.

791
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,920
<32-5,House>还有你的儿子  海伦
<32-5,House>Your son was with you, Helen.

792
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,270
<32-6,House>你写书是为了让他继续活在你的生命里
<32-6,House>The books are your way of keeping him alive.

793
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,140
<32-7,Alice>为什么你就不能让我平静的死去
<32-7,Alice>Why can't you just let me die in peace?

794
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,410
<32-8,House>车祸后你一直不得安宁
<32-8,House>You haven't been at peace since it happened.

795
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,820
<32-9,Alice>是我害死了他
<32-9,Alice>I killed him.

796
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,190
<32-10,House>不  不是你
<32-10,House>No, you didn't.

797
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,120
<32-11,Alice>我让他开车
<32-11,Alice>I let him drive.

798
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,960
<32-11,Alice>他只有学习驾照
<32-11,Alice>He only had a learner's permit.

799
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,330
<32-11,Alice>当时在下雨
<32-11,Alice>It was raining.

800
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,530
<32-11,Alice>我应该受到惩罚
<32-11,Alice>I deserve this.

801
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,830
<32-12,House>不  不关你的事
<32-12,House>No, you don't.

802
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,640
<32-13,Alice>他总有办法让我满足他的一切要求
<32-13,Alice>He could always get me to do what he wanted.

803
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,210
<32-13,Alice>他是我的艺术女神
<32-13,Alice>He's always been my muse.

804
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,950
<32-14,House>这倒是有可能
<32-14,House>Well, that may be true,

805
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,550
<32-14,House>我重新看过
<32-14,House>but I've been reviewing

806
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,680
<32-14,House>你儿子的验尸报告
<32-14,House>your muse's autopsy results.

807
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,920
<32-14,House>他不是死于车祸
<32-14,House>It wasn't the crash that killed him.

808
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,490
<33-1,Cuddy>你儿子患有脑动脉瘤
<33-1,Cuddy>Your son had a brain aneurism.

809
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,860
<32-14,House>所以他才会撞车
<32-14,House>That's why he crashed.

810
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,890
<32-14,House>在车祸前他就死了
<32-14,House>He was dead before the impact.

811
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,030
<32-14,House>对此你无能为力
<32-14,House>There was nothing you could do to save him.

812
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,000
<32-15,Alice>他们应该告诉我这点的
<32-15,Alice>They would have told me.

813
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,360
<32-16,House>他们没理由追究真正的死因
<32-16,House>They had no reason to dig any deeper.

814
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,730
<32-16,House>那是场车祸  但我发现了
<32-16,House>It was a car accident. I did.

815
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,300
<32-16,House>那很容易被遗漏
<32-16,House>It's easy to miss.

816
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,040
<32-16,House>你可以看到血块淤积在这里
<32-16,House>But you can see the blood buildup here.

817
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,140
<32-16,House>你儿子那天怎么样都会死
<32-16,House>Your son would have died that day

818
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,910
<32-16,House>在公车上  在学校里
<32-16,House>on a bus, in school,

819
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,350
<32-16,House>或者是坐在床上他都会死
<32-16,House>sitting on his bed.

820
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,580
<32-16,House>车祸唯一的受害人是你
<32-16,House>The only thing the crash is killing is you.

821
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,020
<32-16,House>你脖子里的瘘管需要治疗
<32-16,House>We need to repair that syrinx in your neck.

822
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,490
<32-17,Alice>他就是我的一切
<32-17,Alice>He was my world.

823
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,000
<32-17,Alice>写作的时候
<32-17,Alice>Writing...

824
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,400
<32-17,Alice>我能感觉到他的存在
<32-17,Alice>I could feel him with me.

825
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,140
<32-18,Jack>那不是我的错  妈妈
<32-18,Jack>It wasn't my fault, mom.

826
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,480
<32-19,Alice>也不是我的错
<32-19,Alice>And it wasn't mine.

827
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,100
<33-1,Cuddy>她儿子没有脑动脉瘤
<33-1,Cuddy>Her son didn't have a brain aneurism.

828
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,170
<33-2,House>没错
<33-2,House>Nope.

829
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,200
<33-2,House>她不该让他在雨天开车
<33-2,House>She shouldn't have let him drive in the rain.

830
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,970
<33-2,House>杰克从来不是个乖小孩
<33-2,House>Jack was never very coordinated.

831
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,540
<33-2,House>作为你的上司
<33-2,House>As your boss,

832
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,640
<33-3,Cuddy>我反对你欺骗病人
<33-3,Cuddy>I am opposed to you lying to a patient.

833
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,580
<33-3,Cuddy>作为你的女友  我很高兴你关心别人
<33-3,Cuddy>As your girlfriend, I'm glad you care.

834
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,180
<33-3,Cuddy>我不关心
<33-3,Cuddy>I don't.

835
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,150
<33-4,House>我只想拯救杰克·加农
<33-4,House>I just wanted to save Jack Cannon.

836
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,550
<33-5,Cuddy>我知道你为什么喜欢他了
<33-5,Cuddy>Well, I can see why you like him.

837
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,590
<33-5,Cuddy>我开始看你送我的书了
<33-5,Cuddy>I started reading one of the books you gave me.

838
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,730
<33-6,House>我觉得你这话不可信
<33-6,House>I find that very hard to believe.

839
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,930
<33-6,House>为什么
<33-6,House>Why?

840
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,530
<33-7,Cuddy>因为我不能喜欢你喜欢的东西吗
<33-7,Cuddy>Because I can't like something you like?

841
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,900
<33-7,Cuddy>我们没法找到共同点吗
<33-7,Cuddy>We couldn't possibly have something in common?

842
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,230
<33-8,House>因为我没给过你书
<33-8,House>Because I lied about giving you the books.

843
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,330
<33-9,Cuddy>-这样啊  -是啊
<33-9,Cuddy>- Oh. - Oh.

844
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,170
<33-10,House>-威尔森跟你说的  -是的
<33-10,House>- Wilson told you. - Yeah.

845
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,170
<33-12,House>真是个长舌妇
<33-12,House>He's such a gossip.

846
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,380
<33-13,Cuddy>我不会因为我们喜欢不同的食物
<33-13,Cuddy>I'm not gonna dump you because we like different food

847
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,110
<33-13,Cuddy>书籍或音乐甩掉你
<33-13,Cuddy>or books or music.

848
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,680
<33-13,Cuddy>换句话说
<33-13,Cuddy>On the other hand,

849
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,120
<33-13,Cuddy>如果你觉得我们的关系有问题
<33-13,Cuddy>I might dump you if you don't talk to me

850
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,220
<33-13,Cuddy>却不跟我沟通我会甩掉你
<33-13,Cuddy>when you have a problem with our relationship.

851
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,090
<33-14,House>我知道你现在是这么想的
<33-14,House>I know you believe that now...

852
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,790
<33-14,House>但事实是
<33-14,House>but the fact is--

853
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,120
<33-15,Cuddy>谁在乎共同点
<33-15,Cuddy>Who cares about common?

854
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,120
<33-15,Cuddy>共同点多无聊
<33-15,Cuddy>Common is boring.

855
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,790
<33-15,Cuddy>随处可见
<33-15,Cuddy>It's...common!

856
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,700
<33-15,Cuddy>我喜欢和你在一起  我感觉很好
<33-15,Cuddy>I like being with you. You make me better.

<33-15,Cuddy>但愿我也能让你感觉更好
<33-15,Cuddy>Hopefully, I make you better.

858
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,870
<33-15,Cuddy>我们之间
<33-15,Cuddy>What we have is...

859
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,170
<33-15,Cuddy>就是不同寻常
<33-15,Cuddy>uncommon.

860
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,740
<33-15,Cuddy>我也从没这么开心过
<33-15,Cuddy>And I've never been happier.

861
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,330
<34-1,Alice>让我们单独呆会好吗  克里斯蒂娜
<34-1,Alice>Mind giving us a moment alone, Christina?

<34-3,House>你可以把下一本杰克·加农送给我
<34-3,House>You can dedicate the next Jack Cannon to me.

865
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,480
<34-4,Alice>爱莫能助
<34-4,Alice>I can't.

866
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,580
<34-5,House>-你还疼吗  -不
<34-5,House>- Are you still in pain?  - No.

867
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,480
<34-6,Alice>你医好了我  但帮了我更多
<34-6,Alice>You did everything you said, and more.

868
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,720
<34-6,Alice>我终于能放下包袱了
<34-6,Alice>I can finally move on.

869

<34-6,Alice>谢谢

870
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,120
<34-7,House>怎么说

<34-8,Alice>我想写成人小说了
<34-8,Alice>I want to write books for adults.

872
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,790
<34-9,House>杰克怎么办
<34-9,House>What about Jack?

873
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,530
<34-9,House>你的最后一本书什么都没说
<34-9,House>Your last book didn't answer anything.

874
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,830
<34-10,Alice>我结束杰克的故事的方式很完美
<34-10,Alice>The way I ended Jack's story is perfect.

875
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,200
<34-10,Alice>每位读者能根据自己的意愿
<34-10,Alice>Each reader can decide

876
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,210
<34-10,Alice>赋予他之后的人生
<34-10,Alice>what fate they want for him themselves.

877
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,970
<34-11,House>你  那太蠢了
<34-11,House>You--but that's stupid!

878
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,740
<34-11,House>你这样做没道理啊
<34-11,House>That doesn't make any sense!

<34-12,Alice>在真实人生中你能得到多少答案
<34-12,Alice>How many answers do you get in real life?

880
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,780
<34-13,House>这是本书
<34-13,House>This is a book.

881
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,250
<34-13,House>必然有开头过程结尾
<34-13,House>Books have beginnings, middles, and ends.

882
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,680
<34-13,House>你不能就留个悬念
<34-13,House>You can't just leave it on a cliffhanger--

883
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,720
<34-13,House>哪个作家会这么做
<34-13,House>who does that?

<34-15,House>你儿子
<34-15,House>Your son...

<34-15,House>能拥有你这样的母亲是他的福气
<34-15,House>was very lucky to have you as his mother.
