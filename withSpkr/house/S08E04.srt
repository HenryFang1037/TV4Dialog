<3-8,House >my department's not really a department.

142
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,340
<3-8,House >因为我的老板说他没钱
<3-8,House >'cause my boss says he doesn't have the money.

143
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,640
<3-8,House >你  就形成了鲜明对比
<3-8,House >Which provides a nice contrast...with you.

144
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,290
<3-9,Ainsley>我们正在想办法从预算中节省资金
<3-9,Ainsley>We're trying to find money in our budget

145
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,670
<3-9,Ainsley>这样我们就不用将公司搬到海外了
<3-9,Ainsley>so we don't have to move our operations overseas.

146
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,080
<3-10,House>我懂了  你说你们也"没钱"嘛
<3-10,House>I get it. Answer's no.

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,730
<3-10,House>刚才我多嘴了
<3-10,House>Shouldn't have said anything.

148
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,850
<3-10,House>很高兴症状出现在
<3-10,House>I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up

149
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,170
<3-10,House>你去中国前
<3-10,House>before you left for China.

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,390
<3-10,House>我可不认为那里的医生
<3-10,House>'cause I'm not sure the doctors over there

151
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,790
<3-10,House>会这么乐观
<3-10,House>would be so optimistic,

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,680
<3-11,Barton >介于...
<3-11,Barton >considering...

155
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,940
<3-12,Ainsley>你们在说什么
<3-12,Ainsley>What are you guys talking about?

156
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,780
<3-13,House>只是在感叹文化差异有多么巨大
<3-13,House>Oh, just how different the two cultures are.

157
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,110
<3-13,House>比如  对于精神病的看法
<3-13,House>For example, our opinions on mental illness.

158
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,880
<3-13,House>在这里  我们认为是正常且可治疗的
<3-13,House>Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition.

161
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,080
<3-14,Ainsley>一切都好吗
<3-14,Ainsley>Is everything okay?

162
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,420
<3-15,Barton>一切都好
<3-15,Barton>Everything's fine.

164
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,700
<3-16,House >但我能让你转院去
<3-16,House >I could have you checked into a facility

165
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,950
<3-16,House >专治精神疾病的机构
<3-16,House >that exclusively treats mental disorders.

166
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,460
<3-16,House >这主意怎么样
<3-16,House >How does that sound?

167
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,470
<3-17,Ainsley>只要能让他病情好转
<3-17,Ainsley>Whatever's gonna get him better.

168
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,890
<3-18,Barton>先试试药物治疗吧
<3-18,Barton>Let's try the medication first.

170
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,090
<4-1,House>我雇你了
<4-1,House>You're hired!

171
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,230
<4-1,House>你们一定会喜欢奇斯和陶博的
<4-1,House>Oh, you guys are gonna love doctors Chase and Taub.

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,660
<4-1,House>别在小个子医生面前表现你的纳粹情结就好
<4-1,House>Keep your nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.

173
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,710
<4-2,Park>你弄到钱了吗
<4-2,Park>You got the money?

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,400
<4-2,Park>怎么弄的
<4-2,Park>How?

175
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,060
<4-3,House>病人是个精明的商人
<4-3,House>Patient's a smart businessman.

176
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,030
<4-4,Adams>他正一手破坏数千就业机会
<4-4,Adams>He's destroying thousands of jobs.

177
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,400
<4-5,House>工作本身并没有消失
<4-5,House>Jobs are not being destroyed.

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,740
<4-5,House>只不过被转移了地点
<4-5,House>They're being relocated.

179
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,770
<4-5,House>你认为这件事注定是错误的
<4-5,House>The fact that you see that as inherently bad

180
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,420
<4-5,House>说明你是个盲目的爱国者
<4-5,House>means you're an irrational patriot.

181
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,520
<4-5,House>或者说是极端爱国份子
<4-5,House>To put it another way, a patriot.

182
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,800
<4-6,Park>爱国情节是与生俱来的
<4-6,Park>Patriotism is natural.

183
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
<4-6,Park>我们依赖于所属的群体  以保证个人安全
<4-6,Park>We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe.

184
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,200
<4-6,Park>如果个人
<4-6,Park>It's helpful for society

185
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,130
<4-6,Park>对其所在的社会持正面观点
<4-6,Park>if its members have positive feelings

186
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,480
<4-6,Park>是有利于社会安定的
<4-6,Park>about that society.

187
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,410
<4-7,House>反例就是伊朗的女人
<4-7,House>Iranian women.

188
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,010
<4-7,House>乌干达的变装同性恋
<4-7,House>Drag queens in Uganda.

189
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,170
<4-7,House>爱国主义说白了就是对不动产的忠诚
<4-7,House>Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate,

190
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,260
<4-7,House>而这些土地
<4-7,House>real estate that's been conquered 800 times

191
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,020
<4-7,House>曾被不同文化背景的不同政权所统治
<4-7,House>by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures.

192
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,960
<4-7,House>不论哪个时代的人  都认为祖国是最好的
<4-7,House>But each time, it's just the best.

193
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,460
<4-7,House>我以西班牙伊莎贝拉女王之名
<4-7,House>I claim this burger in the name of

195
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,130
<4-7,House>宣告这个汉堡归我了
<4-7,House>Queen Isabella of Spain.

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,030
<4-8,Adams>我去看看病人的情况
<4-8,Adams>I'll go check on the patient.

197
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,610
<4-8,Adams>我有丙肝
<4-8,Adams>I have hepatitis C.

198
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,570
<4-9,Park >是我传给她的
<4-9,Park >She got it from me.

199
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,710
<5-1,Ainsley>我爸爸怎么样了
<5-1,Ainsley>Hey, how's my Dad doing?

200
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,320
<5-2,Adams>很不错
<5-2,Adams>Ah, great.

201
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,040
<5-2,Adams>他的视觉恢复正常了
<5-2,Adams>His vision's back to normal,

202
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,100
<5-2,Adams>如果他整晚都没有复发
<5-2,Adams>And if he remains asymptomatic through the night,

203
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,600
<5-2,Adams>明天早上就可以出院了
<5-2,Adams>we'll be able to release him in the morning.

204
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,440
<5-2,Adams>能不能在九点前出院
<5-2,Adams>Any chance that could happen before 9:00?

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,780
<5-2,Adams>在他住院消息的冲击下
<5-2,Adams>Our stock dropped a couple points today

206
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,760
<5-2,Adams>股价跌了不少
<5-2,Adams>with the news that he's sick.

207
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,430
<5-3,Adams>我希望能在开市之前
<5-3,Adams>I would love for him to get out of here

208
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,580
<5-3,Adams>就让他出院
<5-3,Adams>before the market opens.

209
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,140
<5-3,Adams>请别见怪  但是...
<5-3,Adams>No offense, but...

210
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,700
<5-3,Adams>我觉得你父亲要关闭所有在美工厂
<5-3,Adams>I think it's terrible your Dad's closing down

211
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,320
<5-3,Adams>是很过分的决定
<5-3,Adams>all your American operations.

212
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,840
<5-4,Ainsley>我想他并不是出于图利而转移公司的
<5-4,Ainsley>I don't think he's moving the company out of greed.

213
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,010
<5-4,Ainsley>他是要离开这个伤心之地
<5-4,Ainsley>He's moving it out of grief.

214
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,430
<5-4,Ainsley>我的母亲  在四个月前去世了
<5-4,Ainsley>My mom, she died four months ago.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,070
<5-4,Ainsley>死于非霍奇金淋巴瘤
<5-4,Ainsley>Non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and...

216
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,910
<5-4,Ainsley>住在满是回忆的家里  行驶在同样的路上
<5-4,Ainsley>It's been hard for him-- living in their house,

217
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,300
<5-4,Ainsley>物是人非  让他很伤感
<5-4,Ainsley>driving down the same streets.

218
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,200
<5-4,Ainsley>不断勾起他对我母亲的回忆
<5-4,Ainsley>I mean, he's constantly reminded of her.

219
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,650
<5-5,Ainsley>爸爸
<5-5,Ainsley>Dad?

220
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,430
<5-6,Adams>这里需要一个插管包
<5-6,Adams>I need an intubation kit in here!

221
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,240
<5-7,Ainsley>怎么回事
<5-7,Ainsley>What's going on?

222
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,550
<6-1,Adams>血管造影术显示  在肺左下叶
<6-1,Adams>Angiography showed a hemorrhagic site

223
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,680
<6-1,Adams>有一个出血点
<6-1,Adams>in the left lower lobe.

224
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,170
<6-2,Park>我认为是高黏滞综合征
<6-2,Park>I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.

225
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,940
<6-2,Park>我们呆在福曼的办公室里
<6-2,Park>Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing

226
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,790
<6-2,Park>他没关系吗
<6-2,Park>in his office?

227
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,960
<6-3,House>他才不会发现呢
<6-3,House>He's never gonna know.

228
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,770
<6-3,House>事实上他不就在这里吗
<6-3,House>He's actually in here right now.

229
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,270
<6-4,Adams>血细胞计数和蛋白计数均正常
<6-4,Adams>Blood count and protein count are normal.

230
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,650
<6-4,Adams>我认为是高黏滞综合征
<6-4,Adams>I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.

231
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,640
<6-5,House>抱歉  不过在今天早上朴克向全院
<6-5,House>Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide

232
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,610
<6-5,House>发了那份不算道歉的道歉信后
<6-5,House>non-apology apology this morning,

233
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,050
<6-5,House>我认为抄袭是眼下最流行的
<6-5,House>I assume that plagiarism is the new black.

234
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,850
<6-6,Park>如果那能让大家同情安德鲁斯...
<6-6,Park>If it makes Andrews look sympathetic...

235
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,340
<6-7,House>学他只会让你更可悲
<6-7,House>Copying him makes you look pathetic.

236
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,250
<6-7,House>你要是不去上愤怒控制课  我给你钱
<6-7,House>And I will pay you not to go to anger management classes.

237
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,310
<6-8,Park>会不会是凝血问题
<6-8,Park>What about another clotting problem?

238
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,650
<6-8,Park>凝血因子V缺乏症
<6-8,Park>Factor V Leiden deficiency.

239
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,370
<6-9,House>有可能
<6-9,House>It's possible.

240
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,800
<6-9,House>亚当斯才是需要控制愤怒情绪的人
<6-9,House>Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.

241
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,460
<6-10,Adams>骨髓增生异常综合征
<6-10,Adams>Myelodysplastic syndrome.

242
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,940
<6-11,House>我听说了
<6-11,House>I heard about your conversation

243
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,070
<6-11,House>你跟病人女儿的对话
<6-11,House>with the patient's daughter.

244
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,210
<6-11,House>你的态度很恶劣
<6-11,House>You were hostile.

245
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,030
<6-12,Adams>那是因为他们公司的决定
<6-12,Adams>Well, their company's making a decision

246
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,250
<6-12,Adams>我强烈反对
<6-12,Adams>I strongly disagree with.

247
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,070
<6-13,House>但你对监狱里的种族主义者
<6-13,House>Yet you were never anything but courteous

248
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,440
<6-13,House>和强奸犯的态度可好得不得了
<6-13,House>to the racists and rapists in prison.

249
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,230
<6-13,House>难道你认可那些家伙的作为吗
<6-13,House>Those guys made decisions you supported?

250
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,570
<6-14,Adams>骨髓增生异常综合征
<6-14,Adams>Myelodysplastic syndrome.

251
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,550
<6-15,House>我猜跟你昨天早上参加的葬礼
<6-15,House>I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral

252
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,150
<6-15,House>大有关系
<6-15,House>you attended yesterday morning.

253
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,590
<6-16,Adams>我是去参加面试了
<6-16,Adams>I was at a job interview.

254
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,100
<6-17,House>你九点一刻就来了
<6-17,House>You got to work at 9:15.

255
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,600
<6-17,House>离这里最近的一家就你的专科有招聘的医院
<6-17,House>Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty

256
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,810
<6-17,House>也有45分钟的路程
<6-17,House>is 45 minutes away.

257
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,790
<6-17,House>你在说谎
<6-17,House>It's not possible.

258
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,100
<6-17,House>节哀顺变
<6-17,House>My condolences.

259
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,450
<6-18,Adams>我不是去参加葬礼
<6-18,Adams>I wasn't at a funeral.

260
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,770
<6-19,House>那只剩下...
<6-19,House>That just leaves...

261
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,830
<6-19,House>不是面试
<6-19,House>everywhere but a job interview.

262
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,660
<6-19,House>出去
<6-19,House>Get out.

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,540
<6-20,House>是哪个小鬼
<6-20,House>Who goes there?

264
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,940
<6-20,House>快快现形
<6-20,House>Reveal yourself!

265
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,750
<6-21,Foreman>赶快
<6-21,Foreman>Now.

266
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,120
<6-22,House>我们会走的
<6-22,House>Well, we would.

267
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,500
<6-22,House>但整形外科还占着
<6-22,House>But orthopedics is still squatting

268

<6-22,House>which is weird,

270
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,850
<6-22,House>要知道我昨晚给了张你巨额支票
<6-22,House>'cause you got a large check last night.

271
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,160

<6-23,Foreman>a very public belt-tightening,

273
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,020
<6-23,Foreman>就是说这是笔被迫捐款
<6-23,Foreman>means this donation was given under duress.

274
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,620
<6-23,Foreman>病患没有说明前因后果
<6-23,Foreman>Patient didn't tell me the whole story,

275
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,870
<6-23,Foreman>但他确实提到  若我们不兑现就太好了

<6-27,House>-豪斯...  -我只是想帮你

<6-27,House>我以为他肯定会一拳挥在我脸上
<6-27,House>I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face,

283
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,580
<6-27,House>就能证明那是正常反应了
<6-27,House>thus proving it's a natural response.

<6-27,House>老天  你自制力也太好了点吧
<6-27,House>My god, you have super-human discipline.

290
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,850
<6-32,House>当然是为了我们的赌约

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,460
<6-33,Park>别心心念念你的赌约了
<6-33,Park>Forget about the bet.

<6-35,Adams>If he has myelodysplastic syndrome,

296
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,130
<6-35,Adams>就会出血而死

<6-36,Park>要是他是凝血因子V缺乏
<6-36,Park>And if he has Factor V Leiden deficiency,

<7-6,Adams>What about juice boxes in the break room

312
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,890
<7-6,Adams>在休息室准备果汁吗
<7-6,Adams>for the children you'll be hiring?

<7-10,Park>对他全家来说  这已经是康庄大道了
<7-10,Park>So this is the family's best hope.

<9-5,Park>预防什么  他弄成这样是因为打架
<9-5,Park>Prevent what? He got in a fight.

388
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,390
<9-6,House>还是他先动的手
<9-6,House>Which he started.

389
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,560
<9-6,House>也就是说他又暴躁又愚蠢
<9-6,House>Which means he's both irascible and stupid.

390
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,010
<9-7,Asian man>我都告诉那个种族歧视兄弟会的醉鬼
<9-7,Asian man>I told the drunk, racist frat guy

391
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,820
<9-7,Asian man>这应该叫做连体双胞胎了
<9-7,Asian man>the proper term is "Conjoined twin,"

392
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,240
<9-7,Asian man>不是什么暹罗双胞胎
<9-7,Asian man>not "Siamese."

393
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,990
<9-8,House>对于醉鬼还是兄弟会  我不予置评
<9-8,House>I can't comment on the drunk or the frat.

394
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,600
<9-8,House>但昌恩兄弟呢  确实出生于暹罗
<9-8,House>But Change and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam.

395
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,520
<9-8,House>而且他们确实  是双胞胎
<9-8,House>And they were, in fact, twins.

396
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,550
<9-8,House>就像  如果你叫是理查德
<9-8,House>If your name was Richard,

397
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,290
<9-8,House>那我也可以叫你迪克
<9-8,House>it would be okay for me to call you a Dick.

399
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,540
<9-8,House>展示下你在愤怒控制课上学的废话吧
<9-8,House>But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class

400
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,750
<9-8,House>也许他就不会二进宫了
<9-8,House>might help keep this guy out of here the next time.

401
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,000
<9-9,Park>有时候  给那些罪有应得的人来一拳
<9-9,Park>Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,670
<9-9,Park>会让你感觉到格外的满足
<9-9,Park>to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it.

403
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,420
<9-9,Park>但如果你能想想后果的话
<9-9,Park>But when you think about the consequences--

404
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,370
<9-10,House>这样就行了  走吧
<9-10,House>Okay, let's go.

405
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,690
<9-11,Park>你不是让我帮他控制情绪吗
<9-11,Park>I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.

406
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,090
<9-12,House>不用了  我要的东西已经到手了
<9-12,House>No, I got everything I need.

407
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,940
<9-13,Park >-有时候  -有时候
<9-13,Park >- Sometimes... - Sometimes...

408
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,850
<9-13,Park >给那些罪有应得的人来一拳
<9-13,Park >It's incredibly satisfying to wind up

409
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,470
<9-14,House>会让你感觉到格外的满足
<9-14,House>and punch someone who deserves it.

410
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,750
<9-14,House>不知道委员会的人听后会怎么想
<9-14,House>Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.

411
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,000
<10-1,Barton>这纯粹就是浪费时间
<10-1,Barton>This is a waste of time.

412
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,410
<10-1,Barton>罗宾不可能传染给我性病
<10-1,Barton>There's no way that Robin gave me an STD.

413
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,430
<10-2,Adams>我知道这很难接受
<10-2,Adams>I know this is hard,

414
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,120
<10-2,Adams>关于你妻子的事  我很抱歉
<10-2,Adams>and I'm sorry about your wife.

415
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,860
<10-2,Adams>如果你想找人谈谈的话
<10-2,Adams>If you'd like to talk to someone,

416
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,060
<10-2,Adams>我们医院有悲伤咨询师
<10-2,Adams>we do have grief counselors at the hospital.

417
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,450
<10-3,Barton>你说起话来跟我女儿一样
<10-3,Barton>You sound like my daughter.

418
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,850
<10-3,Barton>我很想我的妻子
<10-3,Barton>I miss my wife,

419
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,900
<10-3,Barton>但这并不影响我的经营决策
<10-3,Barton>but it's not driving my decision-making.

420
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,220
<10-4,Adams>你从88年开始就任首席执行官
<10-4,Adams>You were CEO since 1988.

421
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,930
<10-4,Adams>在你妻子过世后决定搬迁公司
<10-4,Adams>You decided to move your company right after your wife died.

422
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,590
<10-4,Adams>合理的解释就是你受了情感的影响
<10-4,Adams>It stands to reason that your emotions factored in.

423
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,950
<10-4,Adams>我妻子
<10-4,Adams>My wife...

424
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,300
<10-5,Barton>是我逗留此地的唯一原因
<10-5,Barton>is the only thing that keeps me here.

425
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,360
<10-5,Barton>我每周都去给她扫墓
<10-5,Barton>I visit her grave once a week.

426
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,680
<10-6,Adams>这么说  你女儿错了
<10-6,Adams>So your daughter was wrong.

427
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,220
<10-6,Adams>你就是需要
<10-6,Adams>You just...really need

428
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,050
<10-6,Adams>一大笔钱
<10-6,Adams>a lot of money.

429
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,490
<10-7,Barton>你听说过株式会社金刚组吗
<10-7,Barton>You ever hear of Kongo Gumi?

430
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,470
<10-7,Barton>是家成立于公元578年的日本建筑公司
<10-7,Barton>Construction company in Japan founded in the year 578.

431
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,180
<10-7,Barton>是家族企业
<10-7,Barton>Family-owned and operated.

432
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,340
<10-7,Barton>五十代人都是以建造寺庙为生
<10-7,Barton>Building buddhist temples for 50 generations.

433
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,410
<10-7,Barton>五年前破产了
<10-7,Barton>We--went bankrupt five years ago.

434
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,400
<10-7,Barton>你能想象他们最后一任执行官是什么感受吗
<10-7,Barton>You have any idea how that last CEO must have felt?

435
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,050
<10-7,Barton>对不起  我忍不住要动一下
<10-7,Barton>Sorry, I have to move.

436
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,560
<10-8,Adams>你在心律加速
<10-8,Adams>Your heart rate is speeding up.

437
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,860
<10-8,Adams>感觉胸闷吗
<10-8,Adams>Do you feel any tightness in your chest?

438
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,090
<10-9,Barton>是的  我以为是放射的关系
<10-9,Barton>Yes, I figured it was from the radiation.

439
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,560
<10-10,Adams>我想你犯心脏病了
<10-10,Adams>I think you're having a heart attack.

440
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,760
<11-1,Wilson>请进
<11-1,Wilson>Come in.

441
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
<11-2,Park>威尔森医生
<11-2,Park>Dr. Wilson...

442
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,550
<11-2,Park>我有事请教
<11-2,Park>I need your advice.

443
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,850
<11-2,Park>我和豪斯拿一百块
<11-2,Park>I bet House $100

444
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,070
<11-2,Park>赌我不会在纪律听证会
<11-2,Park>that I wouldn't get fired

445
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,750
<11-2,Park>之后被解雇
<11-2,Park>after my disciplinary hearing.

446
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,440
<11-2,Park>自此以后  他仿佛
<11-2,Park>Ever since then, he's been acting like

447
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,710
<11-2,Park>当真想要让我被解雇
<11-2,Park>he's actually trying to get me fired.

448
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,840
<11-3,Wilson>那是因为他的确想让你被解雇
<11-3,Wilson>That's because he is actually trying to get you fired.

449
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,300
<11-4,Park>他讨厌我吗
<11-4,Park>Does he hate me?

450
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,160
<11-5,Wilson>估计和那没有关系
<11-5,Wilson>Not sure that's relevant to the equation.

451
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,550
<11-6,Park>那么就是为了一百块
<11-6,Park>So it's really over $100?

452
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,270
<11-7,Wilson>估计和钱没关系
<11-7,Wilson>Not sure the amount is relevant.

453
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,570
<11-7,Wilson>他捍卫的是他的尊严
<11-7,Wilson>He's fighting for his honor.

454
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,030
<11-8,Park>他会毁了我的前程
<11-8,Park>He'll ruin my career.

455
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,610
<11-9,Wilson>-估计也...  -如果我拿两百块
<11-9,Wilson>- Not sure that'...  - What if I bet him $200

456
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,760
<11-10,Park>赌我会被解雇呢
<11-10,Park>I will get fired.

457
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,930
<11-11,Wilson>他认为和同一个人下相互对立的赌注
<11-11,Wilson>He sees competing debts with the same person

458
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,340
<11-11,Wilson>是非常可耻的行为
<11-11,Wilson>as a disgrace to the game.

459
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,570
<11-11,Wilson>他可能会愈发地想要整垮你
<11-11,Wilson>He'll be even more motivated to beat you.

460
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,830
<11-12,Park>换作是你  你会怎么做呢
<11-12,Park>If you were me, what would you do?

461
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,550
<11-13,Wilson>你得给他些
<11-13,Wilson>You have to give him something

462
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,310
<11-13,Wilson>他视为比尊严还重要的东西
<11-13,Wilson>he values more than honor.

463
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,780
<11-13,Wilson>同时  你可以开始重新写简历了
<11-13,Wilson>And you should update your resume.

464
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,420
<12-1,Adams>心电图和肌钙蛋白检测结果不明确
<12-1,Adams>EKG and troponins were equivocal.

465
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,940
<12-1,Adams>甚至无法确定病人
<12-1,Adams>It's not even clear if our patient

466
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,820
<12-1,Adams>是否犯了心脏病
<12-1,Adams>just had a heart attack or what it was.

467
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,370
<12-2,House>看看他是否有节段性室壁运动异常
<12-2,House>Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities.

468
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,650
<12-2,House>给他做个超声波检测
<12-2,House>Get him an echo to confirm.

469
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,430
<12-2,House>我需要二十万
<12-2,House>I need $200,000.

470
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,770
<12-2,House>自他入院后他的公司
<12-2,House>His company's lost one third of its value

471
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,880
<12-2,House>损失了三分之一的市值
<12-2,House>since he was admitted.

472
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,820
<12-3,Adams>所以你想进行内幕交易吗
<12-3,Adams>And you want to do some insider trading?

473
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,880
<12-3,Adams>这是经济犯罪
<12-3,Adams>I take it felonies

474
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,470
<12-3,Adams>有违你的假释条例吧
<12-3,Adams>aren't a violation of your parole?

475
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,560
<12-4,House>这不是内幕交易
<12-4,House>It's not insider trading.

476
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,690
<12-4,House>就是赌我能治好他的病
<12-4,House>Just betting on myself to solve the case.

477
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,780
<12-4,House>一旦治好了  他公司股价就会涨
<12-4,House>Once we cure him, share price goes up,

478
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,550
<12-4,House>我就还你钱
<12-4,House>I pay you back.

479
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,930
<12-5,Adams>不行
<12-5,Adams>No.

480
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,150
<12-6,House>不  你不能说"不"
<12-6,House>No, you don't say "No."

481
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,980
<12-6,House>你应该和我还价
<12-6,House>You...make a counter offer.

482
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,270
<12-7,Adams>我不会借钱给我的老板的
<12-7,Adams>I'm not loaning my boss money.

483
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,130
<12-8,House>好吧  我替你还价
<12-8,House>Fine. I'll make you a counter.

484
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,550
<12-8,House>十万块
<12-8,House>$100,000.

485
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,910
<12-8,House>二万块吧
<12-8,House>$20,000.

486
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,760
<12-8,House>我不买股票了  我买期权
<12-8,House>I'll buy options instead of shares.

487
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,910
<12-8,House>风险更大  不过收益也更多
<12-8,House>More risk, but more upside.

488
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,270
<12-8,House>最低就这个数了
<12-8,House>But that's as low as I'm gonna go.

489
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,020
<12-9,Adams>我能借你五千块
<12-9,Adams>I could do $5,000.

490
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,530
<12-10,House>真的  不准反悔
<12-10,House>Really? No backsies.

491
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,760
<12-11,Adams>如果  你的门诊时间翻倍的话
<12-11,Adams>If...you double your clinic hours.

492
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,870
<12-11,Adams>每周六小时
<12-11,Adams>Six a week.

493
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,680
<12-11,Adams>我见识过你对病人的不尊重
<12-11,Adams>I've seen how you disrespect those patients.

494
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,930
<12-12,House>所以你想要双倍数量的病人不被我尊重
<12-12,House>So you want twice as many of them disrespected?

495
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,400
<12-13,Adams>多花些时间在病人身上
<12-13,Adams>Spend more hours with them,

496
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,600
<12-13,Adams>你会对他们更人性些的
<12-13,Adams>you'll treat them more humanely.

497
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,040
<12-14,House>现在  去俄罗斯打场地面战
<12-14,House>And this time, a land war in Russia

498
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,210
<12-14,House>真是个好主意啊
<12-14,House>will be a good idea.

499
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,010
<12-15,Adams>成交吗
<12-15,Adams>Deal?

500
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,330
<12-16,House>以下是我的愚见
<12-16,House>Here's what I'm thinking.

501
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,830
<12-16,House>你出席了一次假释听证会
<12-16,House>You went to a parole hearing,

502
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,060
<12-16,House>他们拒绝了你以前病人的假释申请
<12-16,House>where one of your old patients was denied.

503
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,530
<12-16,House>这解释了你为什么穿礼服  为什么会迟到
<12-16,House>Hence the attire, hence the tardiness,

504
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,900
<12-16,House>尤其重要的是  为什么发这么大的火
<12-16,House>most importantly hence the anger.

505
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,390
<12-16,House>你认为在这里多做些好事
<12-16,House>You think you can restore the cosmic balance

506
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,840
<12-16,House>可以维持世间的平衡
<12-16,House>by doing extra good here.

507
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,690
<12-16,House>更让人不爽的是  这好事还要由我来做
<12-16,House>More annoyingly, by having me doing it.

508
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,390
<12-15,Adams>成交
<12-15,Adams>And deal.

509
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,360
<12-17,House>你知道  你这么做就是宣战了
<12-17,House>Of course, you know... this means war.

510
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,020
<12-17,House>是的  我知道
<12-17,House>Oh, I know.

511
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,490
<12-18,Ortho doctor>你会让战事升级
<12-18,Ortho doctor>I mean, you'll escalate,

512
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,900
<12-18,Ortho doctor>然后我会报复
<12-18,Ortho doctor>And then I'll retaliate,

513
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,090
<12-18,Ortho doctor>就这么礼尚往来地发展下去
<12-18,Ortho doctor>And the cycle will continue

514
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,780
<12-18,Ortho doctor>直到我们都做出过激行为
<12-18,Ortho doctor>until we've both gone too far,

515
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,690
<12-18,Ortho doctor>到那时  我可能因此停职
<12-18,Ortho doctor>at which point, I'll maybe get suspended.

516
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,020
<12-18,Ortho doctor>至于你  就回监狱去吧
<12-18,Ortho doctor>And you'll go back to prison.

517
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,830
<12-18,Ortho doctor>恶作剧万岁
<12-18,Ortho doctor>Happy pranking.

518
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,110
<13-1,Adams>超声波显示病人有室性心动过速
<13-1,Adams>Patient had v-tach in the echo lab,

519
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,870
<13-1,Adams>所以我们做了检查
<13-1,Adams>so we capped him, but...

520
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,930
<13-1,Adams>但冠状动脉没有堵塞
<13-1,Adams>Coronary Arteries were clean.

521
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,270
<13-2,Park>这好比如果水管没问题的话
<13-2,Park>If the plumbing's fine,

522
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,540
<13-2,Park>就去检查下电路系统
<13-2,Park>check the electrical.

523
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,820
<13-2,Park>做个电生理检查
<13-2,Park>EP study.

524
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,110
<13-3,House>好主意
<13-3,House>Nice idea.

525
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,130
<13-3,House>甚至还用了比喻
<13-3,House>Even has a metaphor in it.

526
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,080
<13-3,House>虽然比不上我的尊严
<13-3,House>Not worth more than my honor.

527
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,550
<13-3,House>但还是挺讨喜的
<13-3,House>But delightful, all the same.

528
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,250
<13-4,Park>我不会输的
<13-4,Park>I'm not going to lose.

529
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,150
<13-4,Park>我大学室友现在是
<13-4,Park>My college roommate is the editor

530
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,920
<13-4,Park>《耶鲁法学观察》的编辑
<13-4,Park>of the Yale Law Review.

531
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,320
<13-4,Park>我的开场白正由她起草
<13-4,Park>She's writing my opening statement.

532
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,420
<13-5,House>你会拥有一个华丽的失败
<13-5,House>You will be eloquent in your loss.

533
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,560
<13-5,House>归根结底就是你和他各执一词
<13-5,House>This case boils down to he said, she said.

534
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,660
<13-5,House>他说  "我在医院干了十五年了"
<13-5,House>He said, "I've been working at this hospital for 15 years.

535
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,660
<13-5,House>"而且我还参加了自我改善的课程"
<13-5,House>"And I'm taking self-improvement classes."

536
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,870
<13-5,House>她说  "我入院工作两个月"
<13-5,House>She said, "I've been a fellow for two months,

537
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,300
<13-5,House>"而且我性情古怪"
<13-5,House>"and I'm kind of weird."

538
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,740
<13-6,Park>不对  他说的是  "我是个喝醉的白痴"
<13-6,Park>No, he said, "I'm a drunk idiot"

539
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,270
<13-6,Park>"以为能随便摸女生的屁股"
<13-6,Park>"who thinks he can grab girls' behinds

540
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,670
<13-6,Park>"而不会被追究责任"
<13-6,Park>"without ramifications."

541
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,110
<13-7,Adams>等等  他当时醉了
<13-7,Adams>Wait, he was drunk?

542
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,970
<13-8,Park>-还待在医院  -我告诉过福曼
<13-8,Park>- In the hospital? - I already told Foreman

543
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,180
<13-8,Park>他那晚喝过酒了
<13-8,Park>he'd been drinking that night.

544
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,310
<13-9,House>安德鲁斯上的是性骚扰课程
<13-9,House>Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes,

545
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,450
<13-9,House>不是戒酒互助会
<13-9,House>not AA.

546
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,400
<13-9,House>意味着他没有因饮酒而受罚
<13-9,House>That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking.

547
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,170
<13-9,House>说明是福曼替他隐瞒了
<13-9,House>Which means that Foreman signed off on it,

548
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,070
<13-9,House>是他操办了这一切
<13-9,House>which means that he set all the wheels in motion.

549
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,920
<13-9,House>算了  我推断得太离谱了
<13-9,House>Forget that. Wild speculation.

550
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,480
<13-9,House>去做电生理检查吧
<13-9,House>Go do the EP study.

551
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,000
<14-1,Park>你早就知道安德鲁斯那晚喝酒了
<14-1,Park>You already knew Andrews was drinking that night,

552
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,140
<14-1,Park>是吧
<14-1,Park>didn't you?

553
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,510
<14-2,Foreman>是的
<14-2,Foreman>Yes.

554
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,940
<14-3,Park>我认为你应该取消我的听证会
<14-3,Park>I think you should cancel my hearing.

555
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,540
<14-4,Foreman>我希望事态不会向我认为的方向发展
<14-4,Foreman>I hope this isn't going where I assume it's going.

556
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,850
<14-5,Park>是你把安德鲁斯牵涉进来的
<14-5,Park>You're the one who brought Andrews in.

557
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,420
<14-5,Park>这一切都是你操办的
<14-5,Park>You set the wheels in motion.

558
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,340
<14-6,Foreman>我们当时有个重危病人
<14-6,Foreman>We had a patient who was going to die

559
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,530
<14-6,Foreman>如果不做脑动静脉畸形栓塞治疗必死无疑
<14-6,Foreman>without an avm embolization.

560
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,050
<14-6,Foreman>安德鲁斯是我唯一能联系到的神经科医师
<14-6,Foreman>Andrews...was the only neurologist I could reach.

561
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
<14-6,Foreman>他告诉我他喝了几杯红酒
<14-6,Foreman>He told me had a few glasses of wine,

562
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,000
<14-6,Foreman>也知道他不该这么做
<14-6,Foreman>and that he shouldn't do it,

563
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,440
<14-6,Foreman>但他还说了  你很优秀
<14-6,Foreman>but he also said that you were good.

564
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,810
<14-6,Foreman>只要有人在旁指导  你已可以做栓塞治疗了
<14-6,Foreman>You were ready to do one, as long as you were supervised.

565
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,230
<14-6,Foreman>所以我们同意让他留下
<14-6,Foreman>So we agreed that he would come in,

566
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,070
<14-6,Foreman>但不能碰病人
<14-6,Foreman>but wouldn't touch the patient.

567
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,430
<14-7,Park>你的想法我可以理解
<14-7,Park>I can understand the rationalization.

568
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
<14-7,Park>那我们就看董事会怎么说
<14-7,Park>We'll see if the board agrees

569
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,140
<14-7,Park>我要在听证会上和盘托出
<14-7,Park>when I tell them the whole story at my hearing.

570
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,930
<14-8,Foreman >我已经说了
<14-8,Foreman >I already did.

571
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,420
<14-8,Foreman >上周我召开了一次内部听证会
<14-8,Foreman >I had a closed session hearing last week.

572
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,300
<14-8,Foreman >董事会决定扣除我两周的薪水
<14-8,Foreman >The board decided to dock me two weeks pay.

573
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,160
<14-10,Foreman>在豪斯手下做了两周
<14-10,Foreman>Been working for House for two weeks.

574
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,530
<14-10,Foreman>已经嫌长了
<14-10,Foreman>It's already too long.

575
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,420
<15-1,Adams>右心房没有任何
<15-1,Adams>No sign of any electrical abnormalities

576
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,900
<15-1,Adams>心电图异常
<15-1,Adams>in the right atrium.

577
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,270
<15-2,Park>我死定了
<15-2,Park>I'm so dead.

578
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,510
<15-2,Park>我觉得豪斯给我下了个套
<15-2,Park>I-I think House set me up.

579
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,610
<15-2,Park>你有没有
<15-2,Park>Have you sent

580
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,650
<15-2,Park>帮我写品行参考书给委员会
<15-2,Park>the committee a character reference for me?

581
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,280
<15-3,Adams>我以为你不喜欢别人帮忙
<15-3,Adams>I thought you don't like favors.

582
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,850
<15-4,Park>我不喜欢礼物  这不算礼物
<15-4,Park>I don't like gifts. It wouldn't be a gift.

583
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,820
<15-4,Park>你也只是说真话而已
<15-4,Park>I would just be you telling the truth.

584
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,820
<15-5,Adams>我都不怎么了解你
<15-5,Adams>I hardly know you.

585
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,160
<15-6,Adams>血氧饱和度89
<15-6,Adams>O2 sat is 89.

586
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,830
<15-6,Adams>我们穿孔了吗  怎么会梗塞的
<15-6,Adams>Did we perforate? Is he tamponading?

587
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,230
<15-7,Park>心率90  颈静脉平坦
<15-7,Park>Heart rate's only 90. Neck veins are flat.

588
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,160
<15-8,Adams>那血氧饱和度怎么会低
<15-8,Adams>Then why isn't he saturated?

589
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,530
<16-1,House>他看着挺健康的
<16-1,House>Seems healthy to me.

590
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,740
<16-1,House>放他出院吧
<16-1,House>Let's release him.

591
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,780
<16-1,House>我手头以34美元卖出巴顿食品股票的期权
<16-1,House>My option to sell Barton Foods at $34

592
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,230
<16-1,House>要到期了
<16-1,House>is about to expire.

593
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,890
<16-1,House>人们以为他已经好转了
<16-1,House>So they thought the patient would be better by now.

594
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,560
<16-1,House>不然  我得损失两万美元
<16-1,House>Instead, I am going to lose $20,000.

595
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,760
<16-2,Adams>两万
<16-2,Adams>20?

596
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,630
<16-3,House>你的五千加上从威尔森那偷的五千
<16-3,House>Your five plus the five I stole from wilson.

597
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,300
<16-3,House>还有一万保证金额度
<16-3,House>Plus the ten I got on margin.

598
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,820
<16-3,House>你得找我的破产律师要钱去了
<16-3,House>You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney.

599
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,670
<16-3,House>除非
<16-3,House>Unless...

600
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,970
<16-3,House>要拿回你的钱  确实有个方法
<16-3,House>There is a way that you can get your money back.

601
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,670
<16-3,House>给我二十万
<16-3,House>Give me the full $200,000.

602
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,340
<16-4,Adams>这样下去
<16-4,Adams>And extrapolating,

603
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,900
<16-4,Adams>明天你大概就要欠一百万了
<16-4,Adams>tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.

604
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
<16-5,House>是你自己惹的祸
<16-5,House>It's your own fault.

605
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,810
<16-5,House>是你逼我选择了期权
<16-5,House>You forced me to go with the options here.

606
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,540
<16-5,House>因为你生气  害我赔了钱
<16-5,House>Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances.

607
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,490
<16-5,House>这次我只买平常的股票  平稳安全
<16-5,House>Regular stock this time, nice and safe.

608
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,890
<16-6,Adams>我没有生气
<16-6,Adams>I'm not angry.

609
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,270
<16-6,Adams>不知道你是不是想要惹我生气
<16-6,Adams>I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.

610
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,610
<16-7,House>你拒绝赌你自己赢
<16-7,House>You refuse to bet on yourself.

611
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,190
<16-7,House>这说明你缺乏自信
<16-7,House>That means low self-esteem.

612
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,990
<16-8,Adams>所以如果我给你二十万
<16-8,Adams>So if I give you $200,000,

613
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
<16-8,Adams>我就会又漂亮又聪明了
<16-8,Adams>I'll feel smart and pretty.

614
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,150
<16-9,House>缺乏自信可能源于
<16-9,House>Low self-esteem can be brought on

615
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,480
<16-9,House>被某个亲戚戳了痛处
<16-9,House>by exposure to one's relatives.

616
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,000
<16-9,House>穿得正式  还生气
<16-9,House>Nice clothes and anger...

617
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,370
<16-9,House>很典型
<16-9,House>Classic symptoms.

618
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,740
<16-9,House>家庭聚会
<16-9,House>Family gathering.

619
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,790
<16-9,House>你那天迟到
<16-9,House>You were late the other day

620
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,990
<16-9,House>是因为你在和
<16-9,House>'cause you were having breakfast

621
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,380
<16-9,House>外婆或是表亲谁谁的一起吃早餐
<16-9,House>with grammy Adams or cousin it.

622
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,900
<16-9,House>她催你快找个人嫁了
<16-9,House>And she was nagging you about finding a husband.

623
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,860
<16-9,House>好吧  你开始有点招人烦了
<16-9,House>All right, this is getting annoying.

624
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,180
<16-10,House>我直接告诉你得了
<16-10,House>I'll just tell you what I was--

625
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
<16-10,House>别剧透
<16-10,House>No spoilers.

626
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,350
<16-10,House>剧透最讨厌了
<16-10,House>They ruin everything.

627
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,370
<16-11,Park >肺科在那边
<16-11,Park >Pulmonology was that way.

628
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,380
<16-12,House>他的肺部问题不是肺的问题
<16-12,House>Our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem.

629
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,560
<16-12,House>是脑部问题
<16-12,House>It's a brain problem.

630
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,720
<16-12,House>我们去神经科咨询咨询
<16-12,House>We're consulting with neurology.

632
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,460
<16-13,Park>那是我前任上司
<16-13,Park>That's my old boss.

633
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,590
<16-13,Park>你根本不觉得这和神经有关
<16-13,Park>You don't actually think this is neurological.

634
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,750
<16-14,House>我不知道这和什么有关
<16-14,House>I don't know what it is.

635
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,470
<16-14,House>也许我应该
<16-14,House>Maybe I should just

636
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,720
<16-14,House>就让病人去死  因为找某些人帮忙
<16-14,House>accept the patient's death, if getting help

637
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,660
<16-14,House>可能会比较尴尬
<16-14,House>can lead to awkwardness.

638
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,600
<16-15,House>安德鲁斯医生
<16-15,House>Dr. Andrews.

639
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,560
<16-15,House>见过我的同事们
<16-15,House>My associates.

640
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,250
<16-15,House>亚当斯医生和朴克医生
<16-15,House>Doctors Adams and Park.

641
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,570
<16-16,Andrews>很高兴见到你  亚当斯医生
<16-16,Andrews>Ah. Nice to meet you, Dr. Adams.

642
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,540
<16-16,Andrews>你好  朴克医生
<16-16,Andrews>Hello, Dr. Park.

643
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,510
<16-24,Andrews>你们俩认识啊
<16-24,Andrews>You two know each other?

644
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,880
<16-25,Park>世界真小
<16-25,Park>It's a small world.

645
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,840
<16-23,Park>朴克医生  能不能请你
<16-23,Park>Dr. Park, maybe you'll like to update

646
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,270
<16-21,Andrews>向我们可敬的同事
<16-21,Andrews>our esteemed colleague

647
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,870
<16-19,Adams>讲讲病人的情况
<16-19,Adams>on the condition of our patient.

648
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,460
<16-17,Park>视物显小症  出血
<16-17,Park>Micropsia, bleeding,

649
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,510
<16-17,Park>心动过速和呼吸困难
<16-17,Park>tachycardia, and difficulty breathing.

650
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,220
<16-18,House >屁股不错吧
<16-18,House >Cute butt, huh?

651
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,470
<16-19,Adams>我们可以走了吗
<16-19,Adams>Can we go now?

652
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,810
<16-20,House>你真的想背对他吗
<16-20,House>You really wanna turn your back on this guy?

653
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,210
<16-20,House>抱歉  继续
<16-20,House>Sorry. Carry on.

654
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,870
<16-21,Andrews>听上去可能是
<16-21,Andrews>It sounds like there could be

655
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,230
<16-21,Andrews>脊髓受累
<16-21,Andrews>spinal cord involvement.

656
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,070
<16-21,Andrews>有没考虑过正常颅压脑积水
<16-21,Andrews>Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?

657
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,920
<16-22,House>好吧  正常颅压脑积水
<16-22,House>Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus

658
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,230
<16-22,House>一次
<16-22,House>going once.

659
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,250
<16-22,House>正常压力脑积水  两次
<16-22,House>Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice...

660
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,150
<16-23,Park>和脊髓无关
<16-23,Park>It's not his spinal cord,

661
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,920
<16-23,Park>是他心脏和大脑的连接问题
<16-23,Park>It's the wiring between his heart and his brain.

662
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,850
<16-23,Park>自主神经功能障碍综合征
<16-23,Park>Autonomic dysregulation syndrome.

663
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,590
<16-23,Park>做直立倾斜试验
<16-23,Park>You do a tilt table test,

664
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,360
<16-23,Park>看他的心率作何反应
<16-23,Park>see how his heart rate responds.

665
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,760
<16-23,Park>就能证实了
<16-23,Park>That'll confirm.

666
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,060
<16-24,Andrews>如果是正常颅压脑积水
<16-24,Andrews>Well, if he has normal pressure hydrocephalus,

667
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,860
<16-24,Andrews>直立倾斜试验可能致使他昏迷
<16-24,Andrews>a tilt table test could put him in a coma.

668
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,200
<16-25,Park>那他最好得的是自主神经功能障碍综合症吧
<16-25,Park>Then it's a good thing he has A.D.S.

669
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,900
<16-26,House>你真相信自己的诊断吗
<16-26,House>Do you really believe in this diagnosis?

670
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,800
<16-26,House>因为如果这只是个斗气比赛
<16-26,House>Because if this is just a pissing contest,

671
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,500
<16-26,House>那说明你有严重的生理结构缺陷
<16-26,House>you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.

672
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,440
<16-27,Park>是自主神经功能障碍综合症
<16-27,Park>It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.

673
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,380
<16-28,House>不  是正常颅压脑积水
<16-28,House>No...it's normal pressure hydrocephalus.

674
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,180
<16-28,House>做脊髓液检测
<16-28,House>Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.

675
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,970
<17-1,Park>我们要做直立倾斜试验
<17-1,Park>We're doing the tilt table.

676
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,270
<17-2,Adams>真有道理
<17-2,Adams>That makes sense.

677
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,270
<17-2,Adams>比起福曼你更想被豪斯解雇是吗
<17-2,Adams>You'd rather have House fire you than Foreman?

678
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,440
<17-3,Park>这场赌局是个测试
<17-3,Park>This bet's got to be a test.

679
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,920
<17-3,Park>测试我是否有能力和他一起工作
<17-3,Park>See if I can handle working with him.

680
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,960
<17-3,Park>我必须证明我有自信
<17-3,Park>I need to prove I have the confidence

681
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,180
<17-3,Park>来违抗他
<17-3,Park>to disobey him.

682
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
<17-4,Adams>对于你的诊断  你有没有任何
<17-4,Adams>Do you have any medical justification

683
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,060
<17-4,Adams>医学上的理由
<17-4,Adams>for your diagnosis?

684
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,330
<17-5,Park>症状相符  而且安德鲁斯就是个草包
<17-5,Park>The symptoms fit, and Andrews is a hack.

685
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,900
<17-5,Park>你觉得呢
<17-5,Park>Do you think I'm right?

686
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,780
<17-5,Park>走吧
<17-5,Park>Let's go.

687
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,530
<17-6,Adams>不  你得准备听证会
<17-6,Adams>No...you need to go prepare for your hearing.

688
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,570
<18-1,Adams>还有15分钟  巴顿先生
<18-1,Adams>15 more minutes, Mr. Barton.

689
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
<18-2,Foreman>一个激光换肤器不见了
<18-2,Foreman>A skin resurfacing laser is missing.

690
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,090
<18-3,Adams>为什么来问我
<18-3,Adams>And why are you asking me about it?

691
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,630
<18-4,Foreman>因为你替豪斯做事
<18-4,Foreman>Because you work for House.

692
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
<18-5,Adams>豪斯要激光换肤器干什么
<18-5,Adams>What would House want with a skin resurfacing laser?

693
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,400
<18-6,Foreman>我怎么知道  你见过吗
<18-6,Foreman>I have no idea. Have you seen it?

694
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,040
<18-7,Barton>我的脚感觉很热
<18-7,Barton>My feet feel hot.

695
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,870
<18-8,Adams>那完全正常
<18-8,Adams>That's completely normal.

696
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,940
<18-8,Adams>不  但豪斯一直提到
<18-8,Adams>No, but House has been talking about

697
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,910
<18-8,Adams>他有多想把在监狱时的纹身洗掉
<18-8,Adams>how badly he wants to remove those prison tats.

698
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,510
<18-9,Foreman>那机器很贵
<18-9,Foreman>It's a very expensive machine,

699
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,010
<18-9,Foreman>我希望能找回来
<18-9,Foreman>and I'd like it back.

700
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,550
<18-9,Foreman>有什么消息麻烦告诉我
<18-9,Foreman>Please tell me if you hear anything.

701
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,650
<18-10,Adams>有多贵
<18-10,Adams>How expensive?

702
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,250
<18-11,Foreman>二十万
<18-11,Foreman>$200,000.

703
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,760
<18-11,Foreman>就是他拿的
<18-11,Foreman>He took it.

704
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,560
<18-12,Adams>我不知道
<18-12,Adams>I have no idea.

705
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,530
<18-13,Foreman>朴克的听证会要开始了
<18-13,Foreman>Park's hearing's about to start.

706
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,080
<18-14,Adams>你在为他掩饰
<18-14,Adams>You're covering for him.

707
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,060
<18-14,Adams>我以前经常这样
<18-14,Adams>I did the same thing many times.

708
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,000
<18-14,Adams>我的建议  设好
<18-14,Adams>My advice to you-- figure out what line

709
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,600
<18-14,Adams>你能为他所逾越的底线
<18-14,Adams>you aren't willing to cross for him.

710
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,200
<18-14,Adams>因为他最终还是会让你跨越它
<18-14,Adams>Because, eventually, he'll ask you to cross it.

711
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,980
<18-15,Adams>你的脚怎样了
<18-15,Adams>How are your feet?

712
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,980
<18-15,Adams>巴顿先生
<18-15,Adams>Mr. Barton?

713
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,660
<18-15,Adams>能听到我说话吗  巴顿先生
<18-15,Adams>Can you hear me, Mr. Barton?

714
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,990
<18-15,Adams>不
<18-15,Adams>Oh, no.

715
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,740
<19-1,Foreman>此次召集纪律委员会开庭
<19-1,Foreman>We have convened the disciplinary committee

716
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,980
<19-1,Foreman>是为了裁定朴克智医生
<19-1,Foreman>to decide the appropriate action that should be taken

717
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
<19-1,Foreman>于今年十月七日
<19-1,Foreman>against Dr. Chi Park as a result of her actions

718
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,520
<19-1,Foreman>所采取的行为是否适当
<19-1,Foreman>on October 7th of this year.

719
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,720
<19-1,Foreman>朴克医生  你是否打算进行开庭陈述
<19-1,Foreman>Dr. Park, do you have an opening statement.

720
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,920
<19-2,Park>福曼医生  各位委员会委员
<19-2,Park>Dr. Foreman, members of the committee,

721
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,840
<19-2,Park>感谢你们给我这次机会
<19-2,Park>thank you for giving me this opportunity

722
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,710
<19-2,Park>与你们进行交流  我...
<19-2,Park>to speak to you today, I...

723
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,380
<19-2,Park>好消息
<19-2,Park>Good news.

724
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,510
<19-2,Park>你们可以取消听证会了
<19-2,Park>You can cancel the hearing.

725
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,610
<19-3,Foreman>因为我要亲自开除她
<19-3,Foreman>'cause I'm firing her myself.

726
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,950
<19-3,Foreman>她不是你能开除的
<19-3,Foreman>She's not yours to fire.

727
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,980
<19-4,House>你们最好以唯命不从的理由把她开除
<19-4,House>You guys better fire her for insubordination,

728
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,870
<19-4,House>因为她的捣乱  我的病人陷入了昏迷
<19-4,House>'cause she went rogue, and my patient is now in a coma.

729
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,840
<19-5,Adams>我才是做测试的人
<19-5,Adams>I'm the one who did the test.

730
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,190
<19-6,Park>不  那是我的主意
<19-6,Park>No, it was my idea!

731
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,290
<19-7,Foreman>你搞什么  豪斯
<19-7,Foreman>Seriously, House?

732
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,320
<19-8,House>至少我有自知之明
<19-8,House>At least I'm smart enough

733
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,470
<19-8,House>不会不懂装懂
<19-8,House>to know what I don't know.

734
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,190
<19-8,House>她反抗我到过火了
<19-8,House>She went out of her way to defy me!

735
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,860
<19-8,House>她应该  该死  就应该直接开除她
<19-8,House>She needs--damn it, you should just fire her!

736
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,500
<19-9,Foreman>很抱歉
<19-9,Foreman>My apologies.

737
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,230
<19-9,Foreman>很抱歉  朴克医生
<19-9,Foreman>My apologies, Dr. Park.

738
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,540
<19-9,Foreman>豪斯医生的意见
<19-9,Foreman>Dr. House's comments

739
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
<19-9,Foreman>当然不会在此次听证会上
<19-9,Foreman>will, of course, have no bearing

740
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,670
<19-9,Foreman>被采纳
<19-9,Foreman>on this hearing.

741
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,460
<19-9,Foreman>请继续
<19-9,Foreman>Please continue.

742
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,800
<19-9,Foreman>我...
<19-9,Foreman>I, uh...

743
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,200
<20-1,Adams>我不敢相信你真这么做了
<20-1,Adams>I can't believe you did that.

744
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,420
<20-2,House>彼此彼此
<20-2,House>Right back at ya.

745
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,100
<20-2,House>我们的病人正在死去  我们需要些想法
<20-2,House>Our patient's dying. We need theories.

746
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,190
<20-3,Adams>应该是正常颅压脑积水
<20-3,Adams>It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus.

747
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,040
<20-3,Adams>安德鲁斯预测到了昏迷
<20-3,Adams>Andrews predicted the coma.

748
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,440
<20-4,House>没错  但再傻的医生也有蒙对的时候
<20-4,House>Yeah, but even a broken doctor's right twice a day.

749
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,900
<20-4,House>病人没有出汗  发抖或行为古怪
<20-4,House>Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky.

750
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,110
<20-4,House>昏迷只是碰运气猜中的
<20-4,House>Coma had to be a lucky guess.

751
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,790
<20-5,Adams>如果你认为他是错的
<20-5,Adams>If you didn't think he was right,

752
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,890
<20-5,Adams>为什么还让我们去采集脊髓液呢
<20-5,Adams>then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?

753
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,560
<20-6,House>我没有  我想让你们去做直立倾斜实验
<20-6,House>I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.

754
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,360
<20-7,Adams>你的沟通方式真是太绝了
<20-7,Adams>You have a wonderful way of communicating.

755
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,330
<20-8,House>我知道朴克想进行直立倾斜测验
<20-8,House>I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.

756
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,800
<20-8,House>如果她听了我的  我就是浪费了一小时
<20-8,House>She listens to me, I waste an hour.

757
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,420
<20-8,House>如果她违反我的命令
<20-8,House>If she defies me...

758
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,820
<20-8,House>我不仅得到了测试结果还赚了一百块
<20-8,House>Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks.

759
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,320
<20-8,House>爽死了
<20-8,House>Up high.

760
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,160
<20-8,House>你真是个混蛋
<20-8,House>You're an ass.

761
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,130
<20-9,House>你生气了
<20-9,House>You're angry.

762
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,230
<20-10,Adams>没错  现在我是生气了
<20-10,Adams>Yes! Now I'm angry.

763
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,750
<20-10,Adams>我们就去做正常颅压脑积水的测试吧
<20-10,Adams>Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.

764
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,350
<20-10,Adams>不
<20-10,Adams>No.

765
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,540
<20-11,House>还有什么可以解释这些症状
<20-11,House>What else would explain our symptoms

766
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,340
<20-11,House>并且让病人在测试过程中陷入昏迷的呢
<20-11,House>and make our patient go into a coma during that test?

767
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,970
<20-11,House>肝性脑病可能吗
<20-11,House>How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?

768
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,170
<20-12,Adams>不会  我们已经测过肝酶了
<20-12,Adams>No, we already tested his liver enzymes.

769
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,280
<20-12,Adams>指标正常
<20-12,Adams>They're normal.

770
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,040
<20-13,House>或是他的肝脏已经
<20-13,House>Or his liver's so far gone

771
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,940
<20-13,House>没办法产生酶了
<20-13,House>it can't even produce enzymes.

772
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,350
<20-14,Adams>这想法太离谱了
<20-14,Adams>That's desperate.

773
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,860
<20-14,Adams>与症状相符
<20-14,Adams>Fits the symptoms.

774
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,900
<20-14,Adams>安德鲁斯就是个草包
<20-14,Adams>And Andrews is a hack.

775
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,770
<20-14,Adams>进行穿刺活检确认
<20-14,Adams>Go biopsy to confirm.

776
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,430
<20-14,Adams>除非你也想开个听证会
<20-14,Adams>Unless you want your own hearing.

777
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,360
<20-15,Adams>那你得先雇我
<20-15,Adams>You'd have to hire me first.

778
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,270
<20-15,Adams>威廉斯护士请到社会服务科
<20-15,Adams>Nurse Williams to social services.

779
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,440
<20-15,Adams>威廉斯护士请到社会服务科
<20-15,Adams>Nurse Williams to social services.

780
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,140
<21-1,Foreman>你现在充分认识到
<21-1,Foreman>So you do realize

781
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,210
<21-1,Foreman>在工作场所打人
<21-1,Foreman>that it is unacceptable to hit someone

782
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,300
<21-1,Foreman>是不应该的了吗
<21-1,Foreman>in the workplace?

783
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,000
<18-1,Adams>是的  完全不应该
<18-1,Adams>Yes, completely unacceptable.

784
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,240
<18-2,Foreman>我当时没动脑子
<18-2,Foreman>I wasn't thinking.

785
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,470
<18-3,Adams>我猜  我的意思是  理论上讲
<18-3,Adams>I guess, I mean-- yes, technically,

786
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,810
<18-4,Foreman>我一直在思考
<18-4,Foreman>I was thinking.

787
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,680
<18-5,Adams>我只是...一切发生得太快了
<18-5,Adams>I just...it happened so fast,

788
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,400
<18-6,Foreman>我
<18-6,Foreman>I did--I--

789
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,840
<18-7,Barton>我...
<18-7,Barton>I...

790
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,980
<18-8,Adams>当时就好像...
<18-8,Adams>It's like...

791
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,480
<18-9,Foreman>就好像我不是我了
<18-9,Foreman>It's like it wasn't even me.

792
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,850
<15-4,Park>我绝不会做那种事的
<15-4,Park>I would never do something like that.

793
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,620
<16-3,House>虽然我那么做了
<16-3,House>Even though I did.

794
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,590
<16-4,Adams>对不起  我现在有点语无伦次了
<16-4,Adams>I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense right now.

795
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,390
<16-5,House>我...
<16-5,House>I, um...

796
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,200
<16-6,Adams>我不知道  我...
<16-6,Adams>I don't know, I...

797
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,830
<16-6,Adams>我真的很喜欢当医生
<16-6,Adams>Just really love being a doctor so much.

798
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,840
<16-6,Adams>我连一百块钱都没有...
<16-6,Adams>And I barely even have $100 and...

799
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,070
<16-6,Adams>请不要开除我
<16-6,Adams>please don't fire me.

800
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,730
<16-6,Adams>这理论比其它的可能性更大吗
<16-6,Adams>Is this theory more promising than the others?

801
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,440
<16-6,Adams>几小时内我们就能知道了
<16-6,Adams>We'll know in a few hours.

802
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,540
<16-6,Adams>你还撑得住吗
<16-6,Adams>How are you holding up?

803
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,140
<16-6,Adams>除了我爸还在昏迷以外...
<16-6,Adams>Other than the fact that my dad's in a coma...

804
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,280
<16-6,Adams>糟透了
<16-6,Adams>terrible.

805
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,950
<16-6,Adams>明天早上  我应该签署
<16-6,Adams>Tomorrow morning, I am supposed to sign

806
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,980
<22-1,Ainsley>一份文件  那会...
<22-1,Ainsley>a piece of paper that will...

807
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,320
<22-2,Adams>将公司转移
<22-2,Adams>move the company

808
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,420
<22-3,Ainsley>并断送数千员工的工作
<22-3,Ainsley>and cost thousands of employees their jobs.

809
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,290
<22-4,Adams>我以为你会希望看到公司
<22-4,Adams>I thought you'd rather see the company

810
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,190
<22-4,Adams>搬去新泽西而不是中国
<22-4,Adams>go under in New Jersey than thrive in China.

811
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,690
<22-5,Ainsley>那是我爸的愿望
<22-5,Ainsley>It's what my dad wants.

812
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,050
<22-5,Ainsley>公司还是他的
<22-5,Ainsley>And it's still his company.

813
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,030
<22-5,Ainsley>我只是在让公司保持运转
<22-5,Ainsley>I'm really just keeping the seat warm.

814
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,530
<22-5,Ainsley>如果他不能在明早前醒来
<22-5,Ainsley>But unless he wakes up before tomorrow,

815
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,870
<22-5,Ainsley>那份文件上就会是我的签名了
<22-5,Ainsley>it's gonna be my signature on that piece of paper.

816
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,130
<22-6,Adams>你不必签字的
<22-6,Adams>You don't have to sign it.

817
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,400
<22-6,Adams>一有结果我第一时间通知你
<22-6,Adams>I'll let you know when we have the results.

818
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,980
<23-1,Adams>活检结果正常  不是肝脏问题
<23-1,Adams>Biopsy was clean. It's not his liver.

819
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,800
<23-1,Adams>我还做了脊髓液检测
<23-1,Adams>I also ran the spinal fluid test,

820
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,520
<23-1,Adams>你是对的  安德鲁斯确实错了
<23-1,Adams>and you were right that Andrews was wrong.

821
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,890
<23-1,Adams>他的颅内压不正常  指标偏高
<23-1,Adams>His ICP was not normal. It was elevated.

822
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,980
<23-1,Adams>会不会是人体T细胞白血病病毒
<23-1,Adams>What about HTLV?

823
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,880
<23-2,House>早在三天前就被排除了
<23-2,House>We ruled that out three days ago.

824
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,050
<23-3,Adams>因为他的心脏问题  但是
<23-3,Adams>Because of his heart problems, but--

825
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,650
<23-4,House>一旦某些理论被否定了
<23-4,House>Once something gets taken off the board,

826
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,400
<23-4,House>我是唯一能将它们重新列入考虑范围的人
<23-4,House>I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.

827
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,580
<23-5,Park >你欠我106804韩元
<23-5,Park >You owe me 106,804 won.

828
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,980
<23-5,Park >或者是100美元
<23-5,Park >or $100 U.S.

829
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,480
<23-6,House>上帝啊  你真小心眼
<23-6,House>God, but you're petty.

830
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,820
<23-6,House>两个选项
<23-6,House>Okay, so...two options.

831
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,090
<23-6,House>要么查出这家伙的病因
<23-6,House>Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy,

832
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,820
<23-6,House>要么设法让他的公司在新泽西州
<23-6,House>or we figure out how to make this company profitable

833
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,420
<23-6,House>也能营利
<23-6,House>in New Jersey.

834
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,790
<23-7,Adams>东部马脑炎
<23-7,Adams>Eastern Equine Encephalitis?

835
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,030
<23-7,Adams>我们在思考问题
<23-7,Adams>Thinking in here!

836
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,900
<23-8,Park>脑部扫描显示
<23-8,Park>Brain scans indicate

837
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,730
<23-8,Park>有可能是罗阿罗阿丝虫病
<23-8,Park>it could be Loa Loa Disease.

838
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,900
<23-9,House>给我关掉
<23-9,House>Ah, shut it off!

839
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,110
<23-10,House>显然现在打人也没事了
<23-10,House>Apparently we're allowed to do this now.

840
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,090
<23-11,Ortho doctor>豪斯  出去
<23-11,Ortho doctor>Get out of here, House!

841
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,530
<23-11,Ortho doctor>给病人做血浆置换
<23-11,Ortho doctor>Start the patient on plasmapheresis.

842
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,340
<23-11,Ortho doctor>一小时后他就会醒过来
<23-11,Ortho doctor>He'll wake up in an hour.

843
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,090
<23-11,Ortho doctor>有你做邻居真开心
<23-11,Ortho doctor>It's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.

844
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,920
<24-1,House>本诊断的灵感来自字母Y
<24-1,House>This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter "Y."

845
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,920
<24-1,House>爸
<24-1,House>Dad...

846
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,330
<24-2,Ainsley>上帝  你没事了
<24-2,Ainsley>God, you're okay.

847
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,530
<24-3,Barton>我口渴
<24-3,Barton>I'm thirsty.

848
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,800
<24-4,House>活着就是比死了麻烦
<24-4,House>That's a side effect of not dying.

849
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,840
<24-4,House>发现是你的血液粘稠  血糖高
<24-4,House>Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy.

850
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,210
<24-4,House>Y字型抗体聚集成团
<24-4,House>Complexes of large, Y-shaped antibodies

851
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,790
<24-4,House>阻塞了血管
<24-4,House>were clogging up your blood vessels,

852
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,240
<24-4,House>引起你全身器官接连衰竭
<24-4,House>causing your organs to shut down one by one.

853
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,910
<24-4,House>通常来说  高粘滞血症的成因是

00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,340
<24-14,Wilson>我跟你赌是为了让你

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,680
<24-14,Wilson>不要极力炒掉朴克
<24-14,Wilson>actively trying to fire Park

891
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,080
<24-14,Wilson>至少保持中立
<24-14,Wilson>so you'd be neutral.

892
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,550
<24-14,Wilson>而你破例费心帮她
<24-14,Wilson>You went out of your way to help her.

893
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,820
<24-14,Wilson>她明显已经赢得了你的尊重
<24-14,Wilson>She obviously earned your respect,

894
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,220
<24-14,Wilson>通过了你的什么测试...
<24-14,Wilson>passed whatever test you...

895
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
<24-15,House>我去了她的听证会上捣乱
<24-15,House>I sabotaged her hearing.

896

<24-15,House>校报你还看的吧
<24-15,House>You do read the school paper, don't you?

897
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,990
<24-16,Wilson >如果你真是去破坏她听证会的
<24-16,Wilson >If you had sabotaged her hearing,

898
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,320
<24-16,Wilson >她就不会仅仅被小施惩戒了
<24-16,Wilson >she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist.

899
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,630
<24-16,Wilson >你行动的实际效果是让她情绪激动
<24-16,Wilson >What you actually did was make her emotional

900
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,430
<24-16,Wilson >让董事会成员视她为受害者
<24-16,Wilson >and make the board members see her as a victim.

901
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,960
<24-17,House>因为董事会不喜欢
<24-17,House>'cause the panel feels badly

902
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,420
<24-17,House>险些害死病人的无能医生

903
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,270
<24-18,Wilson>你知道董事会的人都恨你
<24-18,Wilson>You know that everyone on that panel hates you.

904
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,400
<24-18,Wilson>你提出要解雇某人
<24-18,Wilson>You know the minute you recommend firing anyone,

905
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,270
<24-18,Wilson>他们立刻开始研究要给那人多少奖金
<24-18,Wilson>they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.

906
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,010
<24-19,House>这话真伤人
<24-19,House>That's just hurtful.

908
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
<24-19,House>给我带来的欢乐
<24-19,House>gives me more pleasure

909
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,700
<24-19,House>远胜过从她那里赢一百美元
<24-19,House>than winning $100 from her.

910
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,620
<24-19,House>这是你的五千
