<12-8,Taub >Or portable gas heater,

261
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,650
<12-8,Taub >那会产生一氧化碳
<12-8,Taub >which emits carbon monoxide.

262
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,490
<12-9,Foreman >从而导致血管舒张
<12-9,Foreman >Which is a vasodilator.

263
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,370
<12-9,Foreman >暴露在低浓度的一氧化碳中实际上
<12-9,Foreman >The low-grade exposure was actually improving

264
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,460
<12-9,Foreman >增加了他的肺活量
<12-9,Foreman >his lung capacity.

265
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,690
<12-9,Foreman >我们把他带到这来  他的情况就恶化了
<12-9,Foreman >We bring him here, he gets worse.

266
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,180
<12-9,Foreman >如果我们是对的  就不需要豪斯了
<12-9,Foreman >If we're right, don't need House,

267
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,460
<12-9,Foreman >并且还能放两天假
<12-9,Foreman >and we still get two days off.

268
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,610
<12-10,Chase >我们还是得证明这点
<12-10,Chase >We still have to prove it.

269
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,580
<12-10,Chase >有人得回到他的住所检查一氧化碳浓度
<12-10,Chase >Someone's got to go back into that place and test for C.O.

270
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,050
<12-11,Masters >我可以跟奇斯去
<12-11,Masters >Chase and I can go.

271
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,710
<12-11,Masters >只有这样才公平
<12-11,Masters >It's only fair.

272
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,500
<12-12,Taub >公平最重要
<12-12,Taub >Fairness is important.

273
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,680
<13-1,Thirteen >你异常安静
<13-1,Thirteen >You're awfully quiet.

274
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,450
<13-2,House >不好意思  我呆在杀人犯旁边
<13-2,House >Sorry. That's just how I get around people

275
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,100
<13-2,House >一般就会这样
<13-2,House >who have recently killed a man.

276
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,370
<13-2,House >事情不是
<13-2,House >It wasn't...

277
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,210
<13-3,Thirteen >这一年我过得很辛苦
<13-3,Thirteen >You know, I've had a pretty rough year.

278
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,350
<13-3,Thirteen >你觉得我们能不能
<13-3,Thirteen >Do you think maybe we could just

279
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,260
<13-3,Thirteen >把这事先放一放
<13-3,Thirteen >give this whole thing a rest?

280
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,940
<13-3,Thirteen >你杀了人
<13-3,Thirteen >You killed a man.

281
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,110
<13-4,House >但你以滥开处方为由辩护
<13-4,House >But you pled out to drugs.

282
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,220
<13-4,House >在嗑药的情况下肇事逃逸
<13-4,House >Hit-and-run under the influence.

283
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,730
<13-4,House >刚才被你踢中要害的人
<13-4,House >Guy you kneed in the groin

284
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,570
<13-4,House >就是你当时的约会对象
<13-4,House >was your date

285
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,690
<13-4,House >他向警察举报了你
<13-4,House >who dropped a dime on you.

286
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,260
<13-5,Thirteen >我请求你别问了
<13-5,Thirteen >I'm asking you to let it go.

287
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,990
<13-5,Thirteen >我也希望我是不喜欢
<13-5,Thirteen >And I really wish I was the kind of person

288
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,560
<13-5,Thirteen >刨根问底的那种人
<13-5,Thirteen >who could do that.

289
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,120
<14-1,Foreman >露比  对吧
<14-1,Foreman >Ruby, right?

290
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,200
<14-2,Ruby >没错
<14-2,Ruby >Yeah.

291
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,060
<14-3,Foreman >你觉得这医院怎么样
<14-3,Foreman >Hey, how are you liking PPTH?

292
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,010
<14-4,Ruby >很好  每个人都很友好
<14-4,Ruby >It's great. Everyone's so friendly.

293
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,410
<14-5,Foreman >没错  尤其是陶博医生
<14-5,Foreman >Yeah. Especially Dr. Taub.

294
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,580
<14-5,Foreman >别担心
<14-5,Foreman >Don't worry.

295
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,710
<14-5,Foreman >我不是想让你难堪
<14-5,Foreman >I'm not gonna bust your chops.

296
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,650
<14-5,Foreman >我只是想知道一件事
<14-5,Foreman >I just want to know one thing.

297
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,900
<14-5,Foreman >他是怎么成功把你约出去的
<14-5,Foreman >How did he get you to go out with him?

298
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,950
<14-5,Foreman >怎么了  是不是有什么
<14-5,Foreman >Why? Is--is there something--

299
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,360
<14-6,Foreman >不不  他  他人很好
<14-6,Foreman >No, no, no, no, he's--he's great.

300
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,200
<14-6,Foreman >我只是随便问问
<14-6,Foreman >I'm--you know, I'm just asking

301
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,970
<14-6,Foreman >因为...
<14-6,Foreman >because...

302
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,170
<14-6,Foreman >他...
<14-6,Foreman >Well, he's...

303
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,900
<14-7,Foreman >算了
<14-7,Foreman >You know what, never mind.

304
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,970
<14-7,Foreman >与我无关
<14-7,Foreman >It's none of my business.

305
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,470
<14-7,Foreman >祝你们今晚玩的开心
<14-7,Foreman >You guys have fun tonight.

306
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,820
<14-8,Ruby >我今晚不和他出去
<14-8,Ruby >I'm not seeing him tonight.

307
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,040
<14-8,Ruby >本来要的  但他变卦了
<14-8,Ruby >We had plans, but he canceled.

308
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,370
<15-1,Thirteen >这东西没有燃油阀
<15-1,Thirteen >This thing's got no fuel valve.

309
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,050
<15-1,Thirteen >就是说没办法控制进油量
<15-1,Thirteen >Means you can't regulate the input.

310
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,820
<15-1,Thirteen >这是什么  烧烤点火器吗
<15-1,Thirteen >And what is this? A barbecue lighter?

311
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,640
<15-1,Thirteen >你的枪太逊了
<15-1,Thirteen >Your gun sucks.

312
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,820
<15-1,Thirteen >我们应该把这当作一次考古挖掘
<15-1,Thirteen >We should treat this like an archaeological dig.

313
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,760
<15-1,Thirteen >分好区域  挖掘  记录  分析
<15-1,Thirteen >Grid the site, excavate, catalog, analyze.

314
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,570
<16-1,Chase >你喜欢这里
<16-1,Chase >You like it here.

315
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,510
<16-2,Masters >你不觉得这很吸引人吗
<16-2,Masters >You don't think this is fascinating?

316
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,850
<16-3,Chase >你认为这里吸引人的想法
<16-3,Chase >Not nearly as fascinating as the fact

317
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,950
<16-3,Chase >更加吸引人
<16-3,Chase >that you think it's fascinating.

318
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,250
<16-4,Masters >但这人保留了所有
<16-4,Masters >But this guy kept everything

319
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,050
<16-4,Masters >他曾经接触过的东西
<16-4,Masters >he ever came into contact with.

320
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
<16-4,Masters >一部活的生活史
<16-4,Masters >An interactive life history.

321
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,770
<16-5,Chase >只是一堆乱扔的垃圾而已
<16-5,Chase >It's an indiscriminate pile of rubbish.

322
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,970
<16-6,Masters >大部分时候
<16-6,Masters >Well, for the most part,

323
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,080
<16-6,Masters >我们的生活也是如此
<16-6,Masters >so are our lives.

324
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,640
<12-8,Taub >没有检测到一氧化碳
<12-8,Taub >There's no carbon monoxide.

325
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,130
<16-4,Masters >否定了福曼的毒物暴露假设
<16-4,Masters >A bit of a blow to Foreman's exposure hypothesis

326
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,730
<16-5,Chase >也否定了我想赶快离开的计划
<16-5,Chase >and my plan to get out of here quickly.

327
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,840
<16-6,Masters >或许我们不该只琢磨什么导致了他的症状
<16-6,Masters >Maybe we don't just figure out the what,

328
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,980
<16-7,Masters >也弄明白为什么
<16-7,Masters >we figure out the why.

329
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,390
<16-7,Masters >或许就可以
<16-7,Masters >Then maybe...

330
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,290
<16-7,Masters >从尺寸和未消化的种子推断
<16-7,Masters >From the size and the undigested seeds,

331
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,240
<16-8,Masters >我估计这是浣熊排泄的
<16-8,Masters >I'm guessing this came from a raccoon.

332
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,200
<16-8,Masters >如果你觉得是寇热
<16-8,Masters >If you're thinking Q fever,

333
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,570
<16-8,Masters >症状是符合的
<16-8,Masters >it fits.

334
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,670
<16-9,Chase >那为什么我们还在找啊
<16-9,Chase >So why are you still looking?

335
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,020
<16-10,Masters >你只找出了一种可能
<16-10,Masters >Well, you only found one thing.

336
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,270
<16-11,Chase >它完全符合啊
<16-11,Chase >It fits perfectly.

337
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,210
<16-12,Masters >没错  但这不意味着
<16-12,Masters >Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

338
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,390
<16-12,Masters >奇斯
<16-12,Masters >Chase.

339
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,230
<17-1,Chase >你们在他家查漏了点东西
<17-1,Chase >You missed something at his place.

340
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,350
<17-1,Chase >他妻子
<17-1,Chase >His wife.

341
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,180
<17-2,Brian >妮娜
<17-2,Brian >Nina.

342
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,470
<17-3,Nina >我不知道你去哪里了
<17-3,Nina >I didn't know where you were.

343
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,290
<17-4,Brian >对不起  我没法回家
<17-4,Brian >I'm so sorry. I couldn't get home.

344
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,100
<17-4,Brian >你还好吗
<17-4,Brian >You okay?

345
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,130
<17-5,Chase >我们认为你们都感染了寇热
<17-5,Chase >We think you both have Q fever.

346
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,120
<17-5,Chase >在厨房的碗橱里发现了浣熊的粪渣
<17-5,Chase >Found raccoon feces in the kitchen cupboard.

347
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,550
<17-5,Chase >我们会开始用多西环素治疗你
<17-5,Chase >We're gonna start you on doxycycline.

348
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,430
<17-6,Taub >你为什么不告诉我们你结婚了
<17-6,Taub >Why wouldn't you tell us you're married?

349
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,660
<17-7,Brian >越少人知道她
<17-7,Brian >The fewer people who know about her,

350
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,560
<17-7,Brian >事情就会越容易
<17-7,Brian >the easier it is.

351
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,570
<17-8,Nina >我什么时候能回家
<17-8,Nina >When can I go back?

352
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,570
<17-9,Brian >当她离开她的收藏物时她就会变得焦虑
<17-9,Brian >She gets anxious when she's away from her things.

353
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,390
<17-10,Masters >她才是那个囤积者  他只是住在那里
<17-10,Masters >She's the hoarder. He just lives there.

354
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,360
<17-11,Taub >是自愿的吗
<17-11,Taub >On purpose?

355
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,610
<17-12,Brian >她是我的妻子
<17-12,Brian >She's my wife.

356
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,240
<18-2,House >他们怎么能没有半英寸钻头呢
<18-2,House >How do they not have 1/2-inch drill bits?

357
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,500
<18-1,House >顺便说一句  哈罗德可能会和你调情
<18-1,House >By the way, Harold's probably gonna hit on you.

358
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,660
<18-1,House >所有我的东西  他都想要
<18-1,House >Everything I have, he wants.

359
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,060
<18-1,House >只要干脆地拒绝他就行了
<18-1,House >Just turn him down flat.

360
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,790
<18-1,House >-除非  -是啊
<18-1,House >- Unless... - Yes.

361
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,840
<18-2,House >咱别买东西了
<18-2,House >Let's stop shopping.

362
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,050
<18-2,House >我去把他上了然后让他退赛就好了
<18-2,House >I'll just do him and get him to throw the contest.

363
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,010
<18-2,House >我没想...
<18-2,House >I'm not sugges...

364
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,520
<18-2,House >你会这么做吗
<18-2,House >Would you do that?

365
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,150
<18-5,House >这个比赛是怎么评分的呢
<18-5,House >How's this thing judged?

366
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,420
<18-6,Thirteen >腾空时间  射程和准确度
<18-6,Thirteen >Hang time, distance, and accuracy.

367
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,460
<18-3,House >这个怎么样
<18-3,House >Okay, how about this?

368
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,510
<18-3,House >你在酒吧里遇到一个男人
<18-3,House >You met a guy in a club,

369
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,450
<18-3,House >你把他带回家  他嗑药过度死了
<18-3,House >you brought him home, he O.D.'d,

370
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,370
<18-3,House >而那个在家门口疼得打滚的男的
<18-3,House >so the guy now writhing on his front porch

371
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,920
<18-3,House >就是卖给你次品的毒贩子
<18-3,House >was the dealer who sold you the faulty goods.

372
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,040
<18-4,Thirteen >-每一项占的分都一样吗  -没错
<18-4,Thirteen >- Categories weighted the same? - Yup.

373
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,760
<18-5,House >别管准确度了  我们加倍射程
<18-5,House >Screw accuracy. We're gonna double distance

374
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,740
<18-6,Thirteen >和腾空时间  在总分上击败哈罗德
<18-6,Thirteen >and hang time, beat Harold on points.

375
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,970
<18-6,Thirteen >我们需要点强劲的力量
<18-6,Thirteen >We need raw power.

376
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,900
<18-6,Thirteen >肥料在哪里
<18-6,Thirteen >Where's the fertilizer?

377
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,530
<18-7,House >不择手段啊  凯辛斯基

436
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,140
<22-5,Thirteen >给你个提示
<22-5,Thirteen >Well, here's a hint.

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,790
<22-5,Thirteen >我其实很讨厌吃大黄

443
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,580
<22-6,House >对我从来都不适用
<22-6,House >Yeah, that line never works for me either.

444
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,840
<22-6,House >那句话对你一直是适用的
<22-6,House >That line always works for you.

445
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,600
<22-7,House >你到底做什么了
<22-7,House >So what did you do?

446
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,190
<22-8,Thirteen >就不再猜了吗
<22-8,Thirteen >No more guessing?

447
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,800
<22-8,Thirteen >我得搞清楚

<22-8,Thirteen >我可以打几个电话
<22-8,Thirteen >I can make some phone calls,

449
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,600
<22-8,Thirteen >看能否提前你的医委会听证

450
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,850
<24-1,Taub >与此同时
<24-1,Taub >In the meantime,

451
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,410
<24-2,Masters >没人能阻止我招一个助手

452
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,080
<18-2,House >今早你说对了
<18-2,House >You were right this morning.

453
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,800
<18-3,House >我在咖啡店遇到了个男的
<18-3,House >I met a guy at a coffee shop,

454
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,230
<19-8,Foreman >我们去我家鬼混

456
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,470
<22-8,Thirteen >妈的

457
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,330
<22-9,House >我本来可以省下一个工作职位的
<22-9,House >I could have saved myself a job offer.

458
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,480
<22-10,Thirteen >我俩都装不知道
<22-10,Thirteen >We both acted like idiots.

459
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,780
<22-10,Thirteen >结果我被判了服刑
<22-10,Thirteen >And I ended up doing time.

460
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,190
<22-10,Thirteen >可能他被判的更久
<22-10,Thirteen >Guess he did more.

461
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,190
<22-10,Thirteen >我们刚搬进去的时候
<22-10,Thirteen >When we first moved into the house,

462
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
<23-1,Brian >一直都有人来看望我们
<23-1,Brian >we had people over all the time.

463
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,100
<23-1,Brian >后来她开始收集东西
<23-1,Brian >Then she started collecting things.

464
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,300
<23-1,Brian >我以为是她的兴趣
<23-1,Brian >I figured it was a hobby.

465
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,770
<23-1,Brian >把堆品做成了艺术品
<23-1,Brian >Piles turned into art projects,

466
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,150
<23-1,Brian >艺术品又变成了你们所看到的样子
<23-1,Brian >and art projects turned into what you saw.

467
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,690
<23-2,Masters >那你为什么还留在那里呢
<23-2,Masters >So why do you stay?

468
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,630
<23-3,Brian >对其他人来说  这个世界到处是垃圾
<23-3,Brian >To everyone else, the world is full of junk--

469

<23-3,Brian >无意义的  丑陋的  破烂的垃圾
<23-3,Brian >meaningless, ugly, broken things.

470
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,520
<23-3,Brian >但是在妮娜看来
<23-3,Brian >But to Nina,

471
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,830
<23-3,Brian >每一种形状

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,940
<23-3,Brian >每一种的颜色  纹理  味道
<23-3,Brian >every color, texture, smell,

473
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,590
<23-3,Brian >都讲述了一个故事
<23-3,Brian >they all tell a story.

474
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,450
<23-3,Brian >都是值得珍视的东西
<23-3,Brian >They're all worth treasuring.

475
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,250
<23-3,Brian >我并不奢望别人也能理解她的想法
<23-3,Brian >I wouldn't wish what she has on anyone,

476
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,020
<23-3,Brian >但时不时的我瞥一眼
<23-3,Brian >but every now and then I get a glimpse

477
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,270
<23-3,Brian >她所看到的世界...
<23-3,Brian >of what she sees, and...

478
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,660
<23-3,Brian >我就懂了
<23-3,Brian >it helps.

479
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,430
<23-4,Masters >肺部的杂音正在减轻

481
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,910
<23-4,Masters >看来你很快会好起来
<23-4,Masters >Looks like you're gonna be fine.

482
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,570
<23-4,Masters >她还好吗
<23-4,Masters >She okay?

483
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,040
<23-5,Masters >她的心脏出问题了
<23-5,Masters >Something's wrong with her heart.

<24-1,Taub >丈夫好转了  妻子却恶化了
<24-1,Taub >The husband is fine. The wife is worse.

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,340
<24-1,Taub >她心脏病发作了
<24-1,Taub >She had a heart attack.

486
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,670
<24-2,Masters >她的心脏病发作可能是
<24-2,Masters >Her heart attack could be

487
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,730
<24-2,Masters >并发症导致的
<24-2,Masters >from a complication.

488
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,940
<24-3,Taub >寇热可能会引起充血性心力衰竭
<24-3,Taub >Q fever would cause congestive heart failure,

489
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,700
<24-3,Taub >但不会引起心肌梗塞
<24-3,Taub >not myocardial infarction.

490
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,660
<24-4,Chase >那是说她不单患了寇热还有其它
<24-4,Chase >So she had Q fever and something else

491
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,650
<24-4,Chase >引起心脏病的原因吗
<24-4,Chase >that causes heart attack?

492
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,720
<24-5,House >还有囤积癖
<24-5,House >And the hoarding.

493
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,280
<24-5,House >现在他妻子才是病人
<24-5,House >Now that the wife is the only patient,

494
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,560
<24-5,House >我们需重新考虑囤积癖
<24-5,House >hoard is back on the board.

495
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,460
<24-6,Chase >或者我们对寇热的诊断是错的
<24-6,Chase >Or we were wrong about Q fever.

496
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,950
<24-6,Chase >我可不认为只是个巧合
<24-6,Chase >I don't buy it's just a coincidence.

497
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,940
<24-6,Chase >当然不是巧合
<24-6,Chase >It's not a coincidence.

498
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,060
<24-7,House >未知病因导致了囤积癖
<24-7,House >Diagnosis X caused the hoarding,

499
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,210

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,480
<25-1,Man on PA >恭喜你  查德
<25-1,Man on PA >Congratulations, Chad.

616
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,850
<25-1,Man on PA >可可粉调味真是出奇制胜
<25-1,Man on PA >That cocoa powder really did it.

617
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,530
<25-1,Man on PA >在斯克内克塔迪的沃土上被甩
<25-1,Man on PA >Dumped in a field in Schenectady.

618
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,070
<28-1,Harold >哎呦
<28-1,Harold >Ouch.

619
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,050
<28-1,Harold >介意我补上吗
<28-1,Harold >You mind if I make a move?

620
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,200
<28-1,Harold >我自知配不上她
<28-1,Harold >I know she's out of my league,

621
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,590
<28-1,Harold >可她在马铃薯加农炮大赛上
<28-1,Harold >but she's at a spud gun contest

622
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,600
<28-1,Harold >陪着千年老二
<28-1,Harold >with the soon-to-be five-time runner-up,

623
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,320
<28-1,Harold >不免情难以堪  期许冠军臂弯吧
<28-1,Harold >so she's probably got some self-esteem issues.

624
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,630
<28-1,Harold >你不会开炮的
<28-1,Harold >You wouldn't.

625
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,110
<29-1,Thirteen >-怎样  -口头警告
<29-1,Thirteen >- So? - Warning.

626
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,250
<29-2,House >只给你口头警告吗
<29-2,House >They gave you a warning?

627
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,500
<29-3,House >事实上我们的老弟哈罗德
<29-3,House >Well, it turns out our friend Harold

628
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,900
<29-3,House >在昨夜土豆泥宴交谊会上
<29-3,House >felt up the sheriff's daughter

629
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,600
<29-3,House >调戏警长千金
<29-3,House >last night at the potato mash mixer,

630
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,640
<29-3,House >所以警长难以秉公执法
<29-3,House >so sheriff's feeling kind of ambivalent.

631
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,890
<29-4,Thirteen >你总能全身而退  是吧
<29-4,Thirteen >You always get your way, don't you?

632
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,840
<29-5,House >也不总是
<29-5,House >Not always.

633
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,190
<29-5,House >今天本该是我跟卡迪的一周年纪念日
<29-5,House >Today would have been our one-year anniversary.

634
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,400
<29-5,House >总该好好庆祝才是
<29-5,House >Which is an incredibly arbitrary thing to celebrate.

635
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,560
<30-1,Masters >想要知根知底
<30-1,Masters >If you want to get to the bottom of something,

636
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,030
<30-1,Masters >就得找到根源才行
<30-1,Masters >you literally have to dig down to the bottom.

637
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,860
<30-1,Masters >按地质年代讲
<30-1,Masters >So stratigraphically,

638
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,930
<30-1,Masters >就我发现最老的收集物出现在卧室
<30-1,Masters >the oldest stuff I found was in the bedroom.

639
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,190
<30-1,Masters >卧室里最旧的家什是衣柜
<30-1,Masters >And the oldest stuff in the bedroom was in the closet.

640
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,810
<30-1,Masters >在衣柜的最下面
<30-1,Masters >And at the bottom of the closet...

641
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,290
<30-1,Masters >跟我说说这个
<30-1,Masters >Tell me about this.

642
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,800
<30-1,Masters >发现新症状
<30-1,Masters >We have a new symptom.

643
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,880
<30-1,Masters >不孕
<30-1,Masters >Infertility.

644
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,670
<31-1,Masters >他们想要孩子  可是一直怀不上
<31-1,Masters >They wanted kids but couldn't have them.

645
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,040
<31-1,Masters >她就开始收集东西填补空虚
<31-1,Masters >She started collecting things to fill the void.

646
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,920
<31-1,Masters >应该做个全方位荷尔蒙血液测定
<31-1,Masters >We should run a full hormone blood panel.

647
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,940
<31-2,House >小侦探哈里特[儿童读物]
<31-2,House >Hey, Harriet the Spy,

648
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,310
<31-2,House >先别着急忙活
<31-2,House >before you get too full of yourself,

649
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,510
<31-2,House >复习一下生物基础课
<31-2,House >you might want to go back to bio 101.

650
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,070
<31-2,House >巧妇难为无米之炊
<31-2,House >It takes two to not-tango.

651
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,610
<31-3,Taub >丈夫的精子可能有问题
<31-3,Taub >Hubby could be shooting blanks.

652
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,080
<31-4,House >所以这可能是助我们救她一命的新症状
<31-4,House >So either it's a new symptom that will help us save her life

653
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,440
<31-4,House >也可能是在枉费时间
<31-4,House >or it's a complete waste of time.

654
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,440
<31-5,House >查查是哪个的问题  培根还是蛋[他还是她]
<31-5,House >Figure out which is fried, the bacon or the eggs.

655
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,810
<31-6,Masters >我去开始荷尔蒙检测
<31-6,Masters >I'll start the hormone workup.

656
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,360
<31-7,Thirteen >还有另一种可能
<31-7,Thirteen >There's another option.

657
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,620
<31-7,Thirteen >豪斯  谁在说话
<31-7,Thirteen >House, who's that?

658
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,360
<31-8,House >电台
<31-8,House >Radio.

659
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,750
<31-9,Foreman >听起来很像十三
<31-9,Foreman >Sounded a lot like thirteen.

660
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,480
<31-10,House >模仿十三的乐队出了新歌
<31-10,House >It's a thirteen tribute band with their new song,

661
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,440
<31-10,House >《我的推测比马斯特斯好》
<31-10,House >"I've got a better theory than Masters."

662
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,930
<31-11,Thirteen >她说他们没有过孩子
<31-11,Thirteen >She said they never had kids.

663
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,340
<31-12,Taub >我的天哪  你到哪里去了
<31-12,Taub >Oh, my God. Where the hell have you been?

664
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,350
<31-12,Taub >我想我们都还有更要紧的事情
<31-12,Taub >I think we've all got something a little more important

665
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,980
<31-13,Chase >-需要关心  -这很要紧
<31-13,Chase >- to worry about than... - No, we don't.

666
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,520
<31-13,Chase >她杳无音信整整一年了
<31-13,Chase >She's been missing for a year.

667
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,800
<31-14,House >你们等她周一上班的时候再问好了
<31-14,House >You can ask her all about it when she comes in on Monday.

668
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,650
<31-14,House >周一
<31-14,House >Monday?

669
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,630
<31-15,Thirteen >下周一
<31-15,Thirteen >This Monday?

670
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,990
<31-15,Thirteen >我可以说话了吗
<31-15,Thirteen >Can I talk?

671
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,440
<31-11,Thirteen >她说他们没有过孩子
<31-11,Thirteen >She said they never had kids,

672
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,360
<31-15,Thirteen >你们就直接认定为不孕
<31-15,Thirteen >and you all jumped to infertility.

673
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,210
<31-15,Thirteen >忽略了另一种可能
<31-15,Thirteen >You never considered the other option.

674
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,040
<31-16,House >哈十三又回来啦
<31-16,House >And the bitch is back.

675

<32-1,Masters >我们认为你患有埃莱尔-当洛综合症
<32-1,Masters >We think you have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

676
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,780
<32-1,Masters >与你的症状完全相符
<32-1,Masters >It would explain the symptoms.

677
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,640
<32-1,Masters >此病还会导致流产
<32-1,Masters >It also causes miscarriages.

678
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,960
<32-1,Masters >你有过这样的经历吗
<32-1,Masters >Is that something you think you might have?

00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,500
<32-2,Brian >你怀上过
<32-2,Brian >Were you pregnant?

680
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,610
<32-3,Nina >三次
<32-3,Nina >Three times.

681
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,100
<32-4,Masters >多次流产致使她囤积成癖
<32-4,Masters >The miscarriages triggered the hoarding.

682
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,190
<32-4,Masters >最终导致你也生病
<32-4,Masters >Hoarding eventually made you sick too.

683
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,520
<32-4,Masters >你们能治好她吗
<32-4,Masters >Can you cure her?

684
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,610
<32-5,Masters >出现的身体症状可以治疗
<32-5,Masters >We can treat the physical symptoms

685
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,710
<32-5,Masters >改善她的生活
<32-5,Masters >as they arise, make her life a lot better,

686
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,930
<32-5,Masters >但是囤积癖
<32-5,Masters >but the hoarding,

687
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,350
<32-5,Masters >不在我们的治疗范围内
<32-5,Masters >we're the wrong kind of doctors.

688
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,050
<32-5,Masters >你骗了我
<32-5,Masters >You lied to me?

689
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,940
<32-6,Brian >整整九年
<32-6,Brian >For nine years?

690
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,590
<32-6,Brian >我太害怕会失去你
<32-6,Brian >I was so afraid of losing you.

691
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,880
<32-6,Brian >我做了什么让你怕成这样
<32-6,Brian >What have I ever done to make you afraid of that?

692
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,940
<32-6,Brian >我得出去透口气
<32-6,Brian >I need to get some air.

693
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,160
<33-1,Taub >是我一直太自私
<33-1,Taub >I've been selfish.

694
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,100
<33-1,Taub >我应该让你
<33-1,Taub >I need to let you

695
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,420
<33-1,Taub >过自己的生活
<33-1,Taub >move on.

696
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,200
<33-1,Taub >我想我们不该再见面了
<33-1,Taub >I think we should stop seeing each other.

697
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,810
<33-2,Rachel >不
<33-2,Rachel >No.

698
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,750
<33-3,Taub >我只是想给你一个
<33-3,Taub >Um, I just want you to be able to...

699
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,220
<33-4,Rachel >你上一次跟我玩绅士
<33-4,Rachel >The last time you got all noble on me,

700
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,760
<33-4,Rachel >闹得我们离婚连餐具都分了
<33-4,Rachel >we ended up dividing our dishes.

701
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,750
<33-4,Rachel >这一次  我来做决定
<33-4,Rachel >This time, I want to make the decision.

702
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,010
<33-5,Taub >我们这样你不觉得别扭吗
<33-5,Taub >You don't feel weird about this?

703
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,700
<33-5,Taub >我当然觉得别扭
<33-5,Taub >Of course I feel weird about this.

704
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,060
<33-6,Rachel >而且混乱困惑
<33-6,Rachel >It's confusing and messy

705
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,810
<33-6,Rachel >肮脏龌龊
<33-6,Rachel >and dirty.

706
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,210
<33-6,Rachel >愚蠢
<33-6,Rachel >Dumb.

707
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,640
<33-6,Rachel >可你看看我们俩  一辈子都怕犯错
<33-6,Rachel >But we spent our whole lives trying to do everything right,

708
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,470
<33-7,Taub >-结果非常失败  -也没那么差啦
<33-7,Taub >- and it sucked. - It wasn't all bad.

709
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,140
<33-8,Rachel >真的很失败  克里斯
<33-8,Rachel >It sucked, Chris.

710
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,150
<33-8,Rachel >可现在
<33-8,Rachel >And this,

711
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,760
<33-8,Rachel >不论这算什么
<33-8,Rachel >whatever it is,

712
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,730
<33-8,Rachel >都很好玩
<33-8,Rachel >It's fun.

713
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,240
<33-9,Taub >那我不是在占你便宜吧
<33-9,Taub >So I'm not taking advantage of you?

714
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,480
<33-10,Rachel >不好玩了
<33-10,Rachel >The fun is fading.

715
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,420
<33-11,Taub >知道吗
<33-11,Taub >You know...

716
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,080
<33-11,Taub >我们俩真是无可救药了
<33-11,Taub >There's something seriously wrong with us.

717
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,310
<33-12,Rachel >我知道
<33-12,Rachel >I know.

723
