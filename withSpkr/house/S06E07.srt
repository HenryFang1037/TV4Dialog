1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,890
<1-1,Madison>行了 别浪费时间了 这又不算啥
<1-1,Madison>Sure,let's give up now.It's no big deal.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,520
<1-1,Madison>不过是Phapmacide 巡回演唱会的首场罢了
<1-1,Madison>It's just pharmacide.Just their tour kickoff.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,660
<1-1,Madison>依我看 即使错过了史上最疯魔的派对 也没什么了不起?
<1-1,Madison>I mean,who cares if we miss the most insane party in the world?

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,830
<1-2,Jordan>跟我来吧 phoeb.
<1-2,Jordan>Come on,phoeb.

<1-2,Jordan>孤注一掷
<1-2,Jordan>Victory or death.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,880
<1-2,Jordan>说不定还有蛋糕作奖励
<1-2,Jordan>Or possibly cake.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,210
<1-2,Jordan>小心点 真对不起咯
<1-2,Jordan>Look,I'm sorry.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,680
<1-3,Jordan>不好意思 你要的咖啡就到了
<1-3,Jordan>Sorry,your caffeine fix is on its way.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,580
<1-3,Jordan>先别挂机好吗?
<1-3,Jordan>Will you hold on?

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,090
<1-4,Jordan>我们是DJ的助理
<1-4,Jordan>We're the dj's assistants.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,100
<1-5,Security Guard>你不能过去
<1-5,Security Guard>Hold on.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,270
<1-6,Jordan>抱歉 我俩都是他的助理
<1-6,Jordan>No,I said we both work for him.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,730
<1-7,Security Guard>你说她吧?
<1-7,Security Guard>You mean her.

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,140
<1-7,Security Guard>DJ是女的
<1-7,Security Guard>The dj's a  she-jay.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,760
<1-8,Band Member>没啥 Dave.
<1-8,Band Member>It's okay,dave.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,380
<1-8,Band Member>她是我的特别助理
<1-8,Band Member>She's my "plus one.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,860
<1-8,Band Member>那个也算是吧
<1-8,Band Member>" make that "plus two.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,130
<2-1,Jordan>" 难道你一点也不害怕吗?
<2-1,Jordan>" you weren't worried,were you?

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,110
<2-2,Madison>如果不全盘托出 小心会遭受惩罚哦
<2-2,Madison>Yes.And there will be punishment unless you tell us everything.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,780
<2-3,Avery>你真的在那里呆了一晚?
<2-3,Avery>You've been here all night?

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,670
<2-4,Jordan>后来我们跟着乐队去了总统套房
<2-4,Jordan>After the party,we went up to the presidential suite with the band.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,670
<2-5,Phoebe>真是忒大 共10个房间啊
<2-5,Phoebe>It was ginormous.Like,ten rooms.

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,940
<2-6,Jordan>喝酒 抽大麻之余 我们还在巨型等离子电视上玩"鼓神鼓"
<2-6,Jordan>We had a few drinks and some weed and played "drummer god" on this giant plasma tv.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,180
<2-7,Phoebe>她超抢眼哦
<2-7,Phoebe>Which she rocked,by the way.

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,670
<2-8,Kaitlin>我真是恨死你了
<2-8,Kaitlin>I think I hate you right now.

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,080
<2-9,Jordan>Colt领我上了天台 游泳池的入口被锁了
<2-9,Jordan>Colt took me up to the roof,but by then the gate to the pool was locked.

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,950
<2-9,Jordan>所以那里空无一人
<2-9,Jordan>So no one was up there.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,360
<2-9,Jordan>我们偷偷翻了进泳池,然后裸泳
<2-9,Jordan>So we just climbed over and jumped down and,um... went skinny dipping.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,710
<2-10,Avery>你们亲热了吗?
<2-10,Avery>Did you do it?

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,330
<2-11,Jordan>没有 他很体贴
<2-11,Jordan>No. He was so sweet.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,110
<2-11,Jordan>后来他弹起了吉他 还写了首歌给我
<2-11,Jordan>Later,he played his guitar,and he wrote a song for me.

32
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,770
<2-12,Kaitlin>天啊!
<2-12,Kaitlin>Oh,my god!

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,520
<2-13,Phoebe>Jord 你的脚怎么了?
<2-13,Phoebe>Jord,what happened to your foot?

34
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,890
<2-13,Phoebe>可能是你落地时扭到脚了
<2-13,Phoebe>Maybe you twisted your ankle when you jumped.

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,740
<2-14,Phoebe>也可能是过敏
<2-14,Phoebe>Or it could be your allergies.

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,740
<2-14,Phoebe>我阿姨对感冒药过敏 她的手都会像棉花糖人一样肿
<2-14,Phoebe>My aunt was allergic to some cold medication,and her hands swelled up like the marshmallow man's.

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,510
<2-15,Phoebe>Jord 没事吧?
<2-15,Phoebe>Jord,are you okay?

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,530
<2-15,Phoebe>Jordan!
<2-15,Phoebe>Jordan!

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,110
<3-1,House>Foreman竟然要我在这分辨率超低的 微型屏幕上读片
<3-1,House>Foreman expects me to read an x-ray on this itty-bitty screen.

40
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,110
<3-1,House>他该顺便给我邮个大点的电话
<3-1,House>He should have emailed me a larger phone.

41
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,110
<3-1,House>你干嘛收拾行李啊?
<3-1,House>Why are you packing?

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,140
<3-2,Wilson>今天下午我们要去 参加药理学暨和公共管理会议
<3-2,Wilson>We're leaving this afternoon for the conference on pharmacology and public policy.

43
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,640
<3-4,Wilson>- 我们? - 我和你提过的
<3-4,Wilson>- We? - We discussed this.

44
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,090
<3-4,Wilson>数周前就写在你的日历上了
<3-4,Wilson>It's been on your calendar for weeks.

45
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,330
<3-6,Wilson>- 斋月也记在日历上啊 - 你就把这个当成放假吧
<3-6,Wilson>- So has ramadan. - Think of it as a vacation.

46
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,390
<3-6,Wilson>我不管阿第伦达克山的空气
<3-6,Wilson>Nice,healthy adirondack air.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,930
<3-6,Wilson>是否清新怡人 你来就是了
<3-6,Wilson>Or not. I don't care.You're coming with.

48
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,470
<3-7,House>你才应该跟我走呢
<3-7,House>You should come with me.

49
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,610
<3-7,House>全国枕头大战争霸赛
<3-7,House>State pillow fighting championships.

50
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,650
<3-7,House>廉价啤酒 湿身T恤 应有尽有
<3-7,House>Dollar beers,wet t-shirts.

51
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,320
<3-7,House>用Eddie Money的话来说 (摇滚歌手) 我得到了两张去天堂的入门券 (歌曲名)
<3-7,House>In the words of the philosopher eddie money,I've got two tickets to paradise.

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,730
<3-8,Wilson>House 你搬进来时我答应你的医生 我会陪着你
<3-8,Wilson>House,when you moved in I promised your therapist  I'd be here for you.

53
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,350
<3-8,Wilson>如果我去开会 就不能看着你了
<3-8,Wilson>I can't be here if I'm there.

54
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,110
<3-8,Wilson>除非你与我同行 所以这是毋庸置疑的
<3-8,Wilson>Unless you're there too.So it's not a discussion.

55
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,790
<3-8,Wilson>行吧
<3-8,Wilson>Fine.

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,000
<3-9,House>我会告诉Foreman 那个严重水肿的16岁患者要等等了
<3-9,House>I'll let foreman know that the 16-year-old patient  with severe edema can wait.

57
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,140
<3-9,House>别急 对她的病我还是没啥头绪
<3-9,House>Relax.I've got no idea what's wrong with her.

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,630
<3-9,House>也有可能 她根本死不了
<3-9,House>So odds are,not fatal.

59
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,850
<3-10,House>我不去 我不去!
<3-10,House>Still not going!

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,300
<4-1,House>这是横纹肌溶解症
<4-1,House>She's got rhabdo.

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,410
<4-1,House>谁想去枕头大战争霸赛啊?
<4-1,House>Who wants to come to the pillow fighting championships?

62
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,140
<4-1,House>Rutgers 今年阵容强大哦.
<4-1,House>Rutgers has got a great team this year.

63
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,690
<4-1,House>他们的主力没有转成职业选手真是太好了
<4-1,House>I'm so glad their anchor didn't turn pro.

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,020
<4-2,Foreman>16岁少女的关节突然像80岁老妇
<4-2,Foreman>A 16-year-old girl suddenly has the joints of an 80-year-old.

65
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,620
<4-2,Foreman>我们能稍微谈谈这个吗?
<4-2,Foreman>You think we can discuss this for a second?

66
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,640
<4-3,House>毫无疑问就是横纹肌溶解症 她晕倒后病情恶化
<4-3,House>It's rhabdo.The patient gave you the answer.She fell down and went boom.

67
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,240
<4-3,House>再过1小时就得去看比赛 不如来玩猜大小决定谁去?
<4-3,House>We have to leave in an hour,so should we eenie-meenie?

68
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,350
<4-4,Chase>摔倒仅能解释小腿病变 解释不了手部肿胀
<4-4,Chase>The fall would explain the lower leg damage,but not the swollen hands.

69
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,370
<4-5,House>着地引起肌肉损伤
<4-5,House>Hard landing caused crushed muscles.

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,720
<4-5,House>肌肉损伤释放毒素入血 进而导致手脚肿胀
<4-5,House>Crushed muscles released toxins into the blood stream.Toxins caused swelling in the hands and legs.

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,040
<4-5,House>归根结底还是横纹肌溶解症 还剩59分钟
<4-5,House>Just another way of saying it's rhabdo.59 minutes.

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,310
<4-6,Cameron>她少人照看 父母都是建筑师
<4-6,Cameron>She's a credit card kid.Her parents are architects.

73
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,600
<4-6,Cameron>现在都在上海赶项目
<4-6,Cameron>They're working on a project in shanghai.

74
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,580
<4-7,House>你能在一间屋子里 坐得离Chase更远些么?
<4-7,House>Could you be sitting any further away from chase  and still be in the same room?

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,160
<4-8,Chase>不一定是横纹肌溶解症 深部静脉血栓也会导致肿胀
<4-8,Chase>It doesn't have to be rhabdo.The swelling could also be caused by deep vein thrombosis.

76
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,340
<4-9,Cameron>她也有过敏 可能是过敏反应 或者有心脏问题被我们忽略了--
<4-9,Cameron>She has allergies.Could be anaphylaxis or some heart condition that we don't--

77
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,040
<4-10,House>除了横纹肌溶解症 其他都不可能
<4-10,House>it can't really be any of those things since it's rhabdo.

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,090
<4-10,House>我肯定这是横纹肌溶解症 Foreman也知道
<4-10,House>I know it's rhabdo.Foreman knows it's rhabdo.

79
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,960
<4-10,House>即使chanse嘴里不说 心里也知道的
<4-10,House>Deep in his heart,even chase knows it's rhabdo.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,220
<4-10,House>人人都知晓 只有你被瞒在鼓里 很不爽吧?
<4-10,House>Isn't it annoying when everybody in the room knows  something you don't?

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,440
<4-11,Chase>我去做检查
<4-11,Chase>I'll test for everything.

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,140
<5-1,Chase>他是混蛋
<5-1,Chase>He's an ass.

83
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,070
<5-2,Foreman>增强显影准备好了
<5-2,Foreman>Contrast is ready.

84
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,450
<5-3,Chase>她早就怀疑我有外遇了
<5-3,Chase>She already thinks I'm cheating on her.

85
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,820
<5-4,Foreman>可能House希望藉此 让你亲口告诉她
<5-4,Foreman>Maybe this is house's way of telling you to talk to her.

86
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,830
<5-5,Chase>行啊 亲爱的 今天过得咋样啊? 忘记说 我杀了人
<5-5,Chase>Sure. How was your day,honey?By the way,I killed someone.

87
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,000
<5-5,Chase>如果我说了 她就会一辈子背着这个包袱
<5-5,Chase>If I tell her,that's dumping a burden on her forever.

88
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,850
<5-6,Foreman>成
<5-6,Foreman>Okay.

89
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,260
<5-7,Foreman>没有发现栓塞或血栓
<5-7,Foreman>No sign of obstructions or clots.

90
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,100
<6-1,Cuddy>house 直说吧 你来干啥
<6-1,Cuddy>Tell me what you came here for,house.

91
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,020
<6-2,House>我有正当的理由
<6-2,House>I've got a legitimate medical reason.

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,630
<6-3,Cuddy>那你肯定很自豪咯
<6-3,Cuddy>You must be so proud.

93
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,870
<6-3,Cuddy>我刚刚失忆了
<6-3,Cuddy>I've forgotten it.

94
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,060
<7-1,House>那也不算啥 我只是找籍口来看看Patty和Selma姐妹
<7-1,House>I guess it's no big deal,since I was only using it as an excuse to come check out patty and selma.

95
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,510
<7-2,Cuddy>我好惭愧 我都没有给你的老二起名字呢
<7-2,Cuddy>I feel bad.I haven't named your testicles.

96
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,990
<7-3,House>大伙都说你找到了个人最惹火低胸装
<7-3,House>Word on the street is you set a new personal best for low-cut.

97
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,060
<7-4,Cuddy>我不懂你为啥 给她们起个阿姨的名字
<7-4,Cuddy>I don't know why you chose to give them the names of somebody's aunts.

98
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,310
<7-4,Cuddy>赞美之词而已 她们太惹火了
<7-4,Cuddy>It's a compliment.They're always smokin'.

99
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,880
<7-5,House>想起了
<7-5,House>Oh,I remember.

100
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,980
<7-5,House>我要你批准一个未成年患者出院
<7-5,House>I need you to authorize the medical discharge of a minor.

101
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,340
<7-5,House>就是我手里这一份
<7-5,House>That's why I'm holding this in my hand.

102
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:23,530
<7-6,House>我还没有做完检查 但是--- 你的发信箱是正常的3倍大
<7-6,House>I haven't finished testing yet,but it's rh-- your outbox is three times normal size.

103
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,590
<7-6,House>我没有其他意思的
<7-6,House>It's not a metaphor.

104
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,260
<7-7,Cuddy>这周我还有一堆活要干
<7-7,Cuddy>There's a lot to be done before the weekend.

105
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,730
<7-8,House>你可以把文件拿回家
<7-8,House>You could take the papers home with you.

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,520
<7-8,House>除非你不准备回家
<7-8,House>Unless you're not gonna be home.

107
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,790
<7-8,House>除非你准备去参加某个医学会议
<7-8,House>Unless you were,for example,going to a medical conference.

108
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,190
<7-9,Cuddy>- 我和wilson一起去 - 我也是
<7-9,Cuddy>- I'm driving up with wilson. - Me too.

109
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,500
<7-11,Cuddy>- 你没有登记参加啊 - 你真关注我啊
<7-11,Cuddy>- *** - I love that you checked.

110
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,890
<7-12,House>- 可wilson说-- 我收了个病人吗?没错
<7-12,House>- But wilson said-- that I have a case?Yeah.

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,790
<7-14,House>你签的就是她的出院批准书
<7-14,House>You're authorizing the discharge right now.

112
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,380
<7-14,House>刚刚那个确实是比喻哦 (发信箱=翘臀)
<7-14,House>That  was  a metaphor.

113
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,650
<8-1,Wilson>我没空
<8-1,Wilson>Busy right now.

114
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,070
<8-2,House>- 他不行了吗? - 嗯
<8-2,House>- Is he dying? - Yeah.

115
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,230
<8-4,House>再有十分钟就不行了?
<8-4,House>In the next ten minutes?

116
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,820
<8-5,Wilson>可惜不是 他很遭罪
<8-5,Wilson>Unfortunately,no.He's in a lot of pain.

117
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,370
<8-6,House>我琢磨过了 你没错 我应该去参加大会
<8-6,House>I've thought about it.You're right.I should go to the conference.

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,290
<8-7,Wilson>因为你发现Cuddy也去
<8-7,Wilson>You found out cuddy's going.

119
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,060
<8-8,House>老天啊
<8-8,House>Oh,god,no.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,320
<8-8,House>她真是破坏王
<8-8,House>She'll ruin everything.

121
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,740
<8-9,Wilson>我们2小时后启程
<8-9,Wilson>We leave in two hours.

122
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,220
<8-10,Joseph>请给我用些吗啡
<8-10,Joseph>Please...morphine.

123
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,330
<8-11,Wilson>我会一直陪着你的 Joseph.
<8-11,Wilson>I'm right here.I'm right here,joseph.

124
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,840
<9-1,House>我要离开2天
<9-1,House>Two days away.

125
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,810
<9-1,House>我要不要带球球去呢? 你不能走 你点着了火
<9-1,House>You think I should pack ball-y?You can't leave.You lit a fuse.

126
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,460
<9-2,Chase>就该留下来看起爆
<9-2,Chase>You need to watch the bomb go off.

127
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,820
<9-3,House>如果你保持缄默 炸弹也会自动引爆
<9-3,House>The bomb was gonna go off on its own if you kept quiet.

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,060
<9-3,House>要不就编个够说服力的谎 不然就告诉她实情
<9-3,House>So now you either have to come up with a convincing lie,or tell her the truth.

129
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,580
<9-3,House>自己选吧
<9-3,House>Your choice.

130
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,360
<9-4,Chase>- 肌酸激酶提示横纹肌溶解症 - 当然啦
<9-4,Chase>- Ck levels point to rhabdo. - Of course.

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,870
<9-4,Chase>但影像学检查没有提示肌肉损伤
<9-4,Chase>Except for the part where imaging shows no sign of muscle crush.

132
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,430
<9-4,Chase>我是你的主治医师
<9-4,Chase>I'm your doctor.

133
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,510
<10-1,House>lars ulrich 史上最著名的重金属摇滚鼓手 听过这曲子吗?
<10-1,House>This is lars ulrich,the greatest metal drummer of all-time.You know the song?

134
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,140
<10-2,House>来 这是你的鼓槌
<10-2,House>Good. Drumstick.

135
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,370
<10-2,House>另外一个
<10-2,House>Another drumstick.

136
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,940
<10-2,House>我想你像那晚一样跟着节奏敲鼓
<10-2,House>I want you to rock out to the music the way you did last night.

137
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,400
<10-3,House>来吧 这可是经典医学检查哦 希波克拉底也用过 开始啦
<10-3,House>Go on.This is a classic medical test.Hippocrates used it.Let's go.

138
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,640
<10-4,House>来吧 跟住节奏! 敲高踏钹时要双手交叉
<10-4,House>Come on,you've gotta keep time!Cross over on the high hat.

139
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,320
<10-4,House>来激烈的!
<10-4,House>Let's head bang!

140
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,930
<10-5,Chase>House 你在干吗?
<10-5,Chase>House,what are you doing?

141
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,250
<10-6,House>检查提示低钾
<10-6,House>The chart said her potassium's low.

142
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,100
<10-6,House>横纹肌溶解症会升高血钾 拨浪鼓也会哦
<10-6,House>Rhabdo elevates the potassium.And monkey drums.

143
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,160
<10-6,House>Ergo... 那昨晚你的血钾一定低得可怕咯
<10-6,House>Ergo...   the levels must've been really low  last night.

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,990
<10-7,Jordan>- 那就会导致... - 我的手动不了
<10-7,Jordan>- Which causes... - I can't move them.

145
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,160
<10-8,House>暂时性肌肉瘫痪
<10-8,House>Temporary muscle paralysis.

146
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,020
<10-8,House>根据肌肉瘫痪的状况 她绝对不可能又爬楼梯 又翻墙到游泳池
<10-8,House>Given this rate of muscle fatigue,there's no way she could've climbed stairs and then a fence to the pool.

147
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,120
<10-8,House>低钾意味着没有翻墙 即没有外伤史
<10-8,House>Low potassium means no jump,means no trauma.

148
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,580
<10-8,House>检查证实了横纹肌溶解症
<10-8,House>Tests mean "yes rhabdo.

149
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,540
<10-8,House>就是说 某个因素同时引起了 横纹肌溶解症和低钾
<10-8,House>"  ergo,something else caused both the rhabdo and the low potassium.

150
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,090
<10-8,House>这次从详细查问病史入手
<10-8,House>This time start by getting an accurate history.

151
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,960
<10-8,House>当心了 我们的病人是个大话精
<10-8,House>Be careful.Our patient's a big fat liar.

152
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,990
<11-1,Chase>你昨晚到底干了什么?
<11-1,Chase>What did you really do last night?

153
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,310
<11-2,Cameron>我们得找出低钾的原因
<11-2,Cameron>We need to find the cause of your low potassium.

154
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,250
<11-2,Cameron>你可能患有肾功能异常 白血病或腺瘤
<11-2,Cameron>You could have a kidney disorder,leukemia,adenoma.

155
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,490
<11-3,Chase>我们要知道你磕了什么药 喝了什么酒
<11-3,Chase>We need to know about any drugs or alcohol.

156
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,820
<11-3,Chase>任何对你健康造成损害的因素
<11-3,Chase>Anything that might have threatened your health.

157
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,890
<11-4,Phoebe>说吧 Jord
<11-4,Phoebe>Come on,jord.

158
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
<11-4,Phoebe>好吧 我们没和乐队一起过夜
<11-4,Phoebe>Okay,we didn't spend the night with the band.

159
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,660
<11-5,Jordan>不要告诉我其他朋友
<11-5,Jordan>You can't tell our friends.

160
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,940
<11-6,Phoebe>你听说过"短剑风云之女王战士"吗?
<11-6,Phoebe>Have you heard of stiletto: warrior queen of space?

161
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,050
<11-7,Chase>是部漫画对吧?
<11-7,Chase>It's a comic book right?

162
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,870
<11-8,Phoebe>- 谢谢 - 没错
<11-8,Phoebe>- Thank you. - Yeah.

163
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,600
<11-9,Jordan>这是部超正的科幻电视剧
<11-9,Jordan>Yes,and a freaking amazing new sci-fi series.

164
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,550
<11-9,Jordan>他们要把它拍成动作片
<11-9,Jordan>And they're filming the motion picture now.

165
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,390
<11-10,Phoebe>这是一部前传
<11-10,Phoebe>It's a prequel.

166
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,570
<11-11,Jordan>其她女生是不会明白的
<11-11,Jordan>The other girls wouldn't get it.

167
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,490
<11-11,Jordan>只有Phoebe理解我的痴迷
<11-11,Jordan>Only phoebe understands my passion.

168
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,230
<11-11,Jordan>只有Phoebe理解武士道精神
<11-11,Jordan>Only phoebe understands the bushido of the heel.

169
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,000
<11-12,Chase>那昨晚到底发生了什么事?
<11-12,Chase>So what actually happened last night?

170
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,000
<11-13,Jordan>我们和其他朋友想进入 Adams酒店的Pharmacide巡回 派对
<11-13,Jordan>We were with our friends trying to get into the pharmacide tour party at the adams.

171
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,010
<11-13,Jordan>这时我发现 Jeffrey Keener也在那儿
<11-13,Jordan>And then I found out that jeffrey keener's gonna be there.

172
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,500
<11-14,Jordan>我在跟他的微博
<11-14,Jordan>I follow his tweets.

173
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,340
<11-14,Jordan>真可悲 还得向你们解释
<11-14,Jordan>It's tragic that I have to explain this.

174
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,400
<11-14,Jordan>他是短剑风云第一部的作者
<11-14,Jordan>He's the creator of stiletto issue number one.

175
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,090
<11-15,Phoebe>- 电视剧的创作人 - 神一样的人物
<11-15,Phoebe>- And the tv show. - He's a god.

176
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,220
<11-16,Cameron>于是你们冲上前去?
<11-16,Cameron>So did you guys go up to him?

177
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,680
<11-17,Jordan>上帝 不 我们是有原则的
<11-17,Jordan>God,no.We keep a ten-foot rule.

178
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,390
<11-17,Jordan>我们绝不会冒昧上前去打扰别人
<11-17,Jordan>It's not stalking if you don't go up to the person and bother them.

179
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,690
<11-18,Phoebe>- 所以我们跟着他到处转 - 小心翼翼地
<11-18,Phoebe>- So we just followed him around. - Discreetly.

180
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,620
<11-20,Phoebe>他半小时后便离开了 去酒店楼下餐厅吃饭
<11-20,Phoebe>He ditched after half an hour and went down to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.

181
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,850
<11-21,Cameron>- 你们也跟着去了? - 小心翼翼地
<11-21,Cameron>- And you went with him? - Discreetly.

182
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,470
<11-23,Phoebe>这实在太酷了
<11-23,Phoebe>We played it so cool.

183
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,870
<11-23,Phoebe>两小时里 我们像他一样生活
<11-23,Phoebe>For two hours,we lived his life.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,160
<11-23,Phoebe>我们模仿他做的一切 吃着和他一样的晚餐
<11-23,Phoebe>We did everything he did.Ate the exact same meal he ate.

185
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,330
<11-24,Cameron>真酷
<11-24,Cameron>Cool.

186
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,200
<12-1,Cameron>证实了她们的后半截故事
<12-1,Cameron>The rest of their story checks out.

187
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,680
<12-1,Cameron>酒店经理说 向她父母收取了食物 房间和收看三集短剑风云的费用
<12-1,Cameron>The hotel manager says mom and dad were charged for food and a room,three pay-per-view episodes of  stiletto.

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,770
<12-2,Cameron>你想找死么?
<12-2,Cameron>Are you trying to kill yourself?

189
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,440
<12-2,Cameron>这和她们吃的是同一批食物
<12-2,Cameron>It's from the same batch the girls ate.

190
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,660
<12-3,Chase>她们吃的和他一样 另外上百个健康人吃的也一样
<12-3,Chase>They ate what he ate.And what a hundred other healthy people ate.

191
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,390
<12-3,Chase>开动 中饭由Adams酒店提供
<12-3,Chase>Dig in.Lunch is on the adams.

192
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,740
<12-4,Foreman>会不会 食物就是答案?
<12-4,Foreman>What if food is the answer?

193
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,950
<12-4,Foreman>不是这些食物 所有食物
<12-4,Foreman>Not this food.Any food.

194
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,200
<12-4,Foreman>Jordan说这些她全吃了
<12-4,Foreman>Jordan says she ate all of this.

195
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,370
<12-4,Foreman>她才16岁 正是注重外表 讲究身材的年龄
<12-4,Foreman>She's 16,all about body image,and she obviously worries about fitting in.

196
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,240
<12-5,Cameron>暴食症符合她的症状
<12-5,Cameron>Bulimia would account for her symptoms.

197
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,550
<12-5,Cameron>我们得做个钡餐检查贲门黏膜撕裂综合征 还得给她补充营养和转介心理治疗
<12-5,Cameron>We should do a barium swallow for mallory weiss tears,start her on nutritional supplements,get a psych consult.

198
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,030
<12-5,Cameron>为什么要看我的会议日程?
<12-5,Cameron>Why are you reading my program guide?

199
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,270
<13-1,Wilson>你又不打算出席任何演讲
<13-1,Wilson>It's not like you plan on attending any of the presentations.

200
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,030
<13-2,House>我想知道我错过了多少闷蛋会议
<13-2,House>I like to know how much boredom I'm missing.

201
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,020
<13-2,House>"对化疗并发症病人的临终关怀"
<13-2,House>"patient perceptions of complications in end-stage chemotherapy.

202
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,310
<13-2,House>- 你没告诉我你要发表演讲 - 我这么做错了?
<13-2,House>- you didn't tell me you were giving a paper. - And that was wrong?

203
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,200
<13-4,House>你上次演讲时提前让我看稿子 还问我有何意见
<13-4,House>Last time you presented a paper,you gave me an advance copy and asked for feedback.

204
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,960
<13-5,Wilson>你还好意思问 我为何不重蹈这一覆辙?
<13-5,Wilson>And you're wondering why I wouldn't want to repeat that experience?

205
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,350
<13-6,House>噢 你看! 80年代舞会
<13-6,House>Oh,look! An '80s party.

206
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,930
<13-6,House>当你以为海鸥乐队 在你的倒后镜中渐渐远去
<13-6,House>Just when you think  you left flock of seagulls behind in your rearview mirror,

207
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,310
<13-6,House>他们却像便车客一样 突然从你眼前杀出
<13-6,House>suddenly it's up ahead like an undead hitchhiker.

208
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,160
<13-7,Wilson>Cuddy会去
<13-7,Wilson>Cuddy's going.

209
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,000
<13-8,House>你带了我的裤袜么?
<13-8,House>Did you pack my leg warmers?

210
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,320
<13-9,Wilson>如果你想要她...约她出去
<13-9,Wilson>If you want her... ask her out.

211
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,760
<13-9,Wilson>天哪!
<13-9,Wilson>My god,man!

212
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,150
<13-10,House>她又不是酒吧里的妓女
<13-10,House>She's not some floozy in a bar.

213
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,800
<13-10,House>而是我给我发工钱的妓女
<13-10,House>She's the floozy I work for.

214
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,490
<13-10,House>所以不能循规蹈矩地来 而是要出其不意
<13-10,House>There's gotta be no radical steps here.Gotta be subtle.

215
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,110
<13-10,House>我们恰巧在派对上偶遇
<13-10,House>We happened to attend the same party.

216
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,060
<13-10,House>又恰巧有了一番很感性的对话
<13-10,House>The chat happens to turn personal.

217
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,860
<13-11,Wilson>像青蛙在一锅渐渐烧开的水里?
<13-11,Wilson>Like the frog in gradually boiling water.

218
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,330
<13-12,House>没错 没等她发现怎么回事 已经被煮透端上桌了
<13-12,House>Exactly.She'll be red and delicious before she knows it.

219
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,300
<13-12,House>什么?
<13-12,House>What?

220
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,630
<13-13,Wilson>这计划真是万无一失啊
<13-13,Wilson>What could possibly go wrong?

221
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,580
<14-1,Cameron>Chase这星期去了五次健身
<14-1,Cameron>Chase went to the gym five times this week.

222
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,970
<14-2,Foreman>是么
<14-2,Foreman>Okay.

223
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,370
<14-3,Cameron>其中一次我跟踪他了
<14-3,Cameron>One of those times I followed him.

224
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,010
<14-4,Foreman>什么?
<14-4,Foreman>What?

225
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,010
<14-5,Cameron>我跟踪他了 是的 我知道向你承认有多难堪
<14-5,Cameron>I followed him.And yes,I know how humiliating that admission is.

226
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,970
<14-6,Foreman>他去哪儿了?
<14-6,Foreman>Where'd he go?

227
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,820
<14-7,Cameron>- 那次确是健身中心 但我知道-- - 就此打住
<14-7,Cameron>- The gym,that time.But I know that something's--  I'm stopping you right there.

228
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,600
<14-8,Foreman>这番话你应该和Chase说 而不是我
<14-8,Foreman>This is a conversation you should be having with chase,not me.

229
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,740
<14-9,Cameron>我试过和Chase说了
<14-9,Cameron>I've tried having this conversation with chase.

230
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,620
<14-10,Foreman>没有撕裂 不是暴食症
<14-10,Foreman>No sign of tears.It's not bulimia.

231
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,010
<14-11,Cameron>他是不是有外遇了?
<14-11,Cameron>Is he having an affair?

232
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,850
<14-12,Foreman>不
<14-12,Foreman>No.

233
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,900
<14-13,Cameron>- 我为什么要相信你 - 你不必
<14-13,Cameron>- Why should I believe you? - You shouldn't.

234
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,740
<14-14,Foreman>你只要相信他
<14-14,Foreman>You should believe him.

235
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,950
<14-15,Michelle>宝贝...甜心...你还好吗?
<14-15,Michelle>Baby... sweetie... how are you?

<14-16,Cameron>- Jordan! - 窦性心律正常

<14-16,Cameron>Heart rate's fine.

238
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,330
<14-17,Foreman>血压下降
<14-17,Foreman>Bp's dropping.

239
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,080
<14-18,Derek>- 出什么事了? - 没有脉搏
<14-18,Derek>- What's happening to her? - No pulse.

240
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,540
<14-19,Foreman>噢 上帝!
<14-19,Foreman>Oh,my god!

241
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,710
<14-20,Michelle>你刚不是说她心跳正常吗?
<14-20,Michelle>You said her heart rate was fine.

242
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,750
<14-21,Chase>心包填塞 得马上抽出积液
<14-21,Chase>Cardiac tamponade.Drain the fluid now.

243
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,810
<14-22,Derek>怎么回事?
<14-22,Derek>What is going on?

244
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,040
<14-23,Cameron>她心脏周围出血
<14-23,Cameron>She's bleeding around her heart.

245
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,060
<15-1,Foreman>积血抑制了她的心肌
<15-1,Foreman>Blood constricted her heart muscle.

246
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,890
<15-1,Foreman>我们在给她用抗心律失常药物 但不知能维持多久
<15-1,Foreman>She's on antiarrhythmics,but we don't know how long we can keep her stable.

247
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,420
<15-1,Foreman>看来是压力导致 当时她的父母刚--
<15-1,Foreman>Seemed to be triggered by stress.Her parents had just--

248
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,680
<15-2,House>做钡餐检查时 她的血压下降了么?
<15-2,House>did her blood pressure drop during the barium swallow?

249
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,740
<15-3,Chase>- 收缩压三分钟内降到了50 - 排除慢性病的可能
<15-3,Chase>- Dropped to 50 systolic in three minutes. - Rules out chronic conditions.

250
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,110
<15-5,Foreman>急性发作只能是中毒 感染
<15-5,Foreman>Acute conditions limit us to toxins,infections.

251
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,650
<15-6,Cameron>发病原因太多了 煤气泄漏 墙纸里的砷 花洒里的真菌
<15-6,Cameron>Could be anything.A gas leak,arsenic in the wallpaper,fungus in the shower.

252
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,480
<15-6,Cameron>我去她的房间和酒店取样本
<15-6,Cameron>I'll get samples from her room and the restaurant.

253
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,270
<15-7,House>去找我们的追星女孩谈谈
<15-7,House>Talk to our little gossip girl.

254
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,560
<15-7,House>我们要明确知道过去24小时 她去过哪里 做过什么
<15-7,House>You need to know exactly where she's been and what she's done in the last 24 hours.

255
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,190
<15-7,House>噢 我想--@#$%^
<15-7,House>Oh,I think--

<15-10,House>Perlmutter喜欢80年代秀
<15-10,House>Perlmutter loves the '80s.

259
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,510
<15-11,Phoebe>我不用出去吗?
<15-11,Phoebe>Do you need me to leave too?

260
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,620
<15-12,Foreman>你可能记得她不记得的东西
<15-12,Foreman>You might remember stuff she doesn't.

261
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,270
<15-13,Jordan>我们把一切都告诉你了
<15-13,Jordan>We didn't do anything we haven't told you about.

262
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,200
<15-14,Phoebe>我们在Jordan家呆了一整天
<15-14,Phoebe>We hung out at jordan's all day.

263
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,230
<15-14,Phoebe>然后我们叫了一辆加长房车进城
<15-14,Phoebe>And then we called a limo to go into the city.

264
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,540
<15-15,Jordan>我们去了Bruce Springsteen家
<15-15,Jordan>We stopped at bruce springsteen's house.

265
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,670
<15-16,Phoebe>Jord...不要胡闹了 好吗? 你病得很厉害
<15-16,Phoebe>Jord... don't joke around,okay?You're really sick.

266
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,840
<15-16,Phoebe>告诉他们真相
<15-16,Phoebe>Just tell him the truth.

267
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,460
<15-17,Jordan>Bruce让我弹他第一把电吉他
<15-17,Jordan>Bruce let me play  the first electric guitar he ever owned.

268
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,580
<15-18,Phoebe>天啊 你为什么还要说谎?
<15-18,Phoebe>My god,why are you lying?

269
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,220
<15-19,Jordan>你为什么不相信我?
<15-19,Jordan>How can you not believe me?

270
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,080
<15-20,Foreman>把头转向右边
<15-20,Foreman>Turn to your right.

271
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,030
<16-1,Cameron>Keener先生 谢谢你肯见我
<16-1,Cameron>Mr.Keener,I really appreciate you coming.

272
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,110
<16-2,Keener>噢 不费多少事 我的房间就在这儿六楼
<16-2,Keener>Oh,it's not that much of a hike.My room's only six floors up.

273
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,380
<16-3,Cameron>你记得昨晚见过两个女孩吗 16岁上下?
<16-3,Cameron>Last night,do you remember two girls,about 16?

274
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,670
<16-4,Keener>坐在那边的桌子
<16-4,Keener>That table right there.

275
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,140
<16-5,Cameron>她们让你印象深刻呢
<16-5,Cameron>They made an impression.

276
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,460
<16-6,Keener>她们老盯着你看 还笑个不停 想不注意都很难
<16-6,Keener>Well,they were hard to miss with the giggling and the staring.

277
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,540
<16-7,Cameron>我想这种情况你见得多了
<16-7,Cameron>I'm sure that happens to you a lot.

278
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,010
<16-8,Keener>我想你见得更多
<16-8,Keener>I'm sure that happens to you a lot more.

279
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,230
<17-1,Foreman>她无法控制
<17-1,Foreman>She can't control it.

280
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,990
<17-1,Foreman>脑里的积血影响脑丘 使她不停地说谎
<17-1,Foreman>A bleed in her brain is affecting her thalamus,causing her to lie.

281
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,200
<17-1,Foreman>我们要知道一切 你们昨晚没分开过?
<17-1,Foreman>We need to know everything.You two were never apart?

282
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,580
<17-2,Phoebe>除了她去拿冰块那会儿
<17-2,Phoebe>Except for when she went to go get ice.

283
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,570
<17-2,Phoebe>但这应该用不了多久
<17-2,Phoebe>But that couldn't have taken very long.

284
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,950
<17-4,Phoebe>- 你不记得了? - 那是在半夜里
<17-4,Phoebe>- You don't know? - It was in the middle of the night.

285
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,350
<17-4,Phoebe>她回到房间时我醒来了
<17-4,Phoebe>I woke up when she came back into the room.

286
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,790
<17-5,Foreman>她告诉你她去拿冰块了?
<17-5,Foreman>And she told you she went to get ice?

295
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,220
<18-1,Cuddy>你确定?
<18-1,Cuddy>You sure?

296
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,870
<18-2,House>他们没讲清楚
<18-2,House>They weren't specific.

<18-3,Cuddy>你花多少钱租的这一身?
<18-3,Cuddy>How much did it cost you to rent that?

<18-5,Man at Dance>Dr. Perlmutter,I read your article on neural degeneration.

<18-6,House>我只是写来捞钱的
<18-6,House>I just wrote that for the money.

<18-8,House>抱歉 我们正要进舞池
<18-8,House>Sorry,we were just about to hit the floor.

307
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,430
<18-10,House>但别指望我把节奏踩准
<18-10,House>As long as you don't expect rhythm.

<18-11,House>记得我们上一次一起跳舞吗?
<18-11,House>You remember the last time we danced?

309
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,820
<18-11,House>医学院 我们见面的第一周
<18-11,House>Med school,the week we met.

310
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,950
<18-12,Cuddy>不
<18-12,Cuddy>No.

311
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,820
<18-13,House>我在内分泌课上见到你
<18-13,House>I saw you in endocrinology.

312
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,430
<18-13,House>跟着你去到乡村舞会
<18-13,House>Tracked you down to the hoedown.

313
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,970
<18-14,Cuddy>我是说 我们之前就见过了 在书店里
<18-14,Cuddy>I meant,we met before that.In the bookstore.

314
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,250
<18-15,House>到学校的第三天 我把课程表递给柜台后那人
<18-15,House>My third day of school,I hand my syllabus to the guy behind the counter.

315
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,690
<18-16,Cuddy>他几乎没正眼看我 只瞄了 一眼课表就说 我很有野心
<18-16,Cuddy>He barely looks at me.Just skims the sheet and tells me I'm overly ambitious,

316
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,770
<18-16,Cuddy>喜欢跟人叫板 而且喜欢去舞会
<18-16,Cuddy>i have a chip on my shoulder,and I know how to party.

317
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,550
<18-17,House>我忘记你喜欢去舞会了
<18-17,House>I'd forgotten you knew how to party.

318
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,360
<18-18,Cuddy>我说 "你胡说八道"
<18-18,Cuddy>I said,"you're making that up.

319
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,700
<18-18,Cuddy>你说 "你课表排得很满"
<18-18,Cuddy>" and you said,"your class schedule is overloaded.

320
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,780
<18-18,Cuddy>"但没一节是11点前的"
<18-18,Cuddy>"but none of your classes are before 11:00,"

321
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,390
<18-18,Cuddy>没人会选Lamb教授的课 除非他们想证明什么
<18-18,Cuddy>and no one takes professor lamb's course unless they have something to prove.

322
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,060
<18-19,House>因为Siegal教授开了一样的课 而且分数好拿得多
<18-19,House>" because professor siegal covered the same ground and was the easier grader.

323
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,920
<18-20,Cuddy>从此我盯上了你
<18-20,Cuddy>I tracked you down.

324
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,000
<18-20,Cuddy>内分泌学...还有舞会
<18-20,Cuddy>Endocrinology... the party.

325
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,610
<18-21,House>事情一件接一件发生
<18-21,House>And one thing led to another.

326
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,950
<18-22,Cuddy>最后还是不了了之
<18-22,Cuddy>And then it didn't.

327
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,540
<18-23,House>我本来想打给你
<18-23,House>I was gonna call you.

328
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,660
<18-24,Cuddy>不...不要说了
<18-24,Cuddy>No...don't do that.

329
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,930
<18-24,Cuddy>- 我没指望你有什么表示 只是... - 我本来想去找你
<18-24,Cuddy>- There was no expectations.I was just as into it-- I was gonna come see you.

330
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,690
<18-25,House>看看我们之间会发生什么
<18-25,House>Figure out where things would go from there.

331
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,240
<18-25,House>但那天早上我接到了院长电话 我被第一所医学院开除了
<18-25,House>That was the morning I got the call from the dean and I was expelled from my first med school,

332
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,970
<18-25,House>所以我想 这么做也没意义了
<18-25,House>and there didn't seem any point.

333
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:02,120
<18-26,Cuddy>我得回房准备明天 传染病讲座的文件
<18-26,Cuddy>I should go to my room and review papers for the infectious disease panel.

334
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,150
<20-1,Wilson>*我的照片开始褪色 * (Time after Time By Cyndi Lauper)
<20-1,Wilson>*after my picture fades *

335
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,540
<20-2,House>*黑色转变为灰调 *
<20-2,House>*and darkness has turned to gray *

336
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,350
<20-3,Wilson>*从窗子往外看去... *
<20-3,Wilson>*watching through windows... *

337
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,550
<20-3,Wilson>喂?
<20-3,Wilson>Hello?

338
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,350
<19-1,Wilson>是的 谢谢告知
<19-1,Wilson>Yeah.Thanks for telling me.

339
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,460
<19-2,House>清早七点 最好有人挂掉了
<19-2,House>7:00 in the morning.Somebody better be dead.

340
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,780
<19-3,Wilson>我的病人 Joseph Schultz
<19-3,Wilson>My patient,joseph schultz.

341
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,870
<19-4,House>照他的病情 这是解脱 对吧?
<19-4,House>Under the circumstances,that's the best thing that could have happened,right?

342
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,000
<19-5,Wilson>是的 我只是希望能陪着他
<19-5,Wilson>Yeah.  I just wish I had been there.

343
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,210
<19-5,Wilson>昨晚没听到你回房
<19-5,Wilson>Didn't hear you come in last night.

344
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,730
<19-6,House>是的 那时快...9:30了
<19-6,House>Yes,and it was almost 9:30.

345
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,730
<19-7,Wilson>事情没能如你所愿?
<19-7,Wilson>things didn't go as you planned?

346
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,760
<19-8,House>我们的关系上了一个新台阶
<19-8,House>We've moved on to a new phase.

347
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,410
<19-8,House>我告诉Cuddy我一直对她有意思 她听完就径直离开了
<19-8,House>I tell cuddy that I've always been interested in her,and she walks out of the room.

348
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:17,050
<19-9,Wilson>要么是她还没准备好面对 要么就是惊讶得不知该如何反应
<19-9,Wilson>Well,either she just wasn't ready for that,or maybe she was just surprised and didn't know how to react.

349
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,230
<19-10,House>- 你在干什么? - 你刚才表现出一丝有趣的罪恶感
<19-10,House>- What are you doing? - Interesting reflex of guilt just now.

350
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,720
<19-10,House>六周来 你的病人一直都奄奄一息
<19-10,House>Your patient's been dying for six weeks.

351
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,490
<19-10,House>你没法确定他这周末是否会死
<19-10,House>You couldn't have predicted he'd go this weekend.

352
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,780
<19-10,House>你能吗?
<19-10,House>Or could you?

353
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,670
<19-11,House>"安乐死: 说实话
<19-11,House>"euthanasia: let's tell the truth.

354
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,970
<19-11,House>我们都这么做过"
<19-11,House>We all do it.

355
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,490
<19-11,House>开场白不错
<19-11,House>" that's a great opening line.

356
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,460
<19-11,House>你疯了吗?
<19-11,House>Are you insane?

357
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,770
<19-12,Wilson>我之前不需要你的评论 现在也不需要
<19-12,Wilson>I didn't want your notes before,and I don't want 'em now.

358
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,940
<19-13,Chase>她不是去取冰块
<19-13,Chase>Well,she didn't  get ice.

359
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,880
<19-13,Chase>她去大厅了 可能去了任何地方
<19-13,Chase>She got out in the lobby.She could have gone anywhere.

360
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,650
<19-13,Chase>先看看她走了多久吧
<19-13,Chase>Let's start with for how long.

361
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,970
<19-13,Chase>快进
<19-13,Chase>Fast forward.

362
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,350
<19-13,Chase>停 倒带 倒带
<19-13,Chase>Stop.Rewind.Back.

363
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,120
<19-14,Chase>不管去了哪 也就去了大概五分钟
<19-14,Chase>Wherever she went,she was only gone for,like,five minutes.

364
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,460
<19-14,Chase>- 她手上拿着什么 - 那是Keener的日记
<19-14,Chase>- She's holding something. - It's keener's journal.

365
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,150
<19-15,Cameron>他那晚肯定落在餐馆里了
<19-15,Cameron>He must have left it in the restaurant that night.

366
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,140
<19-15,Cameron>她折了回去 声称是她的
<19-15,Cameron>She went back,claimed it belonged to her.

367
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,660
<19-15,Cameron>她在找一个敲门的理由
<19-15,Cameron>She was looking for an excuse to knock on his door.

368
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,360
<20-1,Wilson>我知道你要说什么
<20-1,Wilson>I know what you're gonna say.

369
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,430
<20-1,Wilson>我没疯
<20-1,Wilson>I'm not insane.

370
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,750
<20-1,Wilson>医生很少受到指控
<20-1,Wilson>Doctors are rarely indicted.

371
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,700
<20-2,House>我只是在关心你的事业
<20-2,House>I was just thinking of your career.

372
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:52,570
<20-2,House>但如果你是那些偶尔被控诉的医生之一 你的事业会受影响的
<20-2,House>But yeah,if you're one of the doctors occasionally  indicted,I guess it could affect that.

373
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:58,240
<20-3,Wilson>总得有人揭示出 那些临死之人的生活状况
<20-3,Wilson>Someone needs to say what life is really like now for people who are dying.

374
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,460
<20-3,Wilson>医生会面对什么 我们要做怎样的决定
<20-3,Wilson>What doctors have to go through,the decisions we have to make.

375
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,290
<20-3,Wilson>没有指导 独自做出决定
<20-3,Wilson>Alone.Without guidance.

376
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,080
<20-4,House>应该讲述出来... 写在寄给时代周刊的匿名信上
<20-4,House>Someone should say that... in an unsigned letter to the  times.

377
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,380
<20-5,Wilson>我说的将是事实 我说的将是我们共同的想法
<20-5,Wilson>I'd be telling the truth.I'd be saying what we're all thinking.

378
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,000
<20-6,House>谁在乎呢? 肿瘤科接受药厂的资助
<20-6,House>Who cares?The oncology department is subsidized by drug companies.

379
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,930
<20-6,House>他们不会让一个杀人犯来掌管的
<20-6,House>They don't want it run by a murderer.

380
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,860
<20-7,Wilson>- 我们都是杀人犯 只是没胆承认而已 - 还是这句话 谁在乎呢?
<20-7,Wilson>- We're all murderers.We just don't have the guts to admit--  and once again,who cares?

381
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,440
<20-8,House>哪里都不会雇你的
<20-8,House>You won't be hirable anywhere.

382
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,030
<20-9,Wilson>如果说我从你身上学到了点什么
<20-9,Wilson>If there's one thing I've learned from you,

383
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,360
<20-9,Wilson>那就是我该坚持自己认为对的事 不计后果
<20-9,Wilson>it's that I should do what I think is right and not worry about the consequences.

384
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,800
<20-10,House>嗯 我受用得紧
<20-10,House>Yeah,it's worked out great for me.

385
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,640
<21-1,Keener>无意冒犯 但我在等一个洛杉矶的电话 有话快说好吗?
<21-1,Keener>Um,I don't mean  to be rude,but I'm expecting a notes call from l.A.Can we make this quick?

386
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,510
<21-2,Chase>Jordan那晚有没有来过你房间?
<21-2,Chase>Did jordan come to your room the other night?

387
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,690
<21-3,Cameron>让我换种说法吧 我们知道Jordan那晚来过你的房间
<21-3,Cameron>Let me put it another way.We know jordan came to your room the other night.

388
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,220
<21-4,Keener>我很想帮忙
<21-4,Keener>Look,I've tried to be helpful.

389
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,730
<21-4,Keener>我不知道你为什么要假装我在说谎
<21-4,Keener>I don't know why you want to pretend   I'm lying to you.

390
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,440
<21-5,Cameron>- 但感觉可不太好 - 我们需要搜查你的房间
<21-5,Cameron>- But this is getting too weird for me. - We need to search your room.

391
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,370
<21-6,Keener>- 用不着 因为她没来过 - Allison 冷静点
<21-6,Keener>- You don't,because she was never here. - Allison,calm down.

392
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,340
<21-7,Chase>你想明哲保身? 以他人的生命为代价?
<21-7,Chase>You would cover your ass at the expense of someone's life?

393
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,760
<21-8,Cameron>我们知道她给你送来了日记
<21-8,Cameron>We know she brought up your journal.

394
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,270
<21-9,Chase>真是帮了大忙
<21-9,Chase>That was helpful.

395
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,270
<21-9,Chase>要是为了和未成年人的一夜情 而拿婚姻冒险 那他肯定是疯了
<21-9,Chase>He'd be crazy to risk his marriage for a one-night stand with a teenager.

396
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,480
<21-10,Cameron>理智的人只会因更重要的事 来拿婚姻冒险吗?
<21-10,Cameron>Sensible people only risk their marriage for something more serious?

397
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,530
<21-11,Chase>我没搞婚外情
<21-11,Chase>I'm not having an affair.

398
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,020
<21-12,Cameron>- 我们在说Keener - 好的很
<21-12,Cameron>- We're talking about keener. - Fine.

399
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,750
<21-13,Chase>他不在乎自己的婚姻 那事业呢? 强奸罪会毁了他的事业
<21-13,Chase>He doesn't care about his marriage.What about his career?Statutory rape would ruin it.

400
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,350
<21-14,Cameron>承认强奸罪才会毁掉他的事业
<21-14,Cameron>It's admitting statutory rape that could ruin it.

401
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,780
<21-14,Cameron>所以我们别指望他说真话
<21-14,Cameron>Which is why we'll never hear the truth out of him.

402
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,750
<21-14,Cameron>过量服用迷奸药能解释她的症状 我们该用氟马西尼给她治疗
<21-14,Cameron>Rufies od explains all her symptoms.We should start treating her with flumazenil.

403
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,830
<22-1,Wilson>没去研讨金黃色葡萄球菌?
<22-1,Wilson>Isn't the mrsa panel going on?

404
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,130
<22-2,Cuddy>我们被赶出来了 她开始哭了
<22-2,Cuddy>We got kicked out.She started crying.

405
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,240
<22-3,Wilson>对 要是讨论导尿问题我也会哭
<22-3,Wilson>Yeah,well,discussions of urinary catheterization  will do that to me too.

406
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,770
<22-4,Cuddy>保姆有点急事
<22-4,Cuddy>The babysitter had an emergency.

407
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,670
<22-5,Wilson>哦... 你喜欢那个80年代舞会吗?
<22-5,Wilson>Oh...how did you like '80s night?

408
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,070
<22-6,Cuddy>House告诉你了?
<22-6,Cuddy>House talked with you?

409
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,770
<22-7,Wilson>我有种微妙的感觉
<22-7,Wilson>I was being subtle about it.

410
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,740
<22-7,Wilson>你突然就离开了
<22-7,Wilson>You left suddenly.

411
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,030
<22-7,Wilson>- 我知道House有时会很过分... - 不 他很好
<22-7,Wilson>- I know house can be  a little much sometimes... - no,he was sweet.

412
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,820
<22-8,Cuddy>我只是学乖了 知道不能依赖他
<22-8,Cuddy>I just know better than to rely on that.

413
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,030
<22-9,Wilson>- 他在努力了 - 对 我知道
<22-9,Wilson>- He's trying. - Yeah. I know.

414
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,270
<22-10,Cuddy>我现在是个母亲了
<22-10,Cuddy>I'm a mother now.

415
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,110
<22-10,Cuddy>我需要一个任何时候都能依靠的人
<22-10,Cuddy>I need a guy I can count on every single day.

416
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,030
<22-10,Cuddy>那人绝不会是House
<22-10,Cuddy>That's never been house.

417
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,620
<23-1,Foreman>不是迷奸药
<23-1,Foreman>It's not rufies.

418
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,390
<23-1,Foreman>她的肾脏后方在出血
<23-1,Foreman>She's bleeding behind her kidneys.

419
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,120
<23-1,Foreman>又输了两袋红细胞 但她还在出血
<23-1,Foreman>We're transfusing another two units packed red cells,but she keeps springing leaks.

420
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,370
<23-2,Cameron>看起来像是中毒反应
<23-2,Cameron>It looks like a toxic reaction.

421
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,950
<23-2,Cameron>Keener肯定给她吃过什么
<23-2,Cameron>Keener must have given her something.

422
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,800
<23-3,Chase>他是个漫画家 不是毒贩
<23-3,Chase>The guy's a comic book writer,not a drug dealer.

423
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,040
<23-4,Cameron>很多毒物都没法在标准毒筛中测出来 但他是不会告诉我们的
<23-4,Cameron>There's a lot that wouldn't show up in a standard tox screen.But he's never gonna tell us the truth.

424
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,660
<23-5,Foreman>她也不会告诉我们
<23-5,Foreman>Not gonna get the truth out of her either.

425
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,050
<23-6,Cameron>如果我们给她下药的话 她就会说
<23-6,Cameron>We will if we drug her.

426
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,940
<23-6,Cameron>异戊巴比妥会抑制她的丘脑活动
<23-6,Cameron>Amobarbital would suppress her thalamus.

427
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,270
<23-7,Chase>她在用抗心律不齐的药 异戊巴比妥可能会导致心脏停跳
<23-7,Chase>She's on antiarrhythmics.Amobarbital could stop her heart.

428
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,760
<23-8,Cameron>她已经要死了
<23-8,Cameron>She's already dying.

429
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,060
<23-9,Chase>你在生我的气
<23-9,Chase>You're angry at me.

430
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,160
<23-9,Chase>你怪罪在这男人身上 是因为你觉得他也在说谎
<23-9,Chase>You're taking it out on this guy 'cause you think  he's lying to you too.

431
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,140
<23-9,Chase>你会害死病人的
<23-9,Chase>And you're gonna kill our patient in the process.

432
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,240
<23-10,Foreman>- 我们得知道真相 - 我们该打电话给House
<23-10,Foreman>- We need to know the truth. - We should call house.

433
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,810
<24-1,House>对 他会叫我们小心点
<24-1,House>Yeah. He'll recommend we take the cautious approach.

434
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,350
<24-2,Wilson>- 要饼干吗? - 这些会记在我的信用卡上 7块一包
<24-2,Wilson>- Pretzel? - Those are gonna show up on my credit card at seven bucks a bag.

435
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,420
<24-2,Wilson>楼下有自助餐
<24-2,Wilson>There's an all-you-can-eat buffet downstairs.

436

<24-6,Wilson>I just spoke with cuddy.She doesn't think you're reliable.

<24-6,Wilson>在她改主意之前 你们只会是朋友
<24-6,Wilson>And you will remain friend-zoned  until that changes.

444
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,520
<24-7,House>我没法让她相信仅一个周末 我就完全改变了性格
<24-7,House>I can't convince her  that I've changed my entire personality in a weekend.

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,550
<24-8,Wilson>对 但你可以采取主动
<24-8,Wilson>Yeah,but you could make the first step.

446
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,300
<24-9,House>- 她需要什么? - 今天需要一个保姆
<24-9,House>- What does she need? - Today,a babysitter.

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,020
<24-13,House>但你却表现得不相信我能做到
<24-13,House>and yet you act like you don't believe I can.

455
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,730
<24-14,Wilson>她还是没你比较好
<24-14,Wilson>She's better off without you.

456
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,600
<24-15,House>这么说会伤人的
<24-15,House>Words can hurt,you know.

457

<25-1,Jordan>我以为吐真剂只会出现在 那些差劲的间谍片里
<25-1,Jordan>I thought truth serum was only stuff they gave people in lame spy movies.

<25-3,Cameron>那晚去他房间之后 你和 Jeffrey Keener之间发生了什么?
<25-3,Cameron>What happened between you and jeffrey keener   the night you went up to his room?

461
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,570
<25-4,Jordan>我都不敢相信他和我说话了
<25-4,Jordan>I couldn't believe he even talked to me.

462
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,130
<25-4,Jordan>我告诉他 他的作品对我来说意味深刻
<25-4,Jordan>I told him how much his work means to me.

463
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,810
<25-5,Chase>我知道自己听起来就像个白痴
<25-5,Chase>I figured I must sound like a moron.

464
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,230
<25-7,Cameron>但他人很好
<25-7,Cameron>But he was nice about it.

465
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,050
<25-8,Jordan>他说我很特别
<25-8,Jordan>He said I was special.

466
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,870
<25-5,Chase>心跳加速
<25-5,Chase>Heart rate's increasing.

467
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,810
<25-6,Foreman>140 可以接受 让她说
<25-6,Foreman>140's acceptable.Let her talk.

468
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,800
<25-7,Cameron>他有没有给过你什么? 喝的或者是药片?
<25-7,Cameron>Did he give you anything?A drink,pills?

469
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,250
<25-8,Jordan>他说那是迷幻药
<25-8,Jordan>He said it was ecstasy.

470
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,940
<25-8,Jordan>但看着不像 也没有迷幻药的感觉
<25-8,Jordan>But it didn't look like ecstasy,and it didn't really make me feel how ecstasy usually does.

471
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,820
<25-9,Cameron>那你是什么感觉?
<25-9,Cameron>How did it make you feel?

472
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,920
<25-10,Jordan>让我感觉很累
<25-10,Jordan>It just made me really tired.

473
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,640
<25-11,Cameron>看起来什么样子? 胶囊还是药片?
<25-11,Cameron>What did it look like?A capsule?Tablet?

474
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,060
<25-13,Chase>- 是药片 圆的 - 可能是锂
<25-13,Chase>- It was a tablet.Round. - Could be lithium.

475
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,060
<25-14,Jordan>然后他开始碰我
<25-14,Jordan>He just started touching me.

476
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,530
<25-14,Jordan>一开始感觉还不错
<25-14,Jordan>At first it seemed nice.

477
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,850
<25-14,Jordan>但之后... 我不想污蔑他
<25-14,Jordan>But then... I didn't want to insult him.

478
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,710
<25-15,Foreman>够了
<25-15,Foreman>That's enough.

479
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,240
<25-16,Jordan>我很抱歉
<25-16,Jordan>I'm so sorry.

480
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:54,350
<25-16,Jordan>我很爱你们 但我... 我感觉我让你们失望了
<25-16,Jordan>I love you guys so much,and I just-- I feel like I've let you down.

481
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,900
<25-17,Derek>我要杀了他 我要杀了那个混蛋
<25-17,Derek>I'm gonna kill him.I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

482
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,650
<25-18,Foreman>先别急 看这个
<25-18,Foreman>Before you do that,look here.

483
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,000
<25-18,Foreman>眶骨膜处的血流量增加
<25-18,Foreman>Increased periorbital blood flow throughout.

484
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,290
<25-18,Foreman>说明她说的都是谎话
<25-18,Foreman>It means everything she's been saying has been a lie.

485
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,080
<25-19,Michelle>都是谎话?
<25-19,Michelle>Everything?

486
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,650
<25-20,Derek>那你还是不知道她怎么了?
<25-20,Derek>S-so you still don't know what's wrong with her?

487
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,090
<25-21,Foreman>抱歉
<25-21,Foreman>Sorry.

488
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,300
<26-1,Cuddy>噢 我还以为是客房服务
<26-1,Cuddy>Oh,I thought you were room service.

489
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,100
<26-1,Cuddy>你的病人出问题了?
<26-1,Cuddy>Something going on with your patient?

490
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,150
<26-2,House>里面很安静 Rachel睡了?
<26-2,House>It's quiet in there.Is rachel asleep?

491
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,190
<26-2,House>我想你也许需要一个保姆
<26-2,House>I thought maybe you could use a babysitter.

492
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,490
<26-3,Cuddy>实际上 我把她送到楼下的日托中心去了
<26-3,Cuddy>Actually,I've got her in day care downstairs.

493
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,010

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,610
<26-6,House>- 嗨 House - 嗨 Lucas
<26-6,House>- Hey,house. - Hey,lucas.

<26-7,Lucas>- 这可真尴尬 - 有点
<26-7,Lucas>- This is awkward. - A bit.

497
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,490
<26-8,House>我走了大概就不会尴尬了吧
<26-8,House>That awkwardness would probably go away if I left.

498
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,070
<27-2,Wilson>我是Foreman 想告诉House病情进展 但他关机了
<27-2,Wilson>It's foreman.I'm trying to update house,but his phone's off.

499

<27-5,Foreman>病人失血比我们输血的速度还快
<27-5,Foreman>Patient's losing blood faster than we can transfuse.

502

<27-5,Foreman>Cameron上网搜查发现Keener带着狗旅行 --我们想按照立克次体治疗
<27-5,Foreman>Cameron did an online search and found out keener travels with his dog-- we're treating for rickettsia.

<27-5,Foreman>- 知道他现在哪儿么? - 噢！不！
<27-5,Foreman>- Any idea where he is? - Oh,no!

<28-5,House>"i told him too much morphine would kill him,"but not to worry.

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,520
<29-4,House>而且你的工作也保住了 那是我的文章
<29-4,House>And your job is safe.That was my paper.

546
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,690
<29-5,Wilson>你不问我想要什么 不顾我的意愿 你对我下药了
<29-5,Wilson>You don't ask what I want,you ignore my wishes,you drug me.

547
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,160
<29-6,House>我在等你为我们关系重新命名
<29-6,House>I'm waiting for you to name something new to our relationship.

548
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,650
<29-6,House>你没理由对我生气
<29-6,House>You've got no good reason to be angry with me.

549
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,350
<29-7,Wilson>真的吗? 我应该感谢你?
<29-7,Wilson>Oh,really?I should be thanking you?

550
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,900
<29-8,House>如果这是为了让文章公之于众 那是的
<29-8,House>If this was about getting the story out there,then yeah.

551
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,160
<29-8,House>当然 如果这是为了别的什么...
<29-8,House>Of course,if this is actually about something else...

552
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,110
<29-8,House>可能病人奄奄一息 让你觉得无能为力 你需要做一些伟岸的 愚蠢的举动
<29-8,House>maybe you feeling impotent because patients keep dying and you think you need to make some grand,stupid gesture-

553
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,520
<29-8,House>你想当个英雄-- 那么 对不起
<29-8,House>you need to be a hero-- well,then,yeah,sorry.

554
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,960
<29-8,House>我确实搞糟了
<29-8,House>I did screw it up.

555
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,860
<29-9,Wilson>你太过分了 这不是你的决定
<29-9,Wilson>You stepped over the line.This was not your decision.

556
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:40,920
<29-10,House>我的上帝 这个国家有10,000个肿瘤学家
<29-10,House>My god,there are 10,000 oncologists in this country.

557
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,540
<29-10,House>每个人都死过病人
<29-10,House>Every one of them loses patients.

558
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,980
<29-10,House>但只有你会感觉内疚...
<29-10,House>But only you would feel guilty enough...

559
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,880
<29-11,Wilson>当然了 连吵架也不能按照我的时间表
<29-11,Wilson>of course,we can't even argue on my schedule.

560
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,330
<29-12,House>我是House
<29-12,House>It's house.

561
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,410
<29-12,House>把袋子取下来
<29-12,House>Take down the bags.

562
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,480
<30-1,Chase>- 现在判断药物是否有效还太早- - 不是药袋子
<30-1,Chase>- It's too soon to tell if the meds are gonna--  it's not the meds.

563
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,530
<30-2,House>要她命的是那些血
<30-2,House>It's the blood that's killing her.

564
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,970
<30-2,House>大家什么反应 你们都大吃一惊了 是吧?
<30-2,House>What's everybody doing?You're stunned,right?

565
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,360
<30-3,Michelle>- 我是说 血? - 她有内出血
<30-3,Michelle>- I mean,blood? - She's had internal bleeding.

566
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,120
<30-3,Michelle>- 她需要血来? - 这是她妈妈吗?
<30-3,Michelle>- She needs the blood to-- is that the mom?

567
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,940
<30-4,House>如果是的话 我能解释下
<30-4,House>I've got a good comeback if it's the mom.

568
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
<30-5,Michelle>是的 我是她的母亲
<30-5,Michelle>Yes,I'm her mother.

569
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,880
<30-6,House>当然 她需要血 如果你想杀死她的话
<30-6,House>Sure,she needs blood,if you want to kill her.

570
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,550
<30-6,House>你就没人可忽略的了? 好主意
<30-6,House>Then you'd have nobody left to neglect--great plan.

571
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:35,530
<30-6,House>你的女儿感染了致伤弧菌 美味的牡蛎的附赠品
<30-6,House>Your daughter has vibrio vulnificus,courtesy of a few scrumptious oysters on the half shell.

572
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,450
<30-7,Jordan>我没有吃过牡蛎
<30-7,Jordan>I didn't eat any oysters.

573
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,060
<30-8,House>这就证明了她吃了 伙计们 这真棒
<30-8,House>Thus proving that she did.Boy,that's neat.

574
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,160
<30-9,Chase>100个人都吃了那些牡蛎
<30-9,Chase>100 other people ate those oysters.

575
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,180
<30-10,House>- 我也吃了 - 是她爸爸吗?
<30-10,House>- I ate-- is that the dad?

576
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,640
<30-10,House>- 我能解释 - 是Chase
<30-10,House>- I've got a good comeback-- it's chase.

577
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,350
<30-12,House>我还想她爸爸可能也是个澳洲人
<30-12,House>Oh,I thought the dad might've been australian too.

578
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,020
<30-12,House>牡蛎没问题 牡蛎都有弧菌
<30-12,House>There was nothing wrong with the oysters.All oysters have vibrio.

579
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,440
<30-12,House>但是几乎没人有血色沉着病
<30-12,House>But almost no one has hemochromatosis.

580
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,730
<30-12,House>血色沉着病让弧菌易感 导致了肿胀
<30-12,House>It'd give here a unique susceptibility to vibrio,cause the swollen joints.

581
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,180
<30-12,House>但却被误归于暴食症 所以给她用营养剂
<30-12,House>But it got attributed to bulimia,so she got supplements.

582
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,920
<30-14,House>- 那含铁 - 铁把肝脏烧坏了 导致了出血
<30-14,House>- With iron. - Which overcooked the liver,which caused bleeding.

583
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,980
<30-14,House>输血 加铁 流血 输血
<30-14,House>More blood,more iron,more bleeding,more blood.

584
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,670
<30-15,Michelle>她会好起来吗?
<30-15,Michelle>Is she going to be okay?

585
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,380
<30-16,House>除非给她用高剂量的头孢他啶治疗弧菌 螯合治疗血色沉着
<30-16,House>Only if we give her high-dose ceftazidime  for the vibrio and chelate for the hemochromatosis.

586
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,460
<30-16,House>现在 Cameron 拿起电话 给我来个戏剧性的退场
<30-16,House>Now,cameron,pick up the phone and give me a dramatic exit.

587
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,570
<31-1,House>那么...你们两个疯孩子是怎么勾搭上的?
<31-1,House>So...how'd you two crazy kids hook up?

588
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,550
<31-2,Cuddy>我怀疑会计部有人偷钱 我想私下调查
<31-2,Cuddy>I suspected someone in accounting was skimming money,and I wanted to investigate quietly.

589
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,750
<31-2,Cuddy>我唯一认识的私家侦探是你介绍的
<31-2,Cuddy>And since you introduced me to the only detective I know...

590
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,530
<31-2,Cuddy>事情一件接一件发生
<31-2,Cuddy>and one thing leads to another.

591
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,330
<31-3,House>为什么保密?
<31-3,House>Why keep it a secret?

592
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,550
<31-3,House>你是在我脆弱的时候保护我么?
<31-3,House>You protecting me in my fragile state?

593
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,380
<31-3,House>你觉得我是个疯子 如果听到坏消息的时机不对 就会错乱?
<31-3,House>You think I was an unhinged looney  who was about to go off the rails at a badly timed bit of news?

594
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,100
<31-4,Cuddy>我只是不想私生活太招摇
<31-4,Cuddy>I just don't advertise my personal life.

595
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,720
<31-4,Cuddy>我需要有人帮助照顾宝宝 Lucas赶来了
<31-4,Cuddy>I needed help with the baby.Lucas drove up.

596
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,120
<31-5,Lucas>是的 她很担心 是有一点担心
<31-5,Lucas>Yeah. She was worried. A little worried.

597
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,240
<31-5,Lucas>像朋友那样
<31-5,Lucas>As a friend.

598
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,380
<31-5,Lucas>我必须躲在房间里 见不得光
<31-5,Lucas>I had to hide in our room and be the dirty little secret.

599
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,500
<31-5,Lucas>有点不爽
<31-5,Lucas>Kinda sucked.

600
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,150
<31-7,Lucas>我告诉她这没有必要 你有想跟她上床的幻想
<31-7,Lucas>I told her it wasn't necessary.So you had some hallucination  about having sex with her.

601
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,790
<31-7,Lucas>- 我觉得我们没有必要谈论- - 我意思是 我总是想象和女人上床
<31-7,Lucas>- I don't think we need to talk-- I mean,I imagine having sex with women all the time.

602
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,150
<31-7,Lucas>没什么大不了的
<31-7,Lucas>No big deal.

603
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,670
<31-7,Lucas>当然要是她们知道我想象的内容 会很尴尬
<31-7,Lucas>Though I guess if they knew what I imagine,it could get awkward.

604
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,050
<31-7,Lucas>我猜这有点不同 因为在你的幻想中 她是你的救赎者
<31-7,Lucas>And I guess it's different because in the fantasy,she was your savior.

605
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,650
<31-7,Lucas>但 那也是几个月前的事了 对吗?
<31-7,Lucas>But I mean,that was months ago,right?

606
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,610
<31-8,House>好不容易你才能恢复理智 -进了精神病院
<31-8,House>All the work that you had to do to get straight-- you've been institutionalized.

607
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,110
<31-8,House>你有更重要的事情要做 我该闭嘴了
<31-8,House>You've had way bigger stuff to deal with.I should shut up.

608
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,980
<31-8,House>你要一杯姜汁汽水吗?
<31-8,House>Can I buy you a ginger ale?

609
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,690
<31-8,House>姜汁汽水不错 要加柠檬
<31-8,House>A ginger ale would be good.With lemon.

610
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,000
<32-1,Cameron>感染清除干净了 你几天后就能出院了
<32-1,Cameron>Infection's clearing up nicely.You should be out of here in a few days.

611
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,430
<32-2,Derek>那太好了
<32-2,Derek>Oh,that is wonderful.

612

<32-4,Michelle>亲爱的 你爸爸和我觉得我们应该放个假
<32-4,Michelle>Sweetie,your father and I think  we should reward ourselves with a little time off.

614

<32-5,Derek>那个会议得等上几周
<32-5,Derek>That meeting's gonna have to wait a couple of weeks.

615
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,020
<32-5,Derek>我们还不能走
<32-5,Derek>We're staying here.

616
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,330
<32-6,Michelle>你想去什么地方
<32-6,Michelle>You should think about where you'd like to go.

617
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,320
<32-7,Derek>亲爱的 他们说奠基的设计图纸错了
<32-7,Derek>Honey,they're saying the specs are wrong for the whole foundation.

618
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,520
<32-7,Derek>你能跟他们说说吗?
<32-7,Derek>Can you at least come talk to 'em?

<32-15,Jordan>我甚至没勇气敲门
<32-15,Jordan>I never even got up the courage to knock on his door.

<33-1,Cuddy>小冰箱又装满了
<33-1,Cuddy>Minibar is restocked.

<35-1,House>- 我们拿些小饼干路上吃吧- - 当你也像我那么做时
<35-1,House>- I say we grab some pretzels for the road-- when you do what I did,

632
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,740
<35-2,Wilson>光是告诉自己你没做错是不够的
<35-2,Wilson>it's not enough to tell yourself you did nothing wrong.

633
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,780
<35-2,Wilson>你必须从别人嘴里听到
<35-2,Wilson>You need to hear it from someone else.

634
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,490
<35-2,Wilson>如果没得到上帝或者社会的原谅 那就得有朋友支持
<35-2,Wilson>If not god or society,a friend.

635
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,830
<35-2,Wilson>否则你会疯的

<35-2,Wilson>你是个好朋友
<35-2,Wilson>You're a good friend.

638
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,730
<35-2,Wilson>Cuddy应该意识到
<35-2,Wilson>Cuddy should know that.

639
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,600
<35-3,House>是 你该让她知道我对你下药 阻止你承认谋杀
<35-3,House>Yeah,you should let her know that I drugged you so you wouldn't confess to murder.

640
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,990
<35-3,House>我们走吧
<35-3,House>Let's get out of here.

641
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,770
<35-4,Wilson>万一有人认出你呢
<35-4,Wilson>Someone could have recognized you.

642

<35-5,House>15年来我第一次参加全美医生联会
<35-5,House>First u.S. Conference I've attended in 15 years.

<35-7,House>I'm sorry.

646
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,870
<36-1,Cameron>我不知道 为什么我总是朝最坏的地方想
<36-1,Cameron>I don't know why I always suspect the worst.

647
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,130
<36-1,Cameron>如果你说你没有外遇 我相信你
<36-1,Cameron>If you say you're not having an affair,you're not having an affair.
