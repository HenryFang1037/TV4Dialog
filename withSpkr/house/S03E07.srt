<12-7,CAMERON>说他吃多了药不能履行医生的职责
<12-7,CAMERON>That he takes too many pills,and is a danger to the hospital?

205
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,680
<12-7,CAMERON>还是说他吃得太少,因为他在囤积兜售?
<12-7,CAMERON>Or he takes too few,because he's selling them on the side?

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,980
<12-7,CAMERON>两者都够荒谬
<12-7,CAMERON>Either one is ridiculous.
