00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,580
<7-6,Wilson >也是一些让你特别恐慌的暗语吗

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,070
<7-6,Wilson >我没想这个
<7-6,Wilson >I am not imagining this.

167

<7-6,Wilson >是她对我的态度很反常
<7-6,Wilson >It's an aberration in the way that she treats me.

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,830
<7-7,Wilson >我怎么能知道这代表什么意思
<7-7,Wilson >How do I find out what it means?

169
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,930
<7-7,Wilson >没必要

<7-8,House >如果我死于这段时间内的好奇呢
<7-8,House >What if I die of curiosity in the meantime?

174
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,970
<7-8,House >你开始骗她已经够白痴了
<7-8,House >You were an idiot for lying to her in the first place.

175
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,210
<7-8,House >别再白痴下去了
<7-8,House >Don't be more of an idiot now.

<8-4,Taub >理论上讲  你会不会对男友格外客气
<8-4,Taub >Would you ever be extra nice to a theoretical boyfriend

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,440
<8-4,Taub >如果你对他很生气的话

188
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,510
<8-4,Taub >我想我格外客气的唯一原因
<8-4,Taub >I guess the only reason I would be extra nice

189
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,980
<8-5,House >应该是我生气了  我想让他离我远点
<8-5,House >is because I'm angry, and I just want him to go away

190
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,680
<8-5,House >这样我就不必理他了
<8-5,House >so I don't have to deal with him anymore.

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,850
<8-5,House >你真是个咄咄逼人的坏女人

195
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,360
<8-8,Masters >意思是我们的猜测都被判出局了
<8-8,Masters >so all of our ideas are off the table.

<8-9,House >我重新缕缕

<9-2,Cuddy >Why didn't you say something?

209
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,500
<9-2,Cuddy >因为我想让你自己来向我道歉

<9-3,House >我没做错是不会道歉的
<9-3,House >I can't apologize if I haven't done anything wrong.

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,930

<11-2,Taub >有治疗的办法  可以用西多福韦
<11-2,Taub >There are treatments. We can give you cidofovir.

<11-3,House >说到底  有30%死亡率
<11-3,House >Bottom line-- it's 30% fatal,

238
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,680
<11-3,House >即是说你活命的概率
<11-3,House >which means your chances of being okay

<11-6,House >奥尼尔罚中球

<11-13,House >说明你得的不是天花
<11-13,House >It means it's not smallpox.

<12-1,Wilson >你是说你理解豪斯的立场
<12-1,Wilson >Are you saying you see House's side?

254
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,790
<12-1,Wilson >根本算不上立场  完全是找借口
<12-1,Wilson >It's not even a side. It's a fictional construction.

255
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,620
<12-2,Sam >她指望豪斯实话实说
<12-2,Sam >She's expecting House not to lie?

256
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,990
<12-2,Sam >她要是靠和豪斯的关系
<12-2,Sam >If she's using the relationship

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,560
<16-6,Broda >你跑来给我个没把握的诊断
<16-6,Broda >You come to me with a weak diagnosis.

397
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,060
<16-6,Broda >我主动提出帮你诊察
<16-6,Broda >I even offer to investigate,

398
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,160
<16-6,Broda >但你还不满意
<16-6,Broda >But that's not good enough for you.

399
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,230
<16-6,Broda >你到底打的什么注意
<16-6,Broda >What's really going on here?

400
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,530
<16-7,Broda >先生
<16-7,Broda >Sir...

401
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
<16-7,Broda >你感到任何不适吗
<16-7,Broda >Are you feeling all right in there?

402
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,040
<16-8,Niles >我头疼
<16-8,Niles >It's just a headache.

403
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,440
<16-9,Lulu >老公
<16-9,Lulu >Baby.

404
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,250
<16-9,Lulu >爸爸
<16-9,Lulu >Dad...

405
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,300
<16-10,Roger >你在流血
<16-10,Roger >You're bleeding.

406
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,620
<16-11,Lulu >快来人啊
<16-11,Lulu >Somebody, please...

407
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,850
<16-11,Lulu >快进来啊
<16-11,Lulu >Get in here now!

408
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,770
<16-12,Broda >这不是脑膜炎球菌
<16-12,Broda >This is not meningococcus.

409
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,830
<16-12,Broda >你不许进来
<16-12,Broda >You're not getting in here.

410
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,280
<17-2,Chases >-酷  -哪里酷  他们家病更重了
<17-2,Chases >- Cool. - Not really--not for them

411
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,870
<17-2,Chases >你也诊断错了  那个爸爸的新症状
<17-2,Chases >and not for you-- the dad's new symptoms

412
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,390
<17-2,Chases >和感染天花病毒相吻合
<17-2,Chases >are consistent with them having smallpox.

413
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,030
<17-3,House >如果他头疼才吻合
<17-3,House >Would be if he had a headache.

414
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,220
<17-4,Chase >他就是头疼啊
<17-4,Chase >He does have a headache.

415
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,580
<17-5,House >不  他只是"噢"了一声  然后捧着头
<17-5,House >No. He just said, "Ow," And held his head.

416
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,850
<17-6,Foreman >事实上  他"噢"了一声
<17-6,Foreman >Actually, he said, "Ow."

417
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,130
<17-6,Foreman >然后说"我头疼"
<17-6,Foreman >Then he said, "It's a headache."

418
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,300
<17-7,House >这只能预示头部有疼痛感
<17-7,House >Which could be indicative of head pain.

419
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,550
<17-7,House >头疼由肌肉紧张
<17-7,House >Headache is caused by

420
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,500
<17-7,House >或者血管拉伸引起
<17-7,House >muscle tension or vascular stretching.

421
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,020
<17-7,House >而头部疼痛感是由创伤引起
<17-7,House >Head pain is caused by trauma, which would include

422
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,630
<17-7,House >比如说结核导致的脑出血
<17-7,House >Such events as a bleed in the brain from T.B.

423
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,810
<17-8,Taub >-又回到结核了  -一直在说它
<17-8,Taub >- We're back to T.B.? - We never left.

424
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,540
<17-9,House >我们需要做个断层扫描
<17-9,House >We'll need to do a C.T.

425
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,160
<17-10,Foreman >我有预感疾控中心的人
<17-10,Foreman >And I sort of have a hunch that the CDC's

426
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,330
<17-10,Foreman >是不会同意我们移动病人的
<17-10,Foreman >not gonna approve of us moving the patient.

427
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,780
<17-11,House >奇斯  能和你去外面说两句吗
<17-11,House >Chase, can I talk to you outside for a second?

428
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,260
<18-1,Chase >你用过这招了
<18-1,Chase >You just tried this.

429
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,640
<18-1,Chase >我撒谎水平不比福曼高
<18-1,Chase >I'm not a better liar than Foreman.

430
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,420
<18-2,House >你比他强多了
<18-2,House >Sure, you are.

431
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,230
<18-2,House >你可是罪犯的传人啊
<18-2,House >You're descended from convicts.

433
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,130
<18-2,House >况且这次不需要说谎
<18-2,House >Plus, there's no lie this time.

434
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,500
<18-2,House >我们挂羊头卖狗肉
<18-2,House >It's a bait and switch.

435
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,200
<18-2,House >你提出个做气脑造影的建议
<18-2,House >You propose that we don't have to move him

436
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,670
<18-2,House >气脑造影:将脑脊液放出,代之以气体(空气或氧气)
<18-2,House >使脑室密度降低,以在X光片上显影的检查方法

437
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,830
<18-2,House >这样我们就不用转移病人
<18-2,House >if we do a pneumoencephalograph.

438
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,550
<18-3,Chase >这是60年前的技术  很多病人因此丧命
<18-3,Chase >That's 60-year-old technology that killed patients.

439
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,420
<18-4,House >就要这个效果
<18-4,House >Exactly.

440
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,950
<18-4,House >他会做出让步允许我们做断层扫描
<18-4,House >He'll compromise on the C.T.

441
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,210
<18-5,Chase >他可不是卡迪
<18-5,Chase >This isn't Cuddy.

442
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,630
<18-5,Chase >你这种绝地武士式的思维控制对他不管用
<18-5,Chase >Your Jedi mind tricks won't work here.

444
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,730
<18-5,Chase >这不是你们要找的机器人
<18-5,Chase >These aren't the droids you're looking for.

445
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,750
<18-6,Masters >你不信任我
<18-6,Masters >You don't trust me.

446
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,610
<18-7,House >背着你做事情
<18-7,House >Going behind your back

447
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,180
<18-7,House >不被你发现效果更好
<18-7,House >works better when you're not facing us.

448
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,620
<18-8,Masters >不管你打算对布洛塔说什么谎
<18-8,Masters >Instead of whatever lie you're gonna tell Broda,

449
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,620
<18-8,Masters >何不告诉他真相呢
<18-8,Masters >why don't you just tell him the truth?

450
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,860
<18-8,Masters >如果我们坦诚相待  跟他讲明白道理
<18-8,Masters >If we are honest and reasonable--

451
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,220
<18-9,House >全世界的人民  无论种族宗教
<18-9,House >People of all races and creeds

452
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,690
<18-9,House >都能够和平共处  和谐生存
<18-9,House >will live together in peace and harmony.

453
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,530
<18-10,Masters >之前的计划结果如何
<18-10,Masters >How did your first plan work out?

454
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,670
<18-11,House >按你说的办吧
<18-11,House >Permission granted.

455
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,270
<18-12,Masters >谢谢
<18-12,Masters >Thank you.

456
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,870
<18-13,House >她被拒绝后  马上按我们的计划行事
<18-13,House >After she gets denied, do the bait and switch.

457
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,690
<19-1,Wilson >他们不让你妈妈回到医院来
<19-1,Wilson >They won't let your mommy back in the hospital

458
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,030
<19-1,Wilson >是因为楼下发生了紧急事件
<19-1,Wilson >because of an emergency downstairs.

459
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,260
<19-1,Wilson >但我们真得开始化疗了
<19-1,Wilson >But we have to get started.

460
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,350
<19-2,Eve >羊羊不在我不干
<19-2,Eve >I can't do it without my Lamby.

461
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,290
<19-2,Eve >她是谁呀
<19-2,Eve >Who is she?

462
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,520
<19-3,Sam >谁都不是  我马上就走
<19-3,Sam >I'm nobody. I'm leaving soon.

463
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,220
<19-4,Wilson >她叫萨姆  是我的朋友
<19-4,Wilson >Her name is Sam, and she's a friend of mine.

464
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,200
<19-4,Wilson >你平时化疗的时候  羊羊都干点什么呢
<19-4,Wilson >What does Lamby usually do while you get your treatment?

465
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,830
<19-5,Eve >他会握着我的手
<19-5,Eve >He holds my hand.

466
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,270
<19-6,Wilson >你可以握着我的手呀
<19-6,Wilson >Well, you could hold my hand.

467
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,870
<19-7,Eve >这不管用
<19-7,Eve >That won't work.

468
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,840
<19-7,Eve >有的时候我们必须做一些
<19-7,Eve >Well, sometimes we have to do things

469
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,740
<19-7,Eve >我们不想做的事情
<19-7,Eve >that we don't want to do.

470
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,580
<19-8,Eve >比如必须上学  必须吃蔬菜
<19-8,Eve >You have to go to school. You have to eat your vegetables.

471
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
<19-8,Eve >必须吃药

473
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,850
<19-8,Eve >我要妈妈
<19-8,Eve >I want my mommy.

474
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,220
<19-8,Eve >好
<19-8,Eve >Yeah.

475
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,250
<19-9,Wilson >我马上就回来
<19-9,Wilson >I'll be right back.

476
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,800
<19-9,Wilson >我相信在楼下商店里能找到
<19-9,Wilson >You know, I'm pretty sure Lamby has a cousin

477
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,060
<19-9,Wilson >羊羊的兄弟姐妹
<19-9,Wilson >down in the gift shop.

478
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
<20-1,House >稍等一下
<20-1,House >Hold off a minute.

479
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,080
<20-1,House >现在是加时赛
<20-1,House >I'm in overtime.

480
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,650
<20-2,Masters >布洛塔同意给孩子爸爸做断层扫描
<20-2,Masters >Uh, Broda agreed to C.T. The dad's brain.

481
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
<20-3,House >真没意思
<20-3,House >Well, that sucks.

482
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,250
<20-4,Masters >这不是你想要的结果么
<20-4,Masters >But I thought that's what you wanted.

483
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
<20-5,House >不应该通过讲实话得来
<20-5,House >I shouldn't have gotten it with the truth.

484
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,820
<20-5,House >他是个伪君子
<20-5,House >He's a hypocrite.

485
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,410
<20-5,House >从他到这儿起立场完全是...
<20-5,House >His position ever since he's been here has been--

486
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,790
<20-6,Masters >我跟他说  如果我们对了
<20-6,Masters >I-I pointed out that either we're right,

487
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,880
<20-6,Masters >他就是化解这次危机的英雄
<20-6,Masters >and he's the hero for ending the crisis,

488
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,910
<20-6,Masters >如果他对了  他就可以第一个看到
<20-6,Masters >or he's right, and he gets to be the first person

489
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,700
<20-6,Masters >感染天花的大脑
<20-6,Masters >to look at a brain infected with smallpox.

491
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,750
<20-6,Masters >三十年前断层扫描还没发明
<20-6,Masters >C.T. scans weren't around 30 years ago.

492
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,960
<20-7,House >干得不错
<20-7,House >Good work.

493
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,190
<21-1,Masters >看来诚实真是上上策
<21-1,Masters >So I guess honesty is the best policy.

494
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,730
<21-2,House >说这话干嘛  真的
<21-2,House >Why'd you say that? Seriously...

495
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,430
<21-2,House >想表明你的观点  好像我还不知道似的
<21-2,House >To establish your viewpoint, as if I didn't already know it,

496
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,570
<21-2,House >还是想展示你跟卡迪
<21-2,House >or to demonstrate some weird

497
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,200
<21-2,House >有种灵异的跨越代沟的姊妹情谊
<21-2,House >cross-generational female solidarity with Cuddy?

498
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,110
<21-3,Masters >我只想缓解一下没话可说的尴尬局面
<21-3,Masters >Actually, I was just trying to fill the awkward silence.

499
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,380
<21-4,House >他们怎么停下了
<21-4,House >Why have they stopped?

500
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,350
<21-5,Masters >你不能过去
<21-5,Masters >You can't go out there.

501
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,450
<21-6,House >你们怎么停下了
<21-6,House >Why did you stop?

502
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,720
<21-7,Broda >快离开走廊
<21-7,Broda >Get out of the hallway.

503
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,520
<21-8,House >他又没感染天花
<21-8,House >He does not have smallpox.

504
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,960
<21-9,Broda >他也得了
<21-9,Broda >Yes, he does.

505
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,950
<21-9,Broda >好痒
<21-9,Broda >It itches.

506
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,090
<21-10,Broda >他身上刚刚出现脓疱
<21-10,Broda >He's just developed pustules.

507
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,390
<21-10,Broda >现在转移他的风险太大了
<21-10,Broda >He's now too dangerous to transport.

508
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,300
<21-7,Broda >快离开走廊
<21-7,Broda >Get out of the hallway.

509
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,880
<22-2,Masters >孩子爸爸的生命体征很差
<22-2,Masters >Dad's vitals are in the toilet.

<22-1,House >他女儿怎么样了
<22-1,House >What about the daughter?

512
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,670
<22-2,Masters >脓疱数量剧增  生命体征特极差
<22-2,Masters >Pustule count is way up. Vitals are way down.

513
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,090
<22-2,Masters >说明我想错了
<22-2,Masters >Means I was wrong.

514
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,130
<23-1,House >但准确地讲  在我想错之前我是对的
<23-1,House >But to be precise, I was right before I was wrong, so...

515
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,930
<23-2,Masters >我们就这样放弃回家了
<23-2,Masters >So we just give up and go home?

516
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
<23-3,Foreman >事实上医院大门紧锁
<23-3,Foreman >Actually, somebody locked the front door,

517
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,210
<23-3,Foreman >但我们确实只能放弃了
<23-3,Foreman >but, yeah, we... give up.

518
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,460
<23-4,Masters >-我们应该继续  -我们已经做出诊断
<23-4,Masters >- We might as well keep... - We have our diagnosis.

519
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,310
<23-5,House >如果你想积极表现  可以去找个新病人
<23-5,House >If you're eager, you can go find us a new case.

520
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,700
<23-6,Foreman >她要么是太积极了  要么就是无法理解讽刺
<23-6,Foreman >I guess she's eager or has a blind spot for sarcasm.

521
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,740
<24-1,Masters >我只想看看她胳膊下面的脓疱
<24-1,Masters >I just want to look at the rash under her arm

522
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,990
<24-1,Masters >看看是否已经成熟
<24-1,Masters >to see if it's matured--

523
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,800
<24-2,Broda >-你可以隔着玻璃看  -我想更近一些
<24-2,Broda >- You can look through the glass. - I need to be closer.

524
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,430
<24-3,Masters >如果脓疱发展的程度不一致
<24-3,Masters >If the pustules are at a different stage--

525
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,470
<24-4,Broda >她现在没有痛苦
<24-4,Broda >She's comfortable.

526
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,860
<24-4,Broda >八个小时后结果就出来了
<24-4,Broda >We're gonna have our results back in eight hours.

527
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,010
<24-4,Broda >如果不是天花  可以让你第一个进去看
<24-4,Broda >If it's not smallpox, you can be the first one in there.

528
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,220
<24-5,Julie >你站在外面干什么
<24-5,Julie >Why are you just standing out there?

529
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,290
<24-6,Masters >我只是想帮你
<24-6,Masters >I'm just trying to help.

530
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,380
<24-6,Masters >不知道你有没有力气
<24-6,Masters >If you're feeling up to it,

531
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,090
<24-6,Masters >坐起来让我看一下你胳膊下面的脓疱
<24-6,Masters >can you sit up and show me the rash under your arm?

532
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,690
<24-6,Masters >等等
<24-6,Masters >Uh, wait.

533
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,760
<24-6,Masters >你脚掌上一个脓疱都没有
<24-6,Masters >The soles of your feet. There aren't any lesions.

534
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,470
<24-7,Julie >管脚掌干吗
<24-7,Julie >Who cares?

535
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,010
<24-7,Julie >别的地方到处都是  简直是在受刑
<24-7,Julie >They're everywhere else. This is torture.

536
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,410
<25-1,Wilson >伊芙
<25-1,Wilson >Eve?

537
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,400
<25-1,Wilson >猜猜谁来医院看你了
<25-1,Wilson >Guess who came by the hospital for a visit?

538
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,480
<25-1,Wilson >伊芙你好
<25-1,Wilson >Hello, Eve.

539
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,350
<25-1,Wilson >哦  不
<25-1,Wilson >Oh, no!

540
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,190
<25-1,Wilson >好吧
<25-1,Wilson >All right.

541
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,790
<25-1,Wilson >我去叫几个特别和蔼的护士来
<25-1,Wilson >I'm gonna get a couple of nice nurses to come in here,

542
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,830
<25-1,Wilson >帮你们两个做好化疗准备  行吗
<25-1,Wilson >and get you two ready for the treatment, all right?

543
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,230
<25-1,Wilson >好的
<25-1,Wilson >Okay.

544
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,470
<25-2,Sam >为什么羊羊可以进来妈妈却不行
<25-2,Sam >How come Lamby can be here but mommy can't?

545
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,830
<25-2,Sam >羊羊有点脏  我们给他洗了个澡
<25-2,Sam >Lamby was dirty. Um, we gave her a bath.

546
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,850
<25-3,Eve >它不是羊羊
<25-3,Eve >This isn't lamby!

547
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,290
<26-1,Masters >朱莉得的不是天花
<26-1,Masters >Julie doesn't have smallpox.

548
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,490
<26-2,House >刚才终于认同了天花的诊断
<26-2,House >Did I just dream the part

549
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,060
<26-2,House >难道我当时是在做梦
<26-2,House >where I finally agreed it was smallpox?

550
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,160
<26-2,House >如果我以为是事实的东西
<26-2,House >Well, if what I thought was reality

551
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,970
<26-2,House >实际上是梦境  那反之亦然
<26-2,House >was actually a dream, then the reverse...

552
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,200
<26-2,House >哦  天呐
<26-2,House >Oh, my god.

553
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,940
<26-2,House >我曾经跟嘎嘎夫人和碧昂丝一起玩3P
<26-2,House >I had a threesome with Beyonce and Lady Gaga.

554
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,530
<26-3,Masters >她手掌和脚掌上
<26-3,Masters >She doesn't have pustules on her palms

555
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,680
<26-3,Masters >没有脓疱
<26-3,Masters >or the soles of her feet.

556
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,580
<26-4,House >但他爸爸有
<26-4,House >The dad does have pustules there.

557
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,620
<26-4,House >天花怎么跳过她染上她爸的
<26-4,House >So how does he get smallpox, but it skips her?

558
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,800
<26-4,House >我像那样跑出去  你应该跟上
<26-4,House >If I leave like that, you should follow.

559
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,060
<26-4,House >哦
<26-4,House >Oh.

560
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,070
<27-1,House >我们让他染上的
<27-1,House >We gave it to him.

561
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,610
<27-1,House >奇斯哪里去了
<27-1,House >Where's Chase?

562
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,220
<27-1,House >我们并不住在一起  你知道吧
<27-1,House >You do realize we don't all live together, right?

563
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,910
<27-1,House >这样啊...  我们让他感染了天花
<27-1,House >Well, then just.. we gave it to him.

564
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,720
<27-1,House >女儿的手掌上没有脓疱  所以...
<27-1,House >No pustules on the daughter's palms, so...

565
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,750
<27-2,Taub >所以你认为
<27-2,Taub >So therefore your theory is

566
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,350
<27-2,Taub >你让我去抽孩子爸爸的血
<27-2,Taub >you asked me to take the dad's blood,

567
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,050
<27-2,Taub >但我不小心给他注射了天花病毒
<27-2,Taub >but I accidentally injected him with smallpox.

568
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,820
<27-3,House >千真万确  虽然严格来讲是牛痘病毒
<27-3,House >Exactly, although technically, it was the vaccinia virus,

569
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,170
<27-3,House >用来制作天花疫苗的原料
<27-3,House >which is what the smallpox vaccine is made from.

570
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,420
<27-3,House >跟天花症状相同
<27-3,House >Same symptoms as smallpox,

571
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,660
<27-3,House >但毒性只有一半而且几乎不致死
<27-3,House >but only half the calories and almost none of the lethality.

572
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,500
<27-3,House >听起来像个反疫苗狂的言论
<27-3,House >You sound like one of those anti-vaccine cranks.

573
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,860
<27-3,House >接种天花疫苗受感染
<27-3,House >You can't develop full-blown symptoms

574
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,160
<28-1,House >不可能这么快就进入极期
<28-1,House >from the vaccine this quickly.

575
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,100
<27-4,House >免疫功能受损就有可能
<27-4,House >You can if you're immunocompromised.

576
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,000
<27-4,House >只有我读病史吗
<27-4,House >Am I the only one who reads these things?

577
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,740
<27-5,Foreman >-她爸得过肾癌  -六年前的事
<27-5,Foreman >- Dad had kidney cancer. - Six years ago.

578
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,670
<27-5,Foreman >-他已经康复了  -现在显然复发了
<27-5,Foreman >- He's been in remission. - Well, it's obviously back.

579
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,810
<27-6,House >破坏了他的免疫系统
<27-6,House >Shot his immune system,

580
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,450
<27-6,House >使他失去对牛痘病毒的防御能力
<27-6,House >made him vulnerable to the vaccinia,

581
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,460
<27-6,House >用干扰素可以让他好转
<27-6,House >which will get better on interferon.

582
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,410
<27-6,House >所以如果干扰素治疗起作用
<27-6,House >So if he responds to the treatment,

583
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,420
<27-6,House >就能证明他得的不是天花
<27-6,House >that proves he doesn't have smallpox.

584
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,820
<27-7,Taub >那他女儿得的是什么
<27-7,Taub >Then what does the daughter have?

585
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,420
<27-8,House >妈的  我还在幻想你不会问这个问题
<27-8,House >Damn. I was hoping you weren't gonna ask me that.

586
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,700
<27-8,House >麻烦先集中精力对付
<27-8,House >Can we please just focus

587
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,480
<27-8,House >有诊断可治疗的疾病
<27-8,House >on the disease we just diagnosed and can treat?

588
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,630
<28-1,House >你说哪种更有可能
<28-1,House >What's more likely-- he got smallpox

589
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,500
<28-1,House >接种疫苗第二天就感染天花
<28-1,House >the day after we immunized him for it,

590
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,430
<28-1,House >还是疫苗本身使他感染
<28-1,House >or he's sick from the vaccine itself?

591
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,540
<28-2,Broda >你有肾癌复发的证据吗
<28-2,Broda >You got any proof the kidney cancer is back?

592
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,940
<28-3,House >让我给他用这个药
<28-3,House >Well, let me give him this.

593
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,510
<28-3,House >他病情好转就是你想要的证据
<28-3,House >When he gets better, that'll be the proof you need.

594
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,210
<28-3,House >我可以穿上你们的高档太空服
<28-3,House >I'll put on one of your fancy spacesuits,

595
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,980
<28-3,House >而且我保证不会亲吻他的开放性脓疱
<28-3,House >and I promise I won't kiss him on an open sore.

596
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,410
<28-3,House >你知道珍妮特·派克是谁吗
<28-3,House >You know who Janet Parker is?

597
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,610
<28-3,House >1978年
<28-3,House >In 1978,

598
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,150
<28-3,House >她在英国一所大学工作
<28-3,House >she was working at a university in England.

599
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,250
<28-3,House >楼下一间实验室的工作人员出了岔子
<28-3,House >Someone in a research lab on the floor below screwed up.

600
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,470
<35-1,Masters >天花病毒
<35-1,Masters >Some smallpox virus managed to

601
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,990
<35-2,Broda >从通风系统向上飘
<35-2,Broda >float up through the vents

602
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,370
<35-3,Foreman >进入到她的办公室
<35-3,Foreman >into the room where she was working.

603
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,640
<35-4,Broda >四天之后她就死了
<35-4,Broda >She died four days later--

604
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,000
<35-5,Chase >她是已知死于天花的最后一人
<35-5,Chase >the last known person to die from smallpox.

605
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,760
<18-2,House >实验室的负责人自责太深
<18-2,House >And the person in charge of the lab was so destroyed,

606
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
<18-3,Chase >最后自杀了
<18-3,Chase >he killed himself.

607
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,110
<21-10,Broda >他皮肤开始剥落
<21-10,Broda >Now that he's shedding,

608
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,710
<28-7,Broda >我不能放任何人进去
<28-7,Broda >I can't open that door for anyone.

609
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,750
<28-3,House >看  那就是你要的证据
<28-3,House >Look, there's the proof you need.

610
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,200
<28-4,House >尿袋里有血
<28-4,House >There's blood in the urine bag.

611
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,790
<28-4,House >他的肾脏正在衰竭
<28-4,House >His kidneys are shutting down.

612
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,060
<28-5,Broda >他已经到了病程末期
<28-5,Broda >He's in the final stages of the disease.

613
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,980
<28-5,Broda >如果肾衰竭是天花导致的
<28-5,Broda >If smallpox was causing the kidney failure,

614
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,320
<28-6,House >血应该是棕色
<28-6,House >the blood would be brown.

615
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,810
<28-6,House >血呈红色是因为肾癌复发
<28-6,House >It's red because the kidney cancer is back,

616
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,320
<28-6,House >他感染的不是天花
<28-6,House >and this is not smallpox.

617
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,150
<28-7,Broda >我不会把门打开
<28-7,Broda >I'm not opening that door.

618
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,940
<28-8,House >你不开我开
<28-8,House >Well, that makes one of us.

619
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,580
<28-9,Broda >嘿  你简直疯了
<28-9,Broda >Hey! You're insane!

620
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,680
<28-10,House >但我的诊断是正确的
<28-10,House >But I'm right.

621
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,320
<28-10,House >希望你是正确的
<28-10,House >I hope you are,

622
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,190
<28-10,House >因为现在我不能让你出来了
<28-10,House >because I can't let you out now.

623
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,370
<29-1,Cuddy >这就是你的下场
<29-1,Cuddy >This is what happens

624
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,310
<29-1,Cuddy >不尊重权威
<29-1,Cuddy >when you have no respect for authority,

625
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,270
<29-1,Cuddy >不尊重任何人
<29-1,Cuddy >no respect for anything.

626
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,140
<29-2,House >你不觉得有点太过分吗
<29-2,House >You don't think it's a little much

627
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,680
<29-2,House >用死亡相威胁
<29-2,House >to use the threat of death

628
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,380
<29-2,House >来赢取和男友的一场不相干的争吵
<29-2,House >to win a totally separate argument with your boyfriend?

629
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,250
<29-3,Cuddy >你以为我在说另一件事
<29-3,Cuddy >You think this is about the other thing?

630
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,270
<29-4,House >跟那件事情貌似差不离
<29-4,House >Does seem to track suspiciously closely.

631
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,620
<29-4,House >现在我不在乎你对我撒谎
<29-4,House >I don't care right now that you lied to me.

632
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,960
<29-5,House >我要你活下去
<29-5,House >I want you to stay alive.

633
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,890
<29-5,House >如果我活下来了  是不是意味着两场架我都赢了
<29-5,House >And if I do, does that mean I win both arguments?

634
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,360
<29-6,Cuddy >把隔离服穿上
<29-6,Cuddy >Put the suit on.

635
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,670
<29-6,Cuddy >没必要吧  妈
<29-6,Cuddy >It's unnecessary, Mom.

636
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,500
<29-6,Cuddy >这就是为什么我不希望他们告诉你
<29-6,Cuddy >This is why I didn't want them telling you.

637
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,170
<29-7,Lulu >也是为什么我很高兴他们没有告诉威尔森
<29-7,Lulu >It's why I'm glad they didn't tell Wilson.

638
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,570
<29-7,Lulu >豪斯医生
<29-7,Lulu >Dr. House.

639
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,480
<29-8,Niles >我的病情加重了是吗
<29-8,Niles >I'm getting worse, aren't I?

640
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,860
<28-4,House >干扰素发挥效用需要时间
<28-4,House >Interferon takes a little time to work.

641
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,460
<28-5,Broda >别担心
<28-5,Broda >Don't worry.

642
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,240
<28-6,House >告诉布洛塔
<28-6,House >Tell Broda

643
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,140
<28-7,Broda >我在给他加氧
<28-7,Broda >that I'm increasing his oxygen.

644
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,780
<28-7,Broda >把我的小组都叫过来
<28-7,Broda >And get my team down here.

645
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,390
<30-1,Sam >你好啊
<30-1,Sam >Hi.

646
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,430
<30-1,Sam >生我们气了  对不对
<30-1,Sam >You're mad at us, aren't you?

647
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,230
<27-7,Taub >-嗯  -你生气是应该的
<27-7,Taub >- Yeah. - Well, you have a right to be.

648
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,530
<27-8,House >我们骗你了
<27-8,House >We weren't honest.

649
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,300
<30-1,Sam >你可能还不知道
<30-1,Sam >You might not know this yet,

650
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,410
<30-2,Sam >但有时大人会做错事
<30-2,Sam >but sometimes adults mess up.

651
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,680
<30-2,Sam >我告诉你个事儿
<30-2,Sam >Can I tell you something,

652
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,310
<30-2,Sam >你能帮我保密吗
<30-2,Sam >and you keep it just between us?

653
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,680
<28-7,Broda >我不太会与小孩子相处
<28-7,Broda >I'm not great with kids.

654
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,850
<30-1,Sam >我喜欢孩子  但我害怕
<30-1,Sam >I love them, but I get scared

655
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,720
<30-2,Sam >自己会做错事情
<30-2,Sam >that I'm gonna do the wrong thing,

656
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,420
<30-2,Sam >而且通常都会
<30-2,Sam >and then... I usually do.

657
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,160
<30-2,Sam >刚才我说谎就是
<30-2,Sam >And that's what I did with the lying.

658
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,700
<30-2,Sam >真的很抱歉
<30-2,Sam >And I'm very sorry about that.

659
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,970
<30-2,Sam >我之所以做错误的事
<30-2,Sam >The reason why I did the wrong thing

660
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,840
<30-2,Sam >是希望你可以
<30-2,Sam >was because I was trying to get you

661
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,010
<30-2,Sam >做正确的事
<30-2,Sam >to do the right thing.

662
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,880
<30-2,Sam >你的妈妈和你的羊羊
<30-2,Sam >Your mommy and your Lamby

663
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,710
<30-2,Sam >都希望你好起来
<30-2,Sam >both really need you to get better.

664
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,550
<30-2,Sam >那
<30-2,Sam >So...

665
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,120
<30-2,Sam >你说
<30-2,Sam >Do you think that...

666
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,690
<30-2,Sam >你可以勇敢点
<30-2,Sam >You could be really brave...

667
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,290
<30-2,Sam >去做正确的事情吗
<30-2,Sam >And do the right thing?

668
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,390
<30-3,Eve >我会努力的
<30-3,Eve >I'll try.

669
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,100
<30-4,Sam >好样的
<30-4,Sam >Great.

670
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,530
<30-4,Sam >好样的
<30-4,Sam >Great.

671
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,340
<31-1,Chase >热度很高  氧饱和度很低
<31-1,Chase >Fever's way up. Sat's way down.

672
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,740
<31-1,Chase >脓疱还在扩散
<31-1,Chase >Pustules still spreading.

673
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,340
<31-2,Masters >干扰素没起效
<31-2,Masters >Interferon's not working.

674
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,380
<31-3,Foreman >所以这就是天花
<31-3,Foreman >Which means this is smallpox.

675
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,810
<31-3,Foreman >说得好
<31-3,Foreman >Right!

676
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,810
<31-4,House >因为这大千世界只有两种病
<31-4,House >'cause there are only two diseases

677
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,320
<31-4,House >想想还能是什么
<31-4,House >in the whole wide world-- what else could it be?

678
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,750
<31-5,Masters >一定还有别的
<31-5,Masters >There's got to be something.

679
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
<31-6,Foreman >不  不可能
<31-6,Foreman >No, there doesn't.

680
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,120
<31-7,Cuddy >她的脚上仍然没出现脓疱
<31-7,Cuddy >There are still no pustules on her feet.

681
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,930
<31-7,Cuddy >你认为不是天花的理由依旧成立
<31-7,Cuddy >All the reasons you thought it wasn't smallpox still exist.

682
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,870
<31-8,Foreman >别管她的脚  别管那些原因
<31-8,Foreman >Forget her feet. Forget all those other reasons.

683
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,440
<31-8,Foreman >看看他  疱疹是圆凸状的
<31-8,Foreman >Look at him now. The pox are dome-shaped.

684
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,640
<31-8,Foreman >他身上80%的地方都长满了
<31-8,Foreman >They're on 80% of his body, and

685
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,700
<31-8,Foreman >而且没有结痂
<31-8,Foreman >they're not scabbing over.

686
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,200
<31-8,Foreman >这是典型的天花
<31-8,Foreman >This is textbook smallpox.

687
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,870
<31-8,Foreman >这时候再做鉴别诊断也没用
<31-8,Foreman >DDX'ing at this point isn't gonna make a difference.

688
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,310
<31-9,Cuddy >-别那么说  -很抱歉
<31-9,Cuddy >- Don't say that. - I'm sorry.

689
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,850
<31-9,Cuddy >豪斯
<31-9,Cuddy >House...

690
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,780
<31-10,Foreman >你闯进去犯了大错
<31-10,Foreman >You screwed up going in there.

691
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,170
<31-11,Cuddy >感觉发热了吗
<31-11,Cuddy >You have any fever?

692
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,400
<31-12,House >还没
<31-12,House >Not yet.

693
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,470
<31-12,House >等我真的发热了
<31-12,House >But when it does come,

694
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,440
<31-12,House >你恐怕就会意识到为我撒谎而生气
<31-12,House >I assume you'll see the pettiness

695
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,770
<31-12,House >其实是多么小气
<31-12,House >of being mad at me for lying.

696
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,940
<31-13,Cuddy >闭嘴  豪斯
<31-13,Cuddy >Shut up, House.

697
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,180
<31-13,Cuddy >我去去就来
<31-13,Cuddy >I'll be right back.

698
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,060
<31-14,Niles >我活不成了  是不是
<31-14,Niles >I'm not gonna make it, am I?

699
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,770
<31-15,House >你该向你的家人道别了
<31-15,House >You should say good-bye to your family.

700
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,840
<31-16,Niles >我爱你
<31-16,Niles >I love you.

701
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,840
<31-17,Lulu >坚持住
<31-17,Lulu >Just hold on.

702
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,310
<31-17,Lulu >顽强点
<31-17,Lulu >Fight this.

703
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,250
<31-18,Niles >帮我照顾好儿子
<31-18,Niles >You got to take care of my boy.

704
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,320
<31-18,Niles >不
<31-18,Niles >No.

705
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,690
<31-19,Niles >答应我
<31-19,Niles >Promise me.

706
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,860
<31-20,Lulu >我答应你
<31-20,Lulu >I promise.

707

708
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,870
<31-21,Niles >我也爱你
<31-21,Niles >I love you too.

709
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,540
<31-21,Niles >让罗杰过来
<31-21,Niles >Get Roger closer.

710
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,240
<31-22,Lulu >到这边来
<31-22,Lulu >Come closer.

711
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,310
<31-22,Lulu >来吧
<31-22,Lulu >Come on.

712
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,480
<31-23,Roger >老爸
<31-23,Roger >Dad.

713
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,790
<31-24,Niles >我的宝贝儿子
<31-24,Niles >My baby boy.

714
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,790
<31-25,Roger >老爸  别
<31-25,Roger >Dad, please...

715
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,560
<31-26,Niles >一切都会好起来的
<31-26,Niles >It's gonna be okay.

716
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,070
<31-26,Niles >露露会照顾好你的
<31-26,Niles >Lulu's gonna take care of you.

717
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,430
<31-27,Roger >我不要她  老爸
<31-27,Roger >I don't want her, dad.

718
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,970
<31-27,Roger >她代替不了你
<31-27,Roger >She's not you.

719
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,370
<31-28,Niles >我会永远爱你  罗杰
<31-28,Niles >I will always love you, Roger.

720
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,150
<31-28,Niles >老爸
<31-28,Niles >Dad?

721
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,670
<31-28,Niles >你要害死我
<31-28,Niles >You're killing me!

722
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,970
<32-1,Broda >如果你还没感染的话
<32-1,Broda >The suit will protect you

723
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,880
<32-1,Broda >隔离服能保护你
<32-1,Broda >if you haven't already been exposed.

724
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,810
<32-2,House >我的氧气快耗尽了
<32-2,House >My air supply's almost out.

725
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,020
<32-3,Broda >我们会再给你一罐的
<32-3,Broda >We'll give you another canister.

726
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,360
<32-4,House >换氧气瓶的时候我就会接触到病毒
<32-4,House >Yeah, and when I change it, I will be exposed.

727
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,630
<32-5,Cuddy >赶快转移他吧
<32-5,Cuddy >Just move him!

728
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,150
<32-6,Broda >我希望我可以
<32-6,Broda >I wish I could.

729
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,090
<32-7,House >那太好了
<32-7,House >Oh, that's great,

730
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,330
<32-7,House >你知道你可以做什么吗
<32-7,House >'cause you know what you can do?

731
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,420
<32-7,House >转移我
<32-7,House >You can move me.

732
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,590
<32-7,House >你还不知道我得没得天花
<32-7,House >You don't know that I have smallpox yet.

733
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,060
<32-8,Broda >我们必须作此打算
<32-8,Broda >We have to assume.

734
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,400
<32-9,Cuddy >五楼还有一个隔离间
<32-9,Cuddy >There's another isolation room on the fifth floor.

735
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,360
<32-10,Broda >问题是如何把他转移到那儿
<32-10,Broda >The problem is getting him from here to there.

736
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,740
<32-11,House >就是不方便喽
<32-11,House >So it's inconvenient.

737
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,200
<32-11,House >你不方便给我个机会
<32-11,House >My having a fighting chance at life

738
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,370
<32-11,House >争取活命
<32-11,House >is inconvenient!

739
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,870
<32-12,Broda >很抱歉
<32-12,Broda >I'm sorry.

740
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,950
<33-1,Chase >我们不确定他是否会染上
<33-1,Chase >We don't know that he'll catch it.

741
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,080
<33-2,Masters >我们也不确定那一定就是天花
<33-2,Masters >We don't know that it's definitely smallpox,

742
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,550
<33-2,Masters >只有等疾控中心DNA化验结果出来
<33-2,Masters >not until we get the DNA results back from the CDC.

743
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,490
<33-3,Foreman >你以为那个爸爸怎么死的
<33-3,Foreman >What do you think the dad just died of?

744
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,080
<33-4,Masters >跟他们说说理会死吗
<33-4,Masters >Would it kill us to talk it through?

745
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,980
<33-5,Foreman >不会  也救不了豪斯
<33-5,Foreman >Kill us? No. Save house? Also no.

746
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,730
<33-6,Taub >哪怕奇迹出现  不是天花
<33-6,Taub >Even if by some miracle it's not smallpox,

747
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,160
<33-6,Taub >我们也无能为力
<33-6,Taub >there's nothing more for us to go on.

748
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,430
<33-6,Taub >没有新的病例资料
<33-6,Taub >There's no new data.

749
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,530
<33-6,Taub >也不会再有任何
<33-6,Taub >And there isn't going to be any--

750
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,730
<33-7,Masters >-你要去哪儿  -找新的资料
<33-7,Masters >- Where are you going?  - To get more data.

751
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,210
<34-1,Geerte >"格丽特看上去很冷漠
<34-1,Geerte >"Gerritt seems distant

752

<34-1,Geerte >心事重重"
<34-1,Geerte >and preoccupied."

753
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,540
<34-2,Masters >谁是格丽特  他是个奴隶吗
<34-2,Masters >Who's Gerritt? Is he a slave?

754
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,450
<34-3,Geerte >格丽特是船长的猫
<34-3,Geerte >Gerritt is the captain's kitty.

755
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,210
<34-4,Chase >船长的猫有心事
<34-4,Chase >The captain's cat is preoccupied?

756
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,980
<34-5,Taub >别管猫了
<34-5,Taub >Skip the cat.

757
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,180
<34-6,Geerte >宰了只羊做晚餐
<34-6,Geerte >Uh, "One goat slaughtered for dinner.

<34-6,Geerte >又新开一桶葡萄酒
<34-6,Geerte >Broke out the next barrel of wine."

759
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,890
<34-7,Taub >也别管吃的了
<34-7,Taub >Skip the food.

760
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,260
<34-8,Masters >再回头说说猫吧
<34-8,Masters >Uh, c-can we go back to the cat?

761
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,130
<34-8,Masters >那只猫病了吗
<34-8,Masters >Did the cat get sick?

762
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,260
<34-9,Taub >天花只感染人类
<34-9,Taub >Smallpox is exclusive to humans.

763
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,100
<34-10,Masters >船长不养宠物
<34-10,Masters >Ship captains didn't have pets.

764
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,910
<34-10,Masters >如果没有特殊目的
<34-10,Masters >Nothing and nobody went on those ships

765
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,830
<34-10,Masters >不会带宠物上船吧
<34-10,Masters >if it didn't have a purpose.

766
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,600
<34-11,Taub >-抓老鼠吗  -为了船员们好
<34-11,Taub >- Hunting mice and rats?  - For the crew.

767
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,940
<34-12,Masters >船舱里也许有鼠患
<34-12,Masters >The hold was probably infested with mice.

768
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,400
<34-12,Masters >如果这就是问题关键呢
<34-12,Masters >What if that's the difference?

769
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,610
<34-12,Masters >格丽特到底怎么了
<34-12,Masters >What happened to Gerritt?

770
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,440
<34-13,Geerte >啊
<34-13,Geerte >Ah.

771
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,380
<34-14,Chase >你这"啊"是难过还是开心
<34-14,Chase >Is that a sad "Ah" Or a cute "Ah"?

772
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,980
<34-15,Geerte >格丽特死了  当然是难过了
<34-15,Geerte >Gerritt, he died. It's a sad "Ah."

773
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,790
<34-16,Masters >它死之前掉毛没有
<34-16,Masters >Before he died, did he lose his fur?

774
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,630
<34-17,Geerte >你怎么知道
<34-17,Geerte >How did you know?

775
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,060
<34-18,Masters >老鼠不会携带天花病毒
<34-18,Masters >Mice don't carry smallpox,

776
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,270
<34-18,Masters >但携带立克次体痘疹
<34-18,Masters >but they do carry rickettsialpox.

777
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,300
<34-19,Foreman >这个可以治愈
<34-19,Foreman >Which is treatable.

778
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
<35-1,Masters >给他们用多西环素
<35-1,Masters >Just start them on Doxycycline.

779
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,570
<35-2,Broda >就因为一只秃毛的猫
<35-2,Broda >Based on a bald cat?

780
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,670
<35-2,Broda >你没听过动物换毛吗
<35-2,Broda >You never heard of shedding?

781
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,070
<35-3,Foreman >用了有什么坏处
<35-3,Foreman >What's the downside?

782
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,540
<35-4,Broda >如果我们给她用一堆抗菌素和抗病毒药物
<35-4,Broda >If we shove her full of antibiotics plus the antivirals,

783
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,310
<35-4,Broda >会抑制她的骨髓
<35-4,Broda >it'll suppress her bone marrow.

784
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,920
<35-5,Chase >那个女孩都快死了
<35-5,Chase >That girl's about to die.

785
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,120
<35-6,Broda >可能是吧
<35-6,Broda >She probably is,

786
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,520
<35-6,Broda >但我不想冒险把她推向死亡边缘
<35-6,Broda >and I don't want to risk pushing her over the edge.

787
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,090
<35-7,Masters >起码查看下爸爸的尸体
<35-7,Masters >At least look at the Dad's body.

788
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,360
<35-7,Masters >如果有小块黑死组织就证明我是对的
<35-7,Masters >Small patches of black, dead tissue will prove I'm right.

789
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,490
<35-7,Masters >立克次体痘疹会出现焦痂
<35-7,Masters >Eschars appear with rickettsialpox

790
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,130
<35-7,Masters >天花则不会
<35-7,Masters >but not with smallpox.

791
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,530
<35-8,Broda >如果他出现了焦痂  我不可能没注意到
<35-8,Broda >If he had developed eschars, I would have noticed.

792
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,800
<35-9,Taub >你好几个小时都没靠近他五米之内
<35-9,Taub >You haven't been within 20 feet of the guy in hours.

<35-9,Taub >让他们查查看
<35-9,Taub >Have them check.

<35-10,Broda >他们的工作就是消毒尸体
<35-10,Broda >Their job is to bleach the body,

<35-10,Broda >杀灭病毒
<35-10,Broda >kill the virus,

796
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,710
<35-10,Broda >移出尸体  都是为了豪斯医生
<35-10,Broda >and get it out of there for Dr. House's sake.

797
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,670
<35-11,Masters >消毒尸体
<35-11,Masters >Bleaching the body

798

<35-11,Masters >会销毁立克次体感染的证据
<35-11,Masters >will destroy all evidence of rickettsialpox.

<35-12,Broda >根本就没有什么证据
<35-12,Broda >There is no evidence!

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,920
<35-12,Broda >我也不想骗你
<35-12,Broda >I'm not lying to you.

802
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,600
<35-10,Broda >这就是天花
<35-10,Broda >This is smallpox.

803
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,160
<35-11,Masters >豪斯  你得检查一下尸体
<35-11,Masters >House, you have to examine the body.

804
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,070
<35-13,House >我才不会靠近那儿
<35-13,House >I'm not going anywhere near it.

805
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,070
<35-14,Masters >找找焦痂  快点
<35-14,Masters >Look for eschars. Hurry.

<35-14,Masters >你认为是立克次体
<35-14,Masters >You think it's r-pox?

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,000
<35-15,Masters >船长有只猫
<35-15,Masters >The captain had a cat.

<35-15,Masters >先是掉毛  然后死了
<35-15,Masters >He lost his fur and then died.

<35-16,Broda >退后  豪斯医生

<35-17,House >戴手套做尸检很难
<35-17,House >It's kind of hard to do an autopsy in oven mitts.

<35-18,Masters >脱掉啊
<35-18,Masters >Take them off.

<35-20,Masters >你也认为是立克次体痘疹  对吧
<35-20,Masters >You think it's rickettsialpox, don't you?

817
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,880
<35-20,Masters >如果是  就可以治愈
<35-20,Masters >If it is, it's curable,

818
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,640
<35-20,Masters >除非我们能证明这点否则她必死无疑
<35-20,Masters >and she's gonna die unless we can prove it.

00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,480
<35-21,House >你真的很讨人厌
