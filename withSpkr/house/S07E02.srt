00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,070
<5-11,Taub >现在你又不在乎了
<5-11,Taub >And now you don't care?

84
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,630
<5-12,House >抱歉  不关心十三
<5-12,House >Sorry. Not caring about Thirteen

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,860
<5-12,House >不是诊断心律不齐的一部分

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,300
<5-15,House >她有权保留隐私
<5-15,House >She's entitled to her privacy.

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,730
<5-15,House >就像我有义务诊断病因

94
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,080
<5-16,Taub >你现在试图隐瞒十三离开的原因
<5-16,Taub >And you're glossing over Thirteen's departure

95
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,910
<5-16,Taub >是因为你真的尊重他人隐私吗
<5-16,Taub >because you actually respect somebody's privacy?

96
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,750
<5-17,House >我同意你的说法  我不关心这事才奇怪
<5-17,House >I agree. It's weird of me not to care.

97
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,840
<5-17,House >所以要么我因为卡迪变了个人
<5-17,House >So either I'm a changed man because of Cuddy,

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
<5-17,House >要么我假装变了个人
<5-17,House >or I'm pretending to be a changed man

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,820
<5-17,House >因为我确实知道十三的事
<5-17,House >because I do know something about Thirteen

100
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,030
<5-17,House >还不愿告诉你们
<5-17,House >and I'm trying to throw you off the scent,

101
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,480
<5-17,House >要么就是因为我失去一个病人成了疯子
<5-17,House >or I've just gone nutty bananas because I lost a patient.

102
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,050
<5-17,House >我诊出病因之后
<5-17,House >All of which you are free to discuss

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,800
<5-17,House >随便你们猜测
<5-17,House >after I get a diagnosis.

104
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,430
<5-17,House >如果是长Q-T间期综合症的话
<5-17,House >If it's Long QT Syndrome,

105
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,320
<5-17,House >那么在滑板场地的任何惊吓刺激
<5-17,House >any startling stimulus in that skate park

106
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,510
<5-18,House >都能够引发心律不齐
<5-18,House >could have triggered the arrhythmia.

107
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,890
<5-18,House >噪音太大  灯光太耀眼
<5-18,House >Loud noise, flashing lights.

108
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,910
<5-18,House >把病人吓死就能证明是长Q-T间期综合症
<5-18,House >Scare the patient to death to confirm Long QT.

109
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,790
<5-18,House >好吧  如果你们坚持要做
<5-18,House >Fine. If you insist,

110
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,930
<5-18,House >就找个能把病人救回来的地方
<5-18,House >do it in a room with one of those thingamabobs that brings people back to life.

111
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,220
<6-1,Foreman >惊吓测试太疯狂了
<6-1,Foreman >Scare test is insane.

112
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,360
<6-2,Taub >惊吓测试很合理
<6-2,Taub >Scare test is legitimate.

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,620
<6-2,Taub >能够模拟真实世界的情况
<6-2,Taub >Simulates real world conditions.

114
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,300
<6-2,Taub >和卡迪的交往这事太疯狂了
<6-2,Taub >This fling with Cuddy is insane.

115
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,380
<6-2,Taub >信号枪  够吓人了吗
<6-2,Taub >Flare gun? Scary enough?

116
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,000
<6-3,Foreman >怎么告诉她我们要做这个愚蠢的测试呢
<6-3,Foreman >How about just telling her we're planning this stupid test?

117
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,350
<6-3,Foreman >希望豪斯和卡迪不只是一时冲动
<6-3,Foreman >And I'm hoping House and Cuddy are more than just a fling.

118
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,490
<6-3,Foreman >很显然豪斯陷进去了

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,150
<8-14,House >怎么样  一切在你掌握之中
<8-14,House >See? Everything's under control.

186
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,630
<9-1,Cuddy >我知道你还想做那个愚蠢的惊吓测试
<9-1,Cuddy >I know you're still planning your ridiculous scare test.

187
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,080
<9-1,Cuddy >病人的情况还不足以冒这个险
<9-1,Cuddy >The patient is nowhere near sick enough to justify the risk.

188
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,680
<9-1,Cuddy >血管造影片和心电图
<9-1,Cuddy >An angiogram and an E.P. study

189
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,920
<9-1,Cuddy >更安全有效
<9-1,Cuddy >are much safer and very effective.

190
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,080
<9-2,House >观点不错  不做惊吓测试了
<9-2,House >Fair point. Not doing the scare test.

191
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,980
<9-2,House >我邀请你来监督我不做这个测试
<9-2,House >I'd invite you to watch me not doing the test,

192
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,990
<9-2,House >但是之前很多次没有做
<9-2,House >but having not done it many times before,

193
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,730
<9-2,House >相信我  真的很无聊
<9-2,House >trust me, it's pretty not interesting.

194
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,110
<9-4,House >-豪斯  -惊吓测试的请求没有通过
<9-4,House >- House? - Scare test was not approved.

195
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,980
<9-4,House >先用血管造影法和心电图
<9-4,House >Do an angio and E.P. Study instead.

196
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,830
<9-5,Taub >首先  这两种办法效率比较低...
<9-5,Taub >First of all, that's not as effective as--

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,670
<10-1,George >为什么不做更专业点的测试
<10-1,George >How come you're not doing the more specialized test?

198
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,990
<10-2,Taub >实际上  这个测试比较有效
<10-2,Taub >This test is virtually just as effective.

199
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,700
<10-2,Taub >而且  豪斯医生把病人的安全放在首位
<10-2,Taub >And Dr. House puts a premium on patient safety.

200
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,520
<10-3,Hugo >但他经常改变主意
<10-3,Hugo >But frequently changes his mind.

201
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,780
<10-4,Della >雨果  放过他吧  我没事
<10-4,Della >Hugo, give him a break. I'm fine.

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,610
<10-5,Foreman >我们开始之前你应该去趟厕所
<10-5,Foreman >You should go to the bathroom before we go.

203
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,370
<10-5,Foreman >给你补液有些时候了
<10-5,Foreman >We've been hydrating you for quite a while.

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,660
<10-6,Della >我不想上厕所
<10-6,Della >I don't have to pee.

205
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,920
<10-7,Taub >一旦我们开始测试
<10-7,Taub >Once we start the test,

206
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,460
<10-7,Taub >至少一小时后你才可以走动
<10-7,Taub >you won't be able to move for at least an hour.

207
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,120
<10-8,Della >我真的不想上厕所
<10-8,Della >I really don't have to pee.

208
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,740
<10-9,Foreman >我们给她补了多少液体
<10-9,Foreman >How much fluid have we given her?

209
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,850
<10-9,Foreman >2.5升  你上次上厕所是什么时候
<10-9,Foreman >2.5 liters. When's the last time you went to the bathroom?

210
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
<10-10,Della >大概是昨天晚上吧
<10-10,Della >Last night, I guess.

211
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,070
<10-11,Claire >那说明什么
<10-11,Claire >What does that mean?

212
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,470
<10-12,Foreman >看来你们女儿的肾功能衰竭了
<10-12,Foreman >Your daughter's kidneys seem to be failing.

213
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,810
<10-12,Foreman >是什么引起她心脏停止跳动
<10-12,Foreman >So what could cause her heart to stop

214
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,850
<10-12,Foreman >又不排尿呢
<10-12,Foreman >and her urine not to drop?

215
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,770
<11-1,Taub >豪斯  我以为长远来看
<11-1,Taub >House, I was expecting your relationship with Cuddy

216
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,730
<11-1,Taub >你和卡迪的关系会使我们工作更复杂
<11-1,Taub >to complicate our work long-term.

217
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,840
<11-1,Taub >但我现在担心这样的关系在目前就会发挥作用
<11-1,Taub >I am now concerned it might be affecting us short-term.

218
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,980
<11-2,House >-恕我直言  -恕不接受
<11-2,House >- All due respect. - None taken.

219
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,500
<11-2,House >我一直都很听卡迪的话
<11-2,House >I listen to Cuddy all the time.

220
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,780
<11-2,House >她是我上司  同样也是你们的上司
<11-2,House >She's my boss. Also yours, by the way.

221
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,560
<11-3,Taub >你听她的意见  然后告诉她说她是个白痴
<11-3,Taub >You'd listen, then tell her she's being an idiot,

222
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,620
<11-3,Taub >接着依然我行我素
<11-3,Taub >and do whatever you want.

223
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,320
<11-3,Taub >我想当她不是白痴的时候我可以跳过"白痴"的部分
<11-3,Taub >I find I can skip the idiot part when she's not being an idiot,

224
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,320
<11-4,House >既然惊吓测试
<11-4,House >and since the scare test

225
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,190
<11-4,House >也会造成同样的僵局
<11-4,House >would have led to the same dead end,

226
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,210
<11-4,House >她很明智地阻止了这一行为
<11-4,House >she was right to stop it.

227
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,530
<11-4,House >也就是说你的问题是你自己
<11-4,House >Which means your problem's about you.

228
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,480
<11-5,Taub >这论调有点意思
<11-5,Taub >This should be interesting.

229
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
<11-6,House >失败者需要爱的关怀
<11-6,House >Losers love company.

230
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,610
<11-6,House >就算是像我一样的厌恶人类者
<11-6,House >And if even a misanthrope like me

345
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,780
<16-2,Cuddy >我们就默默祈祷出血能及时止住
<16-2,Cuddy >hoping that the bleeding stops in time

346
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,370
<16-4,Cuddy >她不会把自己给弄死吧
<16-4,Cuddy >and she doesn't die on her own.

347
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,930
<16-4,Cuddy >但我们就能清白的大步走开
<16-4,Cuddy >But we would walk away with clean hands.

348
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,110
<16-5,Cuddy >除了手术时弄到身上的血
<16-5,Cuddy >Except for all the blood.

349
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,720
<16-5,Cuddy >你是对的  更快更险的招比较好
<16-5,Cuddy >You're right. Faster and riskier's better.

350
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,120
<16-5,Cuddy >给肺部填充泡沫
<16-5,Cuddy >Foam the lung.

351
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,040
<16-6,Chase >获得批准了吗
<16-6,Chase >Got a green light?

352
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,730
<16-6,Chase >没有  给肺部做缝合
<16-6,Chase >No. Suture the lung.

353
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,580
<16-7,Chase >手术刀  肋骨撑开器
<16-7,Chase >Scalpel, rib spreader.

354
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
<17-1,House >我处理不来
<17-1,House >I can't handle it.

355
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,520
<17-1,House >发生什么了
<17-1,House >What happened?

356
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,070
<17-1,House >她说了"同意"  但我听到了"不同意"
<17-1,House >She said "Yes," And I heard "No."

357
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,040
<17-1,House >当然我没有听到她说"不同意"
<17-1,House >I didn't actually hear "No."

358
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,700
<17-1,House >我就是  很确定她是这个意思
<17-1,House >But I just...was sure that's what she meant.

359
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,700
<17-2,Wilson >她歪了下头  皱了下眉
<17-2,Wilson >Way she tilted her head and half-arched her eyebrow.

360
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,510
<17-2,Wilson >我为什么要在乎她的想法
<17-2,Wilson >What do I even care what she meant?

361
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,730
<17-2,Wilson >她同意了  这才是关键
<17-2,Wilson >She said yes. That's all that matters.

362
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,380
<17-2,Wilson >我会把这事稿砸的
<17-2,Wilson >I'm screwing this up.

363
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,920
<17-2,Wilson >这不算太糟糕  豪斯
<17-2,Wilson >It's not completely bad, House.

364
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
<17-2,Wilson >你很在意她所以没有胡作非为
<17-2,Wilson >You care enough to pull your punches.

365
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,290
<17-2,Wilson >这是好事
<17-2,Wilson >That's not a bad thing.

366
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,610
<17-2,Wilson >但你和卡迪得想个办法
<17-2,Wilson >But you and Cuddy have got to figure out a way

367
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,050
<17-2,Wilson >避免再出现这种问题
<17-2,Wilson >of avoiding this problem.

368
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,640
<17-2,Wilson >约法三章
<17-2,Wilson >Set some ground rules.

369
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,440
<17-3,House >没错  我要避免这种问题发生
<17-3,House >Yeah. I have to avoid this problem.

370
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,890
<17-3,House >如果我们的相互作用
<17-3,House >If I can restrict our interactions

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,660
<17-3,House >只停留在我们穿内裤的地方
<17-3,House >to places where neither of us are wearing pants...

372
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,920
<17-4,Wilson >这样才不能避免问题发生
<17-4,Wilson >Yeah, that's not avoiding the problem,

373
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,130
<17-4,Wilson >那是避免发生争执
<17-4,Wilson >that's avoiding the issue.

374
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,010
<17-5,House >显然逃避是我处理发生争执的方法
<17-5,House >Since avoidance is my plan for dealing with the issue,

375
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,400
<17-5,House >理论上来说  我没有在避免发生争执
<17-5,House >technically, that's not avoiding it.

376
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,630
<17-6,Wilson >-谢了  -客气
<17-6,Wilson >- Thanks.  - No problem.

377
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,930
<18-1,Chase >-缝合还算有用  -这次
<18-1,Chase >- Stitching worked. - This time.

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
<18-2,Taub >下次请示卡迪可能还是行不通
<18-2,Taub >No guarantee bowing to Cuddy will work next time.

379
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,630
<18-3,House >心律失常  肾衰竭
<18-3,House >Heart arrhythmia, kidney failure,

380
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,490

381
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,550
<18-4,Taub >我不想批评你的女朋友  但是
<18-4,Taub >I don't want to criticize your girlfriend, but--

382
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,720
<18-5,House >这几年你一直要我
<18-5,House >Hey, you've been on me for years

383
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,880
<18-5,House >尊重别人的意见
<18-5,House >to respect someone's opinion.

384
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,750
<18-5,House >别因为我要离开你们
<18-5,House >Just 'cause I had to go outside this group

385
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,780
<18-5,House >去找我尊重的人而吃醋
<18-5,House >to find one I respect.

386
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,690
<18-6,Foreman >多系统脏器病变  肺部为主
<18-6,Foreman >Multi-system involvement centered in the lung.

387
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,310
<18-7,Chase >-可能是结节病  -不能解释胸腔积血
<18-7,Chase >- Sarcoidosis?  - Doesn't explain the hemothorax.

388
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,100
<18-8,Foreman>结核病能损伤三个器官
<18-8,Foreman>TB can affect all three organs.

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,170
<18-9,Taub >皮肤反应测验结果呈阴性
<18-9,Taub >Skin test was negative.

390
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,350
<18-10,Foreman >会不会是古德帕斯丘综合症
<18-10,Foreman >What about goodpasture's?

391
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,090
<18-10,Foreman >会损伤肺和肾
<18-10,Foreman >Affects the lungs, kidneys.

392
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,680
<18-11,House >自身免疫能解释意外的心律失常
<18-11,House >And autoimmune explains the out of the blue arrhythmia.

393
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,290
<18-11,House >是古德帕斯丘综合症
<18-11,House >Goodpasture's it is.

<19-1,House >他需要更多测试
<19-1,House >and he needs more tests.

399

<19-2,Sidney >他102岁了  下次检查就该是验尸了
<19-2,Sidney >He's 102. His next test is an autopsy.

400
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,360
<19-2,Sidney >听着  我爱老爹
<19-2,Sidney >Look, I love the old man,

401
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,020
<19-2,Sidney >但是我得把他从房子里弄走

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,910
<19-2,Sidney >他得去养老院
<19-2,Sidney >He needs to be in a care facility.

404
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,740
<19-3,House >这样的话  直说无妨  他不是小孩了
<19-3,House >Well, so tell him. He's a big boy now.

405
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,450
<19-4,Sidney >我不能  我是他生活的全部
<19-4,Sidney >I can't. I'm his whole life.

406
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,960
<19-4,Sidney >但是  要是这话出自医生之口
<19-4,Sidney >But if it comes from a doctor...

407
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,230
<19-5,House >若你30岁的话  出手很大方啊
<19-5,House >That's very generous. When you were 30.

<19-5,House >假装做做检查  完了告诉他
<19-5,House >Pretend to run the tests, and then tell him...

<20-2,House >Busy day.

412
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,160
<20-3,Cuddy >或许我们明天该一起吃午餐
<20-3,Cuddy >Maybe we should plan on lunch tomorrow.

413
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,410
<20-4,House >问题是  午餐时间  你是穿着衣服的
<20-4,House >Problem is, at lunch you tend to wear tops.

414
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,620
<20-4,House >这样好太多了
<20-4,House >This is much better.

415
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,240
<20-5,House >卡迪和我光着呢
<20-5,House >Cuddy and I are naked.

416
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,500
<20-5,House >所以我没法集中精神
<20-5,House >So I'm having trouble focusing.

417
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,620
<20-5,House >说简单点
<20-5,House >Use small words.

418
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,030
<20-5,House >肾脏活检结果没问题
<20-5,House >Kidney biopsy was clean,

419
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,960
<20-6,House >所以我们复检了手术室得到的肺部组织
<20-6,House >So we rechecked the piece of her lung from the O.R.

420
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,300
<20-6,House >我糊涂了
<20-6,House >You lost me.

421
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,850
<20-6,House >抱歉  谁打电话来着
<20-6,House >Sorry, who is this calling again?

422
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,110
<20-7,Chase >不是肺出血肾炎综合征
<20-7,Chase >It's not goodpasture's.

423
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,130
<20-7,Chase >血管内膜有增厚
<20-7,Chase >There's intimal thickening of the blood vessels.

424
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,500
<20-8,Foreman>以及淋巴细胞渗透
<20-8,Foreman>And lymphocytic infiltrate.

425
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,970
<20-8,Foreman>我们针对淋巴管平滑肌瘤检测  是阳性
<20-8,Foreman>We tested for lam. It's positive.

426
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
<20-9,Chase>此外  她的肺没用了
<20-9,Chase>Plus her lung's fried.

427
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,520
<20-9,Chase>要保命  她需要肺部移植
<20-9,Chase>She needs a donor lung to live,

428
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,480
<20-9,Chase>那也是治疗淋巴管平滑肌瘤的唯一方法
<20-9,Chase>Which is the only treatment for lam, anyway.

429
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,120
<20-10,Foreman >陶博已经去移植委员会了
<20-10,Foreman >Taub's gone to the transplant committee.

430
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,290
<20-10,Foreman >他们可能已经找到供体肺了
<20-10,Foreman >They may have found a donor lung.

431
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,270
<20-11,House >那么这个电话就是为了通知我一下咯
<20-11,House >So this call is purely expositional.

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,180
<20-11,House >我真的得穿衣服了
<20-11,House >I should really get dressed.

433
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,120
<20-12,House >我告诉过保姆  我9点会到家的
<20-12,House >I told the nanny I'd be home by 9:00.

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,390
<20-12,House >我塞了40块钱给保姆
<20-12,House >And I slipped the nanny 40 bucks,

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,910
<20-12,House >让她留到11点
<20-12,House >Told her to stay till 10:00.

<20-12,House >-真的吗  -真的
<20-12,House >- Really? - Mm-hmm, really.

437
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,180
<21-1,Chase >好消息
<21-1,Chase >Good news.

438
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,370
<22-1,Foreman >手术顺利
<22-1,Foreman >Surgery was uneventful,

439
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,370
<22-1,Foreman >但进入恢复期约一小时后供体肺开始衰竭
<22-1,Foreman >But the donor lung started failing about an hour into recovery.

440
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,810
<22-1,Foreman >我们知道是淋巴管平滑肌瘤病没错
<22-1,Foreman >We know we're right about lam.

441
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,740
<23-1,Taub >检测结果已证实
<23-1,Taub >Tests confirmed it.

442
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,560
<23-2,House >那么就只有两个可能
<23-2,House >That leaves us with two options.

443
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,030
<23-2,House >身体排斥新肺
<23-2,House >Body's rejecting the new lung

444
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,910
<23-2,House >或者我们该拒用新肺的
<23-2,House >Or we should have rejected the new lung

445
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,120
<23-2,House >因为它已被感染
<23-2,House >Because it's infected.

446
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,650
<23-3,Chase >做活检  看看是哪个
<23-3,Chase >Let's biopsy, see which one it is.

447
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,630
<23-4,Taub >没法确保取样处是被感染的
<23-4,Taub >No guarantee we'd hit the affected spot.

448
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,120
<23-5,Foreman >要是我们用甾体醇抑制排斥反应
<23-5,Foreman >If we give steroids for rejection,

449
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,210
<23-5,Foreman >会使感染恶化
<23-5,Foreman >it'd make an infection worse.

450
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,840
<23-5,Foreman >要是我们使用抗生素治疗感染
<23-5,Foreman >If we give antibiotics for infection,

451
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,730
<23-5,Foreman >会使排斥反应恶化
<23-5,Foreman >It'd make rejection worse.

452
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,050
<23-6,House >哪个恶化更糟糕呢
<23-6,House >Which worse is worse?

453
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,430
<23-7,Chase >要是我们治疗感染  但是判断错误
<23-7,Chase >If we treat for infection and we're wrong,

454
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,770
<23-7,Chase >她会在几小时内丧命
<23-7,Chase >She'll be dead within hours.

455
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,810
<23-8,House >若我们针对排斥反应用药
<23-8,House >And if we treat for rejection

456
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,600
<23-8,House >却判断失误会怎样呢
<23-8,House >and we're wrong?

457
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,650
<23-9,Taub >她或许能挺上一天两天
<23-9,Taub >She'll probably hang on a day or two.

458
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,160
<23-10,Foreman >你的假设是她的排斥反应是超急性的
<23-10,Foreman >You're assuming her rejection's hyperacute.

459
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,130
<23-10,Foreman >此情况的可能性  为零
<23-10,Foreman >Odds are, it isn't.

460
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,710
<23-11,House >得先针对最严重的恶化情况采取治疗
<23-11,House >Gotta head off the worst worse first.

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,520
<23-11,House >我师从苏斯医生
<23-11,House >I studied under Dr. Seuss.

463
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,640
<23-11,House >开始静注甲强龙  针对超急性排斥反应
<23-11,House >Start with iv methylprednisolone for hyperacute rejection.

464
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,190
<23-11,House >如若失败  我们再给她换上广谱抗生素
<23-11,House >If that fails, we'll switch her to broad-spectrum antibiotics

465
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,260
<23-11,House >但愿到时候还来得及
<23-11,House >And hope we're not too late.

466
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,580
<23-12,House >怎么不动
<23-12,House >Cat got your legs?

467
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,990
<23-8,House >我们刚作出的用药决定
<23-8,House >We just decided to give meds

468
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,800
<23-9,Taub >是基于猜测  可能会要了病人的命
<23-9,Taub >That could kill the patient based on a guess.

469
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,260
<23-10,Foreman >你需要卡迪的许可
<23-10,Foreman >You need approval from Cuddy,

470
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,080
<23-12,House >而她会要求采用保守治疗
<23-12,House >And she'll want to take the safer course,

471
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,260
<23-13,House >然后你就和纸鹤一样缩成一团不敢吱声了
<23-13,House >And you're gonna fold like an origami crane,

472
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,740
<23-13,House >所以
<23-13,House >so...

473
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,070
<23-13,House >我打算等在这里  直到得到确切的医嘱
<23-13,House >I'll just wait here till we get our actual orders.

474
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,500
<23-13,House >行  你去
<23-13,House >Fine. You do it.

475
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,110
<23-13,House >告诉她  她就是个傻瓜
<23-13,House >Tell her she's being an idiot

476
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,050
<23-13,House >总是采用保守疗法
<23-13,House >For always choosing the safer course.

477
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,020
<23-13,House >当我们的病人奄奄一息的时候
<23-13,House >She's sitting on her ample,

478
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,720
<23-13,House >她那硕大  算是匀称的
<23-13,House >if well-formed, bureaucratic ass

479
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,900
<23-13,House >官僚屁股就这样坐着
<23-13,House >while our patient's dying.

480
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,130
<23-13,House >倒要看看最后是谁像个纸虾一样缩成一团
<23-13,House >We'll see who folds like an origami shrimp.

481
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,570
<23-14,Taub >你要我去找卡迪要许可吗
<23-14,Taub >You want me to get Cuddy's approval?

482
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,300
<23-15,House >我要去更重要的地方
<23-15,House >I gotta be somewhere important.

483
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,960
<23-16,Taub >-坐在办公室里么  -我已经迟了
<23-16,Taub >- Sitting at your desk? - I'm running late.

484
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,320
<24-1,Maurice >别管检测了
<24-1,Maurice >Forget the tests.

485
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,600
<24-1,Maurice >我认为年轻的那个可能有自己的想法
<24-1,Maurice >I think junior might have a few words to say about that.

486
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,340
<24-2,Maurice >我爱他  但他就是放不下
<24-2,Maurice >I love him, but he can't let go.

487
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,800
<24-2,Maurice >40美元说明他能
<24-2,Maurice >40 bucks says he can.

488
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,110
<24-3,Maurice >没有他的帮助  我什么也做不了
<24-3,Maurice >I can't do anything without him helping me

489
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,790
<24-3,Maurice >仿佛我年老体衰
<24-3,Maurice >Like I'm senile.

490
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,580
<24-3,Maurice >要是我回去  我绝不轻饶他
<24-3,Maurice >If I go back there, I'm gonna rip his throat out.

491
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,080
<24-4,House >你确定你不想慢慢告诉他么
<24-4,House >You sure you won't warm up to him over time?

492
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,330
<24-4,House >跳过血检  告诉我儿子结果糟糕
<24-4,House >Skip the blood work. Tell my son it's grim news.

<24-4,House >我得去养老院
<24-4,House >I need to be in a nursing home.

495
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,600
<24-5,House >保证有独立卫生间

496

<24-5,House >这是我俩的小秘密
<24-5,House >Be our little secret.

497
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,130
<23-13,House >我的官僚屁股就这么坐着  是吗
<23-13,House >I sit around on my bureaucratic ass?

498
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,660
<24-6,Taub >我完整转述了你的话
<24-6,Taub >I was relaying your words.

499
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,810
<24-11,House >我说了匀称的  我说了匀称
<24-11,House >I said well-formed. I said well-formed!

500
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,910
<24-7,Taub >-你到底  -我得强硬点
<24-7,Taub >- What were you - I needed to be aggressive.

501
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
<24-8,House >你个蠢蛋
<24-8,House >You're an idiot.

502
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,820
<24-9,Taub >她同意福曼的分析
<24-9,Taub >She was siding with Foreman's analysis.

503
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,280
<24-10,Cuddy >是超急性排斥反应的可能很小
<24-10,Cuddy >The odds are against it being hyperacute rejection.

504
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,050
<24-11,House >停下  我同意你的看法
<24-11,House >Stop. I agree with you.

505
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,440
<24-11,House >那是我们开始时候的分析
<24-11,House >That was our analysis from the start.

506
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,930
<24-11,House >要是你对团队决定有意见
<24-11,House >If you've got a problem with a team decision,

<24-11,House >我很抱歉  我  我回头再处理他
<24-11,House >I'm sorry. I-I'll deal with him later.

509
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,730
<24-11,House >我说了匀称的
<24-11,House >I said well-formed.

510
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,410
<24-11,House >对于没有见过裸体卡迪的人而言
<24-11,House >People who have not seen Cuddy naked

511
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,330
<25-1,Chase >不改妄加评论
<25-1,Chase >Should not throw stones.

512
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,970
<25-2,Taub >她的身材真的不错
<25-2,Taub >She does have great cans.

513
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,140
<25-3,Chase >卡迪将豪斯像小狗一样管得死死的
<25-3,Chase >Cuddy has House on such a short leash,

514
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,910
<25-4,Taub >没准她还给他磨牙玩具呢
<25-4,Taub >She might as well start giving him chew toys.

515
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,180
<25-1,Chase >我们再给抗生素至少1小时的作用时间
<25-1,Chase >Let's give the antibiotics at least another hour.

516
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,730
<25-2,Taub >太惊人了  你完全无视他的恋爱生活
<25-2,Taub >Amazing. And House hasn't given you one ounce of grief

517
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,700
<25-2,Taub >他就没有找你的茬么
<25-2,Taub >For your complete lack of interest in his love life?

518
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,920
<25-3,Chase >你就不觉得豪斯就是很幸福快乐
<25-3,Chase >Did it ever occur to you that House is just happy

519
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,730
<25-3,Chase >不在乎别人怎么看么
<25-3,Chase >And could give a crap about other people's lives

520
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,720
<25-3,Chase >因为这个么
<25-3,Chase >Because of it?

521
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,900
<25-4,Taub >这样的话就太讽刺  太让人郁闷了
<25-4,Taub >Well, that's ironic and depressing.

522
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,840
<25-4,Taub >按照那个逻辑
<25-4,Taub >And by that logic,

523
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,530
<25-4,Taub >你不在乎的理由是因为你幸福
<25-4,Taub >The reason you don't give a crap is because you're happy,

524
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,830
<25-4,Taub >也就是说你有新欢了
<25-4,Taub >Which means you've got someone new giving you chew toys.

525
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,050
<25-5,Chase >你说对了四分之一
<25-5,Chase >You're 1/4th right.

526
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,800
<25-6,Taub >慢着  你是说
<25-6,Taub >Wait. Are you saying...

527
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,890
<25-6,Taub >你同时约会4个女人么
<25-6,Taub >You're dating four women?

528
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,200
<26-1,Chase >血压下降
<26-1,Chase >Bp's dropping.

529
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,680
<26-1,Chase >说明抗生素没用
<26-1,Chase >Means the antibiotics aren't working.

530
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,120
<26-2,Taub >将她置于垂头仰卧位
<26-2,Taub >Put her in trendelenburg.

531
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,240
<26-3,George >你们能挽救她的肺么
<26-3,George >Can you save the lung?

532
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,250
<26-4,Taub >信不信由你  眼下我们有更大把握
<26-4,Taub >Believe it or not, we got a better chance now.

533
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,310
<26-4,Taub >意味着是排斥反应  不是感染
<26-4,Taub >This means rejection, not infection.

534
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,050
<26-5,Chase >马上开始静注甲强龙
<26-5,Chase >Start her on iv methylprednisolone right away.

535
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,080
<26-5,Chase >哇  你讨厌吃色拉的
<26-5,Chase >Wow. You hate salad.

536
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,620
<27-1,Wilson >她是真的将你死死拴住了
<27-1,Wilson >She's really got you tied up in knots.

537
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,850
<27-1,Wilson >我自找的  同过中间人
<27-1,Wilson >I caved. Through an intermediary.

538
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,890
<27-2,Wilson >我需要个方案C
<27-2,Wilson >I need a plan "C."

539
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,840
<27-2,Wilson >你真正需要的
<27-2,Wilson >What you need

540
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,590
<27-2,Wilson >是你和卡迪达成共识的方案
<27-2,Wilson >is a plan that you actually develop with Cuddy.

541
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,600
<27-3,Taub >抗生素没用  甾体醇也没用
<27-3,Taub >Antibiotics didn't work and then steroids didn't work.

542
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,190
<27-4,Chase >新肺被废了  不是排斥反应也不是感染
<27-4,Chase >The new lung's ruined, and it's not rejection or infection.

543
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,480
<27-4,Chase >两种可能都是错的
<27-4,Chase >The only two options were wrong.

544
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,010
<27-5,House >除非不是淋巴管平滑肌瘤病
<27-5,House >Unless it's not lam.

545
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,760
<27-6,Chase >是淋巴管平滑肌瘤病  检测结果阳性
<27-6,Chase >It is lam. The tests were positive.

546
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,130
<27-7,House >那么就必是检测结果错了
<27-7,House >Then the tests have to be wrong.

547
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,310
<27-7,House >油炸锅又开始工作了
<27-7,House >Deep-fryer's working again.

560
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,740
<28-3,House >比如  你显而易见的情感缺陷
<28-3,House >For example, your obvious emotional damage

561
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,830
<28-3,House >正导致我和你进行一场辩证对话
<28-3,House >Is now making me have a philosophical conversation

562
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,340
<28-3,House >而非治疗你的姐姐
<28-3,House >Instead of dealing with your sister.

563
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,370
<28-3,House >明白那样的话会造成怎样的伤害吗
<28-3,House >See how that might be damaging?

564
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,060
<28-3,House >从来都不吗
<28-3,House >Never?

<29-3,House >我没问她上次提到是什么时候
<29-3,House >I didn't ask when's the last time she mentioned it.

569
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,610
<29-3,House >我问的是她的不适  哪怕是小小的不适
<29-3,House >I asked when she had one-- even a tiny one.

<30-2,House >血检结果证实是镰状细胞性状
<30-2,House >Blood tests just confirmed sickle cell trait.

610
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,790
<30-2,House >他们就会想知道唯一的治疗方法

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,950
<30-2,House >虽然最近的天气确实挺奇怪
<30-2,House >Though we are having weird weather lately.

612

614
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,960

619
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,500
<30-6,House >这套方案不好但至少给了他们拒绝的机会
<30-6,House >That qualifies as a bad reason for them to reject the idea.

620
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,630
<30-6,House >最糟的是连他们选择的权利都不给
<30-6,House >It's a much worse reason for them not to get the choice.

<30-7,Cuddy >你听过不伤害吗

626
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,640
<30-9,Cuddy >我们何不从门诊部随便找个牙疼患者
<30-9,Cuddy >Why don't we just take half a lung

627
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,430
<30-9,Cuddy >从他身上拿半个肺来用呐
<30-9,Cuddy >from some guy in the clinic with a toothache?

628
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,350
<30-10,House >好主意  这样他们家人就多一个选择
<30-10,House >That's a great idea. Now we can give the parents two options.

<32-7,House >这么做会很大程度上缩短他的寿命
<32-7,House >It would likely shorten his life significantly.

00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,960
<33-6,Taub >那个已经不是现在最重要的了
<33-6,Taub >We're way past that now.

<33-7,Della >他们还想要他的肺

<34-2,George >我们得做个选择  不管怎样都承受苦痛
<34-2,George >We make a choice... and we live with it.

<35-2,Claire >-我的上帝  -她怎么会在这儿
<35-2,Claire >- Oh, my god! - What is she doing here?

<35-3,Taub >她知道是怎么回事了
<35-3,Taub >She figured out what was going on.

723
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,370
<35-4,Chase >救回来了
<35-4,Chase >She's pinking up.

00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,550
<35-5,Taub >她肯定是把静脉注射和氧气给拽掉
<35-5,Taub >She must have yanked off her IVs and oxygen.

00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,400
<35-5,Taub >跑这儿寻死来了
<35-5,Taub >Came here to die.

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,610
<36-1,Taub >现在她的情况急剧恶化

<36-2,Foreman >你们必须得做个决定
<36-2,Foreman >If you're gonna make a decision,

730
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,020
<36-2,Foreman >否则就没时间了

<37-2,House >How come?

733
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,110
<37-3,Cuddy >豪斯  因为你无法无天
<37-3,Cuddy >Because you're unsupervisable, House.

<37-3,Cuddy >两个部门主任还威胁要辞职
<37-3,Cuddy >Two department chairs threatened to quit.

735

<37-4,House >那我们俩只能绑在一起了
<37-4,House >Well, I guess we're stuck with each other.

736
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,030
<37-5,Cuddy >我不懂为什么要这么决定
<37-5,Cuddy >I have no idea why I'm making this call

737
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,170
<37-5,Cuddy >或者这么决定是否明智
<37-5,Cuddy >or if it's the right call to make.

738
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,140
<37-5,Cuddy >但如果你强烈地认为
<37-5,Cuddy >But if you feel strongly

739
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,810
<37-5,Cuddy >应该把治疗方案告诉她家人的话

<37-5,Cuddy >你就做吧

00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,090
<37-13,House >让自己的女儿去死不是你们的决定吗
<37-13,House >that you're not choosing your own daughter's death?

756
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,850
<37-14,Claire >是我们的女儿不想要的
<37-14,Claire >Our daughter doesn't want it.

757
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,960
<37-15,House >也许是不想开口

<37-15,House >她只是个无知少女
<37-15,House >She's a mindless teenybopper.

759
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,580
<37-16,Cuddy >别把罪名强加在他们身上
<37-16,Cuddy >Don't put this on them.

<37-17,House >什么叫不能强加  这原本就是他们的责任
<37-17,House >What do you mean don't put on? It is on them.

<37-18,Cuddy >你给他们的是一个进退维谷的选择
<37-18,Cuddy >You're handing them an impossible choice.

764
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,580
<37-19,House >是生活给了他们糟糕的选择
<37-19,House >Life has handed them crappy choice,

765
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,090
<37-19,House >但他们做出了更为糟糕的决定
