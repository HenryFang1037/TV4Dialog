00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,880
<3-18,Cameron>肾脏衰竭的早期症状是恶心,呕吐 脚踝肿胀
<3-18,Cameron>Early symptoms of kidney failure,are nausea, vomiting,ankle swelling.

121
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,570
<3-18,Cameron>她可能错当成晨疾病了
<3-18,Cameron>She could've mistaken it,for morning sickness.

122
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,910
<3-19,House>心脏比肾脏更可能产生血栓
<3-19,House>Heart's way more likely to,throw a clot than the kidney.

123
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,040
<3-19,House>心音正常
<3-19,House>Echo was normal.

124
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,090
<3-20,Cameron>病史里没有心脏问题
<3-20,Cameron>History indicates no sign,of cardiac problems.

125
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,370
<3-21,House>没有 但如果仔细读过病史的话
<3-21,House>No,but if one were to read,the history closely,

126
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,760
<3-21,House>一定会注意到她六次感染链锁状球菌
<3-21,House>one would notice that,she had six cases of strep.

127
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,810
<3-22,Foreman>在喉咙 那可是心脏上方十英寸的地方
<3-22,Foreman>in her throat. That's the one,about ten inches above the heart.

128
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,600
<3-23,House>让我换种说法
<3-23,House>Let me rephrase.

129
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,660
<3-23,House>六例没根治的链锁状球菌
<3-23,House>Six cases of untreated strep.

130
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
<3-24,Cameron>都给她开了抗生素
<3-24,Cameron>She was prescribed antibiotics.

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,340
<3-25,House>没人把药都吃了
<3-25,House>No one takes them all.

132
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,680
<3-25,House>他们一旦感觉好了 就停药
<3-25,House>They stop when they start feeling better.

133
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,620
<3-25,House>所有链锁状球菌都没被根治
<3-25,House>All strep is untreated strep.

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,250
<3-25,House>要是链锁状球菌没治疗 会怎样?
<3-25,House>What happens when strep goes untreated?

135
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,510
<3-26,Chase>会导致风湿性发热
<3-26,Chase>It leads to rheumatic fever.

136
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,980
<3-27,House>那又会导致...Cameron?
<3-27,House>Which leads to...cameron?

137
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,250
<3-28,Cameron>二尖瓣狭窄
<3-28,Cameron>Mitral valve stenosis.

138
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,380
<3-29,House>那会使...肾脏的瓣膜变厚?
<3-29,House>Which is a thickening,in the valve of the...kidney?

139
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,810
<3-29,House>不 肾脏可没有二尖瓣
<3-29,House>No. Kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,770
<3-30,Foreman>我们会检查她的心脏
<3-30,Foreman>We'll go look at the heart.

141
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,540
<3-31,House>很好找的
<3-31,House>It'll be easy to find.

142
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,090
<3-31,House>就是喉咙下方十英寸的红色大泵
<3-31,House>It's the big red pumping thing about,ten inches below her throat.

143
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,580
<4-1,Cameron>刚才很奇怪
<4-1,Cameron>That was weird.

144
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,100
<4-2,Chase>他刚才和平时一样
<4-2,Chase>He was the way he always is.

145
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,300
<4-3,Cameron>所以才奇怪
<4-3,Cameron>Which is weird.

146
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,340
<4-3,Cameron>千万别动 emma
<4-3,Cameron>Very still,emma.

147
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,480
<4-5,Cameron>- 不好意思,- 没关系
<4-5,Cameron>- Sorry.,- No problem.

148
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,220
<4-5,Cameron>他撞见你手放在我衬衣上
<4-5,Cameron>He caught us with your hand up my shirt.

149
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,650
<4-5,Cameron>他对此应该有反应
<4-5,Cameron>He's gotta have a reaction to that.

150
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,410
<4-5,Cameron>你觉得他度假就是为了这个?
<4-5,Cameron>You think that's what the vacation is?

151
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,750
<4-6,Chase>是 失去你的痛苦逼得他待不下去了
<4-6,Chase>Yes. The pain of losing you,is obviously forcing him away.

152
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,290
<4-6,Chase>冠状截面看来正常
<4-6,Chase>coronal slice appears normal.

153
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,480
<4-7,Cameron>House没理由放过这事的
<4-7,Cameron>There's no way house,just lets this slide.

154
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,010
<4-7,Cameron>他肯定在计划什么
<4-7,Cameron>He's gotta be planning something.

155
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,280
<4-8,Chase>也许他只是不在乎
<4-8,Chase>Maybe he just doesn't give a crap.

156
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,710
<4-8,Chase>横截面也没问题
<4-8,Chase>Sagittal slice is clean.

157
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,300
<4-9,Cameron>你觉得他是误打误撞进那个储藏室的?
<4-9,Cameron>You think he just stumbled,into that closet?

158
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,660
<4-9,Cameron>他知道我们在那儿,他希望我们知道他察觉了
<4-9,Cameron>He knew we were there,,and he wanted us to know that he knew.

159
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,310
<4-10,Chase>或许你本就希望他知道 现在他知道了
<4-10,Chase>Or you wanted him to know,,now he does,

160
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,730
<4-10,Chase>你觉得烦恼是因为他不在乎
<4-10,Chase>and you're annoyed,because he doesn't care.

161
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,250
<4-10,Chase>就在那儿
<4-10,Chase>Right there.

162
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,730
<4-10,Chase>纵截面 钙化的二尖瓣
<4-10,Chase>Transaxial slice,,calcified mitral valve.

163
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,070
<4-11,Cameron>几乎看不出来,还没大到造成血栓
<4-11,Cameron>Barely.,That's n big enough to throw a clot.

164
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,480
<4-12,Chase>很显然足够大了 因为它已经造成了
<4-12,Chase>Obviously it is,because it did.

165
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,990
<4-12,Chase>House是对的
<4-12,Chase>House was right.

166
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,230
<5-1,Chase>你心脏的一个瓣膜变狭窄了
<5-1,Chase>A valve in your heart is narrowed.

167
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,680
<5-1,Chase>造成血栓 引起中风
<5-1,Chase>It caused the clot,which led to your stroke,

168
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,460
<5-1,Chase>循环的减少引起肾脏问题
<5-1,Chase>and the reduced circulation,caused the problems with your kidneys.

169
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,410
<5-2,Emma>这能治好?
<5-2,Emma>And this'll fix it?

170
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,310
<5-3,Cameron>气囊会迫使瓣膜重新打开
<5-3,Cameron>The balloon will force the valve back open.

171
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,720
<5-3,Cameron>你就好了
<5-3,Cameron>And you'll be fine.

172
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,560
<5-4,Emma>做手术我能不用麻醉吗?
<5-4,Emma>can I do this without a sedative?

173
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,470
<5-5,Chase>麻醉非常温和 对胎儿没有风险
<5-5,Chase>It's very mild,,there really is no risk to the fetus.

174
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,140
<5-6,Cuddy>我们会单独监控孩子的心率
<5-6,Cuddy>we'll monitor,your baby's heart rate separately.

175
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,880
<5-6,Cuddy>不会让心率低到危险水平的
<5-6,Cuddy>We won't allow it to decrease,anywhere near dangerous levels.

176
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,690
<5-7,Emma>谢谢你
<5-7,Emma>Thank you.

177
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,240
<5-8,Cuddy>你和孩子都会没事的
<5-8,Cuddy>You're both gonna be fine.

178
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,480
<5-8,Cuddy>开始吧 Cameron医生
<5-8,Cuddy>Go ahead,dr. Cameron.

179
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,870
<5-9,Emma>听那心跳
<5-9,Emma>Listen to that heartbeat.

180
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,590
<5-9,Emma>听起来那么...
<5-9,Emma>It sounds so...

181
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,750
<5-10,Cuddy>开始插管
<5-10,Cuddy>start threading the catheter.

182
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,830
<6-1,House>我不想在法兰克福 台北 新加坡,或者伦敦 安大略换机
<6-1,House>No,I don't want a layover in frankfurt,,taipei,singapore,or london,ontario.

183
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,530
<6-1,House>我要直飞金边 (柬埔寨)
<6-1,House>That's why I asked for a direct flight,to phnom penh.

184
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,320
<6-1,House>不降落换机有多难?
<6-1,House>How hard is it to not land?

185
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,000
<6-1,House>我怎么回答有关系吗?
<6-1,House>Does it matter what I answer?

186
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,700
<6-1,House>那就好 我很高兴不挂断,有什么新情况?
<6-1,House>Then fine,I'd be delighted to hold.,What's new?

187
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,410
<6-2,Cameron>你能叫cuddy别来干涉吗?
<6-2,Cameron>Can you tell cuddy to stop interfering?

188
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,600
<6-3,House>这是她的工作,有什么新情况?
<6-3,House>It's her job. What's new?

189
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,330
<6-4,Chase>好消息是emma的心脏已经治好了
<6-4,Chase>Good news is emma's heart is fixed.

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,490
<6-4,Chase>坏消息是有其他潜在问题
<6-4,Chase>Bad news is it's not her underlying problem.

191
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,520
<6-4,Chase>她的肾脏还在衰竭
<6-4,Chase>Her kidney'sare still failing.

192
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,640
<6-5,Foreman>你要去柬埔寨度假?
<6-5,Foreman>you're vacationing in cambodia?

193
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,200
<6-5,Foreman>你准备去杀人场放松?,(红色高棉统治时的屠宰场)
<6-5,Foreman>You gonna unwind in the killing fields?

194
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,760
<6-6,House>不 去给自己抓这么大的鱼
<6-6,House>Nope,gonna catch me a fish this big.

195
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,320
<6-6,House>湄公巨鲶 超过600磅
<6-6,House>Mekong giant catfish,,weighs over 600 pounds.

196
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,760
<6-7,Foreman>那些巨鲶不是都快绝种了么?
<6-7,Foreman>Aren't those catfish critically endangered?

197
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,730
<6-8,House>所以这是我去抓一条的最后机会了
<6-8,House>That's why it's my last chance,to catch one.

198
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,210
<6-8,House>所有的接线员都...
<6-8,House>All of our operators are...

199
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,830
<6-8,House>如果二尖瓣已经修复了
<6-8,House>if the mitral valve had been properly fixed,

200
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,900
<6-8,House>肾脏也该开始好了
<6-8,House>the kidney should be getting better.

201
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,540
<6-8,House>结论只能是手术做砸了
<6-8,House>Which leads us to the conclusion,that you screwed up the procedure.

202
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,350
<6-8,House>或者是你诊断错了
<6-8,House>Or you screwed up the diagnosis.

203
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,970
<6-9,Cameron>冠状瓣膜变厚根本不明显
<6-9,Cameron>The mitral valve thickening,was so insignificant,

204
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,300
<6-9,Cameron>也许不是造成肾脏衰竭和中风的原因
<6-9,Cameron>it probably wasn't the cause,of the kidneys or the stroke.

205
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,500
<6-9,Cameron>也许永远不会造成什么问题
<6-9,Cameron>Probably never would've been a problem.

206
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,250
<6-10,Foreman>她需要透析 而我们需要新理论
<6-10,Foreman>She needs dialysis,,and we need a new theory.

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,230
<6-11,Chase>只有少数可能
<6-11,Chase>there are only a few possibilities.

208
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,420
<6-11,Chase>病人正在怀孕 也许是前惊厥
<6-11,Chase>Patient's pregnant,,could be preeclampsia.

209
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,690
<6-11,Chase>之前我们已经排除了--
<6-11,Chase>We eliminated it before--

210
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,340
<6-12,House>检查蛋白尿症和低血小板--还有什么?
<6-12,House>check for proteinuria and low platelets--,whaelse?

211
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,790
<6-13,Cameron>循环性休克 胎儿基本上就是窃取营养,矿物质和血液的寄生虫
<6-13,Cameron>Hypoperfusion,the fetusis basically,a parasite stealing nutrients,minerals,blood.

212
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,810
<6-14,House>对她做遥感监测
<6-14,House>Put her on telemetry.

213
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,290
<6-15,Foreman>或者怀孕与此无关
<6-15,Foreman>or the pregnancy's irrelevant.

214
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,220
<6-15,Foreman>可以是感染 败血症 血栓性微血管病
<6-15,Foreman>Could be infection,sepsis,hus/ttp.

215
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,290
<6-16,Chase>胆固醇栓塞也一样有可能
<6-16,Chase>a cholesterol embolism is just as likely.

216
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,750
<6-16,Chase>胆固醇小微粒落下 堵塞肾脏的小血管
<6-16,Chase>Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down,and clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,960
<6-17,House>做涂片 超声检查她血管的血小板
<6-17,House>Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.

218
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,650
<6-18,Cameron>就这些了 应该是这五样中的一个
<6-18,Cameron>That's it,has to be one of those five.

219
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,900
<6-19,House>要自怎样更好吗?
<6-19,House>You know what would be even better?

220
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,130
<6-19,House>就是要排除到只剩一个
<6-19,House>If we could narrow it all the way down to one.

221
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,240
<6-20,Phone>谢谢等待
<6-20,Phone>Thank you for holding.

222
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,650
<6-20,Phone>现在有超大量电话打入
<6-20,Phone>We are experiencing extremely high call volume.

223
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,200
<6-20,Phone>谢谢你的耐心
<6-20,Phone>Thank you for your patience.

224
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,500
<7-1,Cameron>五个里一个都不是
<7-1,Cameron>She's 0 for 5.

225
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,610
<7-2,House>要么鉴别诊断错了
<7-2,House>Either the differential was wrong,

226
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,200
<7-2,House>要么她在假装
<7-2,House>or she's faking it.

227
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,280
<7-3,Chase>肾衰竭一定是急性的--
<7-3,Chase>Kidney failure has to be precipitated--

228
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,110
<7-4,Foreman>我们已经排除了
<7-4,Foreman>by one of the five we've already ruled out.

229
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,610
<7-5,Chase>身体就那么几个原因造成肾衰
<7-5,Chase>The body only has so many ways,of screwing with the kidneys.

230
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,480
<7-5,Chase>一定是检验错了
<7-5,Chase>The labs must be wrong.

231
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,920
<7-6,Foreman>我们自己做的检验 没其他人插手
<7-6,Foreman>We did the labs.No one else had access.

232
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,850
<7-7,House>那倒不一定
<7-7,House>That's not quite true.

233
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,710
<8-1,Emma>你给所有的病人做这么多检查,还是只给重要的人做?
<8-1,Emma>You put all your patients through this,many tests,or just the important ones?

234
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,070
<8-2,House>我们要探索所有可能
<8-2,House>We wanted to explore all the possibilities.

235
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,090
<8-3,Emma>然后?
<8-3,Emma>And?

236
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,780
<8-4,House>我们排除了那些可能
<8-4,House>We've eliminated all the possibilities.

237
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,980
<8-5,Emma>你是说 我快死了 而你不知道为什么?
<8-5,Emma>You telling me I'm dying,and you have no idea why?

238
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,130
<8-6,House>你的身体运作正常
<8-6,House>Your body is functioning properly.

239
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,530
<8-7,Emma>那我的肾脏为什么衰竭?
<8-7,Emma>So why my kidney is failing

240
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,640
<8-8,House>另一个身体不正常
<8-8,House>the other body isn'T.

241
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,960
<8-8,House>胎儿有问题
<8-8,House>There's something wrong with the fetus.

242
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,960
<8-8,House>欢迎来到母体镜式反应综合症的世界
<8-8,House>welcome to the world,of maternal mirror syndrome.

243
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,800
<9-1,House>母亲身体像复杂的德国地铁系统
<9-1,House>Mom's body is like,an intricate german metro system.

244
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,670
<9-1,House>所有火车按时出发
<9-1,House>All the trains run on time.

245
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,060
<9-1,House>当她怀孕了,就像在杜塞尔多夫新开了一站
<9-1,House>When she gets pregnant,,it's like a new station opening in dusseldorf.

246
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,750
<9-1,House>新手操控 一定会出错
<9-1,House>Bunch of rookies running things,,bound to be mistakes.

247
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,010
<9-1,House>孩子在轨道上玩 触电致死
<9-1,House>Kids play on the tracks,,get electrocuted.

248
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,300
<9-1,House>不知不觉 列车拥堵在去柏林的路上
<9-1,House>Before you know it,,trains are backed up all the way to berlin,

249
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,930
<9-1,House>一群愤怒的德国佬 无车可上
<9-1,House>and you got a bunch of,angry germans with nowhere to go.

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,750
<9-1,House>我们都知道那对犹太人不好
<9-1,House>And we all know that ain't good,for the jews.

251
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,110
<9-2,Chase>这个比喻里的犹太人指谁?
<9-2,Chase>Who are the jews in this metaphor?

252
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,120
<9-3,House>胎儿窘迫会有几个后果
<9-3,House>A few things can happen,to a fetus in distress.

253
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,410
<9-3,House>导致流产 或产下病恹恹的婴儿
<9-3,House>It can become a miscarriage,,still birth,very sick baby,

254
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,020
<9-3,House>非常罕见的情况下 也可能是颗定时炸弹,孩子死掉时 杀死妈妈
<9-3,House>or,on rare occasion, a time bomb,that kills mom while it's dying.

255
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,110
<9-3,House>好消息是 我们治好胎儿 妈妈也会好转
<9-3,House>Good news is,we fix the fetus,,mom gets better.

256
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,390
<9-3,House>这诊断等同于买一送一
<9-3,House>It's the diagnostic equivalent,of a two-for-one sale.

257
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,630
<9-4,Cameron>我读到的镜式反应的结果 多数不乐观
<9-4,Cameron>I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome,is almost always unfavorable.

258
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,210
<9-5,House>不乐观...,这是医生对死婴的说法吗?
<9-5,House>Unfavorable...,is that doctor speak for dead baby?

259
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,570
<9-5,House>你以为用词好听 她就会少难过些吗?
<9-5,House>You think she'll be less upset,if you phrase it nicely?

260
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,700
<9-6,Chase>可以跟她说实话 她不会有事
<9-6,Chase>we can tell her the truth,,that she'll be fine

261
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,550
<9-6,Chase>只要我们诊断出那一磅重的人有什么病
<9-6,Chase>as soon as we diagnose a person,who weighs about one pound.

262
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,200
<9-6,Chase>摸不到它 不能问它哪里疼 甚至看不见
<9-6,Chase>Can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts,,can't see it.

263
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,290
<9-7,House>除非这儿存在可以透视人体的巨型机器
<9-7,House>If only there existed giant machines,that could look through human skin.

264
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,010
<9-7,House>镜式反应限于几个病因
<9-7,House>Mirror syndrome has a limited number,of known causes.

265
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,020
<9-8,Cameron>心律失常 胎儿贫血,胎盘绒毛血管瘤--
<9-8,Cameron>Tachyarrhythmia,fetal anemia,,placental chorioangioma--

266
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,800
<9-9,House>所有这些都可以医治
<9-9,House>all of which are fixable.

267
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,660
<9-9,House>就不会不容乐观 对吧?
<9-9,House>Which would be un-unfavorable,right?

268
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,870
<9-10,Foreman>也可以是三倍13号体染色体 Ebstein畸形
<9-10,Foreman>Could also be trisomy 13,,ebstein's anomaly,

269
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,390
<9-10,Foreman>Galen血管的动脉瘤--
<9-10,Foreman>an aneurysm of galen's vein--

270
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,720
<9-11,House>暴风云医生雨点般作出鉴别诊断
<9-11,House>then dr. Storm cloud rained,all over the differential

271
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,140
<9-11,House>杀死了漂亮的小宝宝
<9-11,House>and killed the beautiful little baby.

272
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,190
<9-11,House>心脏是最容易看见和治疗的,我们就从那儿开始吧
<9-11,House>Heart's easiest to see,easiest to fix,,so let's start tre.

273
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,940
<9-11,House>给妈妈做核磁共振的时候,有没有看一下胎儿的心脏?
<9-11,House>When you did mom's mri,,did you get a look at the fetus' heart?

274
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,580
<9-12,Chase>在视界范围内 但是不清楚
<9-12,Chase>It was in the range,but blurry.

275
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,490
<9-12,Chase>胎儿在子宫里到处动
<9-12,Chase>The fetus was moving all over the place.

276
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,670
<9-13,House>所以我们还要再做一次
<9-13,House>So we need another scan.

277
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,000
<9-14,Foreman>是啊 这次还要叫胎儿躺着一动不动
<9-14,Foreman>Yeah,we'll just ask the fetus to lie very,,very still.

278
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,050
<9-15,House>没必要
<9-15,House>No need.

279
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,890
<9-15,House>我要麻痹它
<9-15,House>I'm going to paralyze it.

280
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,970
<10-1,Cuddy>你想麻痹Emma Sloan的胎儿?
<10-1,Cuddy>You want to paralyze emma sloan's baby?

281
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,170
<10-2,House>让我猜猜 Cameron告密的?
<10-2,House>Let me guess.Cameron?

282
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,350
<10-3,Cuddy>Cameron和Chase都有顾虑
<10-3,Cuddy>Cameron and chase both had their concerns.

283
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,920
<10-4,House>不 是Cameron担心
<10-4,House>No,cameron had concerns.

284
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,110
<10-4,House>Chase只是附和她
<10-4,House>Chase just agreed with her

285
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,970
<10-4,House>因为不想失去爬上她的床的机会
<10-4,House>because  he didn't want to lose,his all-access pass to her love rug.

286
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,490
<10-5,Cuddy>他们睡在一起?
<10-5,Cuddy>They're sleeping together?

287
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,010
<10-6,House>如果睡在一起是指在清洁储藏室做爱的话
<10-6,House>If by sleeping together you mean,having sex in the janitor's closet.

288
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,200
<10-7,Cuddy>在这儿?
<10-7,Cuddy>Here?

289
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,720
<10-8,House>不 在本地高中的清洁储藏室
<10-8,House>No,the janitor's closet at,the local high school.

290
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,410
<10-8,House>虎猫 冲啊!
<10-8,House>Go,tigercats!

291
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,040
<10-8,House>你有没有拍照手机?
<10-8,House>Do you have one of those camera phones?

292
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,550
<10-8,House>我有了空间账号
<10-8,House>'Cause I got a my space account.

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,850
<10-9,Cuddy>等我跟你谈完就去处理他们
<10-9,Cuddy>I will deal with them,after I deal with you.

294
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,560
<10-10,House>别这样 我们再八卦一下吧
<10-10,House>Oh,come on,let's gossip some more.

295
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,130
<10-10,House>我肯定她喜欢被捆绑
<10-10,House>I'm sure she's into bondage.

296
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,550
<10-11,Cuddy>麻痹一磅重的胎儿冒险--
<10-11,Cuddy>Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging--

297
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,170
<10-12,House>不麻痹 就得不到心脏清晰的核磁成像图
<10-12,House>not paralyzing the thing risks,not getting a clean mri of its heart.

298
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
<10-12,House>这样才能救它的命
<10-12,House>Which we need to save its life,

299
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,410
<10-12,House>借此拯救Emma的生命
<10-12,House>which we need to do to save emma's life.

300
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,590
<10-13,Cuddy>你得经过她同意
<10-13,Cuddy>You're gonna need to get her consent.

301
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,130
<10-14,House>应该不会太难
<10-14,House>That shouldn't be too hard.

302
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,810
<10-14,House>要么签字 要么你跟婴儿都死
<10-14,House>Sign here or you and your baby both die.

303
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,600
<10-15,Cuddy>我跟你一起去
<10-15,Cuddy>I'm going with you.

304
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,310
<10-16,House>很好
<10-16,House>Oh,good.

305
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,840
<11-1,Emma>你说过使用镇静剂有危险,这太疯狂了吧
<11-1,Emma>You said sedation was risky.,This sounds insane.

306
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,850
<11-2,House>注射剂进入脐带
<11-2,House>The injection goes into the umbilical cord.

307
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,710
<11-3,Cuddy>婴儿什么都感觉不到的
<11-3,Cuddy>The baby won't feel a thing.

308
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,110
<11-3,Cuddy>是胎儿
<11-3,Cuddy>Fetus.

309
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,750
<11-4,House>我是在降低期望值
<11-4,House>I'm lowering expectations.

310
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,780
<11-4,House>在这儿和约会时都有效
<11-4,House>It works here and on dates.

311
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,530
<11-4,House>利大于弊
<11-4,House>The benefits outweigh the risks,

312
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,370
<11-4,House>麻痹在一个小时后就会消失
<11-4,House>and the paralytic will,wear off in an hour,okay?

313
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,710
<11-5,Cuddy>宁愿听到自己可能死 不愿婴儿死
<11-5,Cuddy>Must be easier to hear you might die,than your baby might die.

314
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,980
<11-5,Cuddy>如果要我把自己婴儿的命运,交托给某个人
<11-5,Cuddy>But if there's anyone,I would trust to save my baby,

315
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,120
<11-5,Cuddy>那就是House医生
<11-5,Cuddy>it would be dr. House.

316
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,430
<11-5,Cuddy>胎儿
<11-5,Cuddy>Fetus.

317
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,560
<11-6,House>拿着这个
<11-6,House>Hold this.

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,510
<12-1,Cuddy>Cameron医生 核磁共振有结果了吗?
<12-1,Cuddy>Dr. Cameron. The mri results back?

319
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,230
<12-2,Cameron>胎儿的心脏结构健全
<12-2,Cameron>The fetus' heart is structurally sound.

320
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,340
<12-2,Cameron>膀胱有问题 是普通大小的四倍
<12-2,Cameron>The problem's with the bladder.,It's four times normal size.

321
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,440
<12-3,Cuddy>给我看看
<12-3,Cuddy>Let me see.

322
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,950
<12-4,Cameron>膀胱过胀 占据了整个躯干,挤压着所有其它器官
<12-4,Cameron>Bladder's so engorged,it's taking up,the whole torso, squeezing all the other organs.

323
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,560
<12-4,Cameron>使得肺脏没有发育空间
<12-4,Cameron>There's no room for the lungs to develop.

324
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,290
<12-5,Cuddy>也许婴儿得了下尿路梗阻
<12-5,Cuddy>The baby has a lower urinary tract obstruction.

325
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,160
<12-5,Cuddy>可以通过分流术治愈
<12-5,Cuddy>We can fix that by inserting a shunt.

326
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,950
<12-5,Cuddy>我去告诉Emma
<12-5,Cuddy>I'll give emma the news.

327
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,300
<12-6,Cameron>你要...接管这个病例吗?
<12-6,Cameron>Are you...taking over the case?

328
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,480
<12-7,Cuddy>House不在乎
<12-7,Cuddy>House won't care.

329
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,140
<12-7,Cuddy>他有自己的诊断
<12-7,Cuddy>He has his diagnosis.

330
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,680
<12-7,Cuddy>Cameron医生
<12-7,Cuddy>Dr. Cameron.

331
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,170
<12-7,Cuddy>跟Chase约会
<12-7,Cuddy>Dating chase...

332
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
<12-7,Cuddy>只能有两种结果
<12-7,Cuddy>can only end in one of two ways.

333
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,010
<12-8,Cameron>House告诉你的?
<12-8,Cameron>House told you?

334
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,410
<12-9,Cuddy>要么你们结婚 幸福相伴永远
<12-9,Cuddy>You get married and live happily ever after,

335
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,350
<12-9,Cuddy>要么有人受伤 再也无法共事
<12-9,Cuddy>or somebody gets hurt,and you two can't work together,

336
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,670
<12-9,Cuddy>我不得不开除一个
<12-9,Cuddy>and I have to fire somebody.

337
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,030
<12-10,Cameron>我不愿自己的私生活给你带来这种负担
<12-10,Cameron>I would hate to see my personal life,become such a burden to you.

338
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,560
<12-11,Cuddy>我这么说是为你好
<12-11,Cuddy>I'm telling you this for your own good.

339
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,150
<12-12,Cameron>大概为了Chase好 你也会跟他这么说
<12-12,Cameron>Well,I assume you're gonna have this,same conversation with chase for his own good.

340
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,180
<12-13,Cuddy>这件事上 受伤的不会是Chase
<12-13,Cuddy>Chase isn't the one,that's gonna get hurt here.

341
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,440
<13-1,House>只够一个人待
<13-1,House>There's only room for one.

342
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,770
<13-1,House>尽管我可以挤出点地方给你
<13-1,House>Though I could scooch over.

343
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,930
<13-2,Cameron>我的社交生活属于我自己
<13-2,Cameron>My social life is my social life.

344
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,300
<13-3,House>完全同意
<13-3,House>Couldn't agree more.

345
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,870
<13-3,House>储藏室里的私人秘密与人无关 除了...
<13-3,House>What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's,closet is nobody's business except—

346
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,630
<13-4,Cameron>她让我结束 这就是你要的结果?
<13-4,Cameron>she told me to end it.,Is that what you want?

347
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,520
<13-5,House>事实上我希望她会解雇你们中一个
<13-5,House>I was actually hoping,she'd fire one of you.

348
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,540
<13-6,Cameron>你在干什么?
<13-6,Cameron>What are you doing?

349
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,330
<13-7,House>预防高空病
<13-7,House>Trying to avoid altitude sickness.

350
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,990
<13-7,House>没有直达柬埔塞的航班可乘
<13-7,House>Couldn't score a direct flight to cambodia,

351
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,600
<13-7,House>所以我决定去阿根廷,攀登声名狼藉的阿空加瓜峰
<13-7,House>so I've decided to scale argentina's,infamous mount aconcagua.

352
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,510
<13-8,Cameron>棒极了 可惜你走不了路
<13-8,Cameron>Perfect,except for the fact that you can't walk.

353
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,660
<13-9,House>有个莫科维印第安人部落,会背着老人...
<13-9,House>There's a tribe of mocovi indians,who actually carry the elders—

354
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,130
<13-10,Cameron>你疯了
<13-10,Cameron>you're insane.

355
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,080
<13-11,House>我是个疯狂的天才
<13-11,House>I'm an insane genius.

356
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,250
<13-11,House>将舱内气压降低而不是升高
<13-11,House>Set the chamber to low pressure,instead of high.

357
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,230
<13-11,House>稀薄的空气致红细胞增加,产生新的毛细管
<13-11,House>Thinner air builds upextra red blood cells,,creates new capillaries.

358
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,320
<13-11,House>在这里多呆几天,就不用去探险队营地住上六星期了
<13-11,House>Few more days in here,,I can save myself six weeks in base camp.

359
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,840
<13-11,House>核磁共振结果呢?
<13-11,House>Where's my mri?

360
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,930
<14-1,Cuddy>尿路被阻塞了
<14-1,Cuddy>There's a blockage in the urinary tract.

361
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,100
<14-1,Cuddy>简单说来 就是你的孩子不能撒尿
<14-1,Cuddy>Simple terms,your baby can't pee.

362
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,750
<14-1,Cuddy>他的膀胱肿胀 会压垮肺部
<14-1,Cuddy>His bladder is swollen,and it's crushing his lungs.

363
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,070
<14-2,Emma>你能治好它吗?
<14-2,Emma>Well,can you fix it?

364
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,670
<14-3,Cuddy>我们可以塞根细管到婴儿的膀胱
<14-3,Cuddy>We can insert a small tube in the baby's bladder

365
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,670
<14-3,Cuddy>使得尿液在孕期直接从腹部排出
<14-3,Cuddy>that makes the urine come out straight through,his belly for the duration of the pregnancy.

366
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,260
<14-3,Cuddy>膀胱减压后
<14-3,Cuddy>The bladder decompresses,

367
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,160
<14-3,Cuddy>肺就能正常发育了
<14-3,Cuddy>and the lungs will be able to develop normally.

368
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,320
<14-3,Cuddy>婴儿好转 你也会好转
<14-3,Cuddy>When the baby gets better,you should get better.

369
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,740
<14-5,Cuddy>首先我们要做个测试
<14-5,Cuddy>First we just have to do a test to determine

370
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,020
<14-5,Cuddy>看看婴儿的肾功能是否正常
<14-5,Cuddy>whether the baby's kidneys,are functioning properly.

371
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,700
<14-6,Emma>如果不正常会怎么样?
<14-6,Emma>A-and what if they're not?

372
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,110
<14-7,Cuddy>如果肾脏受损严重
<14-7,Cuddy>If they're already too damaged,

373
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,450
<14-7,Cuddy>我们就真的无能为力了
<14-7,Cuddy>then there's really nothing we can do.

374
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,810
<14-7,Cuddy>如果这次不成功 你总有机会再尝试的
<14-7,Cuddy>If this doesn't work out,,you can always try again.

375
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,430
<14-8,Emma>我已婚时两次流产
<14-8,Emma>I miscarried twice when I was married.

376
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,860
<14-8,Emma>离婚后 在这之前还培育过四次试管婴儿
<14-8,Emma>After the divorce,I tried in vitro,,like,four times before this.

377
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,530
<14-8,Emma>我42岁了
<14-8,Emma>I'm 42.

378
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,260
<14-8,Emma>也许是...天意不可违
<14-8,Emma>Maybe it's,uh,just not meant to be.

379
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,920
<15-1,Cuddy>你在干什么?
<15-1,Cuddy>What are you doing?

380
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,900
<15-2,House>你想成为我 所以我想成为你
<15-2,House>Well,you're trying to be me,,so I thought I'd try to be you.

381
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,360
<15-3,Cuddy>你没我的乳沟
<15-3,Cuddy>You don't have the cleavage for it.

382
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,160
<15-4,House>但我臀部肌肉比你紧
<15-4,House>But I havea much tighter ass.

383
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,080
<15-4,House>你觉得每天都该过得像"赤裸星期四"
<15-4,House>You think every day,should be naked thursday,

384
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,810
<15-4,House>还是这是种矛盾修饰法?
<15-4,House>or is that an oxymoron?

385
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,230
<15-4,House>让我看看膀胱穿刺检验的结果
<15-4,House>Let me see the results of the bladder tap.

386
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,650
<15-5,Cuddy>还没出来
<15-5,Cuddy>They aren't back yet.

387
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,490
<15-6,House>不会有什么结论的
<15-6,House>They're gonna be inconclusive.

388
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,180
<15-7,Cuddy>你觉得我诊断错了?
<15-7,Cuddy>You think my diagnosisis wrong?

389
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,820
<15-8,House>胎儿不撒尿 则羊水应该偏少
<15-8,House>Fetus doesn't pee,,amniotic fluid should be low.

390
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,030
<15-8,House>但妈妈的羊水很正常
<15-8,House>Mom's level is fine.

391
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,200
<15-9,Cuddy>不代表我错了
<15-9,Cuddy>Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

392
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,100
<15-9,Cuddy>也许意味着我们及早发现了阻塞
<15-9,Cuddy>Could just mean we caught,the obstruction early.

393
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,990
<15-10,House>不管怎么样 你的检测都得不出什么结论
<15-10,House>Either way,your tests,will be inconclusive.

394
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,960
<15-10,House>你抽取的尿液已经,在胎儿膀胱里积了几个星期
<15-10,House>The urine you collected has been,sitting in that fetus' bladder for weeks.

395
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,680
<15-10,House>我老爸过去常说 陈尿无用
<15-10,House>And as my pappy always said,,"stale pee is useless pee".

396
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,360
<15-11,Cuddy>很好 那我再做一次穿刺
<15-11,Cuddy>Fine,then I'll do another tap.

397
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,840
<15-12,House>一样没用
<15-12,House>Just as useless.

398
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,070
<15-12,House>第一次穿刺后,存留在肾脏里的陈尿会流下来
<15-12,House>Old urine drops down from the kidney right,after the first tap 'cause it's all backed up.

399
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,600
<15-12,House>第三次膀胱穿刺才能抽到最新的尿
<15-12,House>Bladder tap number three,will give you the freshest pee,

400
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,640
<15-12,House>那时候你会发现 胎儿是否还有机会
<15-12,House>and it's when you'll find out,if this fetus has even a fighting chance.

401
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,690
<5-7,Emma>谢谢
<5-7,Emma>Thank you.

402
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,920
<15-13,Cuddy>我再做两次穿刺
<15-13,Cuddy>I'll run two more taps.

403
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,900
<15-14,House>医院院长几时起 开始做膀胱穿刺了?
<15-14,House>Since when does the dean of medicine,run bladder taps?

404
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,300
<15-15,Cuddy>她是个重要的病人
<15-15,Cuddy>She's an important patient.

405
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,050
<15-16,House>因为她搞摄影?
<15-16,House>Because she takes pictures?

406
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,140
<15-16,House>还是因为她跟你一样?
<15-16,House>Or because she's you?

407
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,120
<15-16,House>40多岁的
<15-16,House>A woman in her 40s.

408
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,440
<15-16,House>单身女人
<15-16,House>Single.

409
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,450
<15-16,House>将母性最后的渴望寄托在滴管上,(喻人工受孕)
<15-16,House>Using a turkey baster as,a last gasp at motherhood.

410
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,800
<15-16,House>你想确保她成功
<15-16,House>And you wanna make sure she succeeds,

411
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,530
<15-16,House>那么自己仍有希望
<15-16,House>so you'll still have hope.

412
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,260
<15-16,House>不客观就当不了好医生
<15-16,House>Can't be a good doctor,if you're not objective.

413
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,550
<15-17,Cuddy>这是你的病人档案
<15-17,Cuddy>It's your file.

414
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,590
<15-18,House>我不要
<15-18,House>I don't want it.

415
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,560
<15-19,Cuddy>那你干嘛说那么多?
<15-19,Cuddy>Then why did you just say all that stuff?

416
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,080
<15-20,House>为了羞辱你
<15-20,House>To humiliate you.

417
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,310
<15-21,Cuddy>- 你继续去处理这起病例,- 我不要
<15-21,Cuddy>- You're taking the case back.,- I don't want it.

418
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,430
<15-22,House>你的诊断是对的 我要休假
<15-22,House>Your diagnosis is right.,I wanna go on vacation.

419
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,240
<15-23,Cuddy>治好她你就可以去休假了
<15-23,Cuddy>You can go on vacation,after you've cured her.

420
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,700
<16-1,Chase>好消息
<16-1,Chase>good news.

421

<16-1,Chase>婴儿尿液里的蛋白质和电解液正常
<16-1,Chase>The fetus' urinehad appropriate levels,of protein and electrolytes,

422
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,530
<16-1,Chase>他的肾没有受损
<16-1,Chase>so his kidneys aren't damaged.

423
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,920
<16-3,Chase>我们要插入分流管
<16-3,Chase>We're gonna put the shunt in,

424
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,790
<16-3,Chase>使得婴儿的肺有更多生长空间
<16-3,Chase>your baby's lungs should,have more room to grow,

425
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,540
<16-3,Chase>你的症状也会随之消失
<16-3,Chase>and your symptoms should go away.

426
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,270
<16-4,Emma>但他出生后还要做外科手术?
<16-4,Emma>But he'll still need surgery,after he's born?

427
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,060
<16-5,Chase>到那时 去除输尿管阻塞
<16-5,Chase>That's when we'll remove,the blockage in the ureter.

<16-6,Emma>我要用影像记录下这个超现实的过程
<16-6,Emma>I'm keeping a visual memory book,of this entire surreal process,

432
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,410
<16-6,Emma>现在是迄今为止最美妙的一刻
<16-6,Emma>and this is the best part,of the story so far.

<16-11,Chase>不用 上班时整天都看到她
<16-11,Chase>Oh,I see her all day at work,,I don't need it.

438
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,600
<16-12,Emma>也许下了班你还想看着她
<16-12,Emma>Maybe you wanna see her after work.

439
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,540
<16-12,Emma>我说对了吧?
<16-12,Emma>I'm right,right?

440
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,960
<16-12,Emma>你看着她时流露感情
<16-12,Emma>I saw the way you look at her.

<17-1,Cameron>膀胱开始减压了
<17-1,Cameron>The bladder's starting to decompress.

<17-2,Chase>关于我们俩 House还说什么了吗?
<17-2,Chase>Did house say anything else?,About us?

446
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,300
<17-3,Cameron>我以为你不在乎他怎么反应
<17-3,Cameron>I thought you didn't care,about his reaction.

447
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,150
<17-3,Cameron>想引起他的妒忌?
<17-3,Cameron>Trying to make him jealous?

448
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,770
<17-4,Chase>我喜欢这份工作
<17-4,Chase>I like my job.

449
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,750
<17-5,Cameron>他不能因为我们在一起就解雇你
<17-5,Cameron>He can't fire you just,because we're together.

450
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,610
<17-6,Chase>我们没在一起,再说House总是为所欲为
<17-6,Chase>We're not together,,and house can do whatever he wants.

451
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,590
<17-7,Emma>我的孩子怎么样了?

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,860
<17-10,Chase>那不是她的胃
<17-10,Chase>That's not her stomach.

<17-11,Cameron>能睁开眼睛吗 Emma?
<17-11,Cameron>Can you open your eyes,emma?

<18-3,Cameron>我还以为你在阿根廷爬什么山呢
<18-3,Cameron>I thought you were climbing mount,whatever in argentina.

463
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,540
<18-4,House>我得跟莫科维印第安人共同生活20年
<18-4,House>Apparently I'd have to live with,the mocovi indians for 20 years

464
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,820
<18-4,House>他们才会把我当成老人
<18-4,House>before they'd consider me an elder.

465
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,300
<18-4,House>我决定去陪逆戟鲸玩皮划艇
<18-4,House>Decided to go kayaking with orca instead.

<18-4,House>- 不用劳驾我的腿了,- 你现在还不能走
<18-4,House>- No legs required.,- Can't leave yet.

467
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,510
<18-5,Foreman>肝功能衰竭,又让她的病症变得扑朔迷离
<18-5,Foreman>Liver failure puts her case back,in the unsolved pile.

468
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,950
<18-6,Chase>氨基转移酶AST和ALT增加,胆红素远远超标
<18-6,Chase>Increased ast,alt,,and her bilirubin's off the charts.

469
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,460
<18-7,House>甚至胎儿都撒谎
<18-7,House>Even fetuses lie.

470
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,200
<18-7,House>我们根据现象诊断出下尿路梗阻
<18-7,House>We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction,because we saw one.

471
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,320
<18-7,House>事实全部并非如此呢?
<18-7,House>What if that's not the whole story?

472
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,760
<18-7,House>万一这个小混蛋有所隐瞒
<18-7,House>What if the little bugger is hiding something?

473
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,830
<18-7,House>镜式反应综合征的真正原因
<18-7,House>Real reason for the mirror syndrome.

474
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,420
<18-7,House>我们是否到它床底下检查过?
<18-7,House>Have we looked under its bed?

475
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
<18-7,House>或看过它的日记?
<18-7,House>Have we checked its diary?

476
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,510
<18-8,Foreman>如果问题不在泌尿生殖系统,就有可能出在心脏
<18-8,Foreman>If it's not gu,it could be the heart.

477
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,710
<18-8,Foreman>左心室发育不全综合症
<18-8,Foreman>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

478

<18-9,Chase>- There were no structural problems.,- Lungs.

479
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,760
<18-11,Cameron>在它们发育前没法看清楚,得等上几个星期
<18-11,Cameron>We won't be able to get a good look,until they develop. It'll be weeks.

480
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,620
<18-12,House>他坚持不了几星期
<18-12,House>He's not gonna last weeks.

481
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,720
<18-13,Foreman>那你想怎么做?
<18-13,Foreman>What do you wanna do?

482
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,290
<18-14,House>母体镜式反映综合症,有个万无一失的治疗方法
<18-14,House>Maternal mirror syndrome,has one surefire cure.

483
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,650
<18-14,House>分娩胎儿
<18-14,House>Deliver the fetus.

484
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,450
<18-15,Chase>21周大的婴儿不能分娩 会害死婴儿的
<18-15,Chase>That's not viable at 21 weeks.,You'lll the baby.

485
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,340
<18-16,House>是胎儿
<18-16,House>Fetus.

486
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,680
<18-17,Cameron>语义学让你感觉更自在吗?,好象它不是人一样?
<18-17,Cameron>Semantics make you feel better?,Pretend it's not a person?

487
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,770
<18-18,House>它会传球吗?
<18-18,House>Can it play catch?

488
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,730
<18-18,House>会吃吗?
<18-18,House>Can it eat?

489
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,470
<18-18,House>会拍出美丽动人的照片吗?
<18-18,House>Can it take pretty pictures?

490
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,030
<18-18,House>谁去跟她说?
<18-18,House>Who wants to tell her?

491
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,370
<19-1,House>膀胱肿胀不是唯一的毛病
<19-1,House>the swollen bladder,was not the only problem.

492
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,730
<19-1,House>我们不能让你继续怀着孩子,得终止妊娠
<19-1,House>We can't leave it inside you.,We have to terminate.

493
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,970
<19-2,Emma>不能为它分娩吗?
<19-2,Emma>Well,can't you deliver him?

494
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,140
<19-2,Emma>放进呼吸机 直到找出毛病在哪儿
<19-2,Emma>Put him on a respiratory machine till--,till you figure out what's wrong.

495
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,270
<19-2,Emma>可以
<19-2,Emma>We can.

496
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,190
<19-3,House>但没用
<19-3,House>It won't matter.

497
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,710
<19-3,House>胎儿至少还要两个星期才能分娩
<19-3,House>The fetus is still at least two weeks,away from being viable.

498
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,850
<19-4,Emma>那我再多受两个星期的苦好了
<19-4,Emma>Oh,well,I'll suffer through this,for two more weeks,then.

499
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,100
<19-5,House>你已经开始做肾脏透析
<19-5,House>You're on dialysis for your kidneys.

500
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,590
<19-5,House>肾脏可以等
<19-5,House>Your kidneys can wait.

501
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,490
<19-5,House>但它们不为你的肝脏服务
<19-5,House>They don't make dialysis for your liver.

502
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,750
<19-5,House>你两天都活不了
<19-5,House>You're not gonna make it two more days.

503
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,910
<19-6,Emma>我不会让你杀死我的孩子
<19-6,Emma>I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.

504
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,390
<19-7,House>它会杀死你
<19-7,House>It's killing you.

505
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,870
<19-8,Emma>我不要流产
<19-8,Emma>I'm not having an abortion.

506
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,710
<19-8,Emma>这不是个婴儿
<19-8,Emma>It's not a baby.

507
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,090
<19-9,House>而是...瘤
<19-9,House>It's...a tumor.

508
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,700
<19-9,House>我明白你想死得其所
<19-9,House>I understand dying for a cause,

509
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,900
<19-9,House>为让孩子活下来 放弃自己的性命
<19-9,House>sacrificing your life,so your child might live.

510
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,750
<19-9,House>但现在不是这情况
<19-9,House>But that's not the choice here.

511
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,930
<19-9,House>或者胎儿死 或者你们都没命
<19-9,House>Either it dies,or you both die.

512
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,850
<19-10,Emma>或者你治好他 我们都活下来
<19-10,Emma>Or you fix him,and we both live.

513
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,710
<19-10,Emma>我治不好它
<19-10,Emma>I can't fix it.

514
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,670
<19-11,House>我去安排刮宫术
<19-11,House>I'm scheduling a d and C.

515
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,330
<19-12,Emma>我不会同意的
<19-12,Emma>I won't consent.

516
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,260
<19-12,Emma>所以我猜你有两天时间去想办法
<19-12,Emma>So i guess you have two days,to figure it out.

517
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,830
<20-1,House>她的肾几乎无法复原了
<20-1,House>Her kidneys are almost irreparable.

518
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,580
<20-1,House>还得了严重的弥散性血管内凝血
<20-1,House>She's developed severe dic.

519
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,260
<20-1,House>你得强迫她终止妊娠
<20-1,House>You have to force her to terminate.

520
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,890
<20-2,Cuddy>你用皮质类固醇加速孩子的肺部发育了吗?
<20-2,Cuddy>Did you give corticosteroids to,speed the baby's lung development?

521
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,360
<20-3,House>没有 我往它胸口塞了块砧骨以阻止肺发育
<20-3,House>No,I dropped an anvilon its chest,to prevent lung development.

522
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,140
<20-3,House>我要灭绝人类 一次干掉一个胎儿
<20-3,House>I'm trying to extinguish,the human race one fetus at a time.

523
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,010
<20-4,Cuddy>再给肺点时间扩张 就能检查它内部了
<20-4,Cuddy>Give the lungs more time to expand,so you can see inside them,

524
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,220
<20-4,Cuddy>看是否是肺的问题
<20-4,Cuddy>see if they're the problem.

525
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,260
<20-5,House>我现实中的病人马上就要死了
<20-5,House>My real patient is dying.,Very quickly.

526
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,190
<20-5,House>我可不会建议她去买青香蕉,(耗时间等香蕉变黄)
<20-5,House>Like,I wouldn't advise her to,buy any green bananas.

527
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,180
<20-5,House>此时的胎儿不过是个寄生虫
<20-5,House>The fetus is nothing more than,a parasite at this point.

528
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,740
<20-5,House>移除胎儿刻不容缓
<20-5,House>Removing it is an instant cure.

529
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,300
<20-6,Cuddy>你无法让Emma从这种角度想
<20-6,Cuddy>You're not gonna get emma,to see it that way.

530
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,740
<20-6,Cuddy>她多半给婴儿取好了名字
<20-6,Cuddy>She's probably already named the baby.

531
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,810
<20-6,Cuddy>念书给他听 跟他说话
<20-6,Cuddy>Read him books,,had conversations with him.

532
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,930
<20-7,House>你说得对
<20-7,House>You get it.

533
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,970
<20-7,House>她会听你的
<20-7,House>She'll listen to you.

534
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,100
<20-8,Cuddy>不行
<20-8,Cuddy>No.

535
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,970
<20-9,House>你让这个女人拒绝流产
<20-9,House>You let this woman refuse to terminate,

536
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,070
<20-9,House>就等于协助她自杀
<20-9,House>you're helping her commit suicide.

537
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,460
<20-9,House>做为她的医生 我反对自杀
<20-9,House>As her doctor,,my recommendation is against suicide.

538
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,030
<20-10,Cuddy>如果婴儿有个医生
<20-10,Cuddy>If the baby had a doctor,

539
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,830
<20-10,Cuddy>我认为她会在夺走它生命前,穷尽一切可能
<20-10,Cuddy>I think she would recommend exhausting,all possibilities before taking its life.

540
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,910
<20-11,House>那她就是白痴
<20-11,House>Then she'd be an idiot.

541
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,540
<20-12,Cuddy>真遗憾 她是你上司
<20-12,Cuddy>Too bad she's your boss.

542
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,590
<21-1,Cuddy>万一我们最初假设错了呢?
<21-1,Cuddy>What if our original assumption is wrong?

543
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,970
<21-2,House>没有错
<21-2,House>It isn'T.

544
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,850
<21-3,Cuddy>假设她没有镜式反映综合症
<21-3,Cuddy>If we assume,she doesn't have mirror syndrome,

545
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,280
<21-3,Cuddy>那么终止怀孕对她的肝脏毫无作用
<21-3,Cuddy>then terminating her pregnancy,isn't gonna help her liver at all.

546
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,430
<21-4,Foreman>我们已经排除了所有其它的可能
<21-4,Foreman>We eliminated all other possibilities.

547
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,900
<21-5,Chase>胎儿患有水肿 生命垂危
<21-5,Chase>The fetus is hydropic and in distress.

548
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,490
<21-5,Chase>Emma的肾和肝在衰竭下去
<21-5,Chase>Emma's kidneys and liver are failing.

549
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,520
<21-5,Chase>诊断很可靠
<21-5,Chase>The diagnosis is solid.

550
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,120
<21-6,House>连马屁精都不同意你的话
<21-6,House>The ass-kisser won't agree with you.

551
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,100
<21-6,House>你一定错得离谱
<21-6,House>You must be even wronger than I thought.

552
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,000
<21-6,House>好吧
<21-6,House>Fine.

553
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,030
<21-7,Cuddy>那就假设她患了镜式反映综合症
<21-7,Cuddy>Let's assume,she had mirror syndrome,

554
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,030
<21-7,Cuddy>但我们治婴儿膀胱时也将它治好了
<21-7,Cuddy>but we fixed it when,we fixed the baby's bladder.

555
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,000
<21-7,Cuddy>也就是说这跟肝脏的衰竭毫无关系
<21-7,Cuddy>That means that her failing liver,would be completely unrelated.

556
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,120
<21-7,Cuddy>如果是这样 我们就能治好它
<21-7,Cuddy>If it is,we can fix it.

557
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,600
<21-7,Cuddy>也不用终止妊娠
<21-7,Cuddy>And we don't have to terminate.

558
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,890
<21-8,House>因此她认为,病人的肝脏问题实属天大的巧合
<21-8,House>So her theory is that our patient's,liver problems were just a giant coincidence.

559
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,310
<21-9,Cuddy>并不是什么惊人的巧合
<21-9,Cuddy>It's nota surprising coincidence.

560
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,490
<21-9,Cuddy>怀孕女人是有可能出现肝脏问题
<21-9,Cuddy>Pregnant women can develop liver problems.

561
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,340
<21-9,Cuddy>如果是这样
<21-9,Cuddy>If this is the case,

562
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,870
<21-9,Cuddy>我们就可以采取相应措施
<21-9,Cuddy>we can actually do something here.

563
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,070
<21-9,Cuddy>你们不认为这值得深究吗?
<21-9,Cuddy>Don't you guys think,that's worth exploring?

564
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,370
<21-10,Cameron>妊娠急性脂肪肝会出现相同的症状
<21-10,Cameron>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy,would have the same symptoms.

565
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,350
<21-11,Cuddy>谢谢
<21-11,Cuddy>Thank you.

566
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,380
<21-12,House>马屁精
<21-12,House>Brown-noser.

567
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,310
<21-13,Chase>病毒性肝炎 HELLP综合症
<21-13,Chase>Viral hepatitis,hellp syndrome.

568
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,490
<21-14,House>看哪 为女友挺身而出
<21-14,House>Oh,look,sticking up for your girlfriend.

569
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,350
<21-14,House>谁说骑士精神荡然无存了?
<21-14,House>Who says chivalry's dead?

570
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,920
<21-15,Foreman>他没在开玩笑?
<21-15,Foreman>He's not joking?

571
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,270
<21-16,House>耐心点
<21-16,House>Be patient.

572
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,620
<21-16,House>她会一一经历我们 最终染上丛林热,(电影 喻不同种族间的性吸引)
<21-16,House>She's going through all of us,,she'll get that jungle fever eventually.

573
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,880
<21-17,Cameron>我谁都不会碰
<21-17,Cameron>I'm not going through anyone.

574
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,290
<21-18,House>你爱他吗?
<21-18,House>You love him?

575
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,070
<21-19,Cuddy>这问题可以等到,你做完Emma的肝脏活检 对吗?
<21-19,Cuddy>This can probably wait until,after you biopsy emma's liver,right?

576
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,190
<21-20,Foreman>不行 她的血小板太低了
<21-20,Foreman>we can't,her platelets are too low.

577
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,340
<21-20,Foreman>一旦刺破肝脏
<21-20,Foreman>Once we pierce her liver,

578
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,940
<21-20,Foreman>要阻止出血几乎不可能
<21-20,Foreman>it'll be next to impossible,to stop the bleeding.

579
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,470
<21-21,Cuddy>从上面进去
<21-21,Cuddy>Come in from above.

580
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,370
<21-21,Cuddy>不要从腹部直接穿刺
<21-21,Cuddy>Instead of going straight,in through her abdomen,

581
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,100
<21-21,Cuddy>而是从颈部的静脉进去
<21-21,Cuddy>go in through the veins in her neck.

582
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,910
<21-21,Cuddy>颈静脉肝活检
<21-21,Cuddy>Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

583
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,970
<21-21,Cuddy>如果肝脏开始出血
<21-21,Cuddy>If the liver starts to bleed,

584
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,060
<21-21,Cuddy>也会直接流回她自己的静脉
<21-21,Cuddy>it'll bleed right back into her own veins.

585
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,200
<21-21,Cuddy>你为什么不现在就开始休假呢?
<21-21,Cuddy>Why don't you start your vacation now?

586
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,150
<22-1,Chase>将导丝从左边的颈内静脉通进去
<22-1,Chase>Threading the guide wire through,the right internal jugular vein.

587
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,430
<22-1,Chase>那么
<22-1,Chase>So...

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,540
<22-2,Foreman>睡眠实验室?
<22-2,Foreman>the sleep lab?

589
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,810
<22-2,Foreman>你和Cameron可没睡着
<22-2,Foreman>You and cameron not sleeping.

590
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,680
<22-2,Foreman>这关系到底多认真?
<22-2,Foreman>How serious is it?

591
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,620
<22-2,Foreman>没什么
<22-2,Foreman>It's nothing.

592
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,890
<22-3,Chase>她只不过想让House吃醋才这么做的
<22-3,Chase>She's only doing it to make house jealous.

593
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,200
<22-4,Foreman>那你又为了什么?
<22-4,Foreman>Then why are you doing it?

594
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,270
<22-5,Chase>开什么玩笑?
<22-5,Chase>Are you kidding?

595
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,880
<22-6,Foreman>快到下腔静脉了
<22-6,Foreman>Approaching the inferior vena cava.

596
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,370
<22-6,Foreman>慢点
<22-6,Foreman>Slow down.

597
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,490
<22-6,Foreman>你最好别伤害她
<22-6,Foreman>You better not hurt her.

598
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,560
<22-7,Chase>- 她已经有老大哥罩着了,- 是吗?
<22-7,Chase>- She already has a big brother.,- She does?

599
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,880
<22-9,Chase>显而易见 你很关心她
<22-9,Chase>You obviously care very deeply about her.

600
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,160
<22-10,Foreman>我不是在保护她 我在保护我自己
<22-10,Foreman>I'm not protecting her,,I'm protecting myself.

601
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,100
<22-10,Foreman>Cameron心碎憔悴的时候...
<22-10,Foreman>A heartbroken,lovesick cameron...

602
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,540
<22-10,Foreman>比她现在更让人受不了
<22-10,Foreman>would be even more unbearable,than she is now.

603
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,120
<22-10,Foreman>肝静脉已经过了
<22-10,Foreman>You're through the hepatic vein.

604
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,430
<22-11,Chase>下针
<22-11,Chase>Firing the needle.

605
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,210
<22-12,Foreman>心率 血压大幅波动
<22-12,Foreman>Heart rate and bp spiking.

606
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,190
<22-12,Foreman>快把探针抽出来
<22-12,Foreman>Get that out of her.

607
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,700
<22-13,Chase>胎儿的心率刚刚降到50
<22-13,Chase>Fetus' heart rate just dropped to 50.

608
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,930
<22-13,Chase>子宫开始收缩了
<22-13,Chase>We've got contractions.

609
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,020
<22-14,Foreman>早产
<22-14,Foreman>Pre-term labor.

610
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,740
<22-14,Foreman>给她吊一针叔丁喘宁
<22-14,Foreman>Start a terbutaline drip.

611
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,880
<23-1,Chase>我们用母育酚安胎 阻止了早产
<23-1,Chase>We were able to control the,pre-term labor with tocolytics.

612
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,880
<23-1,Chase>宫缩现在暂时停止了
<23-1,Chase>The contraction shave subsided for now.

613
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,550
<23-2,Cameron>肝脏活检结果为阴性
<23-2,Cameron>And the liver biopsy was negative.

614
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,940
<23-2,Cameron>这肯定是镜式反应综合征
<23-2,Cameron>This is definitely mirror syndrome.

615
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,140
<23-2,Cameron>由肚子里的胎儿造成的
<23-2,Cameron>Her baby's doing this to her.

616
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,210
<23-3,Foreman>我们别无选择
<23-3,Foreman>We're out of options.

617
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,810
<23-4,Cuddy>早产是由活检造成的 还是自然发生的?
<23-4,Cuddy>Did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor,or did it happen on its own?

618
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,760
<23-5,Chase>两者没有分别
<23-5,Chase>It doesn't make a difference.

619
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,600
<23-6,Cuddy>早产可能是新症状
<23-6,Cuddy>Pre-term labor can be a new symptom.

620
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,500
<23-6,Cuddy>根据新信息能得出新的诊断结果
<23-6,Cuddy>New information gives us new theories.

621
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,430
<23-6,Cuddy>难道不是这么治病的吗?
<23-6,Cuddy>Isn't that how it works?

622
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,510
<23-7,Foreman>这个病例不同
<23-7,Foreman>Not in this case.

623
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,610
<23-7,Foreman>她的身体想方设法做你想阻止的事
<23-7,Foreman>Her body's trying to do,what you refuse to.

624
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,110
<23-7,Foreman>为了挽救自己 把胎儿赶出来
<23-7,Foreman>Get the baby out and save itself.

625
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,310
<23-8,Cameron>病人的转氨酶水平是正常范围的10倍
<23-8,Cameron>Patient's transaminases are,ten times normal.

626
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,310
<23-8,Cameron>她的肝功能即将完全停止
<23-8,Cameron>Her liver's on the verge of,shutting down completely.

627
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,310
<23-9,Cuddy>做个TORCH检查可以--
<23-9,Cuddy>A torch test could--

628
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,510
<23-10,Foreman>没时间再做检查了
<23-10,Foreman>we don't have time for more tests.

629
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,810
<23-10,Foreman>必须终止妊娠 不然她性命不保
<23-10,Foreman>We have to terminate or she'll die.

630
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,210
<23-11,Cuddy>那我们加快速度
<23-11,Cuddy>Then let's work faster.

631
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,010
<23-12,Cameron>希望再迫切 药效也不会加快发作
<23-12,Cameron>Medicine doesn't work faster,just because you hope real hard.

632
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,310
<23-13,Cuddy>可以弄清楚 胎儿到底隐藏了什么
<23-13,Cuddy>But it could help to see,what the baby's been hiding.

633
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,210
<23-13,Cuddy>唯一无法检查的器官,就是胎儿的肺部
<23-13,Cuddy>The only organ we haven't been,able to look inside is its lungs.

634
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,310
<23-13,Cuddy>问题一定就出在那
<23-13,Cuddy>The problem must be in there.

635
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,510
<23-14,Chase>无法检查 是因为肺部还未发育完全
<23-14,Chase>We haven't been able to see inside,because they're under developed.

636
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,410
<23-14,Chase>已经给她用了皮质类固醇
<23-14,Chase>We've already got her on,corticosteroids,

637
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,510
<23-15,Cuddy>- 但要几个星期才会起效,- 加大皮质类固醇剂量
<23-15,Cuddy>- but it'll take weeks for them--,- then let's drown them in corticosteroids.

638
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,410
<23-15,Cuddy>多疗程治疗 加速发育
<23-15,Cuddy>Multiple courses,,speed up their development.

639
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,510
<23-16,Foreman>对胎儿进行多疗程治疗,会抑制肾上腺的功能
<23-16,Foreman>Giving the baby more than one course,will suppress adrenal gland function.

640
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,010
<23-17,Chase>对胎儿器官的发育有长期的不良影响
<23-17,Chase>Have long-term adverse,effects on fetal organ development.

641
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,910
<23-18,Cuddy>- 比死更糟吗?,- Emma已经用了母育酚
<23-18,Cuddy>- Worse than death?,- emma's already on tocolytics.

642
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,910
<23-19,Cameron>多疗程治疗可能诱发肺水肿
<23-19,Cameron>The combination could put,her into pulmonary edema.

643
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,410
<23-19,Cameron>你只会让她死的更快
<23-19,Cameron>You'll just kill her faster.

644
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,910
<23-20,Cuddy>只有这样才能了解胎儿的肺部状况
<23-20,Cuddy>It's the only chance we have to,see inside those lungs.

645
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,510
<23-20,Cuddy>必须让胎儿好起来 快于让Emma恶化的速度
<23-20,Cuddy>We're just gonna have to make the baby,better faster than we make emma worse.

646
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,910
<23-20,Cuddy>得了 House每天都做这样的事!
<23-20,Cuddy>Come on, this is the kind of,thing house does every day!

647
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,710
<23-21,Foreman>House认为6个小时前 就该终止妊娠了
<23-21,Foreman>House thought we should,terminate six hours ago.

648
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,710
<23-22,Cuddy>我自己做
<23-22,Cuddy>I'll do it myself.

649
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,510
<23-23,Cameron>谁来阻止她?
<23-23,Cameron>Anybody gonna stop her?

650
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,610
<23-24,Chase>一贯都是她阻止别人发疯的
<23-24,Chase>Stopping the madness is her job.

651
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,310
<23-24,Chase>得有人充当Cuddy 管管Cuddy了
<23-24,Chase>Somebody's gotta be cuddy's cuddy.

652
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,510
<24-1,Cuddy>护士!
<24-1,Cuddy>Nurse!

653
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,610
<24-2,Wilson>- 肺水肿?,- 哪个大嘴巴说的?
<24-2,Wilson>- Pulmonary edema?,- Who tattled?

654
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,610
<24-3,Cuddy>无所谓
<24-3,Cuddy>Doesn't matter.

655
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,810
<24-4,Wilson>不采用皮质类固醇多疗程疗法,是有原因的
<24-4,Wilson>There's a reason we don't give,multiple courses of corticosteroids.

656
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,110
<24-5,Cuddy>是啊 谢谢提醒
<24-5,Cuddy>Gee, thanks.

657
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,710
<24-6,Wilson>现在该终止妊娠了
<24-6,Wilson>It's time to terminate.

658
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,010
<24-7,Cuddy>她不想这样
<24-7,Cuddy>That's not what she wants.

659
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,210
<24-7,Cuddy>看看她
<24-7,Cuddy>Look at her.

660
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,310
<24-8,Wilson>她不想做死胎的育婴箱
<24-8,Wilson>She didn't want to be,an incubator for a dead baby,

661
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,510
<24-8,Wilson>可你却硬要这样
<24-8,Wilson>but that's what you've done.

662
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,410
<24-9,Cuddy>把喉镜给我 要不就滚出去
<24-9,Cuddy>Either get me a laryngoscope or get out.

663
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,460
<25-1,Cuddy>你是对的
<25-1,Cuddy>you were right.

664
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,060
<25-1,Cuddy>你一直都是正确的
<25-1,Cuddy>You were all right.

665
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,760
<25-1,Cuddy>现在母亲的肺部功能停止了
<25-1,Cuddy>Now the mom's lungs are shutting down.

666
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,660
<25-1,Cuddy>她的衰竭速度 比婴儿肺的发育速度快
<25-1,Cuddy>She's dying faster than,the baby's lungs are developing.

667
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,660
<25-1,Cuddy>必须停用皮质类固醇
<25-1,Cuddy>I had to stop the corticosteroids.

668
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,260
<25-2,Wilson>你和家属谈过了吗?
<25-2,Wilson>Have you spoken to the family?

669
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,960
<25-3,Cuddy>她唯一的亲人就是这个婴儿
<25-3,Cuddy>The only family she's got is that baby.

670
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,560
<25-4,Wilson>他的意见偏倚
<25-4,Wilson>Well, he's biased.

671
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,660
<25-5,Cuddy>你觉得House会怎么做?
<25-5,Cuddy>What do you think house would do?

672
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,560
<25-6,Wilson>House想终止妊娠
<25-6,Wilson>House wants to terminate.

673
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,360
<25-7,Cuddy>我是说如果他不终止
<25-7,Cuddy>I mean if he didn'T.

674
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,160
<25-7,Cuddy>如果他在我的位置上 他会怎么办?
<25-7,Cuddy>If he shared my position,,what do you think he would do?

675
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,560
<25-8,Wilson>他不会像你这么痛苦
<25-8,Wilson>He wouldn't share your pain.

676
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,460
<25-8,Wilson>他会客观处理
<25-8,Wilson>He'd be objective.

677
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,660
<25-9,Cuddy>是的
<25-9,Cuddy>Right.

678
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,960
<25-9,Cuddy>他会分轻重缓急
<25-9,Cuddy>He would prioritize his problems.

679
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,760
<25-10,Wilson>他会选择终止妊娠
<25-10,Wilson>He'd terminate.

680
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,660
<25-11,Cuddy>他不会在乎把病人的肺弄的一团糟
<25-11,Cuddy>He wouldn't be afraid of,screwing with her lungs

681
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,660
<25-11,Cuddy>还存在更严重的问题
<25-11,Cuddy>if there was a bigger issue.

682
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,760
<25-12,Wilson>没有更严重的问题了 她需要肺
<25-12,Wilson>There is no bigger issue.,She needs her lungs.

683
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,160
<25-12,Wilson>现阶段未必
<25-12,Wilson>Not right now.

684
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,060
<25-13,Cuddy>给她上了呼吸器
<25-13,Cuddy>She's already on a respirator.

685
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,260
<25-13,Cuddy>有机器替她呼吸
<25-13,Cuddy>The machine is breathing for her.

686
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,260
<25-13,Cuddy>可以对她的肺为所欲为
<25-13,Cuddy>I can do whatever I want to her lungs.

687
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,960
<25-13,Cuddy>要是你在客厅里抛接球,打碎了妈妈的花瓶
<25-13,Cuddy>If you're playing catch in the living room,and you break your mother's vase,

688
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,360
<25-13,Cuddy>你大可以继续玩下去
<25-13,Cuddy>you may as well keep playing catch.

689
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,660
<25-13,Cuddy>花瓶已经碎了
<25-13,Cuddy>The vase is already broken.

690
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,460
<25-14,Wilson>不过这个客厅没了花瓶 无法呼吸
<25-14,Wilson>Yeah, except that room can't,breathe without that vase.

691
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,260
<25-15,Cuddy>我要继续给她用皮质类固醇
<25-15,Cuddy>I'm putting her back on corticosteroids.

692
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,460
<26-2,House>- 起作用了,- 什么起作用了
<26-2,House>- It worked.,- What worked?

693
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,460
<26-3,Cuddy>我对胎儿肺部进行扩张
<26-3,Cuddy>I got the baby's lungs to expand.

694
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,160
<26-3,Cuddy>- 我们应该可以--,- 出租车快到了
<26-3,Cuddy>- We should be able--,- cab's on its way.

695
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,660
<26-4,House>我得赶紧收拾行李
<26-4,House>I have to finish packing.

696
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,060
<26-5,Cuddy>对于你所做所为 我有了全新的认识
<26-5,Cuddy>I have a whole new appreciation,for what you do.

697
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,360
<26-5,Cuddy>真的很难坚持己见
<26-5,Cuddy>How hard it is to believe,when everyone around you

698
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,660
<26-5,Cuddy>当身边的人都说你错了
<26-5,Cuddy>is telling you that you're wrong.

699
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,460
<26-6,House>知道他们是白痴 有帮助
<26-6,House>Helps to know they're idiots.

700
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,560
<26-7,Cuddy>你觉得我是白痴吗?
<26-7,Cuddy>Do you think I'm an idiot?

701
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,360
<26-8,House>你不够客观
<26-8,House>You're not objective.

702
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,060
<26-8,House>可你不是白痴
<26-8,House>But you're not an idiot.

703
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,160
<26-8,House>还要两个星期,胎儿的肺才能脱离母体存活
<26-8,House>These lungs are still two weeks,away from being viable.

704
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,960
<26-9,Cuddy>不过已经可以诊断了
<26-9,Cuddy>But big enough for a diagnosis.

705
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,760
<26-10,House>这些组织芽体是新长出来的
<26-10,House>These tissue buds are new.

706
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,060
<26-10,House>可能是支气管肺隔离症 或者是横膈上提
<26-10,House>Could indicate bronchopulmonary,sequestration or diaphragmatic eventration.

707
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,760
<26-11,Cuddy>我觉得是遗传性分支囊肿 或支气管闭锁
<26-11,Cuddy>I was thinking bronchogenetic,cyst or bronchial atresia.

708
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,960
<26-12,House>可能是肺损伤 先天性肺囊性腺瘤样畸形
<26-12,House>Could be lung lesions,ccam.

709
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,960
<26-13,Cuddy>会不会是--
<26-13,Cuddy>What about--

710
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,660
<26-14,House>走

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,360
<27-1,Cameron>我以为你去度假了
<27-1,Cameron>I thought you started your vacation.

712
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,760
<27-2,House>总得有人为老板闯的祸擦屁股
<27-2,House>Somebody had to save,our boss' rotundus ass.

<27-2,House>Latest mri of the sloan fetus.

714
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,660
<27-3,Foreman>肺部细小的芽体可能表明--
<27-3,Foreman>Small buds in the lungs could indicate--

715
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,760
<27-4,House>多谢 候选答案已经有了
<27-4,House>thanks,,got that multiple choice all worked out.

716
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,060
<27-4,House>问题是 如何在a b c d及以上皆非中选择
<27-4,House>Question is,how do we pick between,a, b, c, d and none of the above?

717
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,460
<27-5,Cuddy>病房里有便携式核磁共振仪
<27-5,Cuddy>Portable mri's in her room.

718
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,560
<27-5,Cuddy>可以得到现阶段的图象--
<27-5,Cuddy>We could get a current image--

719
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,860
<27-6,Chase>胎儿的肺太小,核磁共振也提供不了所需细节
<27-6,Chase>fetal lungs are so tiny,,an mri won't give us the details we need.

720
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:09,060
<27-7,House>要是这病人不是蝌蚪 我们怎么办?
<27-7,House>What would we do if,this patient were not just a tadpole?

721
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,360
<27-7,House>比如说它是个活生生的人
<27-7,House>Say it was an actual person.

722
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,860
<27-8,Cuddy>他是...个人

<27-9,House>假设这是一个一磅重的成年人
<27-9,House>Pretend it's a one-pound adult.

725
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,960
<27-9,House>别管母体 子宫和胎盘
<27-9,House>Forget the mom,forget the womb,,the placenta.

726
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,760
<27-9,House>怎么才能更清楚地查看肺的内部?
<27-9,House>How would we get a better,look at what's in the lungs?

727
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,060
<27-10,Cameron>做食道超声图
<27-10,Cameron>Transe sophageal echo.

728
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,560
<27-11,Chase>进不了胎儿的食道
<27-11,Chase>Can't access its esophagus.

729
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,260
<27-12,Foreman>高分辨率CT诊断可以让我们更清楚的—
<27-12,Foreman>High-resolution ct could,give us a clearer—

730
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,660
<27-13,Chase>一磅重的婴儿受不了那么大的辐射
<27-13,Chase>too much radiation for a,one-pound person.

731
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,160
<27-14,House>你不能什么都否决 Chase
<27-14,House>You can't just shoot,everything down,chase.

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,060
<27-14,House>你又不是我 合作
<27-14,House>You're not me.Collaborate.

00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,260
<27-15,Chase>接下来做肺通气灌注扫描
<27-15,Chase>A ventilation perfusion scan,would be next.

734
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,360
<27-16,House>怎么让胎儿吸入放射性同位素?
<27-16,House>How do we get a fetus to breathe,in a radioactive isotope?

735
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,060
<27-16,House>白痴
<27-16,House>Idiot.

736
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,460
<27-17,Chase>如果它是个人 没有其他选择的话
<27-17,Chase>If it were really a person,and we had no other options,

737
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,060
<27-17,Chase>可以做探测手术
<27-17,Chase>we'd do an exploratory surgery.

738
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,060
<27-17,Chase>剖开胸 看个明白
<27-17,Chase>Cut into its chest and have,a look around.

<27-17,Chase>我们就这么做吧
<27-17,Chase>Let's do that.

740
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,960
<27-18,House>是你要坚持把它当人看
<27-18,House>You're the one who insists,we treat it like a person.

741
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,360
<27-18,House>等我做完 会把它放回去的
<27-18,House>I'll put it back when I'm done.

<28-1,House>剖开子宫 取出胎儿看个究竟
<28-1,House>We open the uterus,,cut out the fetus so we can look around.

<28-1,House>我知道你不能说话 那么
<28-1,House>I know you can't talk,so

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,960
<28-1,House>我们不会割断脐带
<28-1,House>The umbilical cord won't be cut.

749
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,760

<28-2,Cuddy>During surgery,

750
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,860
<28-2,Cuddy>你的身体基本等同于胎儿的心肺机
<28-2,Cuddy>your body will basically serve,as the baby's heart-lung machine.

751

<28-2,Cuddy>我们会找到问题治好它
<28-2,Cuddy>We find what's wrong and we fix it.

<28-4,Cuddy>She should know what she's facing.

<28-4,Cuddy>手术过程非常危险
<28-4,Cuddy>This is incredibly dangerous.

00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,860
<28-4,Cuddy>会危及你和宝宝的生命
<28-4,Cuddy>It risks both your lives.

757
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,460
<28-4,Cuddy>建议这么做仅仅是因为
<28-4,Cuddy>The only reason why we're suggesting it

758
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,060
<28-4,Cuddy>没有别的方法了
<28-4,Cuddy>is because there's nothing else we can do.
