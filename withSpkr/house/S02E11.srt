<3-36,Cam>亨式病的确诊需要时间,我们该给她用上三苯氧胺
<3-36,Cam>Huntington's takes a day to confirm. We should put her on tamoxifen

<3-47,Foreman>Okay. Get an mri.

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,000

96
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,230
<3-45,Cam>我们要确定一下
<3-45,Cam>We need to find out for sure.

97
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,530
<3-46,Ted>一旦她生产后这一切都会恢复正常么?
<3-46,Ted>Would all this go away once she delivered?

<3-47,Foreman>依然有神经系统问题的可能,我们要做核磁
<3-47,Foreman>It couldso be neurological. We need to get an mri.

<3-49,Cam>对胎儿的危害甚小
<3-49,Cam>The risk to the fetus is extremely low.

101
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,030
<3-50,Mom>可依然有风险
<3-50,Mom>But there is a risk.

102
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,860
<3-50,Mom>我……我看我们在确定前不该做
<3-50,Mom>I-I don't think we should do it until we're sure.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
<3-50,Mom>啊
<3-50,Mom>Ah.

104
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,600
<3-50,Mom>特德，我看你还是带斯黛回家吧
<3-50,Mom>Ted,I think you should take stella home.

105
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,470
<3-51,Ted>我要呆着，我们该陪你
<3-51,Ted>I want to stay here. We should be with you.

<3-54,Foreman>It's a paralytic.

110
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,500
<3-54,Foreman>其实就是从肌肉上切断大脑
<3-54,Foreman>Essentially cuts off the brain from the muscles.

<3-54,Foreman>别担心，你妈妈不会有事的

<3-62,Foreman>你所有器官会被严密监视
<3-62,Foreman>Your vitals will be watched closely.

119
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,290
<3-62,Foreman>我要合上你的眼睑,这样你的眼睛才不会太干
<3-62,Foreman>I'm going to close your lids your eyesn't dry out.

120
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,150
<3-62,Foreman>放松吧
<3-62,Foreman>Just try to relax.

121
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,670
<3-63,Wilson >你到底干了什么啊?
<3-63,Wilson >What the hell did you do?

122
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,470
<3-63,Wilson >就因为你冷还孤独么?
<3-63,Wilson >Were you just cold and lonely?

123
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,630
<3-64,Stacy >他当然会告诉你，他是个才8岁的小孩
<3-64,Stacy >Course he told you,he's an eight-year-old boy.

124
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,320
<3-65,Wilson>嘿，你才是那个亲吻他的人
<3-65,Wilson>Hey,you're the one who kissed him.

125
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,110
<3-66,Stacy>你那么起劲干什么?
<3-66,Stacy>Why are you so worked up over this?

126
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,030
<3-67,Wilson>- 因为你结婚了,- 又不是跟你
<3-67,Wilson>- Because you're married. ,- Not to you.

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,290
<3-68,Stacy>这没你什么事
<3-68,Stacy>This is none of your business.

128
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,460
<3-69,Wilson>上次你离开的时候
<3-69,Wilson>The last time you left,

129
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,860
<3-69,Wilson>我是那个收拾残局的人
<3-69,Wilson>I was the one stuck picking up the pieces.

130
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,940
<3-70,Stacy>哦，好吧，他每晚哭着入睡,他是那样的人么？
<3-70,Stacy>Oh,right. He cried himself to sleep every night. That so sounds like him.

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,810
<3-71,Wilson>他都害5年相思病了
<3-71,Wilson>He's been pining for five years!

132
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,000
<3-73,Wilson>- 你太戏剧化了,- 不，实际上，我还没充分发挥呢
<3-73,Wilson>- You' being dramatic. ,- No. Actually,I'm underplaying.

133
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,130
<3-73,Wilson>是我受了限制
<3-73,Wilson>This is me being restrained.

134
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,000
<3-74,Stacy>就亲了一下
<3-74,Stacy>It was one kiss.

135
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,620
<3-75,Wilson>你是装傻呢么?
<3-75,Wilson>Are you being intentionally thick?

136
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,150
<3-75,Wilson>这可不会只是一夜情
<3-75,Wilson>This was not just a one-night stand.

137
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,370
<3-75,Wilson>- 你不能耍他 ,- 我没有
<3-75,Wilson>- You can't toy with him. ,- I'm not.

138
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,620
<3-76,Stacy >没准是他在耍我呢
<3-76,Stacy >He's probably toying with me.

139
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,960
<3-76,Stacy >我……我不知道我在干嘛
<3-76,Stacy >I do--I don't know what I'm doing.

140
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,510
<3-77,Wilson >哦，天啊
<3-77,Wilson >Oh,boy.

141
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,990
<3-78,Cam>欢迎回来，你已经逃出瘫痪了
<3-78,Cam>Welcome back to the world. You're off the vecuronium.

142
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,560
<3-79,Foreman>你能给我动下脚趾么?
<3-79,Foreman>Could you wiggle your toes for me?

143
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,630
<3-80,Cam>核磁结果没事
<3-80,Cam>The mri was clear.

144
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,340
<3-80,Cam>总之东西不在脑子里
<3-80,Cam>Whatever this is isn't in your brain.

145
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
<3-81,Margo>核磁？
<3-81,Margo>The mri.

146
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,800
<3-81,Margo>那么我没怀孕喽?
<3-81,Margo>So I'm not pregnant?

147
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,270
<3-82,Cam>我很抱歉
<3-82,Cam>I'm sorry.

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
<3-83,Margo>那么接下来我们干嘛?
<3-83,Margo>So what do we do next?

149
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,730
<3-84,Foreman>可能性众多
<3-84,Foreman>It could be a variety of things.

150
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,250
<3-84,Foreman>有些可治，有些情况就比较严重了
<3-84,Foreman>Some treatable. Others more serious.

151
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,870
<3-84,Foreman>张嘴
<3-84,Foreman>Open up.

152
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,130
<3-84,Foreman>要做遗传测试筛除亨式病
<3-84,Foreman>We're gonna run a genetic test for huntington'S.

153
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,510
<3-85,Ted>- 最严重的一种么? ,- 是
<3-85,Ted>- That one of the more serious ones? ,- Yeah.

154
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,120
<3-87,Cam>也有可能是亢奋治疗的一种症状
<3-87,Cam>it's also possible that this is just a symptom of the fertility treatments.

155
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,380
<3-87,Cam>现在我们知道你没怀孕,
<3-87,Cam>Now that we know you're not pgnant,

156
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,050
<3-87,Cam>我们会给你用三苯氧胺阻断雌激素分泌
<3-87,Cam>we're going to start you on tamoxifen to counteract the estrogen.

157
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,760
<3-88,Margo>那样是否会使所有亢奋治疗失效?
<3-88,Margo>Will that undo all the fertility treatments?

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,290
<3-89,Foreman>一时的，对
<3-89,Foreman>For the time being,yeah.

159
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,620
<3-89,Foreman>但可以治愈你
<3-89,Foreman>But it could cure you.

160
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,520
<3-90,Cam>等你健康后你可以重新开始
<3-90,Cam>you can start trying again once we get you healthy.

161
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,070
<3-91,Margo>该死
<3-91,Margo>Damn it!

162
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,000
<3-92,Cam>致瘫剂失效后抽搐会变的更厉害
<3-92,Cam>The spasms are going to get worse now that the vecuronium's wearing off.

163
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,450
<3-93,Margo >你这么害怕干嘛?
<3-93,Margo >What are you so scared of?

164
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,520
<3-93,Margo >我还是你妈妈，不过生了点小病
<3-93,Margo >I'm still your mother. I'm just a little sick.

165
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,450
<3-93,Margo >你干嘛要把她带来,我跟你说了把她留在家里
<3-93,Margo >Why did you even bring her here? I told you to leave her at home!

166
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,640
<3-94,Foreman>突发易激惹
<3-94,Foreman>hypervigilance,sudden irritability--

167
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,480
<3-95,House>是……跟卡迪共进午餐的症状?
<3-95,House>symptomatic of... lunch with cuddy?

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,310
<3-96,Foreman>病人可确诊为亨式病
<3-96,Foreman>The patient now defines huntington'S.

169
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,590
<3-97,House>那你还需要我干嘛?
<3-97,House>Then what do you need me for?

170
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,680
<3-97,House>开始用亨式病的药就是了
<3-97,House>Start her on huntington's meds.

171
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,340
<3-98,Cam>等拿到结果?
<3-98,Cam>Before we get her test results back?

172
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,730
<3-98,Cam>如果用丙戊酸，她的肝脏就完了
<3-98,Cam>If we start her on valproic acid,it could destroy her liver.

173
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,600
<3-99,Chase>会中风
<3-99,Chase>Could stroke.

174
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
<3-100,House>如果等，可能会毁坏整个神经系统
<3-100,House>If we wait,she could progress to full blown psychosis.

175
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,180
<3-100,House>那她的孩子就永远没机会说再见了
<3-100,House>Then her kid will never get the chance to say good-bye.

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,770
<3-100,House>想告诉同学那样的感觉么?
<3-100,House>Want to tell the class how that feels?

177
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,350
<3-101,Chase>亨式病不会在一天里击垮整个精神系统
<3-101,Chase>Huntington's patients don't progress to psychosis in a day.

178
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,590
<3-102,House>她可以创个记录
<3-102,House>She went from 0 to 60 in world-record time.

179
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,600
<3-103,Chase>也没准根本就不是亨式病
<3-103,Chase>Indicating it might be something other than huntington'S.

180
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,790
<3-104,Foreman>我们有麻烦了
<3-104,Foreman>We got a problem.

181
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,280
<4-1,Margo>离我远点
<4-1,Margo>Stay away from me.

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,980
<4-1,Margo>我女儿在哪？发生什么事了？
<4-1,Margo>Where's my daughter? What's happening?

183
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,180
<4-3,Foreman>她精神崩溃了
<4-3,Foreman>She's having a psychotic break.

184
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,110
<4-6,Ted>她不是你的孩子,你怎么会关心?
<4-6,Ted>She is not yours.What do you ?

185
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,210
<4-7,Chase>- 冷静 ,- 马戈，你会伤到人的
<4-7,Chase>- Calm down. ,- Margo,you're gonna hurt someone.

186
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,930
<4-9,Chase >推两毫升ativan
<4-9,Chase >Push two milligrams of ativan.

187
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,940
<4-1,Margo>我要我女儿
<4-1,Margo>I want my daughter!

188
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,230
<4-4,Margo >她不是你的，我要我女儿
<4-4,Margo >She's not yours. I want my daughter.

189
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,620
<4-6,Ted>不做试验了
<4-6,Ted>No more experiments.

190
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,920
<4-8,Margo>不
<4-8,Margo>No!

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,580
<4-9,Chase >她的亨式病测试怎么会是阴性呢?
<4-9,Chase >how can her huntington's test be negative?

192
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,920
<4-11,Foreman>症状都有啊
<4-11,Foreman>all the signs are there.

193
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,680
<4-11,Foreman>运动失调、精神系统问题
<4-11,Foreman>Movement disorder,psychosis.

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,110
<4-11,Foreman>该是亨式病
<4-11,Foreman>It should be huntington'S.

195
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,520
<4-12,House>是啊，那你的工作就容易多了
<4-12,House>Yeah. That'd certainly make your job easier.

196
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,270
<4-12,House>对马戈来说是好消息,不是亨式病
<4-12,House>Well,good news for margo,it's not huntington'S.

197
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,800
<4-12,House>对我们是坏消息
<4-12,House>Bad news for us.

198
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,120
<4-12,House>她的精神崩溃抵消了亢奋药物
<4-12,House>Her psychotic break eliminates fertility meds.

199
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,700
<4-12,House>这意思是我们根本不知道她出啥毛病了
<4-12,House>Which means we have no idea what's wrong with her.

200
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,080
<4-12,House>我们的付出那么多,你的给予那么少
<4-12,House>We give you so much. You give us so little.

201
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,610
<4-13,Foreman>你知道，病人在壮年原发精神分裂症
<4-13,Foreman>You know,patient is prime age to develop spontaneous schizophrenia.

202
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,800
<4-14,Cam>几乎是不可能的
<4-14,Cam>almost impossible.

203
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,890
<4-14,Cam>家族无精神病史
<4-14,Cam>No family history of mental illness.

204
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,770
<4-15,Chase>毒素呢?
<4-15,Chase>How about toxins?

205
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,240
<4-16,Cam>她家没有病人，她办公室没有,她的志愿者工作组没有
<4-16,Cam>None of her family members are sick. Nobody at her office, her volunteer group,

206
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,830
<4-16,Cam>孩子的班级、家长会，都没有
<4-16,Cam>kid's classes, and pta members. All fine.

207
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,780
<4-17,House>所以，她养育女儿，做生意
<4-17,House>So she raises a daughter,runs a business,

208
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,330
<4-17,House>她从事慈善事业
<4-17,House>she does charity work.

209

<4-17,House>在学校做义工，还参加家长会
<4-17,House>She volunteers at school. Attends pta.

210
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,410
<4-17,House>怎么能让妈妈运转呢?
<4-17,House>What makes mommy run?

211
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,680
<4-18,Chase>你在考虑毒品么?
<4-18,Chase>You thinking drugs?

212
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,710
<4-18,Chase>可卡因
<4-18,Chase>Cocaine.

213
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,820
<4-19,House>可以解释精神问题和舞蹈病症状
<4-19,House>Explains the psychosis and the flailing.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,390
<4-19,House>已经那么多离奇精力，买咸肉,在锅里煎
<4-19,House>And the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan,

215
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,240
<4-19,House>还要记得别忘了让特德觉得是个男人
<4-19,House>and never ever let teddy forget that he's a man.

216
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,910
<4-20,Cam>我去查查看
<4-20,Cam>I'll go look for her stash.

217
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,950
<4-21,House>带上福满
<4-21,House>Take foreman.

218
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,530
<4-21,House>陈词滥调需要理由
<4-21,House>There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.

219
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,230
<4-22,House >我知道你在那里头
<4-22,House >I know you're in there.

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,420
<4-22,House >我能听见你的关心
<4-22,House >I can hear you caring.

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
<4-23,House>门是锁着的
<4-23,House>The door was locked.

222
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,130
<4-24,Wilson>意思就是我不想见任何人
<4-24,Wilson>Means I didn't want to see anyone.

223
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,200
<4-25,House >高中同学团聚么?
<4-25,House >High school reunion?

224
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,080
<4-26,Wilson>给一个病人的，她没法卷
<4-26,Wilson>It's for a patient. She can't roll.

225
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,270
<4-26,Wilson>把那个门也锁上
<4-26,Wilson>Now lock that door too.

226

227
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,790
<4-27,House>一定是好料
<4-27,House>Must be the good stuff.

228
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,670
<4-27,House>这样的时候我老想得癌症
<4-27,House>Times like these,I wish I had cancer.

229
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,040
<4-27,House>她说什么了?
<4-27,House>So what did she say?

230
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,520
<4-28,Wilson>那要看情况,你干嘛了，我们谈的是谁？
<4-28,Wilson>That depends. What did you do,and who are we talking about?

231
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,970
<4-29,House>我们都知道我俩刚说完
<4-29,House>We both know that as soon as we talked,

232
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,440
<4-29,House>你就会跑到史黛西那传话、傻笑
<4-29,House>you ran to stacy so you could gossip and giggle.

233
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,900
<4-29,House>我需要知道她说什么了
<4-29,House>I need to know what she said.

234
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,320
<4-30,Wilson>我有个疯狂的主意,你干嘛不找她谈呢?
<4-30,Wilson>I have a crazy idea. Why don't you go talk to her?

235
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,180
<4-31,House>因为我最好的朋友告诉我,那会带来麻烦的
<4-31,House>Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.

236
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,540
<4-32,Wilson>她听上去挺困扰,可我不相信
<4-32,Wilson>She sounds confused, but I don't think she is.

237
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,450
<4-32,Wilson>我看她是要看你的行动,让她觉得你是认真的
<4-32,Wilson>I think she's waiting for you to do something. Show her you're serious.

238
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,950
<4-32,Wilson>哇
<4-32,Wilson>Wow.

239
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,910
<4-33,House >从失贞到干她可是个大飞跃
<4-33,House >It's a big jump from infidelity is morally wrong to do her.

240
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,340
<4-34,Wilson>我没说干她，我说的是行动
<4-34,Wilson>I didn't say do her. I said do something.

241
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,550
<4-35,House>她到底说了什么?
<4-35,House>What exactly did she say?

242
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,210
<4-36,Wilson>她没说是个错误
<4-36,Wilson>She didn't say it was a mistake.

243
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,130
<4-37,House>她不会在马克康复的时候就抛弃他
<4-37,House>She's not gonna leave mark in the middle of his rehab.

244
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,830
<4-37,House>太内疚了
<4-37,House>Too much guilt.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,300
<4-38,Wilson>她抛弃了你
<4-38,Wilson>She left you.

246

250
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,850
<4-42,Foreman>你今天得做了那个试验
<4-42,Foreman>You need to get that test today.

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,450
<4-43,Cam>我希望你们能记住我的生日,而不是我做艾滋病试验的日子
<4-43,Cam>I wish you guys remember my birthday instead of my hiv test.

252
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,220
<4-44,Foreman>原谅我们关心你吧
<4-44,Foreman>Forgive us for being concerned.

253
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,370
<4-44,Foreman>我跟豪斯打了赌
<4-44,Foreman>I got a bet with house.

254
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,850
<4-44,Foreman>他说你太害怕不会去拿结果
<4-44,Foreman>He says you're too scared to get it.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,880
<4-44,Foreman>我说你太拘谨了一定会拿
<4-44,Foreman>I say you're too anal not to.

256
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,480
<4-44,Foreman>我切入到主题了吧
<4-44,Foreman>I'll cut you in.

257
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,250
<4-45,Cam>真浪费
<4-45,Cam>that was a colossal waste.

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,370
<4-46,Foreman>谁知道呢？
<4-46,Foreman>who would've known?

259
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,210
<4-46,Foreman>搜查一个大家庭,以查找非法毒品简直太明显了
<4-46,Foreman>Searching a high end family home for illicit narcotics was such an obvious choice.

<4-55,House>吃足够的利他林，症状都能解释
<4-55,House>Pop enough ritalin,it can explain everything.

<4-56,Foreman>利他林没准能解释一些……
<4-56,Foreman>Well,ritalin maybe explains some tics,some involuntary--

<6-6,Cam >- 呼叫 ,- 怎么了，妈妈?
<6-6,Cam >- Call the code. - What's wrong,mommy?

350
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,070
<6-8,Ted>出什么事了?
<6-8,Ted>What's going on?

351
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,740
<7-1,House>最好是重要事
<7-1,House>This better be important.

352
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,020
<7-2,Cam>你得马上回来
<7-2,Cam>You've gotta come back in.

353
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,770
<7-4,Cam>- 不，我不 ,- 马戈本来已经稳定了，但是……
<7-4,Cam>- No,I don'T. ,- Margo's stable,but--

354
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,230
<7-5,House>哦，我的天啊，我马上就到
<7-5,House>oh,my god. Well,I'll be right there.

355
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,180
<7-6,Cam>她中风了
<7-6,Cam>She had a stroke.

356
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,210
<7-7,House >太好了
<7-7,House >Perfect.

357
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,820
<7-7,House >得回去工作
<7-7,House >Gotta go back to work.

358
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,140
<7-8,Stacy>现在?
<7-8,Stacy>Right now?

359
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,620
<7-8,Stacy>嗯
<7-8,Stacy>Well

360
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,460
<7-9,House >病人稳定
<7-9,House >patient's stable.

361
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,000
<7-9,House >等半个小时吧
<7-9,House >Could maybe wait a half hour.

362
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,250
<7-10,Cam>他该20分钟前就回来的
<7-10,Cam>He should've been here 20 minutes ago.

363
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,910
<7-11,Chase>怀疑他是否全干了
<7-11,Chase>Doubt if he makes it all.

364
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,420
<7-11,Chase>我看到他跟史黛西一起走的
<7-11,Chase>I saw him leave with stacy.

365
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,900
<7-12,Cam>他也许只是送她到车那
<7-12,Cam>He's probably just walking her to her car.

366
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,130
<7-13,Chase>哦，是啊，听起来倒象是豪斯
<7-13,Chase>Oh,yeah. That sounds like house.

367
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,790
<7-14,Cam>他不是白痴,才不会跟个已婚女人勾搭呢
<7-14,Cam>He's not an idiot. He's not going to hook up with a married woman.

368
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,090
<7-15,Foreman>我倒希望他能，也许能变得温和一点
<7-15,Foreman>I hope he is getting some. Maybe he'll mellow out.

369
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,280
<7-16,Cam>怎么耽搁这个久啊？现在是半夜
<7-16,Cam>what took you so long? It's midnight.

370
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,670
<7-17,House>路上不好走
<7-17,House>Traffic. Cinco de mayo.

371
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,210
<7-17,House>你欠我100块
<7-17,House>You owe me 100 bucks.

372
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,360
<7-18,Foreman >你没做试验?
<7-18,Foreman >You didn't take the test?

373
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,130
<7-19,House>拘谨无法战胜恐惧
<7-19,House>Fear trumps anal every time.

374
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,460
<7-20,Cam>没什么了不起
<7-20,Cam>It's not a big deal.

375
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,380
<7-20,Cam>我做了滤过性病毒填充和抗体测试
<7-20,Cam>I had the viral load and antibody tests.

376
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,710
<7-20,Cam>99.9% 我没有艾滋病毒
<7-20,Cam>99.9% that I don't have hiv.

377
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,250
<7-21,House>如果你做了试验又是阴性的,你就赢了1赔10的赔率
<7-21,House>and if you had the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point.

378
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,380
<7-21,House>如果是阳性的，你就输了...
<7-21,House>But if it's positive, you lose...

379
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,330
<7-21,House>近100，对吧?
<7-21,House>nearly 100,right?

380
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,850
<7-22,Cam>无心率失常
<7-22,Cam>No arrhythmia.

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,260
<7-22,Cam>所以利他林不是关键问题
<7-22,Cam>So ritalin isn't the big problem.

382
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,780
<7-22,Cam>有其他事
<7-22,Cam>Something else is going on.

383
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,070
<7-22,Cam>好吧
<7-22,Cam>Fine.

384
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,670
<7-23,House>我们玩医生的游戏吧
<7-23,House>Let's play doctors.

385
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,380
<7-24,Chase>我移除了导致中风的凝块
<7-24,Chase>I removed the clot which caused the stroke.

386
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,950
<7-24,Chase>问题是我们不知道它打哪来的
<7-24,Chase>Problem is,we don't know where it came from.

387
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,590
<7-25,Cam>给她心脏、手臂和腿都做了超声波检查,没有问题
<7-25,Cam>Did ultrasounds of her heart,arms,and legs. All clear.

388
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,240
<7-26,Foreman>可能是c蛋白不足
<7-26,Foreman>Could be a protein c deficiency.

389
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,130
<7-27,Cam>解释不了运动失调
<7-27,Cam>Wouldn't explain the movement disorder.

390
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,030
<7-28,House>没什么东西能解释一切
<7-28,House>Nothing explains everything.

391
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,700
<7-28,House>如果是团伙犯罪呢?
<7-28,House>What if it's a crime syndicate?

392
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,040
<7-28,House>我们假设：利他林和亢进药物结合出击
<7-28,House>Let's say ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper.

393
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,520
<7-28,House>利他林形成精神症状和舞蹈病
<7-28,House>Ritalin takes care of the psychosis,the flailing.

394
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,560
<7-29,Foreman>- 我还是觉得利他林…… ,- 亢进药物被自然竞争
<7-29,Foreman>- I still don't think ritalin--  ,- fertility meds are competitive by nature.

395
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,470
<7-30,House>他们会造就大事件,超乎想像的大事件
<7-30,House>They gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.

396
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,460
<7-31,Cam>亢进治疗已知可导致子宫内膜癌
<7-31,Cam>fertility treatments have been known to cause endometrial cancer.

397
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,820
<7-32,Chase>也能导致凝块
<7-32,Chase>Which could cause clots.

398
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,770
<7-32,Chase>也可能导致她中风
<7-32,Chase>Which could've caused her to stroke.

399
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,930
<7-33,House>所以这次给她的子宫做超声波吧
<7-33,House>So ultrasound her uterus this time.

400
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,730
<7-33,House>看是不是里面,长了什么不受欢迎的东西
<7-33,House>See if there's something growing in there at doesn't look adorable a ones.

401
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,190
<7-33,House>卡麦伦
<7-33,House>Cameron.

402
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,000
<7-34,House>我爱你
<7-34,House>I love you.

403
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,340
<7-34,House>明天去取试验结果吧
<7-34,House>Get your test results tomorrow.

404
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,080
<8-1,Stacy >给我心脏下的处方
<8-1,Stacy >The prescription for my heart condition.

405
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,690
<8-1,Stacy >便宜了点
<8-1,Stacy >A bit on the cheesy side.

406
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,040
<8-2,House>我在尝试浪漫手段
<8-2,House>I was trying for romantic.

407
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,200
<8-2,House>还是很合适
<8-2,House>Still fits.

408
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,800
<8-4,House>告诉马克了么?
<8-4,House>Did you tell mark?

409
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,010
<8-5,Stacy >我跟他说会工作很晚
<8-5,Stacy >I told him I had to work late.

410
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,730
<8-6,House >你打算告诉他吗?
<8-6,House >You going to tell him?

411
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,370
<8-6,House >我怎么告诉他啊?
<8-6,House >How am I going to tell him?

412
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,690
<8-7,Stacy>还在考虑措词
<8-7,Stacy>Still working on that phrasing.

413
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,570
<8-7,Stacy>我们最初到这你说“什么都知道”,那样的话怎么了？
<8-7,Stacy>How about,"know all the stuff"you worried about when we first came here,honey,

414
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,940
<8-7,Stacy>你是对的
<8-7,Stacy>you were right."

415
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,850
<8-8,House>精练
<8-8,House>Pithy.

416
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,220
<8-9,Stacy>如果你不在意会伤到什么人的时候,一切都简单化了
<8-9,Stacy>Everything's easy when you don't care if you hurt anyone.

417
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,900
<8-10,House>你已经把伤害那部分做完了
<8-10,House>You already did the hurting part.

418
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,840
<8-10,House>- 他只是不知道罢了 ,- 如果我永远不告诉他，他不会受伤
<8-10,House>- He just doesn't know yet. - If I never tell hi it'll never hurt.

419
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,940
<8-11,Stacy>我不想爱马克
<8-11,Stacy>I want not to love mark.

420
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,230
<8-11,Stacy>我想恨你，我想一切都简单化
<8-11,Stacy>I want to hate you. I want allf this to be simple,

421
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,510
<8-11,Stacy>可就不是
<8-11,Stacy>but it's not.

422
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,660
<8-12,House >你可以要么跟我过,
<8-12,House >You can either have a life with me,

423
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,640
<8-12,House >要么跟他过
<8-12,House >or you can have a life with him.

424
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,340
<8-12,House >不是兼顾
<8-12,House >It can't be both.

425
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,220
<8-12,House >很容易，确实简单
<8-12,House >It's that easy. But it is simple.

426
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,930
<9-1,Cam>子宫内膜未见增厚
<9-1,Cam>No endometrial thickening.

427
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,650
<9-1,Cam>- 无杂物,- 无癌症
<9-1,Cam>- No masses. ,- No cancer.

428
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,110
<9-3,House>她正接手亢进治疗，产生了血液凝块,就在那
<9-3,House>She's on fertility treatments. She had a blood clot. It's there.

429
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,270
<9-4,Chase>上百万的女人接手亢进治疗,并不得癌症
<9-4,Chase>Millions of women are on fertility treatments, and they don't get cancer.

430
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,210
<9-5,House>对，他们生孩子
<9-5,House>Right. They get babies.

431
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,260
<9-5,House>她却是血液凝块和中风
<9-5,House>She had a blood clot and a stroke.

432
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,880
<9-5,House>她会再来一次，如果我们不快点,找到肿瘤，她会死
<9-5,House>She'll get another one and probably die if we don't find that tumor.

433
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,280
<9-5,House>做子宫内膜活检
<9-5,House>Do an endometrial biopsy.

434
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,770
<9-6,Foreman>活检很痛苦也没必要
<9-6,Foreman>Biopsy's painful and unnecessary.

435
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,450
<9-6,Foreman>我们刚做过超声波
<9-6,Foreman>We just did an ultrasound.

436
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,740
<9-7,Foreman>- 什么? ,- 嘘
<9-7,Foreman>- What? ,- Ssh.

437
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,550
<9-8,House>如果你的私人问题干扰了……
<9-8,House>If you have a person issue that's interfering with--

438
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,200
<9-9,Cam>嘘
<9-9,Cam>ssh,ssh,ssh.

439
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,020
<9-11,Foreman>我们等什么?
<9-11,Foreman>What are we waiting for?

440
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,940
<9-12,House>你的四周任期刚到期了
<9-12,House>Your four weeksjust expired.

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,800
<9-12,House>你的恐怖通知结束了

442
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,600
<9-12,House>我的刚开始
<9-12,House>Mine is just begun.

443

<9-12,House>No go stick a needle up her hoo-hoo and find that cancer.

<9-15,Commentator 1>...has got 1,500 horsepower blown and injected with alcohol.

<9-16,Commentator 2>是啊，那个宝贝真的动起来了
<9-16,Commentator 2>yeah,that baby really moves.

451
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,340
<9-19,House>你在这干嘛?

<9-20,Stella>He asked the nurse to watch me.

454
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,820
<9-21,House>什么护士?
<9-21,House>What nurse?

455
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,530
<9-22,Stella>她没看好我
<9-22,Stella>She's not really watching me.

456
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,640
<9-23,House >明白了
<9-23,House >I got that.

457
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,570
<9-24,Stella>你还有气球么?
<9-24,Stella>Do you still have the balloons?

<9-28,Stella>When can mommy come home?

461
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,480
<9-29,House>不知道
<9-29,House>Don't know.

462
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,830
<9-30,Stella>你脚怎么了?

465
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,210
<9-34,Stella>那就是你难过的原因么?
<9-34,Stella>Is that why you're so sad?

<10-17,Stacy>跟格里在一起不都是坏事,我有理由跟他在一起
<10-17,Stacy>It wasn't all bad with greg. I was with him for a reason.

513
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,410
<10-18,Cuddy>你离开他也有理由
<10-18,Cuddy>You left him for a reason.

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,390
<13-1,Foreman>她至少让一个孩子变成了没妈的孩子
<13-1,Foreman>at least she's only gonna leave one child without a mother.

527
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
<13-2,House >做活检吧
<13-2,House >Do a biopsy.

528

<13-9,House>你妻子，是你的事
<13-9,House>Your wife,your problem.

536
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,430
<13-10,Mark>她不跟我说
<13-10,Mark>She won't talk to me.

537
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,190
<13-11,House>那你就跟我说么？,跟你的心理医生说去
<13-11,House>So what,you're gonna talk to me instead? Talk to your shrink.

538
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,510
<13-12,Mark>她老说什么都没事
<13-12,Mark>She keeps saying everything's fine.

<13-13,House>找个酒吧跟陌生人说去吧
<13-13,House>Find a bar and talk to a stranger.

<13-14,Mark>你是唯一一个经历过此事的人
<13-14,Mark>You're the only one who's been through this.

541
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,970
<13-14,Mark>我不对她负责
<13-14,Mark>I'm shutting her out.

542
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,230
<13-14,Mark>我老是说那种让我自己生气的话
<13-14,Mark>I'm saying things and then hating myself for saying them.

543
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,540
<13-14,Mark>你是怎么熬过去的?
<13-14,Mark>How did you get past that?

544
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,750
<13-15,House>还没
<13-15,House>Didn'T.

<13-16,Mark>你就不能当一分钟的人跟我谈谈吗?
<13-16,Mark>Can you please be a human being for one minute and talk to me?

<13-18,Mark>你躲不了我
<13-18,Mark>You're not gonna outrun me.

548
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,510
<13-19,Mark>豪斯
<13-19,Mark>House.

549
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,780
<13-20,House>你还不能这样
<13-20,House>You're not ready for this.

550
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,030
<13-21,Mark>我看到你跟史黛西说话的方式
<13-21,Mark>I've seen the way you and stacy talk to each other.

551
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,150
<13-22,House>你是白痴
<13-22,House>You're an idiot.

552
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,670
<13-22,House>你没准把你的康复又拖后了三个月
<13-22,House>You probably just set your rehab back three months.

553
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,930
<13-23,Mark >放开我，放开我
<13-23,Mark >Let go of me! Get off of me!

554
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,540
<13-24,House>肝脏肿瘤不合理
<13-24,House>Liver tumor doesn't make sense.

555
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,070
<13-25,Foreman>你是说ct错了么?
<13-25,Foreman>are you saying the ct was wrong?

556
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,570
<13-26,House>我是说症状不合理
<13-26,House>I'm saying the symptoms don't add up.

557
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,400
<13-26,House>a＋b不等于肝脏肿瘤
<13-26,House>"A" plus "b" does not equal liver tumor.

558
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,630
<13-26,House>我们得把x解了
<13-26,House>We gotta solve for X.

559
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,540
<13-26,House>我们得不同看待
<13-26,House>We gotta look at this differently.

560
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,230
<13-26,House>我们对她知道多少?
<13-26,House>What do we know about her?

561
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,030
<13-27,Foreman>利他林的副作用是……
<13-27,Foreman>Side effects of ritalin caused the--

562
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,390
<13-28,House>不，我们把病例已经研究个底朝上了
<13-28,House>no. We've examined the file up and down.

563
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,210
<13-28,House>过来，给我
<13-28,House>Come here. Give me that.

564
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,420
<13-28,House>为什么你们总不重视人类的要件呢?
<13-28,House>Why do you people always overlook the human element?

565
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,390
<13-26,House>我们对她了解什么?
<13-26,House>What do we know about her?

566
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,570
<13-27,Foreman>马戈...
<13-27,Foreman>Margo...

567
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,680
<13-28,House>道顿，女人
<13-28,House>dalton. The woman.

568
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,160
<13-29,Cameron>她很讨人喜欢
<13-29,Cameron>She's a people pleaser.

569
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,610
<13-29,Cameron>她不想让人失望
<13-29,Cameron>She doesn't like to let people down.

570
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,200
<13-30,House>从不与丈夫争吵
<13-30,House>Who never fights with her husband.

571
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,660
<13-31,Chase>她不求助所以依赖毒品
<13-31,Chase>She went to drugs instead of asking for help to manage her life.

572
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,600
<13-32,House>所以，如果她现在不能安排了
<13-32,House>So if she can't manage now,

573
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,900
<13-32,House>她干嘛再想要个孩子呢?
<13-32,House>why does she want another kid?

574
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,100
<13-32,House>福满
<13-32,House>Foreman.

575
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,810
<13-33,House>需要你的帮助
<13-33,House>Need your help here.

576
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,290
<13-33,House>如果要干个银行的活
<13-33,House>You want to pull a bank job.

577
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,910
<13-33,House>你会独个去么?
<13-33,House>Would you go it alone?

578
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,550
<13-33,House>如果只是抢劫一个家，没问题,一、两个同伴就行了
<13-33,House>If you're gonna rob a home,sure. It's a one or two man crew.

579
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,190
<13-33,House>但是，银行...
<13-33,House>But a bank...

580
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
<13-33,House>望风的，开车的
<13-33,House>lookout,getaway driver.

581
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,230
<13-34,Foreman>在比喻的结果出来之前,我是不会说话的
<13-34,Foreman>I'm not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out.

582

<14-5,House>避孕药导致肝腺体瘤
<14-5,House>Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma.

<14-5,House>解释了所有无法解释的症状
<14-5,House>Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained

615
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,740
<14-9,House >肿瘤是良性的
<14-9,House >Tumor is benign.

<14-9,House >停药后会自然消除，我把手术取消
<14-9,House >Stop taking the pill,and it'll go away on its own. I'm canceling the surgery.

617
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,370
<14-10,Margo>你要怎么告诉我丈夫?
<14-10,Margo>What are you going to tell my husband?

618
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,540
<14-11,House>我取消手术
<14-11,House>That I'm canceling the surgery.

619
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,360
<14-11,House>你解释吧
<14-11,House>You can do the explaining.

620
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,760
<14-11,House>很狡猾吧?
<14-11,House>It's tricky,huh?

621
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,100
<14-11,House>说不能生孩子
<14-11,House>It's one thing to say you can't have a baby.

622
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,150
<14-11,House>跟说不想要孩子是两回事
<14-11,House>It's another to say you don't want one.

623
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,770
<14-11,House>要是我，我会编其他借口
<14-11,House>Personally,I'd make up some other lie.

624
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,090
<14-12,Margo>我会……
<14-12,Margo>Could--

625
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,740
<14-12,Margo>我会死在手术台上吗？
<14-12,Margo>could I die on the table?

626
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,080
<14-13,House>你告诉他真相会死么?
<14-13,House>Could you die if you tell him the truth?

627
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,160
<14-14,Margo>我需要那手术
<14-14,Margo>I need the surgery.

628
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,380
<14-14,Margo>我没吃药
<14-14,Margo>I'm not on the pill.

629
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,130
<14-15,Cuddy>你不能取消手术
<14-15,Cuddy>You can't cancel the surgery.

630
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,810
<14-16,House>如果她不吃药了，肿瘤会自动消失
<14-16,House>If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own.

631
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,030
<14-17,Cuddy>你无法证明避孕药导致这些
<14-17,Cuddy>You have no proof the birth control pills caused this.

632
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,620
<14-17,Cuddy>你都无法证明她在用
<14-17,Cuddy>You have no proof she's even taking them.

633
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,160
<14-18,House>如果我们手术，她会死在台上
<14-18,House>Well,if we do the survey,maybe we'll kill her on the table.

634
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,960
<14-18,House>尸检时我就可以证明我对
<14-18,House>Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy.

635
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,580
<14-19,Cuddy>或者我们可以不做手术,让瘤子长大后杀死她
<14-19,Cuddy>Or we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow,and kill her.

636
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,330
<14-20,House>你跟史黛西商量一下吧?
<14-20,House>Why don't you take iup with stacy?

637
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,770
<14-20,House>看哪个风险更小
<14-20,House>See which option minimizes your risk.

638
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,750
<14-20,House>我想她会说
<14-20,House>Here's what I think she's going to say.

639
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,990
<14-21,Cuddy>“哦，我爱格里”
<14-21,Cuddy>Oh,I love greg.

640
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,680
<14-21,Cuddy>但如果你违背病人的愿望,那就是管她叫骗子
<14-21,Cuddy>But if you go against a patient's wishes, you're calling her a liar.

641
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,500
<14-21,Cuddy>而如果出问题
<14-21,Cuddy>And if something goes wrong,

642
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,810
<14-21,Cuddy>结果我就得上庭对抗大、刻薄大夫
<14-21,Cuddy>I end up in court having to defend the big,mean doctor albeit with dreamy eyes

643
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,860
<14-21,Cuddy>尽管我有梦一样的大眼睛,却不相信乡村妈妈
<14-21,Cuddy>who wouldn't believe the nice suburban mom.

644
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,820
<14-21,Cuddy>尽管他的拐杖让我融化,还是做那该死的手术吧
<14-21,Cuddy>And even though his cane makes me melt, do the damn surgery.

645
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,470
<15-1,House>耸人听闻
<15-1,House>Shocking.

646
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,340
<15-1,House>是良性的
<15-1,House>It's benign.

647
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,980
<15-2,Wilson>人们为了爱做疯狂的事
<15-2,Wilson>People do crazy things for love.

648
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:27,110
<15-3,House>不，疯狂是整天在公园闲逛,跟鸽子说话
<15-3,House>No. Crazy is hanging out at the park all day talking to pigeons.

649
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,350
<15-3,House>她知道自己在干嘛
<15-3,House>Rgo knowswhat she's doing.

650
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,390
<15-3,House>她放弃半个肝挽救婚姻
<15-3,House>She gave up half her liver to save her marriage.

651
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,640
<15-4,Wilson>不，她魔术般转移了指纹挽救了谎言
<15-4,Wilson>No. She surgically removed her fingerprints to cover her pathetic lie.

652
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,960
<15-5,House>扭曲而富于操纵，明白了
<15-5,House>It's twisted and manipulative,I get that.

653
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,480
<15-5,House>但同时...
<15-5,House>But it's also...

654
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,050
<15-5,House>很浪漫
<15-5,House>romantic.

655
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,430
<15-5,House>我连撒尿都懒得放下厕板
<15-5,House>I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee.

656
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,110
<15-6,Wilson>- 我们非说话么? ,- 不，我没事
<15-6,Wilson>- Do we need to talk? - Nope. I'm fine.

657
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,130
<16-1,Foreman>手术拿出了整个肿瘤
<16-1,Foreman>so the surgeon got the whole tumor.

658
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,400
<16-2,Ted>- 是良性的 ,- 不错，是吧?
<16-2,Ted>- And it was benign. ,- That's good,right?

659
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,710
<16-3,Foreman>对，良性不错
<16-3,Foreman>Yeah. Benign is good.

660
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,380
<16-4,Ted>良性肿瘤怎么会有那么多症状呢?
<16-4,Ted>How could a benign tumor have caused all the symptoms?

661
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,240
<16-5,Foreman >我们相信你太太,所有的症状都会消失了
<16-5,Foreman >We believe all your wife's symptoms will go away now.

662
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,920
<16-6,Ted>哦，感谢主
<16-6,Ted>Oh. Thank god.

663
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,140
<16-6,Ted>你看，我会去接斯黛
<16-6,Ted>Look. I'm gonna pick up stella.

664
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,590
<16-6,Ted>我找到保姆后给你电话
<16-6,Ted>I'll call you after I get the baby-sitter.

665
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,700
<16-7,Margo>福满医生
<16-7,Margo>Dr. Foreman,

667
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,320
<16-7,Margo>你可以告诉我丈夫...
<16-7,Margo>You could tell my husband that...

668
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,340
<16-7,Margo>因为这些...
<16-7,Margo>because of all this...

669
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,570
<16-7,Margo>我不能再接受亢进治疗了
<16-7,Margo>I can't take any more fertility treatments.

670
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,360
<16-8,Foreman>保密原则让我不能告诉你丈夫实情
<16-8,Foreman>Confidentiality rules stop me from telling your husband the truth.

671
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,020
<16-8,Foreman>但我照义务撒谎到此结束
<16-8,Foreman>But my obligation to lie ends there.

672
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,150
<16-9,Margo>有没有……
<16-9,Margo>Are--are there--

673
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,950
<16-9,Margo>有没有一种控制生育的,方法不让我难受的?
<16-9,Margo>is there a birth control method, something that won't make me sick?

674
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,270
<16-10,Foreman>马戈，你将需要面对一切冒险了
<16-10,Foreman>Margo,you're gonna have risks with everything.

675
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,960
<16-10,Foreman>尤其是如果你不打算,告诉你的亢进治疗医生
<16-10,Foreman>Especially if you're not telling your fertility doctor.

676
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,170
<16-10,Foreman>如果你继续这样做,会毁了你的婚姻和你自己
<16-10,Foreman>If you keep doing this,it's gonna kill your marriage and kill you.

677
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,150
<16-10,Foreman>你不知道
<16-10,Foreman>You don't know.

678
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,930
<16-11,Margo>几年内
<16-11,Margo>In a few years,

679
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,960
<16-11,Margo>我们会放弃
<16-11,Margo>we'll give up,

680
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,760
<16-11,Margo>不再尝试怀孕
<16-11,Margo>stoprying to get pregnant.

681
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,400
<16-11,Margo>我们会拥抱、哭泣
<16-11,Margo>We'll hug,cry.

682
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,360
<16-11,Margo>最终，特德会忘记这回事
<16-11,Margo>Eventually,ted will stop thinking about it.

683
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,280
<16-11,Margo>他会更喜欢斯黛
<16-11,Margo>And he'll appreciate stella even more.

684
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,580
<16-11,Margo>我们就可以幸福生活余下的50年
<16-11,Margo>And we'll live happily together for the next 50 years.

685
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,530
<17-1,House>有些事你得知道
<17-1,House>Something you need to see.

686
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,270
<17-1,House>知道永远都比不知道好
<17-1,House>Knowing is always better than not knowing.

687
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,480
<17-2,Cam>这是推荐建议
<17-2,Cam>It's a referral request.

688
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,160
<17-2,Cam>是啊
<17-2,Cam>Right.

689
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,230
<17-3,House>艾滋病检查结果早来了
<17-3,House>Hiv thing came in earlier.

690
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,390
<17-3,House>你没事
<17-3,House>You're fine.

691
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,570
<17-4,Cam>你连自己的信都不看却看我的?
<17-4,Cam>You won't read your mail, but you'll open mine?

692
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,350
<17-5,House>它说是机密
<17-5,House>It said confidential.

<17-5,House>我想知道

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,930
<17-6,Cam>我一生中最重要的信
<17-6,Cam>The most important letter of my life.

695
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,140
<17-6,Cam>你还是个讨厌鬼
<17-6,Cam>And you're still an ass.

696
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,510
<17-7,House>令人感到安慰，是吧?
<17-7,House>Comforting,isn't it?

<18-4,House>别
<18-4,House>Don't do it.

<18-7,Stacy >什么变了?
<18-7,Stacy >What the hell changed?

707
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,710
<18-7,Stacy >没有
<18-7,Stacy >Nothing.

708
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,370
<18-8,House>什么都没变
<18-8,House>Nothing changes.

709
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,700
<18-8,House>我不会变
<18-8,House>I'm not going to change.

710
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,070
<18-9,Stacy>谁让你变了?
<18-9,Stacy>Who asked you to?

711
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,910
<18-10,House>马克愿意做任何事
<18-10,House>Mark is willing to do whatever it takes.

712
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
<18-10,House>我不会
<18-10,House>I'm not.

<18-10,House>永远都不会
<18-10,House>Never was.

714
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,540
<18-11,Stacy>现在你要反省了？,那天晚上我们谈了那么多
<18-11,Stacy>Now you're introspective? Weren't so analytical the other night.

715
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,020
<18-12,House>你跟马克在一起很快乐,你还会快乐的
<18-12,House>You were happy with mark. You'll be happy again.

716
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,230
<18-13,Stacy>别说马克了,你怎么了?
<18-13,Stacy>Shut up about mark. What the hell's wrong with you?

717
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,120
<18-14,House >我没法让你快乐
<18-14,House >I can't make you happy.

718
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,900
<18-15,Stacy>什么?
<18-15,Stacy>What?

719
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,370
<18-16,House>你觉得这会怎么结束?
<18-16,House>How do you think this is gonna end?

<18-15,Stacy>A few weeks,few months.

722
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,120
<18-16,House>然后我会无心地说些什么,或者忽视你
<18-16,House>And then I'll say something insensitive,or I'll start ignoring you.

723
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,800
<18-16,House>开始的时候没事
<18-16,House>And at first it'll be okay.

724
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,250
<18-16,House>豪斯还是豪斯.
<18-16,House>It's just house being house.

725
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,690
<18-16,House>然后
<18-16,House>And then

726
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,110
<18-16,House>在某些地方，你会需要更多
<18-16,House>at some point, you will need something more.

727
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,750
<18-16,House>你会需要有人给你我不能给你的
<18-16,House>You'll need someone who can give you something I can'T.

728
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,200
<18-16,House>你知道我是对的，我们经历过
<18-16,House>You know I'm right.  I've been there before.

729
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,470
<18-17,Stacy>哦
<18-17,Stacy>Oh.

730
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,080
<18-17,Stacy>不必如此
<18-17,Stacy>It doesn't have to be.

731
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,610
<18-18,House>有必要
<18-18,House>It does.

732
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,130
<18-18,House>有必要
<18-18,House>It does.

733
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,780
<18-18,House>我不想再经历一次
<18-18,House>I don't want to go there again.

734
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,100
<18-18,House>对不起，史黛西
<18-18,House>I'm sorry,stacy.

735
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,500
<18-19,Chase>50块，打赌他们一年内会离婚
<18-19,Chase>50 bucks says they're divorced in a year.

736
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,020
<18-20,Cam>顶多6个月
<18-20,Cam>Six months tops.

737
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,950
<18-21,Foreman>我赌
<18-21,Foreman>I'll take that bet.

738
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,510
<18-21,Foreman>那是个完美的婚姻
<18-21,Foreman>It's the perfect marriage.

739

<18-21,Foreman>如果你不说，就没什么好吵的
<18-21,Foreman>There nothing to fight over if you never talk about anything.

740
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,720
<19-1,Wilson>你怎么跟她说的?
<19-1,Wilson>What did you tell her?

741
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,780
<19-2,House>我跟她说别指望我
<19-2,House>I told her she's better off without me.

742
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,860
<19-3,Wilson>哈
<19-3,Wilson>Huh.

743
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,370
<19-3,Wilson>没准是对的
<19-3,Wilson>That's probably true.

744
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,910
<19-3,Wilson>你是白痴
<19-3,Wilson>You're an idiot.

745
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,550
<19-4,Wilson>你不觉得她该不要指望你么？
<19-4,Wilson>You don't think she'd be better off without you.

746
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,860
<19-5,House>对，我是一时兴起
<19-5,House>Right. I set her off on a whim.

747
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,590
<19-6,Wilson>你不明白为什么你让她走
<19-6,Wilson>You have no idea why you sent her off.

748
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,500
<19-8,Wilson>-别这样 ,-这不是伟大的牺牲
<19-8,Wilson>- Don't do this. - This was no great sacrifice.

749
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,120
<19-8,Wilson>你让她走因为你必须得很悲惨
<19-8,Wilson>You sent her away because you've got to be miserable.

750
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,730
<19-9,House >那种破精神分析理论帮你的病人,渡过长夜吧?
<19-9,House >That kind of psycho-crap help get your paents through the long nights?

751
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,220
<19-9,House >还是专为你造的?
<19-9,House >Or is it just for you?

752
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,540
<19-9,House >坚韧的爱让你感觉良好? 帮助人感受痛苦
<19-9,House >Tough love make you feel good? Helping people feel their pain.

753
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,150
<19-10,Wilson>你不喜欢自己
<19-10,Wilson>You don't like yourself.

754
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,200
<19-10,Wilson>可你钦佩自己
<19-10,Wilson>But you do admire yourself.

755
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,320
<19-10,Wilson>你就剩下这些了，所以你抓住不放
<19-10,Wilson>It's all you've got,so you cling to it.

756
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,260
<19-10,Wilson>你深恐如果你改了
<19-10,Wilson>You're so afraid if you change,

757
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,700
<19-10,Wilson>你会失去使你独特的东西
<19-10,Wilson>you'll lose what makes you special.

758
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,740
<19-10,Wilson>悲惨没让你比任何人强，豪斯
<19-10,Wilson>Being miserable doesn't make you better than everybody else,house.

759
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,470
<19-10,Wilson>只是让你悲惨而已
<19-10,Wilson>It just makes you miserable.
