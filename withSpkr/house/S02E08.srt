46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,490
<2-8,Stacy>House已将律师开除

<2-9,Cuddy>不管你期望什么,,别指望了
<2-9,Cuddy>Stop looking for ,whatever you're looking for.

48
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,400
<2-9,Cuddy>整个月
<2-9,Cuddy>For the last month,

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,640
<2-9,Cuddy>House都在吹嘘,你不能继续与他工作
<2-9,Cuddy>house has been crowing,that you can't work with him

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,260
<2-9,Cuddy>因为你已浑然爱上他
<2-9,Cuddy>because you're just swooning in love.

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,550
<2-10,Stacy>我此刻无法感到
<2-10,Stacy>There is nothing

52
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,480
<2-10,Stacy>对他的一丝爱意
<2-10,Stacy>approaching love in,what I feel about him right now.

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,720
<2-11,Cuddy>结论依然

<2-12,Stacy>我们吵过一架

56
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,420
<2-12,Stacy>很尴尬
<2-12,Stacy>It's awkward.

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,920
<2-12,Stacy>为何不找其他律师?
<2-12,Stacy>Why not use another lawyer?

58
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,820
<2-13,Cuddy>因为去年40%的投诉案,都关于House
<2-13,Cuddy>Because 40% of our lawsuits,last year were about house.

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,790
<2-13,Cuddy>不能与他工作
<2-13,Cuddy>If you can't work with him,

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,110
<2-13,Cuddy>不能在这里工作

61
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,600
<3-1,House>她表现过激
<3-1,House>She's overreacting.

<3-2,Wilson>你溜进她办公室

63
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,740
<3-2,Wilson>偷览她的私密文件
<3-2,Wilson>and read her private file.

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,190
<3-2,Wilson>尼克松那样做时
<3-2,Wilson>When nixon did that,

65
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,370
<3-2,Wilson>被当场抓获

<3-5,House>with her pouring out her soul.

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,770
<3-5,House>唯一我做错的是：被逮到
<3-5,House>The only thing I did,wrong was get caught.

72
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,870
<3-6,Stacy>Chase在哪儿?
<3-6,Stacy>Where's chase?

73
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,080
<3-7,House>下班前他都没空招待你
<3-7,House>He's too busy to service you,until after work.

74
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,420
<3-7,House>我倒是有些时间

<3-7,House>"what'll we do with the time leftover?"

77
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,560
<3-7,House>你可以先酝酿
<3-7,House>Or you could just stew.

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,580
<3-7,House>同样奏效
<3-7,House>That works as well.

79
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,550
<3-7,House>她发怒前会先酝酿
<3-7,House>She stews before she gets violent.

80
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,510
<3-8,Stacy>这份是你,明天会出席听证会

275
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,750
<7-4,Chase>此时他却说

<13-1,Stacy>andaverted this whole thing.

485
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,200
<13-1,Stacy>你一个都没问,为什么?
<13-1,Stacy>You didn't ask either.Why?

486
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,360
<13-2,Chase>由你的问题和态度判断
<13-2,Chase>Judging from your question,and your demeanor,

<13-4,Chase>-好医生从不犯错?,-好医生从不会忘记
<13-4,Chase>- Good doctors don'tmake mistakes--,- good doctors never forget

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,090
<13-4,Chase>我显然不是个好医生
<13-4,Chase>ApparentlyI'm not a good doctor.

<13-5,Stacy>[自哀]不是辩论之策略
<13-5,Stacy>Fyi. Self-pity generallyis not ,a good strategy in these hearings.

<13-5,Stacy>What happenedafter the operation?

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,780
<13-6,Cameron>肝脏损伤令人忧虑
<13-6,Cameron>The liver damage ismore worrisome.

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,790
<13-6,Cameron>肝脏不可被透析
<13-6,Cameron>There's no dialysisfor livers.

498
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,310
<13-7,Sam>我知道,但如果切除一片肝
<13-7,Sam>I know, but if sheloses a liver,

499
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,960
<13-7,Sam>可以移植一片, 对吧?

504
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,310
<13-10,Cameron>除非捐献者深思熟虑
<13-10,Cameron>had a long timeto weigh the decision.

505
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,760

<13-22,Chase>And a cbc, pt,and a liver panel.

515
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,030
<13-23,Chase>败血症使血压持续下降
<13-23,Chase>The sepsis had loweredher bp so much

516
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,290
<13-23,Chase>肝内有血块
<13-23,Chase>she got clotsin her liver.

517
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,970
<13-23,Chase>挡住肝脏动脉,切掉输血管
<13-23,Chase>They blockedthe hepatic artery,,cut off the blood flow.

518
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,160
<13-23,Chase>肝脏压力过大
<13-23,Chase>Her liver was shocked.

519
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,290
<13-24,Stacy>Cubby依然将她列入名单?
<13-24,Stacy>And cuddy listed her?

520
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,950
<13-24,Stacy>在如此多发症状下?
<13-24,Stacy>With all the other problems?

521
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,280
<13-25,Cuddy>不行
<13-25,Cuddy>Forget it.

522
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,290
<13-25,Cuddy>不能把肝脏给,这样的晚期病人
<13-25,Cuddy>We can't give a liver,to a woman this sick.

523
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,610
<13-26,House>你知道你在说什么吗?
<13-26,House>Do you listen to whatyou're saying?

524
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,720
<13-27,Cuddy>没理由为血管炎病人,装个新肝
<13-27,Cuddy>There is no pointin giving a new liver,to somebody who also has vasculitis.

525
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,600
<13-28,Chase>可医治
<13-28,Chase>Treatable.

526
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,900
<13-29,Cuddy>加上肾脏败坏
<13-29,Cuddy>And kidney damage.

527
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,680
<13-30,Chase>改善中
<13-30,Chase>It's healing.

528
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,350
<13-30,Chase>你知道她致死的真正原因?
<13-30,Chase>You know what'sreally killing her?

529
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,780
<13-31,House>Chase忘问一个,胃痛的基本问题
<13-31,House>Chase forgot to ask a standardquestion ,about stomach pains,

530
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,360
<13-31,House>所以他误诊
<13-31,House>so he missed the diagnosis,

531
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,470
<13-31,House>所以她穿孔,所以她有败血症
<13-31,House>so she perforated,so she got sepsis,

532
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,500
<13-23,Chase>所以她血压爆升
<13-23,Chase>so her bp tanked,

533
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,920
<13-31,House>所以她有血凝块
<13-31,House>so she got blood clots,

534
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,970
<13-31,House>所以她肝脏被割
<13-31,House>so she lost her liver.

535
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,510
<13-31,House>肝脏之重要
<13-31,House>Livers are important, cuddy.

536
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,500
<13-31,House>无之丧命
<13-31,House>Can't live without 'em.

537
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,720
<13-31,House>所以才叫肝脏
<13-31,House>Hence the name.

538
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,970
<13-31,House>这才是问题关键
<13-31,House>And here's the big issue.

539
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,960
<13-31,House>Chase是医院的职员
<13-31,House>Chase isa hospital employee.

540
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,780
<13-31,House>而kayla
<13-31,House>And kayla

541

<13-31,House>is a sympathetic motherof those ,two jury-friendlymoppets caleb and cody.

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,320
<13-32,Chase>Dory和nikki
<13-32,Chase>Dory and nikki.

543
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,660
<13-33,Cuddy>综上所述,,你是归咎于Chase
<13-33,Cuddy>Your point, beyond justtrying to make,chase wet himself,

544
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,340
<13-33,Cuddy>看来医院正面临医疗事故
<13-33,Cuddy>seems to be that ,the hospital facesliability here.

545
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,510
<13-33,Cuddy>谢谢, 做出总结
<13-33,Cuddy>Well, thanks for clearing that up.

546
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,520
<13-33,Cuddy>我仍需要一个医学理由,帮她申请
<13-33,Cuddy>I still need a medicalreason to list her.

547
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,190
<13-34,House>这就是医学理由
<13-34,House>That isthe medical reason.

548
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,890
<13-34,House>病人家属打赢医疗事故官司
<13-34,House>The family wins thishospital in a lawsuit,

549
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,640
<13-34,House>他们将要搬进临时公寓
<13-34,House>they'll turn itinto condos.

550
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,390
<13-34,House>临时公寓外有列长队,等待被医治的病人
<13-34,House>And people will die waiting outside, a condofor medical care.

551
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,360
<13-35,Cuddy>祷告着什么时候,才能轮到自己
<13-35,Cuddy>Start praying for, a 12-car pile upon the turnpike,

552
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,940
<13-35,Cuddy>因为我们正在浪费肝
<13-35,Cuddy>because we're not exactly,swimming in livers over here.

553
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,230
<13-36,Stacy>你列席作证时
<13-36,Stacy>When you're testifying,

554

<13-36,Stacy>跳过House打败,Cuddy这一部分
<13-36,Stacy>skip the details on ,howhouse convinced cuddy.

555
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:58,500
<13-36,Stacy>我不认为
<13-36,Stacy>I don't think

556
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,970
<13-36,Stacy>得不到捐献的病人,需要知道原因
<13-36,Stacy>the people who got bumped down the ,transplantlist need to know why.

557
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,490
<13-37,Chase>不再重要
<13-37,Chase>It didn't matter anyway.

558
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,190
<13-38,Sam>她下一个得到捐献?
<13-38,Sam>she next on the list?

<13-40,Foreman>非常少见
<13-40,Foreman>Very rare.

561
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,880
<13-41,Sam>她还能撑多久?
<13-41,Sam>How long can she go on like this?

562
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,080
<13-42,Foreman>大概一两天?
<13-42,Foreman>Probably anotherday or two.

563
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,150
<13-43,Sam>我捐献我的肝
<13-43,Sam>I'm donating my liver.

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,200
<13-45,Sam>六分六蛋白质抗原
<13-45,Sam>Six out of sixhla proteins.

566
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,900
<13-46,Foreman>这么快得到化验结果?
<13-46,Foreman>How'd you getchecked out so fast?

567
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,390
<13-47,Sam>化验室有我熟人
<13-47,Sam>I know a guyin medical testing,

568
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,580
<13-47,Sam>花钱买插队
<13-47,Sam>and I paid himto rush it.

569
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,360
<13-48,Stacy>Sam贿赂某人,提前自己化验?
<13-48,Stacy>Sam bribed someone to rush his tests?

570
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,360
<13-49,Chase>你不会吗?
<13-49,Chase>Wouldn't you?

571
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,370
<13-50,Stacy>某人会因此而被归咎
<13-50,Stacy>Someone's gonna get,the blame for what happened.

572
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,260
<13-50,Stacy>事情越铺越广...
<13-50,Stacy>So the more we spread itaround,

573
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,360
<13-50,Stacy>你说没有外科医生愿意
<13-50,Stacy>might as well--,you said no surgeon would do

574
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,810
<13-50,Stacy>在此情况下动手术
<13-50,Stacy>a live donor transplant ,on such short notice.

575
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,830
<13-51,Chase>House也把它办妥
<13-51,Chase>House took careof that too.

<14-2,House>Sub q vitamin k ,and freshfrozen plasma pre-op.

578
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
<14-3,Ayersman>孤注一掷
<14-3,Ayersman>Pretty risky.

579
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,060
<14-4,House>正是我来拜托医院,最棒移植手术医生的原因
<14-4,House>Well, that's why I cam to the ,best transplantsurgeon in the hospital.

<15-1,Stacy>And this was right before ,you ran the marathon, I suppose?

585
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,840
<15-2,House>你指[握紧双手,以示谢意]那部分?
<15-2,House>Was it the part wherehe warmly ,clasped my hands in thanks?

586
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,590
<15-2,House>有些过头哦?

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,550
<15-3,Stacy>你对他作过什么?
<15-3,Stacy>What did you do to him?

<15-4,House>医院律师问我,是否有不道德行为
<15-4,House>The hospital lawyer asks me,if I did something unethical.

589
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,240
<15-4,House>如果有,也是最后一个告诉律师
<15-4,House>If I did, the last person ,I'dtell is the hospital lawyer.

590
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,540
<15-4,House>值得强调,她对我已失尽信心
<15-4,House>Especially since she's gone,all old testament on me.

<15-6,House>我已厌倦[三方性交]
<15-6,House>I've movedpast threesomes.

595

<15-6,House>对[四方性交]又无兴趣
<15-6,House>I'm not into foursomes.

596
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,620
<15-6,House>一人背信退出
<15-6,House>Someone backs out,

597
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,250
<15-6,House>至少你还有[三方性交]
<15-6,House>then you've still gota threesome.

598
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,530
<15-6,House>如果两人退出
<15-6,House>And if two peopleback out,

599
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,630
<15-6,House>至少还是性行为
<15-6,House>you're still having sex.

600
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,370
<15-6,House>-哪怕三个人, 你仍会震惊,-你说都是辨方证词
<15-6,House>- You'd be amazed.Even if three people--,- anything you sayis attorney-client.

601
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,110
<15-7,Stacy>你终于明白[大事不妙],自我折磨
<15-7,Stacy>So you get advice aboutthe bad, bad thing, you did knowing that I'll be tortured

602
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,780
<15-7,Stacy>无法清楚阐述观点
<15-7,Stacy>because I can't tell a soul.

603
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,280
<15-8,House>实际上, 那经历不错
<15-8,House>Actually, it is kindof cool.

604
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,970
<15-9,Ayersman>你彻底疯了吗?
<15-9,Ayersman>Are you completelyout of your mind?

605
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,770
<15-9,Ayersman>她怎样都会死
<15-9,Ayersman>She's dying on her own.

606
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,350
<15-9,Ayersman>我为何志愿做刽子手?
<15-9,Ayersman>Why would I volunteer,to be her executioner?

607
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,080
<15-9,Ayersman>我怎样都会被病人家属
<15-9,Ayersman>I'd just be invitinga lawsuit ,from the brother no matter what.

608
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,190
<15-10,House>5000美金,只是首付
<15-10,House>Five grand. And that'sjust ante money.

<15-10,House>手术完成,还有1万5
<15-10,House>After the surgery,you get another 15.

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,850
<15-10,House>但提醒你,小费在内
<15-10,House>Though I warn youthat includes the tip.

611

<15-11,Ayersman>我一年挣60万
<15-11,Ayersman>I make 600 grand a year.

612
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,420
<15-11,Ayersman>我会为区区2万,自毁名声?
<15-11,Ayersman>You think I'm gonna risk,tanking my percentages for 20,000?

613
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,590
<15-12,House>免税
<15-12,House>It's tax-free.

614
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,510
<15-13,Ayersman>说到档案...
<15-13,Ayersman>For the record...

615
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,720
<15-13,Ayersman>我希望委员会,把你和Chase

<15-13,Ayersman>很好
<15-13,Ayersman>Great.

618
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,560
<15-14,House>意味我不用担心
<15-14,House>That means I don'thave ,to bother welshing on the 15 grand

619
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,080
<15-14,House>还欠你1万5
<15-14,House>I would've owed you.

620
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,080
<15-14,House>如果你不做手术,我就告诉你老婆
<15-14,House>If you don't do the surgery,,I'm gonna tell your wife

621
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,400
<15-14,House>你和多少护士睡过
<15-14,House>that you've been sleepingwith ,a series of nurses.

622
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,100
<15-14,House>目前是辐射科Culter护士
<15-14,House>Currently nurse cutlerin radiology.

623
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,560
<15-14,House>60万除以二是多少?
<15-14,House>Now what's 600 granddivided by two?

624
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,070
<15-15,House>上年圣诞晚会
<15-15,House>Last christmas party.

625
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,980
<15-15,House>Cutler护士递给你一个小热狗
<15-15,House>Nurse cutler handed youone ,of those little hot dogs,

626
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,610
<15-15,House>你并没说谢谢
<15-15,House>and you didn't thank her.

627
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,490
<15-15,House>那只发生在,你非常非常亲密的人身上
<15-15,House>Well, that only happens ,whenyou're very, very intimate.

628
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,580
<15-15,House>以及
<15-15,House>That and the fact

629
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,970
<15-15,House>你一直敞着裤门儿,跳来跳去
<15-15,House>that you've been practically dancing ,around withyour zipper open

630
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,480
<15-15,House>鞋底粘着一条,用过的保险套
<15-15,House>and a used condomstuck on your shoe.

631
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,940
<15-15,House>显然你老婆,是唯一不知情的人
<15-15,House>Your wife is apparentlythe only one ,who doesn't know.

632
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,960
<15-16,Ayersman>你敢告诉她
<15-16,Ayersman>There's no wayyou'll tell her.

633
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,880
<15-17,House>我当然不敢
<15-17,House>Of course I won'T.

634
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,710
<15-17,House>我是胆小鬼
<15-17,House>I'm much too cowardly.

635
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,270
<15-17,House>我会寄匿名信
<15-17,House>No, I'll just sendan anonymous letter.

636
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,160
<15-17,House>今天下午四点,我预定一间手术室
<15-17,House>Now I've got an O.R. Booked,for 4:00 this afternoon.

637
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,440
<15-17,House>你有空吗?
<15-17,House>Are you free?

638
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,920
<15-18,House>提到个人档案
<15-18,House>Oh, and for the record,

639
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,750
<15-18,House>你是医院里,最差的移植手术医生
<15-18,House>you are the worst transplant surgeon ,in this hospital.

640
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,080
<15-18,House>但不巧
<15-18,House>But unfortunately,

641
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,660
<15-18,House>你是目前,唯一背叛妻子的
<15-18,House>you're the only one who's currently ,cheatingon his wife.

642
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,370
<16-1,Stacy>你贿赂,接着恐吓他?
<16-1,Stacy>You bribed him and then,you blackmailed him?

643
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,700
<16-2,House>她只剩两天
<16-2,House>She'd have been deadin two days

644
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,410
<16-2,House>我只能逼Ayersman做手术
<16-2,House>if I hadn't made ayersman,do the surgery.

645
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,830
<16-3,Stacy>听证会上,务必跳过[恐吓]这段
<16-3,Stacy>Leave the blackmailout of the story,you tell the committee.

646
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,880
<16-4,House>和你谈话前,本打算跳过
<16-4,House>I tried to leave it,out of the story I told you.

647
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,220
<16-5,Stacy>停车场的插曲呢
<16-5,Stacy>And then there was that incident, in the parking lot.

648
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,480
<16-5,Stacy>不要这样,你疯了!
<16-5,Stacy>Don't do that.Wait! Are you nuts?!

649
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,240
<17-1,Ayersman>我没!,我没背叛你!
<17-1,Ayersman>I didn't do it!I didn't do anything!

650
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,830
<17-1,Ayersman>给我钥匙!
<17-1,Ayersman>Give me the key!

651
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,810
<17-1,Ayersman>显然某人寄给他妻子,一封匿名信
<17-1,Ayersman>Apparently someone sent, an anonymous letterto his wife.

652
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,150
<18-1,House>你恐吓Ayersman,在他执行手术后
<18-1,House>You blackmailed ayersman,,he performed the surgery,

653
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,580
<18-2,Stacy>你仍然出卖他?
<18-2,Stacy>and you ratted him outanyway?

654
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,970
<18-3,House>似乎不公平, 是吧?
<18-3,House>Doesn't seem fair, does it?

655
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,890
<18-4,Stacy>你无法控制自己！
<18-4,Stacy>You just can't controlyourself, can you?

656
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,870
<18-4,Stacy>不过多么愚蠢

657
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,480
<18-4,Stacy>-多么自毁,-使本次谈话顺利进行
<18-4,Stacy>- how self-destructive--,- to make this conversation easier,

658
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,300
<18-5,House>我们置其它于一边
<18-5,House>can we discard the fiction,that we're talkingabout anything

659
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,740
<18-5,House>先说我对你做过的事?
<18-5,House>other than what I didto you?

660
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,410
<18-5,House>我溜进你那,精神病专家的办公室
<18-5,House>You're not mad because ,I broke intoyour psychiatrist's office.

661

<18-7,House>是啊, 我是兴奋,好吧, 确实下贱
<18-7,House>- Yeah, I was thrilledabout that.- Okay, it was a lousything to do.

662
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,310
<18-7,House>如果被发现的是少女日记
<18-7,House>But if what I'd found,that was everything was all kittens

663
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,240
<18-7,House>或者月光宝盒
<18-7,House>andmoonbeams in markville,

664
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,220
<18-7,House>你不会如此介意
<18-7,House>you'd be over it.

665
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,380
<18-8,Stacy>不, 我会的
<18-8,Stacy>No, I wouldn'T.

666
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,150
<18-9,House>你生气是因为,我全盘告诉你
<18-9,House>You're mad at me ,forletting you know what I did

667
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,790
<18-9,House>因为你希望顺其自然
<18-9,House>because you likedwhere things were going.

668
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,810
<18-9,House>因此, 我很对不起
<18-9,House>And for that,I actually am sorry.

669
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,640
<18-9,House>非常愚蠢
<18-9,House>It was stupid.

670
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,590
<18-10,House>讲个关于病人的故事
<18-10,House>Let me tell you ,a storyabout a patient.

<18-10,House>一个病人, 姑且叫她[釜山]
<18-10,House>A patient we'll call fusan.

672
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,840
<19-1,Chase>因为Sam提前拿到化验结果
<19-1,Chase>because sam had rushed his tests,

673
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,460
<19-1,Chase>我们当天下午,将他们推进手术室

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,070
<21-21,Foreman>是罪加一等
<21-21,Foreman>It's just one more thing ,they'll pin on you.

815
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,270
<21-21,Foreman>进去,做正确的事
<21-21,Foreman>Go in there.Be the good guy.

816
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,040
<22-1,Chase>我们得谈谈
<22-1,Chase>We need to talk.

817
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,470
<22-2,Sam>不, 没有时间了
<22-2,Sam>No, there's no time.

818
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,710
<22-3,Chase>两分钟, Kayla...
<22-3,Chase>Two minutes. Kayla...

819
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,970
<22-3,Chase>是我的失误
<22-3,Chase>I made a mistake.

820
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,820
<22-3,Chase>我对你突发症状,不够细心
<22-3,Chase>I wasn't as blunt,as I should've been about your odds.

821
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,420
<22-3,Chase>我甚至不想面对
<22-3,Chase>I probably didn't wantto face them myself.

822
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,580
<22-4,Sam>Chase医生,请不要这样
<22-4,Sam>Dr. Chase,please don't do this.

823
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,600
<22-5,Chase>旅途压力和手术
<22-5,Chase>The stress of the travel,the operation.

824
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,340
<22-5,Chase>癌症本身
<22-5,Chase>Even then the cancer.

825
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,710
<22-6,Sam>Kayla, 我们走
<22-6,Sam>Kayla, we are going.

00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:13,420
<22-7,Chase>我爸爸死于肺癌
<22-7,Chase>My dad died.Lung cancer.

827
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,620
<22-7,Chase>事发前几个月我刚见过他
<22-7,Chase>I saw him a couple of months ,before it happened.

828
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,920
<22-7,Chase>我们未提及
<22-7,Chase>We never talked about it.

829
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,230
<22-8,Sam>对你父亲的死我很难过
<22-8,Sam>I'm sorry your fatherdied,

830
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,810
<22-8,Sam>-但那根本...-他从未告诉我他生病
<22-8,Sam>- but it has nothing--,- he never even told mehe was sick.

831
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,080
<22-9,Chase>我希望被告知
<22-9,Chase>I wish he had.

832
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,760
<22-9,Chase>那会...
<22-9,Chase>It would--

833
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,370
<22-9,Chase>你就要死了
<22-9,Chase>you're gonna die.

834
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,570
<22-9,Chase>一个人,离开你孩子几千里以外
<22-9,Chase>Alone. Thousands of miles,from your children.

835
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,010
<22-9,Chase>你不想那样对她们
<22-9,Chase>You don't want to dothat to them.

836
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,060
<22-10,Sam>Kayla.
<22-10,Sam>Kayla

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,140
<22-12,Sam>Kayla, 你不能放弃
<22-12,Sam>Kayla, you can't give up.

839
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,130
<22-12,Sam>如果你...
<22-12,Sam>If you do this...

840
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,670
<22-12,Sam>如果你回家...
<22-12,Sam>if you go home...

841
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,620
<22-12,Sam>那是我杀了你
<22-12,Sam>I killed you.

842
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,680
<22-12,Sam>不是的
<22-12,Sam>No.

843
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,510
<22-13,Kayla>你给我三个月
<22-13,Kayla>You gave me three months.

844
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,740
<22-13,Kayla>你给Dory和Nikki三个月,与我共渡的时光
<22-13,Kayla>You gave dory and nikki ,three more months with me.

845
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,120
<22-13,Kayla>他们发现我的癌
<22-13,Kayla>And when they foundmy cancer,

846
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,770
<22-13,Kayla>也发现你的
<22-13,Kayla>they found yours.

847
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,300
<22-13,Kayla>而我救了我哥哥
<22-13,Kayla>And I got to savemy baby brother.

848
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,040
<22-14,Chase>一个星期后,Kayla在家里去世
<22-14,Chase>a week later, kayla died at home.

849
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,420
<22-14,Chase>Sam因此发怒
<22-14,Chase>Sam was furious.

850
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,380
<22-14,Chase>所以才会有整单诉讼案
<22-14,Chase>That's gotta be whythe big lawsuit.

851
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,680
<22-15,Cuddy>你信吗?
<22-15,Cuddy>Are you buying this?

852
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,300
<22-16,Stacy>当然不信
<22-16,Stacy>of course not.

853
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,560
<22-16,Stacy>没有非法移植,没有因果关系
<22-16,Stacy>There was no illegal transplant.There's no causation.

854
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,130
<22-17,Chase>他就差杀了我
<22-17,Chase>He was ready to kill me.

855
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,500
<22-17,Chase>或者他对他的律师说谎
<22-17,Chase>Maybe he's lyingto his lawyers.

856
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,200
<22-18,Stacy>或者你对我们说谎
<22-18,Stacy>Or you're lying to us.

857
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,930
<22-18,Stacy>上个星期四他找你做复查
<22-18,Stacy>Last thursday he saw you,for post-op care.

858
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,680
<22-18,Stacy>如果你恨你的医生,你可以换个医生
<22-18,Stacy>If you hate your doctor,,you find another doctor

859
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,320
<22-18,Stacy>但你要先换个律师
<22-18,Stacy>before you find a lawyer.

860
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,660
<22-18,Stacy>这个人没起诉,Cameron或Foreman
<22-18,Stacy>This guy didn't suecameron or foreman.

861
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,940
<22-18,Stacy>他甚至没起诉House
<22-18,Stacy>He didn't even sue house.

862
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,460
<22-18,Stacy>有个人因素
<22-18,Stacy>There's something personal here.

863
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,380
<22-18,Stacy>在听证会前,某些不想告诉我们的事实
<22-18,Stacy>Something you don't want us,to know before your hearing.

864
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,920
<22-18,Stacy>那次会面前,他没恨过你
<22-18,Stacy>The guy didn't hate ,youbefore that meeting.

865
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,570
<22-18,Stacy>他在之后才恨你
<22-18,Stacy>He hated you after.

<22-19,Chase>生活如何?,孩子?
<22-19,Chase>So how's everything else?The girls?

867
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,700
<22-20,Sam>孩子们难过, 不停得哭
<22-20,Sam>You know, a lot of crying.Some nightmares.

868
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,130
<22-20,Sam>我们会好起来
<22-20,Sam>We'll be okay though.

869
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,410
<22-21,Chase>那就好
<22-21,Chase>Good.

870
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,890
<22-22,Sam>但孩子们不想搬家
<22-22,Sam>But the girls arenot gonna be happy,about leaving town though.

871
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,460
<22-22,Sam>她们爱那栋房子
<22-22,Sam>They love that house.

00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,160
<22-23,Chase>你们要搬家?
<22-23,Chase>You're moving?

874
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,250
<22-24,Sam>手术过后, 我就像个残废
<22-24,Sam>Ever since the operation,I've been on disability.

875
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,130
<22-24,Sam>还有债务抵押, 所以
<22-24,Sam>And the mortgage, so...

879
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,160
<22-25,Chase>我误诊她的溃疡
<22-25,Chase>I misdiagnosed her ulcer.

880
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,380
<22-25,Chase>我杀了她

00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,660
<22-27,Chase>她找我复诊的时候
<22-27,Chase>when she came back to see me.

884
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,190
<22-27,Chase>我忍着前晚的酒劲
<22-27,Chase>I'd been up halfthe night drinking,

885

<22-27,Chase>还有头痛

<22-27,Chase>and I just wanted,to get the hellout of there.

887
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,190
<22-27,Chase>我豪不在意,你妹妹要说-
<22-27,Chase>I couldn't have cared less what ,your sister was saying

888
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,140
<22-27,Chase>她的胃痛
<22-27,Chase>about her stomach pain.

889
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,480
<23-1,House>我能和我的[未来前],雇员说几句吗?
<23-1,House>May I speak to my futureformer employee?

891
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,000
<23-3,Chase>你认为我在说谎?
<23-3,Chase>you think I'm lying?

892
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,410
<23-3,Chase>确实是我和他的对话
<23-3,Chase>It's exactlywhat I told him.

893
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,470
<23-4,House>我确信无疑,但你向他说谎
<23-4,House>I'm sure it is.But you lied to him.

894
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,910
<23-4,House>你希望他被他起诉
<23-4,House>You want him to sue you.

895
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,910
<23-5,Chase>我杀了他妹妹
<23-5,Chase>I killed his sister.

896
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,690
<23-6,House>今早我点的是黑咖啡
<23-6,House>I ordered black coffeethis morning

897
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,440
<23-6,House>却得到奶昔,每个人都乱来
<23-6,House>and got cream.Everybody screws up.

898
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,170
<23-7,Chase>没人在你咖啡下毒
<23-7,Chase>They didn't put poisonin your coffee.

899
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,820
<23-8,House>我见过你喝醉
<23-8,House>I've seen you hungover.

900
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,620
<23-8,House>而误诊那天你并没有
<23-8,House>You weren't the day ,you blewhis sister's diagnosis.

901
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,640
<23-9,Chase>那有什么关系?
<23-9,Chase>What does it matter why?

902
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,760
<23-9,Chase>如果我理由充足,她能少死吗?
<23-9,Chase>Is she less deadif I have a good excuse?

903
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,290
<23-10,House>如果我认为,你因宿醉而失误
<23-10,House>If I thought you screwed up,because you were drunk,

904
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,430
<23-10,House>我一早就抄了你
<23-10,House>I would've fired you.

905
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,930
<23-11,Chase>你知道?
<23-11,Chase>You knew?

906
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,010

<23-12,House>You were depressedand distracted.

907
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,460
<23-12,House>我猜测你接到继母的电话
<23-12,House>And I assumed you hadgotten ,a phone call from your step-mom.

908
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,320
<23-13,Chase>我是Robert
<23-13,Chase>This is robert.

909
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,560
<23-13,Chase>他怎么死的?
<23-13,Chase>what did he die of?

910
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,010
<23-13,Chase>不可能
<23-13,Chase>That's impossible.

911
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,910
<23-13,Chase>我两个月前才见过他
<23-13,Chase>I saw him two months ago.

912
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,890
<23-13,Chase>如果他有肺癌,他会...
<23-13,Chase>If he had lung cancerhe would've--

913
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,290
<23-14,Kayla>Chase医生?
<23-14,Kayla>dr. Chase?

914
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,400
<23-15,House>好消息是：,现在你已双亲双亡
<23-15,House>The good news is both,your parents are dead now,

915
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,390
<23-15,House>所以不存在,犯类似错误的理由
<23-15,House>so no reason to screw upthis bad again.

916
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,530
<23-16,Chase>你怎么知道?
<23-16,Chase>How'd you know?

917
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,210
<23-17,House>医院有内线
<23-17,House>There's this interconnected ,network of computers,

918
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,410
<23-17,House>被称作[局域网],你可以...
<23-17,House>or interweb,where you can--

919
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,390
<23-18,Chase>你怎么想到去调查?
<23-18,Chase>how did you knowto look?

920
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,600
<23-19,House>他来找我,说他只剩2个月
<23-19,House>When he visited,he told me, he only hadtwo months left.

921
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,040
<23-19,House>当你失误时,我做过数学
<23-19,House>And when you screwed up,,I did the math.

922
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,280
<23-20,Chase>为什么你不告诉我,他要死了?
<23-20,Chase>Why didn't you tell mehe was dying?

923
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,800
<23-21,House>他不让我说
<23-21,House>He asked me not to.

924
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,000
<23-22,Chase>所以你就把我凉在,无知的一面
<23-22,Chase>So you just hung meout,there to be blindsided.

925
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,840
<23-23,House>是的Chase,都是我的错
<23-23,House>Yeah, chase.It was all my fault.

<23-23,House>Look, you've got a choice.

927
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,210
<23-23,House>要么说出事实
<23-23,House>You can eithertell the truth.

928
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,200
<23-23,House>医院给家属慰问金
<23-23,House>Hospital settles.Family gets some money.

929
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,650
<23-23,House>他们可以保住房子
