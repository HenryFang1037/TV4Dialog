<7-12,HOUSE>我不是在找外伤
<7-12,HOUSE>I'm not looking for trauma.

121
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,560
<7-12,HOUSE>我想看看音乐
<7-12,HOUSE>I wanna see the music.

<7-12,HOUSE>看看音乐
<7-12,HOUSE>See the music.

123
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,660
<8-1,HOUSE>真是无聊
<8-1,HOUSE>Well, that's dull.

124
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,920
<8-2,FOREMAN>你觉得功能磁共振成像会显出一个大箭头
<8-2,FOREMAN>You think FMRI's gonna show a big arrow

125
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,970
<8-2,FOREMAN>指向写着"学者综合症"的闪光标志?
<8-2,FOREMAN>pointing to a flashing sign saying "savantism"?

126
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,500
<8-3,HOUSE>那就帮上大忙了
<8-3,HOUSE>Would be hugely helpful.

127
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
<8-3,HOUSE>不知何故 他变成了一个音乐专家
<8-3,HOUSE>Somehow, he's been rewired as a music specialist.

128
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,560
<8-3,HOUSE>我想知道是怎么发生的
<8-3,HOUSE>I wanna know how that happens.

129
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,460
<8-4,FOREMAN>他调用了你不能调用的那部分脑子
<8-4,FOREMAN>He has access to parts of the brain that you don't.

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,370
<8-5,HOUSE>他的脑子没什么反应
<8-5,HOUSE>His brain's doing nothing.

131
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,280
<8-5,HOUSE>听到音乐 反应和别的傻瓜一样
<8-5,HOUSE>It looks like any jerk listening.

132
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,000
<8-6,FOREMAN>他不是聆听方面的天才
<8-6,FOREMAN>He's not a savant at listening.

133
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,140
<8-6,FOREMAN>他是演奏方面的天才
<8-6,FOREMAN>He's a savant at playing.

134
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,090
<8-6,FOREMAN>听和弹是两种不同的脑部活动
<8-6,FOREMAN>Well, listening and playing are two different neurological processes.

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,510
<8-7,HOUSE>把音乐关了
<8-7,HOUSE>Turn off the music.

136
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,790
<8-8,HOUSE>Patrick 我要你把你的腿想象成钢琴
<8-8,HOUSE>Patrick, I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano.

137
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,790
<8-9,PATRICK>我的腿不是钢琴
<8-9,PATRICK>My leg's not a piano.

138
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,550
<8-10,HOUSE>我知道 所以我才说"想象成"
<8-10,HOUSE>I know, that's why I said "pretend".

139
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,880
<8-10,HOUSE>这小子是个低能儿
<8-10,HOUSE>The kid's a moron.

140
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,600
<8-10,HOUSE>头别动 用你的手指
<8-10,HOUSE>Keep your head still, use your fingers.

141
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,580
<8-12,HOUSE>哇 真酷 对吧?
<8-12,HOUSE>Wow. Cool, huh?

142
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,390
<8-12,HOUSE>他的心率变高了
<8-12,HOUSE>His heart rate rose.

143
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,580
<8-13,FOREMAN>情绪上的反应?
<8-13,FOREMAN>Emotional response?

144
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,850
<8-14,HOUSE>那为什么缘脑不活跃呢?
<8-14,HOUSE>Then why is there no activity in the limbic system?

145
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,130
<8-14,HOUSE>除非他的心脏有问题
<8-14,HOUSE>Unless there's a problem with his heart.

146
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,610
<8-14,HOUSE>做个超声心动图来确认
<8-14,HOUSE>Do an echo to confirm.

147
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,400
<8-14,HOUSE>给他洗洗 他需要手术
<8-14,HOUSE>- Then scrub up.- He's gonna need surgery.

148
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,400
<9-1,FOREMAN>不是肌张力障碍
<9-1,FOREMAN>Wasn't dystonia.

149
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,250
<9-1,FOREMAN>他有心脏问题 导致手臂上的动脉收缩
<9-1,FOREMAN>He's got a heart condition that caused the arteries in his arm to constrict.

150
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,250
<9-2,CAMERON>你知道为什么House要去波士顿吗?
<9-2,CAMERON>Do you have any idea why House would want to go to Boston?

151
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,830
<9-3,FOREMAN>去喝杂烩汤? (波士顿海鲜有名)
<9-3,FOREMAN>The chowder?

152
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,780
<9-4,CAMERON>这个礼拜五的机票
<9-4,CAMERON>Plane tickets, this Friday.

153
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,570
<9-4,CAMERON>我看了他的信
<9-4,CAMERON>I opened his mail.

154
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,710
<9-4,CAMERON>听说哈佛有个传染病学的主任医生讲座
<9-4,CAMERON>I heard there's an opening at Harvard for division chief, infectious disease.

155
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,660
<9-5,FOREMAN>上进求知不是他的特色
<9-5,FOREMAN>Well, ambition's not one of his more prominent traits.

156
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,180
<9-6,FOREMAN>- 尽管...- 什么?
<9-6,FOREMAN>- Although...- what?

157
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,440
<9-7,CAMERON>他在门诊时做了血样检查
<9-7,CAMERON>Well, he was testing blood in the clinic.

158
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,390
<9-8,FOREMAN>我不觉得那是病人的血
<9-8,FOREMAN>Don't think it was a patient's blood.

159
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,730
<9-9,CAMERON>为什么 血是绿色的?
<9-9,CAMERON>Why, it was green?

160
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,010
<9-10,FOREMAN>不 他做了些常规检查
<9-10,FOREMAN>No, he was checking for routine stuff.

161
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,960
<9-11,FOREMAN>有可能他是为了新工作 做基本健康证明
<9-11,FOREMAN>Makes sense if he's lookingfor basic medical clearance for employment.

162
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,240
<10-1,CHASE>我要回家
<10-1,CHASE>I'm going home.

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,240
<10-2,CAMERON>你不许回去
<10-2,CAMERON>No, you're not.

164
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,240
<10-3,CHASE>他随时都可能出现
<10-3,CHASE>He could show up any minute.

165
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,740
<10-4,CAMERON>他沉迷于学者综合症患者呢
<10-4,CAMERON>Not with a savant to obsess about.

<10-4,CAMERON>我来查这里

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,260
<11-3,CAMERON>卧室还能在哪儿?
<11-3,CAMERON>Where else would the bedroom be?

170
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,310
<11-4,CHASE>一起来?
<11-4,CHASE>Come with?

171
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,300
<11-5,CAMERON>你怕他发现我们闯进他家
<11-5,CAMERON>You're scared of him catching us breaking into his home,

172
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,490
<11-5,CAMERON>却不怕他发现我们在他床上做那事儿?
<11-5,CAMERON>but you're not scared of him catching us doing it in his bed?

173
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,780
<11-6,CHASE>反正不管怎样 我都会被炒鱿鱼...
<11-6,CHASE>If I'm gonna get fired anyway...

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,780
<12-1,FOREMAN>就快到心脏了
<12-1,FOREMAN>almost at the heart.

175
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,690
<12-1,FOREMAN>没有出血
<12-1,FOREMAN>No bleeding.

<13-1,CHASE>We're wasting our time!

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,020
<13-2,CAMERON>他的高中年册
<13-2,CAMERON>His high school yearbook.

185
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,550
<13-3,CHASE>除非你认为他是去波士顿参加高中同学会
<13-3,CHASE>Unless you think he's going to Boston to attend a high school reunion,

186
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,500
<13-3,CHASE>否则就放回去 在他回家前离开
<13-3,CHASE>put it back and let's get out of here before he comes home.

187
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,080
<13-4,CAMERON>他没有笑
<13-4,CAMERON>He's not smiling.

188
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,940
<13-5,CHASE>我怀疑他没有牙齿
<13-5,CHASE>I wonder if he has teeth.

189
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,290
<13-6,CHASE>波士顿的区号是多少?
<13-6,CHASE>What's the area code for Boston?

190
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,130
<13-7,CAMERON>617 怎么了?
<13-7,CAMERON>617, why?

191

<14-1,CUDDY>你以为可以轻而易举,把House医生偷过去吗?
<14-1,CUDDY>Did you think you could steal Dr. House without a fight?

<14-1,CUDDY>把他偷过去干吗?
<14-1,CUDDY>Steal him for what?

<14-3,CUDDY>He's called you six times in the last month.

<14-3,CUDDY>我们没打算聘请他
<14-3,CUDDY>We're not looking to hire him.

198
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,020
<14-4,CUDDY>你重复说 我就会相信你了?
<14-4,CUDDY>You think if you keep repeating it, I'll start believing you?

199
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,000
<14-4,CUDDY>Cuddy医生 我没别的可说了
<14-4,CUDDY>Dr.Cuddy, there's nothing else I can say.

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,480
<14-5,CUDDY>很抱歉
<14-5,CUDDY>I'm sorry.

201
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,530
<14-5,CUDDY>如果他不是为工作面试而去
<14-5,CUDDY>Well, if he's not coming there for a job interview,

202
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,860
<14-5,CUDDY>那他去你的医院
<14-5,CUDDY>he's either coming to your hospital for

203
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,580
<14-5,CUDDY>就是以普通病人的身份
<14-5,CUDDY>a social visitor because he's a patient.

204

<14-6,CUDDY>是这样的吗 Medick医生?
<14-6,CUDDY>Is it a social visit, Dr.Medick?

205
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,360
<14-6,CUDDY>我受不了House
<14-6,CUDDY>I can't stand House.

206
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,740
<14-6,CUDDY>Kupersmith医生也受不了

<15-4,CUDDY>他具体专攻哪方面的?
<15-4,CUDDY>What's his subspecialty?

212
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,920
<15-5,WILSON>脑癌
<15-5,WILSON>Brain cancer.

213
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,730
<15-5,WILSON>发生了什么事?
<15-5,WILSON>What's going on?

214
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,700
<16-1,CUDDY>他看起来没病啊
<16-1,CUDDY>He doesn't look sick.

215
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,730
<16-1,CUDDY>他应该有症状
<16-1,CUDDY>He should have symptoms.

216
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,400
<16-1,CUDDY>眼花 头疼 精神混乱 呆滞
<16-1,CUDDY>Blurred vision, headaches, confusion, clumsiness.

217
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,330
<17-1,WILSON>那取决于癌的类型 程度 恶化速度
<17-1,WILSON>Depends on how far along the cancer is, what kind, how aggressive.

218
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,040
<17-2,CUDDY>他没告诉过你
<17-2,CUDDY>He didn't tell you.

219
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,230
<17-3,CUDDY>House就是House
<17-3,CUDDY>House is House.

220
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,710
<17-4,WILSON>他和别的癌症患者没两样
<17-4,WILSON>He's no different than anyone else with cancer.

221
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
<17-4,WILSON>一旦说了 那以后所有的对话都是关于癌
<17-4,WILSON>Once you tell, then every conversation is about that.

222
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
<18-1,FOREMAN>心脏骤停说明我们错了
<18-1,FOREMAN>Cardiac arrest means we were wrong.

223
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,710
<18-2,CHASE>肯定有心脏问题
<18-2,CHASE>There was a heart problem.

224
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,140
<18-3,FOREMAN>但不会有血管收缩!
<18-3,FOREMAN>But no vasoconstriction!

225
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,050
<18-3,FOREMAN>心脏问题不可能导致手的问题
<18-3,FOREMAN>The heart problem couldn't have caused the hand problem.

226
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,710
<18-4,HOUSE>除非出血是突然出现的
<18-4,HOUSE>Unless the bleed happened suddenly.

227
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,100
<18-4,HOUSE>脑部缺乏供血可以解释肌张力障碍
<18-4,HOUSE>Less blood to the brain explains the dystonia,

228
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,130
<18-4,HOUSE>心脏缺乏供血可以解释心脏病发作
<18-4,HOUSE>less blood to the heart explains the heart attack.

229
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,750
<18-4,HOUSE>把他上上下下查个遍
<18-4,HOUSE>Scope him above and below.

230
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,270
<18-4,HOUSE>如果不起作用 剖开他
<18-4,HOUSE>If that doesn't work, gut him.

231
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,270
<18-4,HOUSE>你不能麻醉他?
<18-4,HOUSE>You can't sedate him?

232
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,560
<19-1,CHASE>那样他的咽喉可能会萎陷
<19-1,CHASE>There's a risk his throat could collapse.

233
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,900
<19-2,PATRICK>你看起来很生气 爸爸
<19-2,PATRICK>You look mad, pop.

234
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,890
<19-2,PATRICK>不 不 我没生气 我向你保证

252
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,300
<20-1,CAMERON>我刚和Cuddy说过话 她不肯说
<20-1,CAMERON>I just spoke to Cuddy, she can't confirm whether

253
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,110
<20-2,CAMERON>House是否申请去波士顿工作
<20-2,CAMERON>House is applying for a job in Boston.

254
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,700
<20-3,WILSON>啊 我要迟到了...
<20-3,WILSON>Yeah, I'm late for a--

255
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,990
<20-4,CAMERON>如果我要重新找工作的话
<20-4,CAMERON>If I have to look for work,

256
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,810
<20-4,CAMERON>我有权知道
<20-4,CAMERON>I have a right to know.

257
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,400
<21-1,WILSON>很美
<21-1,WILSON>That's pretty.

258
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,490
<21-2,HOUSE>我初中的时候写的
<21-2,HOUSE>I wrote this when I was in junior high school.

259
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,870
<21-2,HOUSE>但是我怎么也不知道如何写下去
<21-2,HOUSE>I could never figure out what came next.

260
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,480
<21-2,HOUSE>然后那个傻瓜弹出了这个
<21-2,HOUSE>Then dimwit came up with this.

261
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,710
<21-3,WILSON>这很好
<21-3,WILSON>It's good.

262
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,530
<21-4,HOUSE>很完美
<21-4,HOUSE>It's perfect.

263
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,000
<21-5,WILSON>我可以在雷雨天在屋顶上搭座塔
<21-5,WILSON>I could set up a tower on the roof during a lightning storm.

264
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,570
<21-5,WILSON>让你和你的病人互换脑子
<21-5,WILSON>Help you switch brains with your patient.

265
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,540
<21-5,WILSON>然后你就可以成为天才钢琴家
<21-5,WILSON>Then you would be the brilliant pianist

266
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,440
<21-5,WILSON>而他就成为患了脑癌,却不告诉朋友的医生
<21-5,WILSON>and he would be the doctor hiding brain cancer from his friend.

267
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,580
<21-6,HOUSE>没什么的
<21-6,HOUSE>It's nothing.

268
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,960
<21-7,WILSON>你得谈谈这个
<21-7,WILSON>You need to talka bout it.

269
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,950
<21-7,WILSON>你得谈谈这个
<21-7,WILSON>You need to talka bout it.

270
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,380
<21-9,WILSON>至少让我看看你的病历
<21-9,WILSON>At least let me look at your medical file.

271
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,770
<21-10,HOUSE>你真是无中生有
<21-10,HOUSE>You're making a big deal out of nothing.

272
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,820
<21-10,HOUSE>还有谁知道?
<21-10,HOUSE>Who else knows?

273
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,820
<21-10,HOUSE>没别人知道
<21-10,HOUSE>No one.

274
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,020
<21-11,WILSON>还有癌症可不是"没什么"
<21-11,WILSON>And cancer isn't nothing.

275
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,390
<21-12,HOUSE>抱歉 没有冒犯你的专业的意思
<21-12,HOUSE>Sorry, didn't mean to offend your specialty.

276
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
<21-13,WILSON>你为什么不来找我?
<21-13,WILSON>Why didn't you come to me?

277
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,550
<21-14,HOUSE>Stein很不错
<21-14,HOUSE>Stein's good.

278
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,980
<21-15,WILSON>Stein接下来六个月都在非洲
<21-15,WILSON>Stein's in Africa for the next six months.

279
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,690
<21-16,HOUSE>他说我至少还有六个月
<21-16,HOUSE>He's given meat least six months.

280
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,120
<21-16,HOUSE>我会去波士顿 我会接受治疗
<21-16,HOUSE>I'll go to Boston, I'll get the treatment.

281
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,180
<21-16,HOUSE>然后万事安好
<21-16,HOUSE>Everything'll be fine.

282
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,950
<21-17,CHASE>没必要谈什么的
<21-17,CHASE>No need to talka bout it.

283
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,520
<21-17,CHASE>你是对的 主刀医生在肾后面发现了一处出血
<21-17,CHASE>You're right, surgeon found a bleed behind the kidney

284
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,940
<21-17,CHASE>在腹膜后隙 原因不明
<21-17,CHASE>in the retroperitoneal cavity, but no reason for it.

285
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,610
<21-17,CHASE>没有癌 没有动脉破裂...
<21-17,CHASE>No cancer, no ruptured arteries...

286
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,570
<21-18,CHASE>那么出血解释了症状
<21-18,CHASE>so bleeding explains the symptoms,

287
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,000
<21-18,CHASE>但解释不了出血
<21-18,CHASE>but we've got no explanation for the bleeding.

288
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,150
<21-19,CHASE>在他们缝合他的时候
<21-19,CHASE>And while they were closing him up,

289
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,670
<21-19,CHASE>Patrick出现了严重的癫痫
<21-19,CHASE>Patrick had a grand mal seizure,

290
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,550
<21-19,CHASE>让人毫无头绪 因为他服用抗惊厥药物
<21-19,CHASE>which makes no sense, since he's on an anti-convulsant medication.

291
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,740
<21-20,HOUSE>你告诉他了
<21-20,HOUSE>You told him.

292
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,600
<21-21,WILSON>不 我没有
<21-21,WILSON>No, I didn't.

293
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,000
<21-22,WILSON>我 只告诉了Cameron
<21-22,WILSON>I...only told Cameron.

294
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,940
<22-1,HOUSE>好吧 你们非常聪明地推断出我有癌症
<22-1,HOUSE>Okay. You guys have cleverly deduced that I have cancer.

295
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,140
<22-1,HOUSE>你们没有权利知道
<22-1,HOUSE>You have no right to know.

296
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,470
<22-1,HOUSE>你们无需知道
<22-1,HOUSE>You have no business knowing.

297
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,870
<22-2,FOREMAN>我们想要做些血样测试
<22-2,FOREMAN>We'd like to run some blood tests.

298
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,490
<22-3,HOUSE>只要是为了病人做就行 而不是我!
<22-3,HOUSE>As soon as you work up our patient, who is not me!

299
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,490
<22-4,CAMERON>我们只是想确认你没有被误诊
<22-4,CAMERON>We just want to make sure you weren't misdiagnosed.

300
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,140
<22-5,HOUSE>我没有 不谈了
<22-5,HOUSE>I wasn't, let's move on.

301
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,190
<22-6,CHASE>我们只想抽几管血
<22-6,CHASE>We're just asking for a couple of vials.

302
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,780
<22-8,CAMERON>- 不需要 - 为什么?
<22-8,CAMERON>- No!,- Why not?

303
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,110
<22-9,HOUSE>好吧 假装我完全健康 继续做事吧
<22-9,HOUSE>Okay, we're going to proceed as if I'm perfectly healthy.

304
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,970
<22-10,CHASE>明明知道不是的 要怎么装?
<22-10,CHASE>How can we do that if we know you're not?

305
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,130
<22-11,HOUSE>你们什么都不知道!
<22-11,HOUSE>You don't know anything!

306
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,560
<22-11,HOUSE>最好知道 服用抗惊厥药的病人
<22-11,HOUSE>Except, hopefully, how a patient on

307
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,040
<22-11,HOUSE>怎么会发生癫痫?
<22-11,HOUSE>anti-convulsant medication has a seizure.

308
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,230
<22-12,FOREMAN>抗惊厥药不能避免癫痫
<22-12,FOREMAN>Anti-seizure meds don't prevent seizures,

309
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,480
<22-12,FOREMAN>只是控制癫痫
<22-12,FOREMAN>they just make them manageable.

310
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,930
<22-13,HOUSE>根据手术医生的报告
<22-13,HOUSE>According to the surgeon's report,

311
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,550
<22-13,HOUSE>连控制都谈不上
<22-13,HOUSE>this one wasn't even close to manageable.

312
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,880
<22-14,CAMERON>说明问题不在于为什么会发作癫痫
<22-14,CAMERON>Means the question isn't why is he having seizures,

313
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,390
<22-14,CAMERON>而是为什么癫痫会恶化?
<22-14,CAMERON>it's why are his seizures getting worse?

314
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,770
<22-15,HOUSE>什么变化了?
<22-15,HOUSE>What's changed?

315
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,920
<22-16,FOREMAN>他的大脑 恶化了
<22-16,FOREMAN>His brain, it's gotten worse.

316
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,020
<22-17,HOUSE>那让它更加恶化
<22-17,HOUSE>So we make it even worser.

317
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,650
<22-18,HOUSE>停掉他的抗惊厥药
<22-18,HOUSE>We take him off anti-convulsant medication.

318
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,890
<22-19,CAMERON>癫痫会发作得更厉害
<22-19,CAMERON>He'll seize even more.

319
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,990
<22-19,CAMERON>多次癫痫发作会严重损害大脑
<22-19,CAMERON>Multiple seizures can seriously damage a brain.

320
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,700
<22-20,HOUSE>这家伙都扣扣子都有问题
<22-20,HOUSE>Dude can't button his shirt.

321
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,450
<22-20,HOUSE>还能有更严重的脑损伤?
<22-20,HOUSE>How much more damaged we really talking about?

322
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,170
<22-21,CHASE>更强的癫痫会照亮大脑的不同部分
<22-21,CHASE>Stronger seizures will light up different parts of

323
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,550
<22-21,CHASE>说明哪里受损
<22-21,CHASE>the brain which will indicate which parts are damaged.

324
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,080
<22-22,HOUSE>一旦恶化 做正电子体层摄影
<22-22,HOUSE>Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.

325
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,380
<23-1,HOUSE>正电子体层摄影做好了?
<23-1,HOUSE>PET scan done?

326
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,950
<23-3,HOUSE>- 不,- 你来安慰我情绪?
<23-3,HOUSE>No. You come for my feelings?

327
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,090
<23-4,HOUSE>可惜我把它丢在另一条裤子里了
<23-4,HOUSE>'Cause I left them in my other pants.

328
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,580
<23-5,CAMERON>这是一封推荐信
<23-5,CAMERON>This is a letter of recommendation.

329

<23-10,CAMERON>I thought you'd find it appealing.

<23-14,HOUSE>你真的想走?
<23-14,HOUSE>You really wanna leave?

345

<23-15,CAMERON>如果你不在了 留在这儿也没什么意义
<23-15,CAMERON>If you're not here, there's not much point in staying.

346
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,370
<23-16,HOUSE>我还没死呢
<23-16,HOUSE>I'm not dead yet.

<28-24,FOREMAN>You're an arrogant ass who makes it impossible for anyone to like him,

481
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,410
<28-24,FOREMAN>喜欢惩罚无过之人-
<28-24,FOREMAN>by punishing people who don't deserve--

482
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,690
<28-25,HOUSE>能不能直接跳到“但是”部分?
<28-25,HOUSE>Can get to the "but" part of this speech?

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,600
<28-26,FOREMAN>但是我喜欢你

<28-27,HOUSE>只是对我快死了这件事做出反应
<28-27,HOUSE>You're just reacting to the perception of my death.

486
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,200
<28-27,HOUSE>你要分清主次
<28-27,HOUSE>You need to put things in order.

<28-28,FOREMAN>- 害怕愧疚-,- 你能闭嘴吗?

<28-29,HOUSE>现在要么给我看结果,或者你想...
<28-29,HOUSE>Now are you gonna give me the results, or are you gonna...

490
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,230
<28-30,FOREMAN>颅内脑电图显示没有电极异常
<28-30,FOREMAN>Intracranial EEG showed no electrical abnormalities.

491
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,430
<28-31,HOUSE>意味着是自体免疫疾病
<28-31,HOUSE>Which means it's autoimmune.

492
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,810
<28-32,FOREMAN>不 还显示他整个右脑已经脑死亡
<28-32,FOREMAN>No, it also showed his entire right hemisphere is brain dead.

493
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,460
<29-1,HOUSE>你们这些家伙忙着担心我的时候
<29-1,HOUSE>So...while you guys were worrying about me,

494
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,840
<29-1,HOUSE>这孩子的半个脑子死了
<29-1,HOUSE>half this kid's brain died.

495
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,380
<29-1,HOUSE>唯一的安慰是并没有脑死
<29-1,HOUSE>The only solace you should take from this is the fact that it didn't.

496
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,500
<29-1,HOUSE>比起颅内脑电图 普通脑电图差远了
<29-1,HOUSE>Garden variety EEG sucks compared to the in-brain variety,

497
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,030
<29-1,HOUSE>但不会误诊脑死
<29-1,HOUSE>but it's not gonna miss brain death.

498
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,030
<29-2,FOREMAN>他正在恶化
<29-2,FOREMAN>He's gotten worse.

499
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,040
<29-3,HOUSE>没有那么糟
<29-3,HOUSE>Not that much worse.

500
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,350
<29-4,FOREMAN>呼吸受抑制 癫痫发作还在增加
<29-4,FOREMAN>Respiration is depressed, seizures are increasing,

501
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,500
<29-4,FOREMAN>五分钟一次
<29-4,FOREMAN>one every five minutes.

502
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,860
<29-3,HOUSE>还不算太糟
<29-3,HOUSE>It's not that much worse.

503
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,580
<29-5,HOUSE>他还能说话 他是左撇子
<29-5,HOUSE>He can still talk,and he's left-handed,

504
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,260
<29-5,HOUSE>也就是说语言中枢在右脑
<29-5,HOUSE>which means speech is in the right side.

505
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,670
<29-6,CHASE>你不知道25年前,Patrick的大脑是怎样重整的
<29-6,CHASE>You don't know how Patrick's brain reorganized itself 25 years ago.

506
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,760
<29-7,HOUSE>万一右半脑只有一点点坏死呢
<29-7,HOUSE>What if the right side is just a little dead.

507
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,480
<29-7,HOUSE>也许偶尔还能进行神经原放电
<29-7,HOUSE>Maybe he still has random neurons firing.

508
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,580
<29-8,CAMERON>你不过在寻找难题 转移掉对自己的注意力
<29-8,CAMERON>You're just looking for a puzzle to distract you from your own situation.

509
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,320
<29-9,HOUSE>你说得对 他死了 我们回家吧
<29-9,HOUSE>You're right. He's dead. Let's go home.

510
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,270
<29-9,HOUSE>你们查出什么了吗?
<29-9,HOUSE>What'd you find out?

511
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,410
<29-9,HOUSE>会没事的 对吗?
<29-9,HOUSE>It's going to be ok?

512
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,530
<30-1,FOREMAN>- 我很抱...- 是的!

<30-5,FOREMAN>What's this?

516
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,890
<30-6,FOREMAN>他显然丧失了...
<30-6,FOREMAN>He's obviously lost use--

517
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
<30-7,HOUSE>闭嘴
<30-7,HOUSE>Shut up.

518
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
<30-8,HOUSE>弹奏音乐需要运用整个大脑
<30-8,HOUSE>Music is a global process.

519
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,010
<30-8,HOUSE>只有半个大脑是弹不了钢琴的
<30-8,HOUSE>Can't play the piano with half a brain.

520
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,050
<31-1,FOREMAN>这表明了什么?
<31-1,FOREMAN>What's it mean?

521
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,580
<31-2,HOUSE>表明他的右半脑状况一直很糟
<31-2,HOUSE>It means the right side of his brain has always sucked.

522
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,010
<31-2,HOUSE>与当前发生的现象无关
<31-2,HOUSE>It means it's not relevant to what's going on now.

523
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,440
<31-3,FOREMAN>这么说 是自身免疫疾病
<31-3,FOREMAN>Wow, then it's autoimmune.

524
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,970
<31-4,HOUSE>是的 问题是 我们该拿它怎么办?
<31-4,HOUSE>Yeah. Question is, what do we do about it?

525
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,310
<31-5,FOREMAN>很可能是可治疗的病症
<31-5,FOREMAN>Most likely ones we can fix.

526
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,800
<31-5,FOREMAN>结节性多动脉炎,多发性大动脉炎或肉样瘤
<31-5,FOREMAN>Polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu, or sarcoid.

527
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,510
<31-5,FOREMAN>我去展开治疗
<31-5,FOREMAN>I'll start treatment.

528

<31-6,HOUSE>You do that.

530
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,030
<32-1,HOUSE>轮到你了?
<32-1,HOUSE>Your turn?

531
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,460
<32-2,CHASE>你非得这样吗?
<32-2,CHASE>Do you have to do that?

532
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,720
<32-3,HOUSE>你是指贬低大家的好意
<32-3,HOUSE>You mean cheapen everyone's attempt at a human moment

533
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,860
<32-3,HOUSE>侦测慰问背后的动机?
<32-3,HOUSE>by identifying the real calculations that go into it?

<32-5,HOUSE>- 是的,- 是 我是

<32-8,HOUSE>如果你想捏我屁股 可别做任何
<32-8,HOUSE>Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything...

539
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,000
<32-9,HOUSE>你完成不了的动作
<32-9,HOUSE>You can't finish.

540

<32-10,HOUSE>既然我们还站在这里 介意就地开工吗?
<32-10,HOUSE>Well, as long as we're just standing here, do you mind if we work?

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,520
<32-12,CHASE>癫痫平息了 状况很好
<32-12,CHASE>Seizures are calming down. It's all good.

545
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,140
<32-13,HOUSE>对要进行的下个步骤 算不上好
<32-13,HOUSE>Not for what I'm gonna do next.

546
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,860
<32-14,CHASE>用不了下一步了
<32-14,CHASE>But there is no next.

<33-3,HOUSE>Happens mostlyin Asian women.

559
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,470
<33-4,CUDDY>你知道多发性大动脉炎可以用类固醇治疗
<33-4,CUDDY>Takayasu is manageable with steroids, which you already know.

560
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,470
<33-4,CUDDY>所以我猜你来有别的原因
<33-4,CUDDY>So I assume you're here for something else.

<33-5,HOUSE>我的病人还出现了严重的癫痫症状
<33-5,HOUSE>My patient also has significant seizure problems.

563
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,770
<33-7,HOUSE>是 如果一直使用抗惊厥药
<33-7,HOUSE>Yes, and if he kept takinghis anti-convulsant medication,

564
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,630
<33-7,HOUSE>他可以继续进行钢琴巡演
<33-7,HOUSE>he could go back on tour and play the piano.

565
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,200
<33-8,HOUSE>或者 大脑半球切除术完全
<33-8,HOUSE>But...a hemispherectomy would completely

566
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,230
<33-8,HOUSE>消除右半脑的癫痫
<33-8,HOUSE>stop the right brain seizure activity

567
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,140
<33-8,HOUSE>他就再不需要服用抗惊厥药了

<33-9,CUDDY>你想切除他半个大脑

<33-11,CUDDY>You don't remove half a brainand gain function.

597
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,370
<34-1,HOUSE>我认为应该切除你儿子的右半边大脑
<34-1,HOUSE>I think we should remove the right side of your son's brain.

598
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,470
<34-1,HOUSE>我以为你们治好他了
<34-1,HOUSE>I thought you fixed him.

00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,900
<34-2,HOUSE>他看起来象治好的样子吗?
<34-2,HOUSE>Does he look fixed?

600
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,250
<34-2,HOUSE>右半脑能使他走直线
<34-2,HOUSE>Right side of his brain was keeping him walking straight.

601
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,370
<34-2,HOUSE>除此之外 事故后它就一直是累赘
<34-2,HOUSE>Other than that, it's been dead weight ever since the accident.

602
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,710
<34-2,HOUSE>如果移除掉 癫痫就会彻底消失
<34-2,HOUSE>If we remove it, seizures would stop completely.

603
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,140
<34-2,HOUSE>但是癫痫几乎察觉不到
<34-2,HOUSE>But the seizures are hardly noticeable.

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,380
<34-3,HOUSE>不会折磨Patrick
<34-3,HOUSE>They don't bother Patrick.

605
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,590
<34-3,HOUSE>但是没有癫痫
<34-3,HOUSE>But without the seizures,

606
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,110
<34-3,HOUSE>左半脑就有可能正常运作
<34-3,HOUSE>the left side would have a chance to actually function.

607
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,470
<34-3,HOUSE>可以学习新的动作
<34-3,HOUSE>It could learn to do new things.

608
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,760
<34-3,HOUSE>但是 他再也弹不了钢琴了
<34-3,HOUSE>Only bummer...he'd never play the piano again.

609
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,240
<34-3,HOUSE>不行 钢琴是他的一切
<34-3,HOUSE>No, the piano is everything.

610
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,440
<34-4,HOUSE>不是说 他能为航空航天局工作
<34-4,HOUSE>I'm not saying he'd ever work for NASA,

611
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,600
<34-4,HOUSE>但翻转夹肉饼肯定没问题
<34-4,HOUSE>but flipping burgers isn't out of the question.

612
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,260
<33-7,HOUSE>我不介意照顾他 让他去弹钢琴
<33-7,HOUSE>Well, I don't mind taking care of him so he can play the piano.

00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,550
<34-5,HOUSE>是的 实际上你很幸运
<34-5,HOUSE>No, you're actually lucky.

614
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,170
<34-5,HOUSE>不用看着孩子长大成人
<34-5,HOUSE>You don't have to watch your kid grow up.

615
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,750
<34-5,HOUSE>不用放手给他们自由
<34-5,HOUSE>You don't have to let go.

616

<34-6,HOUSE>Just the way he is.

619
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,380
<34-6,HOUSE>他是马戏团的猴子
<34-6,HOUSE>He's a monkey grinder at the circus.

620
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,600
<34-7,HOUSE>- 他费劲千辛万苦才能有此...- 猴子也一样
<34-7,HOUSE>- He's worked hard to get where he-,- So does the monkey.

621
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,830
<34-7,HOUSE>钢琴不过是神经学上的意外
<34-7,HOUSE>The piano is a neurological accident.

622

<34-8,HOUSE>而我能给他生命
<34-8,HOUSE>I'm offering him a life.

<34-9,HOUSE>这取决于你
<34-9,HOUSE>It's up to you.

<35-1,CHASE>I've isolated the cancer proteins in House's csf.

627

<35-2,FOREMAN>如果他适宜进行杜克试验,就不能让他去波士顿
<35-2,FOREMAN>We can't let him goto Boston if he qualifies for the Duke trial.

628
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,650
<35-3,CHASE>你想做吗?
<35-3,CHASE>You wanna do it?

<38-14,WILSON>让人们难过的不是死亡
<38-14,WILSON>It's not the dying that gets to people.

<38-14,WILSON>So what do you do?

702
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:44,330
<38-14,WILSON>假冒癌症 将关心你的人推开
<38-14,WILSON>You fake the cancer, then push the people who care away.

<38-15,HOUSE>因为他们烦死人了

<39-3,HOUSE>他除了向远方凝视 什么都没干
<39-3,HOUSE>He hasn't really done anything except to stare off into the distance.

716
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,790
<39-4,HOUSE>他得过会才能...
<39-4,HOUSE>He'll take some time to...
