<1-9,Wilson>你给她加薪  还是增加福利
<1-9,Wilson>You give her a raise? Increase her benefits?

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,030
<1-10,House>我们可没有数码录放机
<1-10,House>Don't have TiVo on this thing.

13
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,930
<1-10,House>不能回放  闭嘴
<1-10,House>Can't rewind. Shut up.

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,030
<1-11,Some guy>减少她的工作时间吗
<1-11,Some guy>You lower her hours?

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,040
<1-12,House>你都不认识她
<1-12,House>You don't even know her.

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,050
<1-13,Wilson>-这家伙是谁  -是个病人
<1-13,Wilson>- Who is this guy? - He's a patient.

<1-16,House>Guess I do too.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,050
<1-17,Wilson>一定有什么缘故
<1-17,Wilson>It's gotta be something.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,690
<1-17,Wilson>她应该不是因为喜欢你才回来的
<1-17,Wilson>She didn't come back because she likes you.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,190
<1-17,Wilson>等等
<1-17,Wilson>Wait a minute.

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,260
<1-17,Wilson>她就是因为喜欢你才回来的

<1-19,House>Keep talking. I'll finish your exam with a prostate check.

<1-23,House>不  我  我没的选
<1-23,House>No. She-- She's not giving me any choice.

30
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,130
<1-24,Some guy>慢着  她逼你和她上床吗
<1-24,Some guy>Wait. She's making you do her?

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,940
<1-25,House>是和她约会
<1-25,House>Date her.

32
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,450
<1-26,Wilson>年轻单纯的医生爱上年长粗鲁的导师
<1-26,Wilson>Young ingenue doctor falling in love with gruff, older mentor--

<1-26,Wilson>她的甜蜜温柔让他愿意揭开旧伤疤
<1-26,Wilson>Her sweet, gentle nature bringing him to a closer,

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,670
<1-26,Wilson>再次面对自己曾经受伤的心
<1-26,Wilson>Fuller understanding of his wounded heart.

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,640
<1-27,Some guy>上了她吧
<1-27,Some guy>Do her...

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,540
<1-27,Some guy>不然你就是同志
<1-27,Some guy>or you're gay.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,150
<1-28,House>老天
<1-28,House>For God's sakes.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
<1-29,Wilson and Some guy>*相依树中  甜蜜吻拥*
<1-29,Wilson and Some guy>*Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G*

<1-31,Harvey>-该死  -抱歉  抱歉
<1-31,Harvey>- Damn it! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,460
<1-32,House>谁带着个没盖的尿液样本到处转啊
<1-32,House>Who the hell walks around with an open urine sample?

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,010
<1-33,Harvey>对不起  我没  没
<1-33,Harvey>I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't--

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,020
<1-34,Wilson>你有点反应过度了吧
<1-34,Wilson>You think that was a bit of an overreaction?

44
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,780
<1-35,House>他把尿弄我身上了
<1-35,House>Well, he peed on me.

45
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,920
<1-35,House>难道还要我高兴不成
<1-35,House>I'm not into that.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
<1-36,Wilson>是苹果汁
<1-36,Wilson>It's apple juice.

47
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,600
<1-36,Wilson>现在去找那个家伙  向他道歉
<1-36,Wilson>Now go find that guy and apologize.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,170
<1-36,Wilson>再有一个病人投诉  你就要停职检查了
<1-36,Wilson>One more patient complaint and you're looking at a suspension.

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,760
<2-1,House>我原谅你毁了我的外套
<2-1,House>I forgive you for ruining my jacket.

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,150
<2-1,House>听着  你看着像是个正常人
<2-1,House>Look, you seem like a regular kind of guy--

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,030
<2-1,House>不是那种会给另一个正常人找麻烦的
<2-1,House>not the type to get another regular guy into trouble.

52
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,970
<2-1,House>我说得对吗
<2-1,House>Am I right?

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,650
<2-1,House>给你20块  不要哭了
<2-1,House>Twenty bucks cash if you'll stop crying.

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,860
<2-1,House>原谅我吧  骂我吧
<2-1,House>Forgive me. Yell at me.

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,070
<2-1,House>给我些回应  好吗
<2-1,House>Just give me something I can work with, okay?

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,760
<2-2,Wilson>比赛结束了
<2-2,Wilson>Game's over.

57
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,680
<2-2,Wilson>-你们两个和好了吗  -找个轮椅来
<2-2,Wilson>- You two make nice? - Get a wheelchair.

58
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,060
<2-3,House>-送这个家伙去急诊室  -怎么了
<2-3,House>- Get this guy into the E.R. - What happened?

59
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,350
<2-5,House>-右眼瞳孔扩张  -天
<2-5,House>- Right pupil's blown. - Holy--

60
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,400
<2-6,Wilson>你把他弄中风了吗
<2-6,Wilson>You gave the guy a stroke?

62
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,030
<3-1,Chase>于是狗熊拿兔子来擦屁股
<3-1,Chase>So the bear wipes himself with the rabbit.

63
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,050
<3-2,Foreman>不好笑
<3-2,Foreman>Lame.

64
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,470
<3-5,Chase>-你在这里干什么  -我在这里工作
<3-5,Chase>- What are you doing here? - I work here.

65
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,230
<3-7,Chase>"这里"是指这里吗  这间办公室
<3-7,Chase>"Here" Here? In this office?

66
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,860
<3-8,Cameron>事实上  豪斯求我回来的
<3-8,Cameron>House practically begged me to come back.

67
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,600
<3-9,Foreman>说吧  你是不是狠狠敲诈了一笔
<3-9,Foreman>Please tell me you took him to the cleaners.

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
<3-10,Cameron>薪水还是一样低
<3-10,Cameron>Same lousy salary.

69
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,650
<3-11,Chase>那么你为何还要回来
<3-11,Chase>Then why'd you do it?

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,760
<3-12,House>因为这是世界上最幸福的地方
<3-12,House>Because this is the happiest place on Earth.

71
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,100
<3-12,House>21岁男性  因磨牙就诊
<3-12,House>Twenty-one-year-old male-- Comes in with grinding of the teeth.

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,240
<3-13,Wilson>然后豪斯让他中风了  瞳孔完全放大
<3-13,Wilson>And House gives him a stroke. Totally blew out his pupil.

73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,160
<3-14,Foreman>你把一个家伙给吓得中风了吗
<3-14,Foreman>You scared a guy into stroking out?

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,910
<3-15,Wilson>这里有人感到惊讶吗
<3-15,Wilson>Does that surprise anyone here?

75
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,160
<3-16,Cameron>瞳孔放大通常意味着脑干水肿
<3-16,Cameron>Blown pupils usually means brain stem edema.

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,060
<3-17,House>没错  不过既然他没死也没昏迷
<3-17,House>Sure, but since he's not dead or in a coma,

77
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,060
<3-17,House>我认为是视神经区域中风
<3-17,House>I'm going with stroke to the optic nerve.

78
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
<3-17,House>断层扫描显示两件事
<3-17,House>C.T. Scan shows two things.

79
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,870
<3-18,Foreman>局部缺血  脑组织死亡
<3-18,Foreman>Ischemia-- death of brain tissue.

80
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,160
<3-18,Foreman>意味着有损伤  还好不是永久性的
<3-18,Foreman>Means there's been some damage, hopefully not permanent.

81
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,610
<3-19,House>-还有呢  -没了
<3-19,House>- And? - And that's it.

82
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,210
<3-20,Foreman>单从X光片上看不出具体病因
<3-20,Foreman>There's nothing there to tell us what the underlying cause is.

83
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,570
<3-20,Foreman>得做核磁共振
<3-20,Foreman>Gotta do an M.R.I.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,900
<3-21,House>你看的地方不对
<3-21,House>You're looking at the wrong part of the scan.

85
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,910
<3-22,Foreman>我在看大脑  还有什么
<3-22,Foreman>I'm looking at the brain. What else is there?

86
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,420
<3-23,Cameron>下颌
<3-23,Cameron>The jaw.

87
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,180
<3-24,Chase>下颌告诉我们中风的原因吗
<3-24,Chase>The jaw tells us why he stroked?

88
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,730
<3-25,Cameron>不  下颌告诉我们不能做核磁共振的原因
<3-25,Cameron>No, the jaw tells us why we can't do an M.R.I.

89
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,480
<3-25,Cameron>除非我们想要他的下巴飞出来
<3-25,Cameron>Unless we want his jawbone flying across the room.

90
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,120
<3-25,Cameron>金属板  他做过大型面部重塑手术
<3-25,Cameron>Metal plate. He's had major reconstruction,

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,170
<3-26,House>我们没法取出它
<3-26,House>And there's no way we're removing it,

92
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,640
<3-26,House>所以我们必须更聪明点
<3-26,House>So we're forced to be clever.

93
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,500
<3-26,House>做血管造影以排除血管炎
<3-26,House>Angiogram to rule out vasculitis,

94
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,040
<3-26,House>做肌电图检查外周神经损伤
<3-26,House>E.M.G. for peripheral neuropathy,

95
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,770
<3-26,House>做毒理检测毒品
<3-26,House>Tox screen to eliminate drugs,

96
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,270
<3-26,House>超声检查以排除心脏栓塞
<3-26,House>And echo to rule out cardiac emboli.

97
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,650
<3-26,House>卡梅隆医生
<3-26,House>Dr. Cameron,

98
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,530
<3-26,House>若你能保守新合同条约不外泄
<3-26,House>I'd appreciate you keeping

<3-26,House>the terms of your new contract to yourself.

100
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,610
<3-26,House>别让其他人也来要同样的额外福利
<3-26,House>Don't want everyone clamoring for the same perks.

101
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,810
<3-28,Cameron>-什么额外福利  -你们不会感兴趣的
<3-28,Cameron>- What perks? - Nothing you'd be interested in.

102
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,890
<3-29,Foreman>那么就不是钱
<3-29,Foreman>So it's not money, then?

103
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,050
<3-29,Foreman>办公室吗  保险  停车位
<3-29,Foreman>Office space, insurance, parking--

<3-29,Foreman>任何他能给你的  我们都感兴趣
<3-29,Foreman>Anything he could offer you, we'd be interested in.

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,100
<3-30,Cameron>他答应和我约会一次
<3-30,Cameron>He agreed to go on a date with me.

106

<3-31,Foreman>Naked and sweaty, date?

109
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,490
<3-32,Cameron>他就同意前面两项
<3-32,Cameron>He only committed to the first two.

110
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,660
<3-33,Chase>他太  太老了
<3-33,Chase>He's so-- He's so old.

111
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,230
<3-35,Foreman>-而你  太年轻了  -是个重大错误
<3-35,Foreman>- And you're so young. - It's a big mistake.

112
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,370
<3-36,Cameron>他是我的老板
<3-36,Cameron>It's my boss.

<3-36,Cameron>我去安排肌电图  你准备血管造影
<3-36,Cameron>I'll arrange for the E.M.G. You will set up the angiogram.

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,980
<3-36,Cameron>问病史  得到病人知情同意书
<3-36,Cameron>Patient history, patient consent.

117
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,520
<3-37,Foreman>就像明知会发生一场事故  却只能坐视

156
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,120

<5-13,Ramona>You try talking a 73-year-old out of sex.

<5-18,House>-可以吗  -把腿并拢
<5-18,House>- Would you? - Close your legs.

204
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,320
<6-1,Cameron>人的神经系统通过产生微弱电流
<6-1,Cameron>Nerves stimulate muscles to move

205
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,700
<6-1,Cameron>来刺激肌肉的运动
<6-1,Cameron>by creating a small electrical current.

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,980
<6-1,Cameron>这仪器能检测到这种电流
<6-1,Cameron>The machine will measure that.

207
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,650
<6-1,Cameron>我会用针刺入不同的肌肉
<6-1,Cameron>And I will insert this needle into various muscles

208
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,900
<6-1,Cameron>让你做一些屈曲运动
<6-1,Cameron>and ask you to flex.

209
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,830
<6-1,Cameron>有时候会很痛
<6-1,Cameron>Sometimes it can be painful.

210

<6-1,Cameron>-告诉我  我就拔出来  -不

215
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,690
<6-5,Cameron>把手举过头顶
<6-5,Cameron>Raise your arm over your head.

216
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,180
<7-1,Cameron>肌电图检查没问题
<7-1,Cameron>The E.M.G. was clean.

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,910
<7-2,House>根据诊疗史来看
<7-2,House>Based on this history,

218
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,250
<7-2,House>可能是顺势疗法医生给他服用了有毒性的草药
<7-2,House>it's either toxic herbs from the homeopath,

219
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,930
<7-2,House>也可能是中医推拿师造成了脊椎损伤
<7-2,House>spinal damage from the chiropractor,

220
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,150
<7-2,House>也可能是针灸医师不小心用了
<7-2,House>infection from a needle that the acupuncturist

221
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,380
<7-2,House>扎过蝾螈眼睛的针头引起的感染
<7-2,House>accidentally let sit in eye of newt,

222
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,470
<7-2,House>又或者那个安神师
<7-2,House>or the shen balancer--

223
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,650
<7-2,House>"神"到底是个什么玩意儿
<7-2,House>What the hell is a shen,

224
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,020
<7-2,House>怎么会不安
<7-2,House>and how come it's lopsided?

225
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,500
<7-3,Foreman>我们只在超声波检查中发现了异常
<7-3,Foreman>The only abnormal test result we found was on the echo report.

226
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,120
<7-3,Foreman>二尖瓣脱垂
<7-3,Foreman>Mitral valve prolapse.

227
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,460
<7-4,House>挂个小招牌
<7-4,House>Hang up a shingle

228
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,790
<7-4,House>抨击西医的局限性
<7-4,House>and condemn the narrowness and greed of Western medicine.

229
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,300
<7-4,House>你们就能大发了
<7-4,House>You can make a damn fine living.

230
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,320
<7-5,Foreman>病变的瓣膜上出现血栓
<7-5,Foreman>Clots form on the faulty valve,

231
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,420
<7-5,Foreman>血栓脱落造成脑栓塞  因而引起中风
<7-5,Foreman>get sent to the brain, voil- stroke.

232
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,630
<7-6,House>是啊  反正治不死人
<7-6,House>Of course, no harm, no foul.

233
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,470
<7-6,House>不过是从迷信的白痴手里赚些钱而已
<7-6,House>Just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots, right?

234
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,540
<7-7,Chase>也可能是由外伤引起的动脉瘤
<7-7,Chase>Could also be an aneurysm due to trauma.

235
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
<7-8,Foreman>哪里来的外伤  难道是被推拿师弄伤的
<7-8,Foreman>Trauma? From what, the chiropractic treatments?

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,450
<7-8,Foreman>是细菌性心内膜炎  瓣膜感染了
<7-8,Foreman>It's bacterial endocarditis, an infected valve.

237
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,730
<7-8,Foreman>我们应该做血液培养
<7-8,Foreman>We should do blood cultures.

238
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,340
<7-9,House>他看了六个月的庸医
<7-9,House>The six months that he had with these charlatans...

239
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,560
<7-9,House>还不如找个切合实际
<7-9,House>might have been better spent going to someone

240
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,930
<7-9,House>相信科学的医生呢
<7-9,House>who looks at things that exist in the real world.

241
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,420
<7-9,House>不过这又是鄙人狭隘的想法
<7-9,House>But that's just me being all narrow again.

242
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,840
<7-10,Chase>我给哈维检查时
<7-10,Chase>I noticed a small bruit

243
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,420
<7-10,Chase>发现左侧颈动脉有杂音
<7-10,Chase>when I listened to Harvey's left carotid.

244
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,610
<7-10,Chase>这种杂音很可能是由外伤引起的动脉瘤引起的
<7-10,Chase>You could hear that if he had an aneurysm from trauma.

245
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,780
<7-11,Cameron>血管造影能看出是否有动脉瘤
<7-11,Cameron>An aneurysm would have shown on the angiogram.

246
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,170
<7-12,Chase>未必  不一定
<7-12,Chase>No. Not necessarily.

247
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,870
<7-13,House>左右为难啊
<7-13,House>Quite a dilemma.

248
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,090
<7-13,House>神奇的水晶球  为我指明方向吧
<7-13,House>Oh, great pool-hall oracle, grant me guidance.

249
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,750
<7-13,House>我们是该相信福曼
<7-13,House>Do we go with Foreman's theory,

250
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,040
<7-13,House>那套基于各项医学检测结果而提出的看法呢
<7-13,House>which is at least marginally supported by medical test results,

251
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,610
<7-13,House>还是该相信奇斯
<7-13,House>or Chase's theory,

252
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,340
<7-13,House>虽然那是完全没有医学根据的奇思妙想
<7-13,House>that is completely unsupported by medical evidence?

253
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,260
<7-13,House>请明示
<7-13,House>What to do?

254
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,320
<7-14,Chase>不管怎样  那家伙的下巴明显骨折过
<7-14,Chase>The guy obviously broke his jaw somehow.

255
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,070
<7-14,Chase>说不定还有别的什么外伤
<7-14,Chase>Who knows what other trauma he's suffered?

256
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,970
<7-14,Chase>我们应该再做一次血管造影
<7-14,Chase>We should do the angiogram again.

257
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,760
<7-15,House>所有的迹象都表明
<7-15,House>And all signs point to--

258
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,190
<7-15,House>抱歉  奇斯  天神发话了
<7-15,House>Ah. Sorry, Chase. The gods have spoken.

259
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,450
<7-15,House>给哈维上血液稀释剂和抗生素
<7-15,House>Start Harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics.

260
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,160
<8-1,Chase>哇  我明白了  豪斯是多么可爱啊
<8-1,Chase>Wow. Yeah, I get it. House is adorable.

261
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,290
<8-1,Chase>我真想牢牢握住他  永不分离
<8-1,Chase>I just want to hold him and never let go.

262
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,410
<8-2,Cameron>天呐  你在干什么呢
<8-2,Cameron>My God! What the hell are you doing?

263
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,370
<8-3,Foreman>她要掐死他
<8-3,Foreman>She's choking him.

264
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,480
<8-4,Chase>福曼  住手  放了她
<8-4,Chase>Foreman, stop. Let her go.

265
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,970
<8-5,Foreman>-她刚才想杀了他  -不  她没有
<8-5,Foreman>- She was trying to kill him. - No. No, she wasn't.

266
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,550
<8-6,Harvey>各项生命体征正常
<8-6,Harvey>His vitals seem okay.

267
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,290
<8-8,Harvey>拜托  别伤害她
<8-8,Harvey>Please-- Please, don't hurt her.

268
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,750
<8-9,Foreman>到底怎么回事
<8-9,Foreman>What the hell is going on in here?

269
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,620
<8-10,Chase>她是  她是"施虐女王"
<8-10,Chase>She's-- She's a dominatrix.

270
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,140
<8-10,Chase>没错吧  安妮特
<8-10,Chase>Right, Annette?

271
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,270
<9-1,Lawyer>是病人要求你勒住他的吗
<9-1,Lawyer>The patient asked you to strangle him?

272
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,210
<9-2,Annette>哈维有窒息癖
<9-2,Annette>Harvey is an asphyxiaphyliac.

273
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,280
<9-2,Annette>他喜欢被人掐着  体验窒息的快感
<9-2,Annette>He likes to be strangled or smothered.

274
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,910
<9-3,Lawyer>真是有病
<9-3,Lawyer>That's just sick.

275
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,090
<9-4,House>这个法律观点倒是有趣
<9-4,House>Well, that's an intriguing legal opinion.

276
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,920
<9-4,House>哎呀  这算哪门子的律师啊
<9-4,House>Geez. What kind of a lawyer is he?

277
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,940
<9-5,Lawyer>你要专业的法律意见吗  报警
<9-5,Lawyer>You want a legal opinion? Call the cops.

278
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,620
<9-6,Annette>我很小心
<9-6,Annette>I was careful.

279
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,330
<9-6,Annette>我一直注意着监护仪
<9-6,Annette>I watched the monitors. Made sure

280
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,620
<9-6,Annette>保证他的血氧量大于90
<9-6,Annette>his O2 sats were over 90.

281
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,680
<9-6,Annette>我不会伤害他
<9-6,Annette>I would never hurt him.

282
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,270
<9-7,House>那你为什么要这么做
<9-7,House>Then what was the point?

283
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,650
<9-8,Annette>哈维很烦躁
<9-8,Annette>Harvey was upset.

284
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,280
<9-8,Annette>他想平静下来
<9-8,Annette>He needed to calm down--

285
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,250
<9-8,Annette>通过被控制而得到一种控制感
<9-8,Annette>to feel in control by being controlled.

286
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,040
<9-9,Cuddy>他出钱让你这么做的吗
<9-9,Cuddy>He pays you for this?

287
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,060
<9-10,Annette>作为回报  他帮我上税  打扫房子
<9-10,Annette>In return, he does my taxes and cleans my house.

288
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,750
<9-11,Cuddy>我们还没结束  还没谈完呢
<9-11,Cuddy>We're not done here. We have to talk.

289
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,720
<9-11,Cuddy>报警吧
<9-11,Cuddy>Call the cops.

290
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,710
<9-12,House>把她关起来  叫她把你的乳头穿个孔
<9-12,House>Bar her from the hospital. Force her to pierce your nipples.

291
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,390
<9-12,House>开玩笑而已  不是真的医嘱
<9-12,House>Not really medical decisions.

292
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,700
<10-1,Chase>很久以前
<10-1,Chase>It was a long time ago.

293
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,770
<10-1,Chase>我和这种女人约会过  一个银行家
<10-1,Chase>I was seeing this woman, a banker,

294
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,660
<10-1,Chase>结果发现她喜欢被火烧
<10-1,Chase>and, uh, turns out she liked to be burned.

295
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,020
<10-2,Cameron>你居然和一个喜欢被烧伤的人约过会
<10-2,Cameron>You actually dated someone who likes to get burned?

296
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
<10-3,Foreman>是啊  你为什么会喜欢上这种
<10-3,Foreman>Yeah, why would you want to be in a relationship...

297
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,040
<10-3,Foreman>明显只会带来痛苦的人
<10-3,Foreman>with someone that's so obviously only gonna lead to pain?

298
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,250
<10-5,Chase>-住嘴  -这确实很奇怪
<10-5,Chase>- Shut up. - It was a weird scene.

299
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,840
<10-5,Chase>-我注意到  -奇斯
<10-5,Chase>- I observed-- - Chase,

300
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,490
<10-6,House>你认识这女人  她是干什么的
<10-6,House>did you know about this woman, what she does?

301
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,920
<10-7,Chase>我在某类"特殊聚会"上见过她
<10-7,Chase>I met her at some parties, yeah.

302
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,720
<10-8,House>要是早知道你喜欢"受虐"
<10-8,House>I wouldn't have tortured you

303
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,500
<10-8,House>我就不折磨你了
<10-8,House>if I knew you liked it.

304
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,060
<10-8,House>有句名言你要谨记
<10-8,House>Well, here's a phrase to remember.

305
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,240
<10-8,House>这家伙的脑袋也许
<10-8,House>"Hey, this guy might have

306
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,200
<10-8,House>已经被人揍过N多次了
<10-8,House>been pounded on the head one too many times".

307
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,800
<10-9,Chase>我说了  这是由外伤引起的动脉瘤
<10-9,Chase>I said I thought it was a trauma-induced aneurysm.

308
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,660
<10-10,House>是啊  要是你早说病人喜欢受虐
<10-10,House>Yeah. Could have carried a tad more weight

309
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,670
<10-10,House>你的意见就会有点分量了
<10-10,House>if you'd mentioned the "Liking pain" Thing.

310
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,820
<10-10,House>你上了我的捣蛋名单
<10-10,House>You're on my naughty list.

311
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,480
<10-10,House>抱歉  今年圣诞节不送你听诊器了
<10-10,House>Sorry. No leather stethoscope this Christmas.

312
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
<10-12,House>-我并非喜欢...  -我估计
<10-12,House>- I'm not into--  - I assume you

313
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,190
<10-13,Cameron>你们还没给他用抗生素和血液稀释剂吧
<10-13,Cameron>never started him on antibiotics and blood thinners...

314
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,170
<10-14,House>[伊莎夫人  《残酷疯淫所》主人公
<10-14,House>代指施虐女王]

315
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,710
<10-12,House>是不是都被伊莎夫人的疯狂举动吓到了
<10-12,House>before Mistress Ilsa's rude interruption.

316
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,000
<10-13,Cameron>这也许是好事  因为...
<10-13,Cameron>That was probably a good thing, given--

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,250
<10-14,House>给他上抗生素和血液稀释剂
<10-14,House>Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners.

318
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,090
<10-15,Cameron>你还认为奇斯错了
<10-15,Cameron>You still think Chase is wrong?

319
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,300
<10-16,House>不  他可能是对的
<10-16,House>No, he's probably right.

320
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,150
<10-17,Chase>那我们应该给他安排血管手术
<10-17,Chase>Then we should schedule him for vascular surgery.

321
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,870
<10-17,Chase>切开颈动脉  找到动脉瘤  然后切除
<10-17,Chase>Go into the carotids, find the aneurysm, repair it.

322
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,580
<10-18,Cameron>如果用血液稀释剂  他可能会大出血
<10-18,Cameron>We put him on blood thinners, he might bleed out.

323
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,730
<10-19,House>但是如果福曼的细菌性心内膜炎
<10-19,House>But if Foreman's right about it

324
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,980
<10-19,House>诊断是正确的  那我们
<10-19,House>being bacterial endocarditis and we--

325
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,900
<10-20,Foreman>我觉得奇斯的诊断没错
<10-20,Foreman>I think Chase is right.

326
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,360
<10-21,House>好吧  假如福曼之前的血栓理论是对的
<10-21,House>Okay. If Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots...

327
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,950
<10-21,House>而我们进行手术
<10-21,House>and we take the surgery route,

328
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,270
<10-21,House>那人估计就会被我们弄死了
<10-21,House>we'll probably kill the guy.

329
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,120
<10-21,House>所以  给他注射血液稀释剂
<10-21,House>So start him on blood thinners,

330
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,820
<10-21,House>如果他再次中风  我们就安排手术
<10-21,House>and if he has another stroke, we'll schedule the surgery.

331
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,850
<10-22,Myron>-什么事  -你是豪斯医生
<10-22,Myron>- Yeah?  - You Dr. House?

332
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,580
<10-23,House>我预感到我承认就会后悔
<10-23,House>I have a feeling I'm gonna regret this,

333
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,530
<10-23,House>不过  正是在下
<10-23,House>but yes.

334
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,690
<10-24,Myron>瑞蒙娜说我该来找你再开些药
<10-24,Myron>Ramona said I should come to you for my refill.

335
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,270
<10-24,Myron>呃  那个...
<10-24,Myron>Uh, you know, the--

336
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,030
<10-24,Myron>"小枝条"开始软软地下垂了
<10-24,Myron>The wood's beginning to droop.

337
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,840
<10-24,Myron>她说你可能会先跟我谈谈
<10-24,Myron>She said you'd probably want to talk to me first.

338
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,590
<10-25,House>她骗你呢
<10-25,House>She lied.

339
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,970
<10-25,House>给你
<10-25,House>Here you go.

340
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,590
<10-26,Myron>谢谢
<10-26,Myron>Thanks.

341
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,330
<10-27,House>我一向助人为乐  再见
<10-27,House>Always happy to make people happy. Good-bye.

342
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,520
<10-28,Myron>我不知道我还能再坚持多久
<10-28,Myron>Uh, I don't know how much more of this I can take.

343
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,280
<10-29,House>-坚持什么  -做爱
<10-29,House>- Much more of what? - Sex.

344
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,200
<10-31,House>你不想再做爱了吗
<10-31,House>You don't want more sex?

345
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,370
<10-32,Myron>我都没力气打高尔夫了
<10-32,Myron>My golf swing is all messed up.

346
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,140
<10-33,House>最根本的解决方法  跟她谈谈
<10-33,House>Hey, here's a radical thought. Talk to her.

347
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,490
<10-35,House>-说实话吗  -实话实说很困难吗
<10-35,House>- The truth? - Sounds crazy when you put it like that.

348
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,520
<10-36,Myron>瑞蒙娜性欲旺盛啊
<10-36,Myron>Ramona's got a big appetite.

349
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
<10-36,Myron>如果我不做
<10-36,Myron>If I don't perform--

350
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,160
<10-36,Myron>我不想失去她
<10-36,Myron>I don't want to lose her.

351
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,060
<10-36,Myron>你这儿有药房吗
<10-36,Myron>You got a pharmacy around here?

352
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,370
<10-37,House>在医院吗  应该吧
<10-37,House>In the hospital? Could be.

353
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,880
<10-37,House>看看我们能不能找到
<10-37,House>Let's see if we can find it.

354
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,360
<11-1,House>有蓝色小药片吗
<11-1,House>Got any blue pills?

355
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,650
<11-2,Pharmacist>你是找治疗勃起障碍的那种药吗
<11-2,Pharmacist>You looking for E.D. Medication?

356
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,180
<11-3,House>那只是一种蓝色药片
<11-3,House>Well, that's one example of a blue pill.

357
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,250
<11-3,House>再另外说六个
<11-3,House>Name six others.

358
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,370
<11-4,Pharmacist>有一种止痛片也是蓝色的
<11-4,Pharmacist>There's a brand of acetaminophen--

359
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,130
<11-5,House>很好  把这装满
<11-5,House>Perfect. Fill  her up.

360
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,280
<11-6,Cuddy>豪斯医生
<11-6,Cuddy>Dr. House.

361
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,480
<11-7,House>正忙呢
<11-7,House>Little busy here.

362
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,210
<11-8,Cuddy>我听说了卡梅隆医生回来工作的条件
<11-8,Cuddy>I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions for coming back to work.

363
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,530
<11-9,House>纯属公事  我会把小票给你的
<11-9,House>It's purely business. I'll make sure you get the receipt.

364
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,330
<11-9,House>我倒觉得这是个好事
<11-9,House>Well, I think it's a good thing.

365
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,800
<11-10,Cuddy>虽然你的上段感情惨淡收场
<11-10,Cuddy>What happened in your last relationship,

366
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,610
<11-10,Cuddy>但你不能永远拒人于千里之外
<11-10,Cuddy>it's no reason to wall yourself off from people forever.

367
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
<11-10,Cuddy>5年自怨自艾的生活也许足够了
<11-10,Cuddy>Five years of self-pity is probably enough.

368
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,580
<11-11,House>哇  您的话犹如醍醐灌顶啊
<11-11,House>Wow. You've certainly given me a lot to think about.

369
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,910
<11-11,House>如果我也能像你这么"开放"的话
<11-11,House>If only I was as open as you.

370
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,500
<11-13,House>其实我说的是你的衬衫
<11-13,House>Actually, it was your blouse I was talking about.

371
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,630
<11-14,Cuddy>记住
<11-14,Cuddy>Bear in mind,

372
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,330
<11-14,Cuddy>卡梅隆也许是唯一受得了你的女人
<11-14,Cuddy>Cameron's probably the only female who could tolerate you.

373
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,450
<11-14,Cuddy>穿那件天蓝的衬衫去
<11-14,Cuddy>Wear the sky-blue shirt.

374
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,720
<11-14,Cuddy>你穿那件很帅
<11-14,Cuddy>It almost makes you look nice.

375
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,210
<12-1,Harvey>他们说她不能再到医院来
<12-1,Harvey>They said she couldn't come back into the hospital.

376
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,230
<12-1,Harvey>他们不让我见她
<12-1,Harvey>They won't let me see her.

377
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,930
<12-2,Chase>哈维  她没被拘捕你就该庆幸了
<12-2,Chase>Harvey, you're lucky she wasn't arrested.

378
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,200
<12-2,Chase>在医院里这么干  你在想什么啊
<12-2,Chase>What were you thinking, doing that at a hospital?

379
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,200
<12-2,Chase>抓住我的手指
<12-2,Chase>Squeeze my fingers?

380
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,210
<12-3,Harvey>我很害怕
<12-3,Harvey>I was scared.

381
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,130
<12-4,Chase>你两只手都用力
<12-4,Chase>I'll need you to squeeze with both hands.

382
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,910
<12-5,Harvey>我都使劲了呀
<12-5,Harvey>I am.

383
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,320
<12-5,Harvey>右臂和右手无力
<12-5,Harvey>Weakness in his right arm and hand.

384
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,070
<12-5,Harvey>哈维患了小中风
<12-5,Harvey>Harvey's having mini-strokes.

385
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,540
<13-1,Chase>血液稀释剂没有起效
<13-1,Chase>The blood thinners aren't making a difference.

386
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,690
<13-2,House>停止治疗
<13-2,House>Stop the treatment.

387
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,540
<13-2,House>抱歉  你的方法我们试过了
<13-2,House>Sorry. We tried your way.

388
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,170
<13-2,House>你大错特错
<13-2,House>You could not have been "Wronger".

389
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,670
<13-3,Foreman>-我说奇斯可能是对的  -是啊
<13-3,Foreman>- I said Chase was probably right.  - Oh, yeah.

390
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,790
<13-4,House>马后炮谁都会放
<13-4,House>We've all got perfect 20/20 hindsight.

391
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,470
<13-4,House>尽快准备血管手术
<13-4,House>Get ahold of may in Vascular.

392
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,960
<13-4,House>看看明天主刀医生有没有空
<13-4,House>See if his surgical dance card is free for tomorrow.

393
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,020
<13-5,Cameron>关于明天晚上
<13-5,Cameron>About tomorrow night.

394
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,560
<13-6,House>你怎么这么大嘴巴
<13-6,House>You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

395
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,870
<13-7,Cameron>没必要保密呀
<13-7,Cameron>I didn't see any reason to.

396
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,390
<13-7,Cameron>我们要去哪里  我想打扮的得体些
<13-7,Cameron>Where are we going? I want to make sure I dress appropriately.

397
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,500
<13-8,House>穿个军靴和T恤好了
<13-8,House>That would be army boots and T-shirt.

398
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,950
<13-8,House>去参加彩蛋球比赛[军事模拟战]
<13-8,House>It's the county paint ball tourney.

399
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,210
<13-8,House>头奖50美金
<13-8,House>First prize is 50 bucks.

400
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,920
<13-8,House>如果你能坚持到底  奖金分你一半
<13-8,House>I'll split it with you if you hold your end up.

401
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,640
<13-9,Cameron>我想我们当初不是这么说的吧
<13-9,Cameron>I'm not sure that was the deal.

402
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,620
<13-10,House>放轻松  我已经在斯波莱托餐馆定了座
<13-10,House>Relax. I made a reservation at Cafe Spoleto.

403
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,690
<13-10,House>说到着装
<13-10,House>Regarding wardrobe,

404
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,090
<13-10,House>你是不是太小  没听说过氨纶
<13-10,House>are you too young to remember spandex?

405
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,290
<13-11,Cameron>我还是自己解决吧
<13-11,Cameron>I'll figure something out.

406
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,120
<14-1,Chase>手术会修复你颈部受损的血管
<14-1,Chase>The surgery will repair the damaged blood vessels in your neck,

407
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,520
<14-1,Chase>你就不会再中风了
<14-1,Chase>and your strokes will stop.

408
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,210
<14-2,Harvey>这都是因为勒脖子引起的吗
<14-2,Harvey>All this is because of the strangulation?

409
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,880
<14-3,Chase>很可能是
<14-3,Chase>More like strangulations.

410
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,820
<14-4,Harvey>我父母说的没错
<14-4,Harvey>My parents are right.

411
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,130
<14-4,Harvey>我是个败类
<14-4,Harvey>I'm a loser.

412
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,070
<14-4,Harvey>我  我不知道
<14-4,Harvey>I don't -- I don't know what--

413
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,960
<14-4,Harvey>我不知道该干什么  我要
<14-4,Harvey>I don't know what to do. I need to--

414
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,780
<14-5,Chase>哈维  冷静
<14-5,Chase>Harvey, calm down.

415
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,740
<14-6,Harvey>我要和安妮特谈谈
<14-6,Harvey>I need to talk to Annette.

416
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,990
<14-7,Chase>你自己能决定
<14-7,Chase>You can do this on your own.

417
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,960
<14-8,Harvey>-手术只是...  -她恨我
<14-8,Harvey>- Surgery's the only-- - She hates me.

418
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,800
<14-8,Harvey>我一直打她电话  一直打
<14-8,Harvey>I've been calling. I've been calling and she--

419
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,250
<14-8,Harvey>她就是不接
<14-8,Harvey>She's not picking up.

420
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,730
<14-9,Chase>哈维  你不需要
<14-9,Chase>Harvey, you don't need--

421
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,800
<14-10,Harvey>我做不到  做不到
<14-10,Harvey>I can't. I can't.

422
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,120
<14-11,Chase>哈维  照我说的做
<14-11,Chase>Harvey, you will do what I say.

423
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,120
<14-12,Harvey>我不想做手术
<14-12,Harvey>I don't want surgery.

424
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,930
<14-13,Chase>把同意书签了  签字
<14-13,Chase>Sign the consent. Sign it!

425
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,960
<14-14,Harvey>我什么都做不了
<14-14,Harvey>I can't do anything.

426
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,720
<14-14,Harvey>不手术  不要手术
<14-14,Harvey>No surgery. No surgery!

427
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,110
<14-14,Harvey>我不做手术
<14-14,Harvey>No surgery!

428
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,870
<15-1,Cameron>给他用抗抑郁药
<15-1,Cameron>We could give him antidepressants.

429
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,080
<15-1,Cameron>看看他会不会改主意
<15-1,Cameron>See if he changes his mind.

430
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,740
<15-2,Chase>已经试过了  我把药混在苹果汁里了
<15-2,Chase>I already did. Mashed 'em up in his apple sauce.

431
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,220
<15-2,Chase>应该很快就会见效的
<15-2,Chase>It'll lighten him up soon enough.

432
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,520
<15-3,House>最好有人能直接叫他同意手术
<15-3,House>Someone should just tell him to do it.

433
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,730
<15-3,House>这样快得多
<15-3,House>Way faster.

434
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,680
<15-4,Cameron>伪造签名也很快  但这是违法的
<15-4,Cameron>So's forgery-- also illegal.

435
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,300
<15-5,Chase>-我也试过了  -不是你
<15-5,Chase>- And I already tried. - Not you.

436
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,400
<15-6,House>当你渴望被虐的时候  上哪儿去找施虐狂
<15-6,House>Where's a good dominatrix when you need one?

437
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,050
<15-7,Chase>安妮特被禁止进入医院
<15-7,Chase>Annette's barred from the hospital.

438
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,200
<15-8,House>万一你也被抓
<15-8,House>If you get caught,

439
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,870
<15-8,House>我透露个小秘密给你  卡迪有把梳子
<15-8,House>Cuddy's got a hairbrush,

440
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,600
<15-8,House>并且那把梳子她还有别的"妙用"
<15-8,House>and believe me, she knows how to use it.

441
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,060
<16-1,Harvey>他们让你回来了
<16-1,Harvey>They let you come back.

442
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,980
<16-2,Annette>不是因为你表现好
<16-2,Annette>Not because you deserve it.

443
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
<16-2,Annette>你太不听话了
<16-2,Annette>You've been bad.

444
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,630
<16-2,Annette>你必须做这个手术  明白吗
<16-2,Annette>You will have the surgery. Do you understand?

445
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,690
<16-2,Annette>不
<16-2,Annette>No.

446
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,980
<16-2,Annette>别嬉皮笑脸的
<16-2,Annette>Do not laugh at me.

447
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,040
<16-2,Annette>你该尊敬我
<16-2,Annette>You will respect me.

448
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,190
<16-3,Harvey>你算老几来  竟然来教我该怎么做
<16-3,Harvey>Where do you get off telling me what to do?

449
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,680
<16-3,Harvey>给我滚出去  你这个老巫婆
<16-3,Harvey>Get out of my room, you bag-faced witch.

450
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,560
<16-4,Foreman>他们平时也是这么对话的吗
<16-4,Foreman>Is this a part of their deal?

451
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,830
<16-5,Annette>这不像他
<16-5,Annette>This isn't like him.

452
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,350
<16-6,Harvey>-有点不对劲  -滚出去
<16-6,Harvey>- Something's wrong. - Get out!

453
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,780
<16-6,Harvey>出去  出去  滚出去
<16-6,Harvey>Get out! Get out! Get out!

454
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,360
<16-6,Harvey>出去
<16-6,Harvey>Get out!

455
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,710
<16-7,Foreman>情绪波动  他又中风了
<16-7,Foreman>Emotional swings-, he's having another stroke.

456
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,450
<16-7,Foreman>哈维
<16-7,Foreman>Harvey!

457
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,200
<16-8,Chase>他不行了  这里需要急救推车
<16-8,Chase>He's crashing. Can we get a cart in here?

458
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,380
<17-1,Lawyer>怎么回事  你把这家伙吓得两次中风吗
<17-1,Lawyer>So what's that? Two strokes you've scared this guy into?

459
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,210
<17-1,Lawyer>没错
<17-1,Lawyer>Yeah.

460
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,520
<17-2,House>因此我开始怀疑自己与人交往的能力
<17-2,House>It's making me question my view of myself as a people person.

461
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,420
<17-3,Lawyer>现在你想不经过他同意就给他做手术吗
<17-3,Lawyer>Now you want to do surgery on him without his consent?

462
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,300
<17-4,Cuddy>那孩子已经昏迷了  他需要手术
<17-4,Cuddy>The kid's in a coma. He needs the surgery.

463
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,590
<17-5,Lawyer>他说了不做  我们不能做
<17-5,Lawyer>He said no. We can't do it.

464
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,650
<17-6,House>紧急情况  我们得特事特办
<17-6,House>Emergent situation. We invoke heroic measures.

465
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,720
<17-7,Lawyer>你需要一纸法院指令
<17-7,Lawyer>You need a court order.

466
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,680
<17-8,House>好啊  我要去哪弄
<17-8,House>Great. Where do I get me one of them?

467
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,920
<17-8,House>我要请个律师吗
<17-8,House>Do I need to lawyer up?

468
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,580
<17-9,Lawyer>我要向法官提供一份他直系亲属的同意书
<17-9,Lawyer>I'll need to show the judge an affidavit from next of kin.

469
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,990
<17-10,House>找他们签名可有点困难了
<17-10,House>They might have a problem signing anything,

470
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,320
<17-10,House>因为他们已经死了
<17-10,House>seeing as how they're dead.

471
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,440
<17-11,Lawyer>那要提供死亡证明
<17-11,Lawyer>He'll want proof.

472
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,980
<17-12,House>比如什么  他老爸的一只手吗
<17-12,House>Like what, Dad's hand?

473
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,920
<17-12,House>我连他们葬在哪里搜不知道
<17-12,House>I don't even know where they're buried.

474
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,570
<17-13,Lawyer>那给我一份讣告
<17-13,Lawyer>Bring me a published obit,

475
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,630
<17-13,Lawyer>或者是死亡证明  我去试试
<17-13,Lawyer>or death certificate, and we'll run with it.

476
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,210
<17-13,Lawyer>我可不想你连累我们
<17-13,Lawyer>I don't want you to mess up your clothes.

477
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,950
<18-1,Cameron>他的父母都是会计
<18-1,Cameron>His parents were accountants.

478
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,620
<18-1,Cameron>也许金融类报纸上会有讣告
<18-1,Cameron>Maybe there's an obit in the trade papers.

479
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,810
<18-2,Chase>他住在马克特镇
<18-2,Chase>Guy lives in Market Town.

480
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,550
<18-2,Chase>我不知道他是不是在那里长大
<18-2,Chase>I don't know if he grew up there,

481
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,170
<18-2,Chase>但我们可以去当地的殡仪馆查查
<18-2,Chase>but we could check the local funeral homes.

482
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,250
<18-3,House>很好  当你无功而返的时候
<18-3,House>Great, and when your searches turn up nothing,

483
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,770
<18-3,House>你就该去查查他们住在哪里
<18-3,House>you should try and find where they live.

484
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,330
<18-4,Foreman>他说他们已经死了
<18-4,Foreman>He said they were dead.

485
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,970
<18-5,House>会计可是高收入群体
<18-5,House>Accountants are usually pretty good with money,

486
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,350
<18-5,House>他怎么可能住在马克特那种贫民窟
<18-5,House>so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?

487
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,730
<18-6,Cameron>也许他们业务不精  收入低廉
<18-6,Cameron>Maybe they were bad accountants.

488
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,190
<18-7,House>糟糕的亚洲会计会远渡重洋来到美国吗
<18-7,House>Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim?

489
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,400
<18-7,House>简直是天方夜谭吧
<18-7,House>The odds are astronomical.

490
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,950
<18-8,Foreman>也许哈维把钱挥霍一空了
<18-8,Foreman>Maybe Harvey burned through their money.

491
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,100
<18-9,Chase>也许他们在发现他的特殊癖好后
<18-9,Chase>Or maybe they cut him off

492
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,870
<18-9,Chase>剥夺了他的继承权
<18-9,Chase>when they found out about his proclivities.

493
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,240
<18-10,House>我肯定没猜错  去他的公寓
<18-10,House>Gotta be my bet. Go to his apartment.

494
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,730
<18-10,House>看看能不能找到他的父母
<18-10,House>See if you can find his folks.

495
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,660
<18-10,House>号码  地址  等等
<18-10,House>Number, address, something.

496
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,870
<18-11,Foreman>能跟你谈谈吗
<18-11,Foreman>Hey. Can I talk to you?

497
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,590
<18-12,House>当然
<18-12,House>Sure.

00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,320
<18-13,Foreman>听着  卡梅隆是我们的朋友
<18-13,Foreman>Look. Cameron's a friend.

499
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,800
<18-13,Foreman>约会这事...
<18-13,Foreman>This whole dating--

<18-14,House>Time's up. Thanks for playing.

501
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,160
<18-15,Foreman>说到约会  我可比你有经验的多
<18-15,Foreman>Hey, I've been on the scene more than you recently.

502
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,200
<18-16,House>你差远了
<18-16,House>Way ahead of you.

503
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,260
<18-16,House>我准备了一箱麦芽酒
<18-16,House>I got a case of malt liquor stashed in the trunk.

<18-16,House>我们会进展得很顺利  你可以走了
<18-16,House>We are gonna get all the way down. Now move.

506
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,090
<18-17,Foreman>得了吧  你又不爱她
<18-17,Foreman>Come on. You're not into her.

507
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,760
<18-17,Foreman>大多数男人对某个女人没兴趣时
<18-17,Foreman>Most guys who aren't interested in a woman

508
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,940
<18-17,Foreman>都会表现得彬彬有礼
<18-17,Foreman>try to sugar coat it, be nice.

509
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,800
<18-18,House>你真是太了解我了
<18-18,House>Oh, you know me too well.

510
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,850
<18-19,Foreman>我就是这意思
<18-19,Foreman>That's what I'm saying.

511
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,810
<18-19,Foreman>我觉得你还是不要压抑自己的本性
<18-19,Foreman>I think you should go with your instincts here.

512
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,780
<18-19,Foreman>好好当个混蛋吧
<18-19,Foreman>Be a jerk.

513
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,340
<18-20,House>我不看电视剧  就为了听你说这个
<18-20,House>I'm missing my soap for this?

514
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,580
<18-21,Foreman>女人总希望自己是对的
<18-21,Foreman>Women love to be right.

515
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,880
<18-21,Foreman>你要让她们有种优越感
<18-21,Foreman>You gotta leave 'em feeling superior,

516
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,170
<18-21,Foreman>就像刚躲过一颗子弹
<18-21,Foreman>like they dodged a bullet.

517
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,140
<18-21,Foreman>但是如果你太和善  她会责怪自己
<18-21,Foreman>But if you're nice, she'll blame herself--

518
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,100
<18-22,House>然后爱我更深
<18-22,House>And fall for me even more.

519
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,770
<18-22,House>爱情医生刚刚阐述了
<18-22,House>The love doctor has made an art

520
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,250
<18-22,House>和女人分手的艺术
<18-22,House>out of breaking up with women...

521
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,450
<18-22,House>因为你坚信
<18-22,House>'cause you're convinced that

522
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,580
<18-22,House>任何女人都无法承受你的离去
<18-22,House>the loss of you would be too devastating for any woman to handle.

523
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,910
<18-23,Foreman>是啊  只有我如此自大
<18-23,Foreman>Yeah. I'm the one with the serious ego problem here.

524
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,380
<18-23,Foreman>我只想说
<18-23,Foreman>I'm just saying...

525
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,250
<18-23,Foreman>有些感情根本不应该开始

529
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,310
<19-4,Chase>安妮特情妇
<19-4,Chase>Mistress Annette.

530
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,560
<19-4,Chase>你要靠勒索才能跟豪斯约会
<19-4,Chase>You had to extort a date out of House.

531
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,760
<19-4,Chase>你不觉得这是个不好的预兆吗
<19-4,Chase>You don't think that's a bad sign?

532
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,130
<19-4,Chase>卡梅隆

544
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,400
<20-3,Chase>他挂了
<20-3,Chase>He hung up.

545
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,850
<20-4,Foreman>你跟他说了为什么要找他吗
<20-4,Foreman>You tell him why you were calling?

<20-7,House>帕克先生吗  我是新泽西州
<20-7,House>Mr. Park? This is Dr. House calling...

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,900
<20-7,House>普林斯顿普波教学医院的豪斯医生
<20-7,House>from Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,990
<20-7,House>你儿子哈维已经死了
<20-7,House>Your son Harvey is dead.

552
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,300
<20-7,House>我们需要你来认尸
<20-7,House>We need you to identify the body.

553
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,850
<20-7,House>是的  我很遗憾  法律规定
<20-7,House>Yes. I'm sorry. It's the law.

554
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,940
<20-7,House>好的
<20-7,House>Okay.

555
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,570
<20-7,House>这才是传达噩耗的艺术
<20-7,House>There's a real art to delivering bad news.

556
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,630
<20-8,Cameron>他们会直接去太平间的
<20-8,Cameron>They're gonna show up at the morgue.

557
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,370
<20-9,House>卡迪发飙的时候通知我
<20-9,House>Be sure and let me know when Cuddy starts screaming.

558
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,440
<21-1,Cuddy>你骗了他们
<21-1,Cuddy>You lied to them!

559
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,140
<21-1,Cuddy>他说我们的儿子死了
<21-1,Cuddy>He told us our son was dead.

560
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,650
<21-2,House>那只是善意的谎言
<21-2,House>It's only a white lie.

561
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,460
<21-2,House>准确地说  我只是提前通知他们而已
<21-2,House>Technically, all I did was call them a little early.

562
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,320
<21-2,House>相信我  他很快就要死了
<21-2,House>Trust me. He'll be dead real soon.

563
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,510
<21-2,House>实际上  我还替你们省了堵车的时间
<21-2,House>Actually, I saved you some rush hour traffic.

564
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,490
<21-2,House>我要打给我的律师
<21-2,House>I'm calling our lawyer.

565
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,330
<21-3,House>行  只要你签了手术同意书
<21-3,House>Fine. Just as soon as you've signed the surgery consent.

566
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,530
<21-3,House>我有笔
<21-3,House>I have a pen.

567
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,180
<21-3,House>我是玛丽莲·帕克  要找马克·莱纳
<21-3,House>Marilyn Park for Mark Lerner.

568
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,300
<21-4,Cuddy>好的  我等着
<21-4,Cuddy>Yes, I'll hold.

569
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,230
<21-4,Cuddy>哈维是你的儿子  我相信你还关心他
<21-4,Cuddy>Harvey's your son. I'm sure you still care about him.

570
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,820
<21-4,Cuddy>他令我们颜面尽失
<21-4,Cuddy>He humiliated us.

571
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,940
<21-5,House>所有人都知道他的...特殊癖好
<21-5,House>Everybody we know knows about his... perversion.

572
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,910
<21-5,House>但你面对困窘的方式跟你儿子不一样
<21-5,House>But you don't get off on embarrassment the way your son does.

573
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,320
<21-5,House>[embarrassment  双关
<21-5,House>指困窘  也指呼吸困难]

574
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,390
<21-5,House>我猜  这也许是隔代遗传吧
<21-5,House>My guess, maybe it skips a generation.

575
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,340
<21-6,Lawyer>你们要多少赔偿金
<21-6,Lawyer>How much money would it take to compensate you--

576
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,710
<21-7,House>你们可以等会再讨价还价  但问题是
<21-7,House>Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute, but here's the thing.

577
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,530
<21-7,House>耻辱分很多种
<21-7,House>Humiliation comes in all kinds of packages.

578
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,730
<21-7,House>被人发现你儿子是性变态
<21-7,House>People finding out that your son's a perv.

579
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,660
<21-7,House>这确是一种奇耻大辱
<21-7,House>That's pretty high up there.

580
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,140
<21-7,House>但如果人们发现你坐视不理自己的儿子死去
<21-7,House>People finding out that you'd rather let your son die...

581
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,440
<21-7,House>也不愿签一纸文书
<21-7,House>than sign a piece of paper--

582
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,070
<21-7,House>哪个比较严重
<21-7,House>Where's that rank?

583
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,560
<21-7,House>相信我
<21-7,House>Trust me,

584
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,030
<21-7,House>必要时我会在宾州的每一家美甲店
<21-7,House>if I have to paste up a sign... in every nail salon

585
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,410
<21-7,House>和饺子店里贴上标语
<21-7,House>and dumpling shop in Pennsylvania,

586
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,140
<21-7,House>弄得人尽皆知
<21-7,House>I'll make sure they know.

587
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,650
<21-7,House>明天一早你们的儿子就会上手术台了
<21-7,House>Your son will be in surgery first thing in the morning.

588
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,130
<21-7,House>饺子店  这招够狠
<21-7,House>Dumplings. That was a cheap shot.

589
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,990
<22-1,Wilson>嘿  你现在...
<22-1,Wilson>Hi. Are you, uh--

590
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,720
<22-1,Wilson>我们能谈谈吗
<22-1,Wilson>Can we talk?

591
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,000
<22-2,Cameron>好啊  我倒想知道关于什么事
<22-2,Cameron>Gee, I wonder what this is gonna be about.

592
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,890
<22-3,Wilson>我只想确保没人会受伤
<22-3,Wilson>I just want to make sure no one gets hurt.

593
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,460
<22-4,Cameron>我会没事的
<22-4,Cameron>I will be fine.

594
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,590
<22-4,Cameron>你们让我觉得我像是要跟开膛手杰克去约会
<22-4,Cameron>Everybody's acting like I'm going out with Jack the Ripper.

595
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,520
<22-5,Wilson>不是  我担心的不是你
<22-5,Wilson>Oh. It's not-- It's not you I'm worried about.

596
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,840
<22-5,Wilson>他已经很久没有向别人敞开心扉  我
<22-5,Wilson>It's been a long time since he opened up to someone, and I--

597
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,880
<22-5,Wilson>你最好能肯定你确实想跟他在一起
<22-5,Wilson>You better be absolutely sure you want this,

598
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,420
<22-5,Wilson>因为如果他再一次敞开心扉而又受到伤害
<22-5,Wilson>because if he opens up again and gets hurt--

599
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,410
<22-5,Wilson>他可能永远也不会对他人敞开心扉了
<22-5,Wilson>I don't think there's gonna be a next time.

600
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,840
<22-6,Cameron>你担心我会伤他的心
<22-6,Cameron>You're worried I'm gonna break his heart?

601
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,170
<23-1,Wilson>宽的那端太短了
<23-1,Wilson>The wide side's too short.

602
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,320
<23-1,Wilson>活像娄·科斯特洛[喜剧演员]
<23-1,Wilson>You're gonna look like Lou Costello.

603
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,450
<23-2,House>这就是个错误
<23-2,House>This is a mistake.

604
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,990
<23-2,House>我根本就不知道该怎样闲聊
<23-2,House>I don't know how to have casual conversation.

605
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,800
<23-2,House>你以为自己言之有物
<23-2,House>You think you're talking about one thing,

606
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,590
<23-2,House>可就算你没说废话  内容也无聊透顶
<23-2,House>and either you are, and it's incredibly boring,

607
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,040
<23-2,House>何况你根本就是想表达一些弦外之音
<23-2,House>or you're not because there's a subtext,

608
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,980
<23-2,House>还得多费唇舌解释才能明白
<23-2,House>and you need a decoder ring.

609
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,780
<23-3,Wilson>为她开门  为她拉椅
<23-3,Wilson>Open doors for her. Help her with her chair.

610
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,330
<23-4,House>我又不是没约会过
<23-4,House>I have been on a date.

611
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,080
<23-5,Wilson>那已经是很多年前的事了
<23-5,Wilson>Not since disco died.

612
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,460
<23-5,Wilson>夸夸她的鞋子和耳坠
<23-5,Wilson>Comment on her shoes, her earrings,

613
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,540
<23-5,Wilson>然后开始谈D.H.A.
<23-5,Wilson>and then move on to D.H.A.

614
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,490
<23-5,Wilson>她的梦想  希望和抱负[首字母DHA]
<23-5,Wilson>Her dreams, hopes and aspirations.

615
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,870
<23-5,Wilson>相信我  就是这么简单【】
<23-5,Wilson>Trust me. Panty peeler.

616
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,400
<23-5,Wilson>需要套套的话我可以给你几个
<23-5,Wilson>And if you need condoms, I've got some.

617
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,190
<23-6,House>你老婆给你的吗
<23-6,House>Did your wife give them to you?

618
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,100
<23-7,Wilson>售药处给的
<23-7,Wilson>Drug rep.

619
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,230
<23-7,Wilson>他们在里面加了些抗体
<23-7,Wilson>They've got antibiotics built in somehow.

620
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,660
<23-8,House>我该取消约会的
<23-8,House>I should cancel.

621
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,790
<23-8,House>我有个病人明早要做手术
<23-8,House>I've got a patient in surgery tomorrow morning.

622
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,220
<23-9,Wilson>你又不是执刀医生
<23-9,Wilson>And if you were a surgeon,

623
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,580
<23-9,Wilson>有什么关系
<23-9,Wilson>that would actually matter.

624
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,460
<23-9,Wilson>不错的主意  缓解紧张
<23-9,Wilson>That's a good idea. Settle your nerves.

625
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,620
<23-9,Wilson>也给我来一瓶啤酒吧
<23-9,Wilson>Get me a beer too.

626
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,430
<23-10,House>不是啤酒
<23-10,House>No beer.

627
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
<23-11,Wilson>你在晚餐前还要吃东西吗
<23-11,Wilson>You're gonna eat before dinner?

628
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,600
<23-12,House>这很逊  不是吗
<23-12,House>This is pretty lame, right?

629
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,090
<23-13,Wilson>我觉得她喜欢这套
<23-13,Wilson>I think she likes lame.

630
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,040
<24-1,Cameron>很漂亮
<24-1,Cameron>It's beautiful.

631
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,870
<24-1,Cameron>你看起来也很帅

<24-2,House>谢谢
<24-2,House>Thank you.

633
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,100
<24-3,Cameron>我一直都挺喜欢这餐厅的
<24-3,Cameron>I've always loved this restaurant.

634
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,290
<24-4,House>是啊  可现在变了不少
<24-4,House>Yeah. It's changed a lot

635
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,640
<24-4,House>跟我上次来这儿大有不同
<24-4,House>since the last time I was here.

636
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,750
<24-4,House>本来是个脱衣舞俱乐部的
<24-4,House>Used to be a strip joint.

637
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,610
<24-4,House>耳环不错
<24-4,House>Nice earrings.

638
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,580
<24-5,Cameron>这是我妈妈的  谢谢
<24-5,Cameron>My mom's. Thank you.

639
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,660
<24-6,House>鞋子也很好
<24-6,House>Nice shoes.

640
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,180
<24-6,House>穿着舒服吗
<24-6,House>Comfortable?

641
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,820
<24-7,Cameron>我并没有期待你变成另一个人
<24-7,Cameron>I'm not expecting you to be someone you're not.

642
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,080
<24-8,House>我们在餐馆里
<24-8,House>We're in a restaurant.

643
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,330
<24-8,House>正装出席  共进晚餐
<24-8,House>We're dressed up. We're eating.

644
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,870
<24-8,House>除了聊些鸡毛蒜皮的东西  还能干嘛
<24-8,House>Without small talk, what is there?

645
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,280
<24-9,Cameron>根据弗洛伊德的学说  他大意如此
<24-9,Cameron>According to Freud-- and I'm paraphrasing--

646
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,550
<24-9,Cameron>人们对某物的爱
<24-9,Cameron>the instinct of love toward an object

647
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,640
<24-9,Cameron>是通过支配与占有而实现的
<24-9,Cameron>demands a mastery to obtain it,

648
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,240
<24-9,Cameron>如果他发现自己无法控制那东西
<24-9,Cameron>and if a person feels they can't control the object,

649
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,450
<24-9,Cameron>或感觉受到它的威胁
<24-9,Cameron>or feel threatened by it,

650
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,130
<24-9,Cameron>他们将会作出消极的回应
<24-9,Cameron>they act negatively toward it.

651
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,780
<24-9,Cameron>比如一个8年级男生去打一个小女生
<24-9,Cameron>Like an eighth-grade boy punching a girl.

652
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,250
<24-10,House>我把你当成垃圾一样
<24-10,House>I treat you like garbage,

653
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,240
<24-10,House>所以我一定很喜欢你了
<24-10,House>so I must really like you.

654
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,790
<24-10,House>根据你的弗洛伊德理论
<24-10,House>Given your Freudian theory,

655
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,610
<24-10,House>要是我开始对你好又意味着什么
<24-10,House>what does it mean if I start being nice to you?

656
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,490
<24-11,Cameron>你开始正视你的内心了
<24-11,Cameron>That you're getting in touch with your feelings.

657
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,630
<24-12,House>所以我无论怎么做
<24-12,House>So there's absolutely nothing I can do

658
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,340
<24-12,House>你都会觉得我喜欢你
<24-12,House>to make you think that I don't like you?

659
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,360
<24-12,House>很抱歉  是的
<24-12,House>Sorry, no.

660
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,470
<24-13,Cameron>我只此一次机会与你共度一晚  唯一的一次
<24-13,Cameron>I have one evening with you-- one chance--

661
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,210
<24-13,Cameron>我不想把时间浪费在讨论
<24-13,Cameron>and I don't want to waste it talking about

662
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,840
<24-13,Cameron>你喜欢什么葡萄酒或讨厌什么电影上
<24-13,Cameron>what wines you like or what movies you hate.

663
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,600
<24-13,Cameron>我想知道你的感觉
<24-13,Cameron>I want to know how you feel.

664
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,690
<24-13,Cameron>对我的感觉
<24-13,Cameron>About me.

665
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,540
<24-14,House>你生活在错觉中
<24-14,House>You live under the delusion

666
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,020
<24-14,House>以为自己可以治愈一切不完美的东西
<24-14,House>that you can fix everything that isn't perfect.

667
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,560
<24-14,House>所以你嫁给一个
<24-14,House>That's why you married a man

668
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,230
<24-14,House>因癌症而垂死的男人
<24-14,House>who was dying of cancer.

669
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,420
<24-14,House>那不是爱  只是需要
<24-14,House>You don't love, you need.

670
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,700
<24-14,House>现在你丈夫去世了
<24-14,House>And now that your husband is dead,

671
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,980
<24-14,House>你又得找新的慈善对象
<24-14,House>you're looking for your new charity case.

672
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,710
<24-14,House>所以你才和我一起约会
<24-14,House>That's why you're going out with me.

673
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,520
<24-14,House>我年龄是你的两倍
<24-14,House>I'm twice your age.

674
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,970
<24-14,House>长得也不帅
<24-14,House>I'm not great-looking.

675
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,520
<24-14,House>还不迷人  甚至连脾气也很臭
<24-14,House>I'm not charming. I'm not even nice.

676
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,090
<24-14,House>你需要的就是这样的我
<24-14,House>What I am is what you need.

677
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,680
<24-14,House>支离破碎的我
<24-14,House>I'm damaged.

678
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,670
<25-1,Foreman>你迟到了  昨晚进行得如何
<25-1,Foreman>Came in late. Good time last night?

679
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,110
<25-2,Cameron>手术情况如何
<25-2,Cameron>How's the surgery going?

680
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,990
<25-3,Chase>哈维目前情况不错
<25-3,Chase>Harvey's doing fine so far.

681
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,470
<25-3,Chase>昨晚如何
<25-3,Chase>How'd the night go?

682
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,080
<25-4,Cameron>非常好  你过得怎样
<25-4,Cameron>It was fine. How was your evening?

683
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,160
<25-4,Cameron>她点了意式馄饨  我点了凤尾鱼
<25-4,Cameron>She had the ravioli. I had the puttanesca.

684
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,090
<26-1,House>是啊  接着说  你以为我要听你说食物呢
<26-1,House>Yes, I really want to know about the quality of the food.

685
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,510
<26-2,Wilson>如果不是情况好极了
<26-2,Wilson>Either something very good

686
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,210
<26-2,Wilson>就是彻底搞砸了  是哪种情况
<26-2,Wilson>happened or something very bad. Which is it?

687
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,920
<26-3,House>好吧  吃完饭我的确有点消化不良
<26-3,House>Well, I did have a little indigestion afterwards.

688
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,410
<26-3,House>可能是因为那个蒜蓉包
<26-3,House>Maybe it was the garlic bread.

689
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,400
<27-1,Cameron>要不然就是葡萄酒  让我眼睛有些浮肿
<27-1,Cameron>Or the wine. Something made my eyes puffy.

690
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,670
<27-2,Foreman>恐怕是因为捂着枕头哭吧
<27-2,Foreman>Crying in your pillow can do that.

691
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,240
<27-3,Cameron>绝对是因为葡萄酒
<27-3,Cameron>It was the wine.

692
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,010
<27-3,Cameron>我们聊天聊得很愉快
<27-3,Cameron>We had a nice candid conversation.

693
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,120
<28-1,House>没什么深入话题  就是在闲聊
<28-1,House>Nothing deep. Mostly small talk.

694
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,300
<28-2,Wilson>我就知道
<28-2,Wilson>I'm sure.

695
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,750
<28-3,House>照你说的那样  赞美了她的鞋子
<28-3,House>Took your advice. Complimented her shoes.

696
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,420
<28-3,House>就这个整整聊了15分钟
<28-3,House>That's 15 minutes of chat right there.

697
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,900
<28-3,House>尖酸刻薄的评论呢
<28-3,House>No snide comments?

698
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,670
<28-3,House>我觉得在聊到你们的时候是有一些
<28-3,House>I guess-- when we talked about you guys.

699
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,770
<30-1,Wilson>一句话说
<30-1,Wilson>Just answer one question.

700
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,240
<30-2,Foreman>你们会再约会吗
<30-2,Foreman>You two gonna do dinner again?

701
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,720
<30-3,House>我觉...得应该不会了
<30-3,House>I... don't think so.

702
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,480
<30-4,Cameron>我...不知道
<30-4,Cameron>I... don't know.

703
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,980
<30-5,Surgeon>孩子们  你们错了
<30-5,Surgeon>Hey, kids. You were wrong.

704
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,090
<30-5,Surgeon>没有动脉瘤  什么也没有
<30-5,Surgeon>No aneurysm, no nothin'.

705
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,090
<30-5,Surgeon>这家伙什么都没长
<30-5,Surgeon>This guy's clean.

706
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,740
<31-1,Chase>意味着我们完全不知道中风的原因
<31-1,Chase>Which means we've got no idea what's causing the strokes.

707
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,440
<31-2,Foreman>手术后他又发作了两次
<31-2,Foreman>He's had two more post-op.

708
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,120
<31-2,Foreman>要等到他清醒过来我们才能知道
<31-2,Foreman>We won't know the extent of the damage...

709
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,390
<31-2,Foreman>损伤有多严重
<31-2,Foreman>until he comes out of the coma--

710
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,610
<31-2,Foreman>如果他能醒过来的话
<31-2,Foreman>if he comes out.

711
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,300
<31-3,Cameron>可能我们该重新用血液稀释剂
<31-3,Cameron>Maybe we should go back to the blood thinners.

712
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,090
<31-3,Cameron>加大剂量
<31-3,Cameron>Up the dosage.

713
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,510
<31-4,House>如果不是血栓  过量的稀释剂
<31-4,House>If it's not clots, a loading dose of blood thinners

714
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,960
<31-4,House>会让他耳出血
<31-4,House>is gonna make him bleed out of his ears.

715
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,880
<31-4,House>这样他就聋了
<31-4,House>Then he won't be able to hear.

716
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,190
<31-4,House>没人在家  留言吧
<31-4,House>Nobody home. Leave a message.

717
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
<31-5,Myron>这很重要
<31-5,Myron>This is important.

718
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
<31-6,House>奇斯和卡梅隆  重做血管造影和超声波
<31-6,House>Chase, Cameron, get another angiogram and echo.

719
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,510
<31-6,House>做个全身扫描
<31-6,House>You better get a full body scan.

720
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,310
<31-6,House>如果真是血栓   最好确定它们的位置
<31-6,House>If it is clots, it'd be good to know where they are.

721
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,220
<31-6,House>非常抱歉
<31-6,House>Sorry about that.

722
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,630
<31-6,House>有病人快死了
<31-6,House>Guy dying.

723
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,700
<31-7,Ramona>你给玛艾隆的药根本没用
<31-7,Ramona>Those pills you gave Myron? They're not working.

724
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,050
<31-8,House>好吧  真高兴你们对这件事
<31-8,House>Well, good to see you've got

725
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,490
<31-8,House>有了个正确的认知
<31-8,House>the correct perspective on the thing.

726
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,610
<31-9,Myron>以前的药物让我感觉像树一样坚挺
<31-9,Myron>Well, the old ones, I mean, made me feel like a tree, you know?

727
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,970
<31-10,House>好比喻
<31-10,House>Nice visual.

728
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,900
<31-11,Myron>但是新的药物
<31-11,Myron>But the new ones,

729
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,800
<31-11,Myron>就跟吃糖豆差不多
<31-11,Myron>I might as well be eating candy.

730
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,630
<31-12,House>-糖豆可治不了你的头痛  -什么
<31-12,House>- Candy wouldn't take away your headaches. - What?

731
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,420
<31-13,Ramona>你来找我
<31-13,Ramona>You came to me and told me

732
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,940
<31-14,House>抱怨你们性生活太多
<31-14,House>you were having too much sex.

733
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,310
<31-16,House>-我没有  -你也一样  "大树"
<31-16,House>-I never did.  -You too, sequoia.

734
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,620
<31-17,Myron>那不是真的 我
<31-17,Myron>Well, no, that's not true. I--

735
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,840
<31-18,House>我知道谁都会说谎
<31-18,House>I know everybody lies,

736
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,990
<31-18,House>但你们共同生活了这么久
<31-18,House>but you'd think that after a certain amount of time together,

737
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,340
<31-18,House>不会还这么激情燃烧的
<31-18,House>you wouldn't be trying so hard.

738
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,340
<31-18,House>你们的婚戒不一样
<31-18,House>Your rings don't match.

739
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,120
<31-19,Ramona>为什么要一模一样
<31-19,Ramona>Why would they?

740
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,760
<31-20,House>风格是一回事
<31-20,House>The style is one thing,

741
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,800
<31-20,House>但一个银的一个金的就不对劲了
<31-20,House>but one silver, one gold?

742
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,280
<31-20,House>你们结婚多久了
<31-20,House>How long have you guys been married?

743
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,650
<31-21,Ramona>-55年  -49年
<31-21,Ramona>-Fifty-five years.  -Forty-nine years.

744
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,580
<31-23,House>该死  你们在搞外遇
<31-23,House>Damn it. You're having an affair.

745
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,380
<31-24,Ramona>你真的说过你想少做点爱吗
<31-24,Ramona>Did you really say you wanted to have less sex?

746
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,120
<31-25,Myron>只是少一点而已  要是我不想做
<31-25,Myron>Well, less. If I wanted none,

747
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,470
<31-25,Myron>我就会待在家里陪依斯瑟了
<31-25,Myron>I'd stay home with Esther.

748
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,280
<31-26,Ramona>我只是需要休息一下
<31-26,Ramona>I just need a little rest.

749
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,700
<31-27,House>你们俩不是蓝色小药丸的受害者
<31-27,House>You guys aren't the victims of the little blue pills,

750
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,780
<31-27,House>问题在于你们本身
<31-27,House>you're the problem.

751
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,510
<31-28,Myron>-我很抱歉  -我也是
<31-28,Myron>-I'm sorry. -Me too.

752
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,080
<31-29,Ramona>我该告诉你我的感受的
<31-29,Ramona>I should just have told you how I felt.

753
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,380
<31-30,House>欢迎来到地狱
<31-30,House>Oh, welcome to hell.

754
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,660
<31-31,Myron>药怎么办
<31-31,Myron>Uh, hey, how about the pills?

755
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,800
<31-32,House>看起来你们最好过几天没药的日子
<31-32,House>Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.

756
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,290
<32-1,House>奇斯医生  从昨天起
<32-1,House>Dr. Chase, these breath mints

757
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,950
<32-1,House>你就开始一个劲在吃薄荷糖
<32-1,House>you've been popping since yesterday--

758
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,380
<32-1,House>你迷恋上这玩意儿了吗
<32-1,House>are they a new fetish?

759
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,400
<32-2,Chase>我在哈维家找到的
<32-2,Chase>I found them at Harvey's.

760
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,430
<32-2,Chase>怎么了  我只拿了两盒
<32-2,Chase>What? I just took two boxes.

761
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,900
<32-2,Chase>那家伙有一整抽屉呢
<32-2,Chase>The guy's got a whole drawer of them.

762
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,380
<32-3,House>而你甚至不觉得这有趣吗
<32-3,House>And you didn't find that interesting?

763
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,830
<32-4,Chase>好吧  他那儿"有趣的东西"太多了
<32-4,Chase>Well, there's lots of interesting stuff in his place.

764
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,420
<32-4,Chase>薄荷糖实在不怎么起眼
<32-4,Chase>The mints weren't high up on the list.

765
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,970
<32-5,House>大错特错
<32-5,House>Wrong.

766
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,420
<33-1,House>奇斯  把鼻子伸过来
<33-1,House>Chase, get your nose in here.

767
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,290
<33-2,Chase>如果你是想让我难堪
<33-2,Chase>If you're trying to humiliate me,

768
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,060
<33-2,Chase>我告诉你
<33-2,Chase>I told you--

769
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,550
<33-3,House>来吧  伸鼻子
<33-3,House>Come on. Put your face in his mouth.

770
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,920
<33-5,House>挺浓郁的不是吗
<33-5,House>Rich, wouldn't you say?

771
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,840
<33-6,Chase>闻起来像放久了的呕吐物
<33-6,Chase>Smells like old vomit.

772
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,890
<33-7,House>爆发性骨髓炎的显要特征
<33-7,House>Number one sign of fulminating osteomyelitis.

773
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,610
<33-8,Cameron>下巴感染吗
<33-8,Cameron>Infection of the jaw?

774
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,320
<33-9,House>很可能是旧伤引起的
<33-9,House>Probably from the original break.

775
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,370
<33-9,House>从未被治愈
<33-9,House>Never healed properly.

776
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,280
<33-9,House>下巴的感染组织
<33-9,House>Infected tissue from the jaw...

<33-9,House>脱落下来  堵塞通向脑部的血流
<33-9,House>breaks off, blocks blood flow to the brain.

778
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,700
<33-9,House>没有血液  生命还如何维系正常
<33-9,House>And life just isn't worth living without blood.

779
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,020
<33-10,Foreman>金属盘使它无法显示在扫描中
<33-10,Foreman>It was hidden from the scans by the metal plate.

780
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,280
<33-11,Chase>而下巴部位的感染
<33-11,Chase>And an infection in the jaw

781
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,210
<33-11,Chase>也不太可能在血液中表现出来
<33-11,Chase>is unlikely to show up in blood tests.

782
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,710
<33-12,Cameron>-那我们要怎么确认  -像这样
<33-12,Cameron>-So how do we confirm? -Like this.

783
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,930
<33-13,House>女士们先生们  脓液
<33-13,House>Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus.

784
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,050
<33-13,House>我们要移除下巴
<33-13,House>We're gonna remove the jaw.

785
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,140
<33-13,House>你们谁有电锯吗  叫个外科医生吧
<33-13,House>Anybody got a buzz saw? Okay, call a surgeon.

786
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,020
<34-1,House>我是豪斯医生
<34-1,House>Hi. I'm Dr. House.

787
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,930
<34-1,House>易装的感觉如何啊  安妮特
<34-1,House>How's tricks, Annette?

788
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,910
<34-2,Annette>我只想看看他是否还好
<34-2,Annette>I just wanted to see if he was okay.

789
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,870
<34-2,Annette>我这就走
<34-2,Annette>I'll leave.

790
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,610
<34-3,House>没事  我是来跟你俩说话的
<34-3,House>It's okay. I came to talk to you both.

791
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,800
<34-3,House>像我对所有病人建议的那样
<34-3,House>Like I tell all my patients,

792
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,630
<34-3,House>你们最好停止窒息行为
<34-3,House>you've simply got to say no to strangulation.

793
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,370
<34-4,Annette>我自己是个怪胎
<34-4,Annette>Me, I'm a freak.

794
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,280
<34-3,House>没有疼痛我反而无法工作
<34-3,House>I get off on not being in pain.

795
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,890
<34-3,House>对了  还有巧克力糖衣的棉花糖
<34-3,House>That and chocolate-covered marshmallow bunny.

796
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,980
<34-4,Annette>他不是怪胎
<34-4,Annette>He's not a freak.

797
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,310
<34-5,House>他是  有点怪
<34-5,House>Yeah, he is... A little.

798
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,120
<34-5,House>但这必须停止
<34-5,House>But it's gotta stop,

799
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,310
<34-5,House>要不然他就会死
<34-5,House>or he'll die.

800
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,790
<34-6,Annette>这与疼痛无关
<34-6,Annette>It's not about pain.

801
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,770
<34-6,Annette>而是将自己的生命交到别人手上
<34-6,Annette>It's about being open.

802
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,940
<34-6,Annette>对那个人毫不设防
<34-6,Annette>And completely vulnerable to another person.

803
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,680
<34-6,Annette>如果你能懂得如此深刻的信任
<34-6,Annette>If you can learn to be that deeply trusting,

804
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,950
<34-6,Annette>这将改变你
<34-6,Annette>it changes you.

805
