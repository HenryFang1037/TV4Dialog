1
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,160
<1-1,Boyd>你们感觉到鼓舞了吗?
<1-1,Boyd>Do you feel the spirit?

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,040
<1-1,Boyd>在犹大王亚撒登基的第39年,他的脚得了病
<1-1,Boyd>And in the 39th year of his reign,asa was diseased in his feet,

3
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,110
<1-1,Boyd>直到病入膏肓
<1-1,Boyd>until the disease was exceedingly great.

4
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,350
<1-1,Boyd>他没有乞求神的帮助, 而是去看医生
<1-1,Boyd>Yet he didn't seek help from the lord,but from the physicians.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,670
<1-1,Boyd>今天, 去看医生不再有什么错
<1-1,Boyd>Now,there is nothing wrong with seeing a doctor.

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,980
<1-1,Boyd>但是医生能用耶稣给他信徒的神力,去治病救人吗?
<1-1,Boyd>But can a doctor heal through the power that jesus gave his disciples?

7
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,440
<1-1,Boyd>相信科学的人们被蒙着眼睛走完一生
<1-1,Boyd>Men of science can walk through life with blindfolds

8
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,250
<1-1,Boyd>从不知道如果没有上帝的搀扶
<1-1,Boyd>never knowing that you or i could not take a single step

9
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,070
<1-1,Boyd>你我连一步也走不了
<1-1,Boyd>if we were not uplifted by god.

10
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,360
<1-2,Boyd>Agnes, 谢谢你让我用上帝的爱来引导你
<1-2,Boyd>Agnes,thank you for letting me be an instrument of god's love for you.

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,710
<1-2,Boyd>信上帝...一切皆有可能
<1-2,Boyd>In faith...all things are possible.

12
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,910
<1-2,Boyd>我的朋友们, 让Agnes在今天,在这个教堂, 感受到信仰的力量吧
<1-2,Boyd>My friends,I want you to let agnes feel the wave of faith in this church here today

13
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,070
<1-2,Boyd>让上帝牵引她
<1-2,Boyd>lifting her into god's hands.

14
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,210
<1-3,Boyd>你能做到的! 加油, 我的姐妹
<1-3,Boyd>You can do it!Come on,sister.

15
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,600
<1-3,Boyd>赞美耶稣! 感谢上帝!
<1-3,Boyd>Praise jesus!Thank you,god!

16
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,250
<1-3,Boyd>感谢神!
<1-3,Boyd>Thank you,lord!

17
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,040
<1-3,Boyd>不!
<1-3,Boyd>no!

18
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,010
<1-4,Dad>孩子!
<1-4,Dad>Son!

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,930
<1-5,Boyd>爸爸, 我想我要看医生
<1-5,Boyd>Dad,I think i need a doctor.

20
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,330
<2-1,Wilson>你还记得我的DVD播放机吗?
<2-1,Wilson>Did you remember my dvd player?

21
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,680
<2-2,House>唔, 如果你想要的话,就不应该走的时候丢下它
<2-2,House>Well,if you wanted it,you shouldn't have left it behind when you moved out.

22
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,280
<2-3,Wilson>现在我明白了,在录像机上看A片太麻烦了
<2-3,Wilson>Now I get it.It's a drag watching porn on vhs.

23
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,950
<2-4,House>我看好了就给你打电话
<2-4,House>I'll call you as soon as I'm done with it.

24
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,170
<2-4,House>如果你赶紧装个电话的话
<2-4,House>That's if you ever get a phone installed.

25
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,640
<2-5,Wilson>噢得了吧, 我自己过去拿
<2-5,Wilson>Oh,forget it.I'll come by and get it myself.

26
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,110
<2-5,Wilson>下班后好吗? 礼拜三怎么样?
<2-5,Wilson>After work?Thursday?

27
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,900
<2-6,House>我礼拜三不在家
<2-6,House>Won't be home thursday.

28
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,600
<2-7,Wilson>没关系, 我有你家钥匙,我可以自由进出
<2-7,Wilson>No problem,I still have a key.I can let myself in and out.

29
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,110
<2-8,House>我想也许我明天就可以带给你
<2-8,House>I guess maybe I could bring it in tomorrow.

30
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,620
<2-8,House>对了, 你要按多少次暂停?
<2-8,House>After all,how many times can you hit pause

31
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,240
<2-8,House>就是lindsay lohan赢得拼字比赛的镜头?,(电影:贱女孩)
<2-8,House>at the part where lindsay lohan wins the spelling bee?

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,490
<2-10,House>你对会拼字的女孩这么有瘾?
<2-10,House>What is it about girls who can spell?

33
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,400
<2-9,Wilson>是数学竞赛
<2-9,Wilson>It's math contest.

34
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,750
<2-10,House>你对会算术的女孩这么有瘾?
<2-10,House>What is it about girls who can count?

35
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,660
<2-11,Wilson>那晚要打扑克是不是?
<2-11,Wilson>It's poker night,isn't it?

36
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,460
<2-11,Wilson>几个星期前你就说带我一起玩,别再找借口了
<2-11,Wilson>You said weeks ago that I could play.Stop making excuses.

37
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,400
<2-12,House>我得走了, 这里到处都是病人
<2-12,House>Gotta go.Building full of sick people.

38
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,810
<2-12,House>如果我抓紧点, 就能躲开他们
<2-12,House>If I hurry,maybe I can avoid them.

39
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,130
<3-1,Foreman>腹部系列检查显示无梗阻
<3-1,Foreman>the abdominal series showed no evidence of obstruction.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
<3-1,Foreman>吃了什么东西?
<3-1,Foreman>What'd you have to eat?

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,920
<3-2,Boyd>鸡肉三明治, 我们云游四处,经常吃快餐
<3-2,Boyd>Chicken sandwich.We travel.Lots of fast food.

42
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,580
<3-3,Boyd>谢谢你, 几乎感觉不到疼
<3-3,Boyd>Thank you.I barely felt it.

43
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,760
<3-4,Cameron>不用谢
<3-4,Cameron>You're welcome.

44
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,620
<3-5,Boyd>上帝告诉我你人很好
<3-5,Boyd>God told me you were kind.

45
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,810
<3-6,Cameron>你对上帝说话?
<3-6,Cameron>You talk to god?

46
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,160
<3-7,Dad>上帝经常降临到他身上来指引他人
<3-7,Dad>God's presence often descends on boyd to help him guide others.

47
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,650
<3-8,Foreman>已经很久了?
<3-8,Foreman>This been going on long?

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,670
<3-9,Dad>从他十岁那年开始
<3-9,Dad>Since he was ten.

49
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,250
<3-10,Boyd>上帝说我将遇见一位女医生...
<3-10,Boyd>God told me I would meet a woman healer...

50
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,030
<3-10,Boyd>她对她的一个男同事怀恨在心
<3-10,Boyd>who was harboring vengeful thoughts about a man she works with.

51
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,680
<3-10,Boyd>那就是上帝的工作
<3-10,Boyd>That's god's job.

52
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,670
<3-11,Cameron>我会记住的
<3-11,Cameron>I'll keep that in mind.

53
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,780
<3-11,Cameron>他的尿液很稀
<3-11,Cameron>His urine is dilute.

54
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,950
<3-12,Dad>那是什么意思?
<3-12,Dad>What does that mean?

55
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,720
<3-13,Cameron>那意味着可能由于某些原因,他的肾不再以应有的方式工作
<3-13,Cameron>It could mean that for some reason hikidneys aren't purifying the way they should,

56
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,760
<3-13,Cameron>导致他体内的毒素不断累积
<3-13,Cameron>which would let toxins accumulate in his body.

57
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,540
<3-13,Cameron>我们打算验血, 看能发现什么
<3-13,Cameron>We'll run the blood work and see what it tells us.

58
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,250
<3-14,Boyd>谢谢你, 我很感激
<3-14,Boyd>Thank you,I appreciate it.

59
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,030
<3-15,House>上帝和他对话?
<3-15,House>God talks to him?

60
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,970
<3-16,Chase>那不是什么精神病,只是一种宗教信仰而已
<3-16,Chase>it's not psychosis,he's just religious.

61
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,120
<3-16,Chase>验血结果唯一有医学意义的是低钠
<3-16,Chase>The only medical issue that showed up on the blood work is low sodium.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,600
<3-17,House>不尽然, 对上帝讲话, 那是宗教信仰,听到上帝对你讲话, 那是精神病
<3-17,House>No,you talk to god,you're religious.God talks to you,you're psychotic.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,480
<3-18,Chase>很多人把他们的宗教体验当作一种,实实在在的东西而不是象征
<3-18,Chase>A lot of people experience their religion as something more than symbolic.

64
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,920
<3-19,House>你在神学院的时候上帝对你讲过话吗?
<3-19,House>God ever talk to you when you where in the seminary?

65
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,770
<3-20,Chase>没有
<3-20,Chase>No.

66
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,790
<3-21,House>上帝损失了, 我们得到你
<3-21,House>God's loss,our gain.

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,090
<3-21,House>他不是个精神病就是个装神弄鬼的
<3-21,House>He's either psychotic or a scam artist.

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,860
<3-22,Foreman>他真的令人印象深刻
<3-22,Foreman>He was actually really impressive.

69
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,830
<3-23,House>是啊...燃烧的灌丛...估计挺精彩的
<3-23,House>Well,yeah...with the burning bush and all,it's quite the show.

70
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,910
<3-24,Cameron>他很聪明, 有礼貌, 而且有气质,不像只有15岁
<3-24,Cameron>He was intelligent,polite,dignified.He's not a typical 15-year-old.

71
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,220
<3-25,Foreman>他还告诉Cameron上帝叫她别再,为论文的事恨我了
<3-25,Foreman>And he told cameron god wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.

72
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,810
<3-26,House>上帝知道你剽窃了Cameron的论文?
<3-26,House>God knows you stole cameron's article?

73
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,760
<3-27,Foreman>他知道她"怀恨在心"
<3-27,Foreman>He knows she's "harboring vengeful thoughts."

74
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,210
<3-28,Cameron>我已经不介意
<3-28,Cameron>I'm over it.

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,900
<3-29,House>得了, 我从你们的肢体语言,就能看出一堵柏林墙
<3-29,House>Yeah,I can tell that from the berlin wall of body language between you.

76
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,220
<3-29,House>他要看不出来我才吃惊呢,低钠
<3-29,House>I'm shocked that he picked up on it.Low sodium.

77
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,620
<3-29,House>查过阿狄森氏病吗?,(一种肾上腺疾病)
<3-29,House>Check for addison's?

78
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,820
<3-30,Chase>无色素沉着, 而且钾的水平也正常
<3-30,Chase>No pigmentation and potassium levels were normal.

79
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,750
<3-31,House>肝硬化呢?
<3-31,House>Cirrhosis?

80
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,670
<3-32,Foreman>肝脏很好. 转氨酶水平未见异常
<3-32,Foreman>Liver feels fine.Transaminases are normal.

81
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,470
<3-33,House>监控他的盐摄入量以纠正低钠
<3-33,House>We should monitor his saline intake to correct the low sodium.

82
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,600
<3-33,House>每小时每升不超过一毫当量
<3-33,House>No more than one meq per liter per hour.

83
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,990
<3-33,House>再去查查病人的既往史
<3-33,House>And let's push the patient history.

84
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,430
<3-33,House>看看病人有没有服用过毒品或幻药,我再去看看
<3-33,House>See if there's any evidence of drugs or other delusions.I'll take care of it.

85
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,010
<3-34,Chase>你打算去和病人谈谈?
<3-34,Chase>You're gonna talk to a patient?

86
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,250
<3-34,Chase>上帝才和他谈
<3-34,Chase>God talks to him.

87
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,900
<3-35,House>认为我比上帝还能干也太狂了
<3-35,House>It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than god.

88
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,420
<4-1,House>那么, 你是个"靠信仰治病的人"
<4-1,House>So,you're a "faith healer."

89
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,510
<4-1,House>我这么说没有轻蔑你吧?
<4-1,House>Or is that a pejorative?

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,630
<4-1,House>是不是叫"神圣健康计划"好听些?
<4-1,House>Do you prefer something like "divine health management"?

91
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,940
<4-1,House>我以为上帝已经和你打过招呼我要来了
<4-1,House>I though god might have mentioned that I was coming.

92
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,850
<4-2,Boyd>我喜欢那个称呼, House医生
<4-2,Boyd>I'm okay with "faith healer",dr. House.

93
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,570
<4-3,House>有两下子, 你还不如直接说...
<4-3,House>That's a nice one.You didn't even go with...

94
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,260
<4-3,House>"我看到了白大褂上有个H"
<4-3,House>"I see an h and a medical coat."

95
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,030
<4-4,Boyd>护士们经常谈论你
<4-4,Boyd>The nurses talk about you a lot.

96
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,650
<4-5,House>别信她们, 我随身带着一只袜子的
<4-5,House>Ah,don't believe them.I keep a sock in my pants.

97
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,190
<4-5,House>信仰, 无知的另一种说法, 是不是?
<4-5,House>Faith,that's anoth word for ignorance,isn't it?

98
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,430
<4-5,House>我无法理解人们怎么可以如此相信,没有根据的事情
<4-5,House>I never understood how people could be so proud

99
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,480
<4-5,House>而且还为此感到骄傲,就好像那是伟大的成就
<4-5,House>of believing in something with no proof at all.Like that's an achievement.

100
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,350
<4-6,Boyd>上帝要我们信任他,你不信任一个人就无法去爱他
<4-6,Boyd>God's asking for our trust.You can't love somebody and not trust them.

101
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,190
<4-7,House>信任是需要争取的
<4-7,House>Trust has to be earned.

102
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,480
<4-7,House>你不能相信一个躲在神龛里的人
<4-7,House>You can't trust someone hiding in a closet.

103
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,910
<4-8,Boyd>你不相信任何人
<4-8,Boyd>You don't trust anyone.

104
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,310
<4-9,House>你看起来很清醒
<4-9,House>You seem lucid.

105
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,990
<4-9,House>思维不混乱, 精神也还好,你在吃什么药?
<4-9,House>There's no confusion,no lethargy.What drugs have you been taking?

106
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,810
<4-11,House>没什么药, 就一些阿司匹林
<4-11,House>Nothing.Some aspirin.

107
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,660
<4-10,Boyd>我精力放在别的事上, 忘记吃饭了--,你知道接下来会怎样
<4-10,Boyd>I get focused on something,I forget to eat--next thing you know,

108
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,000
<4-10,Boyd>我饿得头晕
<4-10,Boyd>I've got a hunger headache.

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,750
<4-11,House>可以吃阿司匹林和上医院
<4-11,House>So aspirin and hospitals are okay.

110
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,640
<4-11,House>这还真有意思了
<4-11,House>That's an interesting attitude for someone

111
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,490
<4-11,House>你不是劝说别人别找医生吗?
<4-11,House>who's kept any number of people from getting medical help.

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,520
<4-12,Boyd>我相信上帝并不意味着,不相信细菌和毒物
<4-12,Boyd>Just because i believe in prayer doesn't mean I don't believe in germs and toxins.

113
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,280
<4-13,House>那瓶子以前开过的
<4-13,House>That bottle's been opened before.

114
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,950
<4-13,House>你在饮水机那里灌的
<4-13,House>You refilled it at the water cooler.

115
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,480
<4-14,Dad>是的
<4-14,Dad>Yes.

116
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,590
<4-15,House>多久灌一次?
<4-15,House>How often do you do that?

117
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,890
<4-16,Dad>一小时灌几次, 他喜欢喝水
<4-16,Dad>A few times an hour.He likes to stay hydrated.

118
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,770
<4-16,Dad>你认为可能有细菌跑进去了?
<4-16,Dad>You think germs might have gotten in?

119
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,710
<4-17,House>我认为可能有水跑进去了
<4-17,House>I think water might have gotten in.

120
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,580
<5-1,Wilson>我们可以对你的疼痛调整疗法
<5-1,Wilson>We can adjust your pain meds.

121
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,690
<5-2,Grace>又调整?
<5-2,Grace>Again?

122
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,240
<5-3,Wilson>假如我们增加给你的氧可酮
<5-3,Wilson>Suppose we incase your oxycodone.

123
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,620
<5-4,Grace>你我都知道之所以我现在还能,清醒地和你说话
<5-4,Grace>We both know the only reason i'm talking lucidly now

124
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,130
<5-4,Grace>是因为今早我没把药全吃下去
<5-4,Grace>is because I did not take my full dose this morning.

125
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,800
<5-4,Grace>你已经尽力了
<5-4,Grace>You've done your best.

126
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,410
<5-4,Grace>而我也曾是个好士兵
<5-4,Grace>And I have been a good soldier.

127
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,450
<5-4,Grace>该是一切结束的时候了
<5-4,Grace>It's time we accept it's over.

128
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,670
<5-5,Wilson>你计划中的那个旅行怎么办?
<5-5,Wilson>What about the trip you were talking about taking?

129
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,560
<5-5,Wilson>十几岁的时候你就想去看看佛罗伦萨了
<5-5,Wilson>You've wanted to see florence since you were a teenager,right?

130
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
<5-6,Grace>去不了了, 难道还整"药"待发么?
<5-6,Grace>Yeah,go now.All drugged up.

131
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,900
<5-6,Grace>我梦想的旅行可不是这样的
<5-6,Grace>It's not exactly the trip i've been dreaming of.

132
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,110
<5-7,Wilson>好的, 你很坚强
<5-7,Wilson>Okay,you're strong.

133
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,400
<5-7,Wilson>你正面对它
<5-7,Wilson>You're dealing with this.

134
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,830
<5-7,Wilson>止疼药组合正确的话一定可以,我们能找到那个组合
<5-7,Wilson>And there is the right combination of pain meds out there.And we'll find it.

135
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,720
<5-7,Wilson>不要对我们绝望
<5-7,Wilson>Don't give up on us.

136
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,140
<5-7,Wilson>还有, 别被那声音吓到
<5-7,Wilson>And don't be startled by the sound you're about to hear.

137
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,190
<5-7,Wilson>请原谅
<5-7,Wilson>Excuse me.

138
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,020
<5-8,Wilson>我这个朋友...有点边界纠纷
<5-8,Wilson>I have a friend with boundary issues.

139
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,330
<5-8,Wilson>你就不能再等5分钟吗?
<5-8,Wilson>Can this wait five minutes?

140
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,530
<5-9,House>她要死了吗?
<5-9,House>Is she dying?

141
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
<5-10,Wilson>是的
<5-10,Wilson>Yeah.

142
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,570
<5-11,House>在我们结束这次谈话以前?
<5-11,House>Before the end of this consult?

143
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,460
<5-12,Wilson>他们会为你的自以为是立碑的
<5-12,Wilson>They could build monuments to your self-centeredness.

144
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,630
<5-13,House>一个15岁病人, 靠信仰治病,自称是上帝的热线电话
<5-13,House>Patient.15-year-old.Faith healer.Hotline to god.

145
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,230
<5-14,Wilson>什么症状?
<5-14,Wilson>What are his symptoms?

146
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,020
<5-15,House>他不是什么圣人
<5-15,House>He is not a saint.

147
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,330
<5-15,House>他通过观察, 倾听, 推理来发现,别人的生活中发生了什么事
<5-15,House>He figures out what's going on in people's lives by watching,listening,deducing.

148
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,640
<5-16,Wilson>担心他侵犯你的专利?
<5-16,Wilson>And you're worried about trademark infringement?

149
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,160
<5-17,House>然后他假传上帝的建议,看他们欢欣鼓舞, 玩弄大众
<5-17,House>Then he passes on advice from god so he can watch them jump.It's a power trip.

150
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,850
<5-18,Wilson>这一点你俩有所不同,他因什么入院?
<5-18,Wilson>Ah,and there the similarities end.Why is he here?

151
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,640
<5-19,House>我为人类感到可怕
<5-19,House>I fear for the human race.

152
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,080
<5-19,House>一个少年自称替上帝传声
<5-19,House>A teenager claims to be the voice of god

153
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,460
<5-19,House>拥有高等学历的人还听他的
<5-19,House>and people with advanced degrees are listening.

154
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,820
<5-20,Wilson>大多数美国人都有自己的神
<5-20,Wilson>The majority of americans believe in a personal god.

155
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,150
<5-20,Wilson>他是什么症状?
<5-20,Wilson>What are his symptoms?

156
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,880
<5-21,House>大范围腹痛, 低钠
<5-21,House>Massive cramps,low sodium.

157
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,720
<5-21,House>原来是因为不停喝水,上帝告诉他要净化身体
<5-21,House>Turns out he's been drinking water non-stop.God told him to purify his body.

158
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,600
<5-22,Wilson>大量摄入水会引起低钠
<5-22,Wilson>Huge water intake would cause low sodium.

159
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,970
<5-23,House>还会引起腹痛, 我知道了
<5-23,House>Which would cause the cramping.Yeah,I got it.

160
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,380
<5-24,Wilson>就这样了? 你解决了
<5-24,Wilson>What,that's it?You solved it.

161
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,450
<5-24,Wilson>你把我叫出来就是因为他的信仰使你很烦?
<5-24,Wilson>You just brought me out here to rant because faith annoys you?

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,640
<5-25,House>嗯, 他好多了
<5-25,House>Mm-hmm.He's all better.

163
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,480
<5-25,House>我能够理解,人要给自己定位在一个坑里
<5-25,House>You know,I'd get it if people were just looking for a way to fill the holes.

164
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,030
<5-25,House>但他们要占有这个坑, 一世生活在坑里
<5-25,House>But they want the holes.They wanna live in the holes.

165
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,090
<5-25,House>别人朝他的坑里填土, 就惹恼他了
<5-25,House>And they go nuts when someone else pours dirt in their holes.

166
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,570
<5-25,House>从坑里出来, 你们这些人!
<5-25,House>Climb out of your holes,people!

167
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,800
<6-1,Boyd>在山顶大声宣告,让声音传遍山峦和每寸土地
<6-1,Boyd>Go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere

<6-2,Chase>Boyd?
<6-2,Chase>Boyd?

176
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,510
<6-2,Chase>Boyd?
<6-2,Chase>Boyd?

177
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,120
<6-3,Boyd>上帝要你别感到害怕
<6-3,Boyd>God doesn't want you to be afraid.

178
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,640
<6-3,Boyd>他派我来治好你
<6-3,Boyd>He sent me here to heal you.

179
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,290
<6-3,Boyd>你以为他无法听到祷告, 他全能听到,甚至你未说出口的
<6-3,Boyd>You think he hasn't heard you prayers,but he heard them all.Even the ones you didn't say.

180
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,610
<6-4,Chase>对不起Boyd, 我带你回病房
<6-4,Chase>Sorry.Boyd,come on.Let's get you back to your room.

<6-7,Boyd>Lord...I call on you to relieve the suffering of your daughter.

190
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,320
<7-1,Cameron>我们能确定他得的是癫痫吗?
<7-1,Cameron>are we certain he even had a seizure?

191
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,870
<7-1,Cameron>就因为唱着赞歌去治疗别人?,他一直这么干, 不是吗?
<7-1,Cameron>Hymn singing and healing.He does it all the time,doesn't he?

192
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,390
<7-2,House>这可真够有意思的
<7-2,House>Isn't it interesting

193
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,190
<7-2,House>宗教行为和疯狂行动太像了,简直分不出来
<7-2,House>that religious behavior is so close to being crazy,we can't tell 'em apart.

194
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,330
<7-3,Chase>行为重复, 缺乏感觉和意识,那就是癫痫
<7-3,Chase>The repetition,the lack of affect and awareness.It was a seizure.

195
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,360
<7-4,Cameron>感染?
<7-4,Cameron>Infection?

196
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,580
<7-5,Foreman>没有发烧
<7-5,Foreman>No fever.

197
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,310
<7-6,Cameron>可能是威尔逊病. 或者是糖原贮积病
<7-6,Cameron>Could be wilson'S.Or maybe it's a glycogen storage disease.

198
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,530
<7-7,Foreman>或者脑瘤
<7-7,Foreman>Or a brain tumor.

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
<7-8,Chase>还有结节性硬化症
<7-8,Chase>Or tuberous sclerosis.

200
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,840
<7-9,House>唔, 怎么解决呢?
<7-9,House>How to settle this?

201
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,230
<7-9,House>应该让我们的病人去问问上帝,或者给他的大脑来次核磁共振
<7-9,House>We could ask our patient to ask god.Or we could mri his brain.

202
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,850
<7-9,House>你们认为如何?,因为我现在什么都可以接受
<7-9,House>Which way do you wanna go?'Cause I'm open to all possibilities.

203
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,090
<7-10,Wilson>House! 你怎么能让一个,病情不稳定的病人在走廊里游荡?
<7-10,Wilson>House!Why the hell do you let an unstable patient wander the hallways?

204
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,370
<7-11,House>她挣脱了皮带
<7-11,House>His leash broke.

205
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,830
<7-12,Wilson>临终病人最不愿听到的,是有人拿康复来开她的玩笑
<7-12,Wilson>The last thing a terminal patient needs is to hear somebody taunt them with a cure.

206
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,420
<7-12,Wilson>她感到很荒诞, 很生气
<7-12,Wilson>She was freaked,she was angry.

207
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,710
<7-13,House>可她不感到荒诞和生气了,现在是你
<7-13,House>And now she's not freaked and angry.And you are.

208
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,260
<7-14,Wilson>她说她"感觉好多了"
<7-14,Wilson>She says she's "feeling better".

209
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,740
<7-14,Wilson>也许没有载歌载舞
<7-14,Wilson>Maybe not singing and dancing,

210
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,100
<7-14,Wilson>但她感觉是这几个月来最开心的一次
<7-14,Wilson>but she's feeling just a little bit happy for the first time in months.

211
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,010
<7-15,House>突然的止痛会带来欣快的感觉
<7-15,House>Sudden drop in pain can create euphoria.

212
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,800
<7-15,House>为什么不让她去度假呢?
<7-15,House>Why don't you let her have her vacation?

213
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,390
<7-16,Wilson>这下好了, 当她结束度假
<7-16,Wilson>Oh,that's great.And when the vacation's over,

214
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,000
<7-16,Wilson>然后再度坠入残酷的现实?,她在和疾病抗争!
<7-16,Wilson>when she crash lands from all this denial?She was dealing with her illness.

215
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,290
<7-16,Wilson>你提高了她的期望
<7-16,Wilson>Now her expectations are rising.

216
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,470
<7-16,Wilson>你又不用陪着她-
<7-16,Wilson>And you're not the one who has to be there

217
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,010
<7-16,Wilson>面对她心中升起的虚假希望
<7-16,Wilson>when all that false hope gets yanked out from under her.

218
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,540
<7-17,House>你们是不是无事可做?
<7-17,House>Don't you guys have anything to do?

219
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,300
<8-1,Chase>你这样医治别人有多久了?
<8-1,Chase>How long have you been healing people?

220
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,960
<8-2,Boyd>你相信我能治病?
<8-2,Boyd>You believe that's what I'm doing?

221
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,710
<8-3,Chase>我希望能
<8-3,Chase>I'd like to.

222
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,980
<8-4,Boyd>但你不信
<8-4,Boyd>But you don'T.

223
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,150
<8-4,Boyd>为什么要做你不想做的?
<8-4,Boyd>Why do you always do things you don't wanna do?

224
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,490
<8-4,Boyd>不要紧, 不必回答我
<8-4,Boyd>It's okay,I don't expect a real answer.

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,250
<8-4,Boyd>上帝可能希望你忘记那些不快
<8-4,Boyd>You know,god would probably want you to take that stick out of your butt and get over this.

226
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,180
<9-1,Foreman>如果宇宙中真有超人一等的神
<9-1,Foreman>If there is some higher order running the universe,

227
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,420
<9-2,Cameron>他很可能是超出人类理解力的
<9-2,Cameron>it's probably so different from anything our species can conceive,

228
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,780
<9-2,Cameron>揣测他的想法没有意义
<9-2,Cameron>there's no point in even thinking about it.

229
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,860
<9-2,Cameron>不过我还是怀疑,他是否会照顾到我的心情
<9-2,Cameron>But I doubt it gives a damn about my butt.

230
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,440
<9-3,Foreman>所以你相信上帝也许真的存在,但你就是不去想他?
<9-3,Foreman>So you believe god might exist,but you don't think about it?

231
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,600
<9-3,Foreman>这个问题非常重要--
<9-3,Foreman>It's the most important issue--

232
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,310
<9-4,Cameron>我认为企鹅还研究核物理学呢
<9-4,Cameron>I think penguins might as well speculate about nuclear physics.

233
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,040
<9-4,Cameron>我们为什么谈这个?
<9-4,Cameron>Why are we having this conversation?

234
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,630
<9-5,Foreman>什么? 我只是好奇
<9-5,Foreman>What?I'm curious.

235
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,870
<9-6,Cameron>不能先告诉别人-,"你只是同事而不是朋友"
<9-6,Cameron>You cannot tell someone they are your colleague and not a friend

236
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,300
<9-6,Cameron>然后又随意地和她探讨死后的事
<9-6,Cameron>and then casually chat about the afterlife.

237
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,290
<10-1,Boyd>你真的在记分?
<10-1,Boyd>you actually keep score?

238
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,550
<10-2,House>你的MRI检查结果还没出来
<10-2,House>Your mri results aren't done yet.

239
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,170
<10-2,House>回你自己病房去, 不许唱歌
<10-2,House>Go back to your room.No singing.

240
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,230
<10-3,Boyd>唔, 查出来为什么低钠你得了一分
<10-3,Boyd>Well,you would get a point for figuring why the low sodium.

241
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,130
<10-3,Boyd>我的分怎么来的?
<10-3,Boyd>What are my guy's points for?

242
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,450
<10-4,House>你关于Cameron和Foreman之间口角,的把戏确实玩的不错
<10-4,House>Your trick about the spat between dr. Cameron and dr. Foreman apparently impressed someone.

243
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,020
<10-5,Boyd>第二分呢?
<10-5,Boyd>And the second point?

244
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,480
<10-5,Boyd>是不是因为我治好了Grace?
<10-5,Boyd>Do you think it could be because I healed grace?

245
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,850
<10-5,Boyd>她回来看过我, 我喜欢她
<10-5,Boyd>She's been back to see me.I like her.

246
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,910
<10-6,House>你喜欢的是捣乱
<10-6,House>You like messing with people.

247
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,820
<10-6,House>所以你跑这儿来了
<10-6,House>That's why you're here now.

248
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,400
<10-6,House>也许你认为你的电池动力来自上帝,也许你不
<10-6,House>Maybe you think that your batteries are powered by god,maybe you don'T.

249
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,010
<10-6,House>不管怎样, 你喜欢你现在干的
<10-6,House>Either way,you enjoy what you do.

250
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,820
<10-7,Boyd>是的, 我喜欢帮助人们
<10-7,Boyd>Yes.I like helping people.

251
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,960
<10-7,Boyd>当看到他们的负担全都飞走的,面部表情时, 我能感到心潮澎湃
<10-7,Boyd>I get a rush when I see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,080
<10-8,House>不过你很快就跑到另一个州了
<10-8,House>Mm,but you make sure you're in the next state by the time

253
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,980
<10-8,House>那时病人的脑内啡耗尽,关节炎又回来了
<10-8,House>the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.

254
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,580
<10-9,Boyd>那不可能发生
<10-9,Boyd>That doesn't happen.

255
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,900
<10-10,House>噢, 你做过长期跟踪研究?
<10-10,House>Oh,you do extensive follow-up studies?

256
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,210
<10-11,Boyd>上帝告诉我的
<10-11,Boyd>God told me.

257
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,080
<10-12,House>你看看, 那就不公平了,我们正玩得好好的
<10-12,House>See,that's not fair.We were having fun.

258
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,470
<10-12,House>当你扔了那么大一个炸弹后想让,被开玩笑的人再保持理性是很难的
<10-12,House>It's hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there.

259
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,540
<10-13,Boyd>他也提到你了
<10-13,Boyd>He spoke with me about you too.

260
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,290
<10-14,House>原谅我的敌人?
<10-14,House>Forgive my enemies?

261
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,770
<10-14,House>当水星逆行的时候,永远不要和金牛座约会?
<10-14,House>Never date a taurus when mercury's in retrograde?

262
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,530
<10-14,House>这些我自己也能学会--通过惨痛教训
<10-14,House>Yeah,I learned that one myself--the hard way.

263
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,960
<10-15,Boyd>上帝说你找借口单独待着
<10-15,Boyd>God says you look for excuses to be alone.

264
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,180
<10-16,House>瞧瞧, 那正是一种听起来非常玄妙
<10-16,House>See,that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep,

265
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,850
<10-16,House>其实可以用来形容任何一个
<10-16,House>but you could say it about any person

266
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,870
<10-16,House>不渴望和他见到的每个人都有深交的人
<10-16,House>who doesn't pine for the social approval of everyone he meets.

267
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,750
<10-16,House>你那么做可以聪明地推断我是什么人,而且使自己看起来还不像弱智
<10-16,House>Which you were cleverly able to deduce about me but not being a moron.

268
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,800
<10-16,House>告诉上帝下次具体点
<10-16,House>Next time tell god to be more specific.

269
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,930
<10-17,Boyd>上帝希望你邀请Wilson医生参加牌局
<10-17,Boyd>God wants you to invite dr. Wilson to your poker game.

270
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,570
<11-1,House>不要和我的病人交谈
<11-1,House>Don't talk to my patient.

271
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,600
<11-2,Wilson>你在说什么?
<11-2,Wilson>What are you talking about?

272
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,840
<11-3,House>我的病人在走廊里无意中碰到你的病人,于是你火了
<11-3,House>You get all huffy when my patient stumbles into yours in the hallway.

273
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,390
<11-3,House>但是你不能和我的病人什么都谈
<11-3,House>But you got no qualms about chatting my guy up.

274
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,780
<11-4,Wilson>有意思, 就像猜密码一样
<11-4,Wilson>This is fun,it's like password.

275
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,800
<11-4,Wilson>继续, 当我发现你他妈的在说什么的,时候我就会加入的
<11-4,Wilson>Keep talking,I'll jump in when I get a clue what the hell you're talking about.

276
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,640
<11-5,House>上帝知道牌局的事
<11-5,House>God knows about my poker game.

277
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,010
<11-6,Wilson>你认为是我告诉了他?
<11-6,Wilson>You think I told him?

278
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,590
<11-7,House>如果不是那样,我可要开始每周上教堂了
<11-7,House>Either that or I start going to church every sunday.

279
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,170
<11-7,House>会和保龄球时间冲突的
<11-7,House>That would mess with my bowling league.

280
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,730
<11-8,Wilson>House, 除了朝他吼让他滚回自己的病房
<11-8,Wilson>House,aside from yelling at him to get back to his room,

281
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
<11-8,Wilson>我从没有和你的病人讲过话
<11-8,Wilson>I've never spoken to your patient.

282
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,210
<12-1,Chase>核磁共振显示有一个区域不正常
<12-1,Chase>mri shows an abnormal area.

283
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,640
<12-2,House>结节性脑硬化
<12-2,House>Tuberous sclerosis.

284
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
<12-4,Chase>它邻近的部分是引起一切症状的根源
<12-4,Chase>It's the right neighborhood.Accounts for all the symptoms.

285
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,850
<12-5,House>所有的症状
<12-5,House>All of them.

286
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,160
<12-6,Foreman>首先确认是脑皮质结节
<12-6,Foreman>Leading cortical tuber's identifiable.

287
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,940
<12-6,Foreman>我们可以手术去除
<12-6,Foreman>We can do this surgically.

288
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,030
<12-7,House>去祝贺我们的病人吧
<12-7,House>Tell our patient congratulations.

289
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,850
<12-7,House>那些和上帝的对话很快就要成为历史了
<12-7,House>Soon these chats with god will be a thing of the past.

290
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,840
<12-7,House>天平向凡人这边倾斜
<12-7,House>Tie goes to the mortal.

291
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,170
<13-1,Wilson>你知道在Lourdes的天主教堂里,一直都有一名医生的吗?
<13-1,Wilson>Did you know the catholic church keeps a doctor at lourdes?

292
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,950
<13-1,Wilson>他每天听到的都是一样的
<13-1,Wilson>He hears the same thing every day.

293
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,740
<13-1,Wilson>可是在数以千计的声称好转的案例中
<13-1,Wilson>But out of the thousands of cases of people who have claimed to feel better,

294
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,030
<13-1,Wilson>只有很少一部分被教堂确认是奇迹
<13-1,Wilson>the catholic church has only recognized a handful as miracles.

295
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,160
<13-2,Grace>可他们确实认识到了这很小一部分
<13-2,Grace>But they do recognize a handful.

296
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,210
<13-3,Wilson>唔, 他们只是一个教堂
<13-3,Wilson>Well,they're a church.

297
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,450
<13-3,Wilson>他们就是干这个的
<13-3,Wilson>It's what they do.

298
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:41,290
<13-4,Grace>在过去的几年里, 我的世界越来越小
<13-4,Grace>Look,for the past couple of years,the world's been getting smaller.

299
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,650
<13-4,Grace>8个月, 6个月
<13-4,Grace>Eight months,six months.

300
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,330
<13-4,Grace>我看到一部电影的宣传片
<13-4,Grace>I watch a trailer for a movie...

301
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,790
<13-4,Grace>就会想, 正式片上映的时候我还在吗?
<13-4,Grace>and I think,am I gonna be here when that comes out?

302
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,150
<13-4,Grace>也许那里还有一道地平线
<13-4,Grace>But maybe there is still a horizon out there.

303
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:04,830
<13-4,Grace>你知道, 也许...也许我能做个,一年的计划, 甚至两年
<13-4,Grace>You know,maybe...maybe I can make plans for a year from now.Two years.

304
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,470
<13-4,Grace>我喜欢这个前景
<13-4,Grace>I like the view.

305
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,360
<13-5,Wilson>那是个谎言,如果你相信, 你会被害惨的...
<13-5,Wilson>The view is a lie.And if you believe it,you're going to crash so hard...

306
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,150
<13-5,Wilson>我再给你的肝拍几张片子吧
<13-5,Wilson>let me take new images of your liver.

307
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,050
<13-6,Grace>你不能接受那可能是事实
<13-6,Grace>You can't accept that it could be true.

308
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,590
<13-7,Wilson>唔, 如果是事实,你不应该害怕去证明它
<13-7,Wilson>Well,if it is true,you shouldn't be afraid of proving it.

309
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,330
<14-1,Foreman>结节性脑硬化是遗传性疾病
<14-1,Foreman>tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder.

310
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,060
<14-1,Foreman>它导致体内各部分出现良性小肿瘤,在这个病例中, 是大脑
<14-1,Foreman>It causes small,benign tumors to grow in various parts of the body.In this case,the brain.

311
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,580
<14-2,Dad>你说是良性的
<14-2,Dad>You said benign.

312
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,620
<14-3,Foreman>仅仅是可能. 可不管是不是良性,长的可真不是地方
<14-3,Foreman>They probably are.But benign or not,they're not in a good location.

313
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,510
<14-3,Foreman>必须切除掉
<14-3,Foreman>We need to remove them.

314
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,920
<14-4,Dad>你们说的是脑外科手术?
<14-4,Dad>You're talking brain surgery?

315
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,930
<14-5,Chase>他的症状越来越严重了,这说明肿瘤正在生长
<14-5,Chase>His symptoms are getting worse which means the tumors are growing.

316
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,400
<14-5,Chase>手术将解决一切问题,包括电解质失衡, 癫痫, 幻听
<14-5,Chase>Surgery will correct it all.The chemical imbalance,the seizures,the auditory hallucinations.

317
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,250
<14-6,Dad>幻觉?
<14-6,Dad>Hallucinations?

318
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:02,320
<14-7,Foreman>不手术, 情况会越来越糟,甚至危及生命
<14-7,Foreman>Without the surgery,it's just gonna get worse.It might even be fatal.

319
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,570
<14-7,Foreman>做了手术, 你的儿子会变成一个,15岁普通男孩
<14-7,Foreman>With the surgery,your son should be a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.

320
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,520
<14-8,Boyd>我不普通
<14-8,Boyd>I'm not normal.

321
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,160
<15-1,House>我需要你跟我的病人谈谈
<15-1,House>I need you to talk to my patient.

322
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,770
<15-1,House>这个我来
<15-1,House>I'll get this one.

323
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,740
<15-2,Wilson>我怎么觉得你要密谋称霸世界呢?
<15-2,Wilson>Why do I have the feeling you're plotting world domination?

324
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,050
<15-3,House>摩西拒绝手术
<15-3,House>Moses is refusing surgery.

325
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,500
<15-3,House>你有这个本事
<15-3,House>You have a gift.

326
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,880
<15-3,House>人们感激你,因为你告诉他们要死
<15-3,House>People thank you for telling them they're gonna die.

327
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,560
<15-4,Wilson>如果我能说服他手术
<15-4,Wilson>If I can get him to agree to surgery,

328
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,260
<15-4,Wilson>我要参加扑克
<15-4,Wilson>I want in on the poker game.

329
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,320
<15-5,House>你为了参加一个愚蠢的游戏,宁愿让一个孩子去死?
<15-5,House>You would let this kid die,,just to get into a stupid game?

330
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,370
<15-6,Wilson>你宁可让他死也不让我参加?
<15-6,Wilson>You'd let him die just to keep me out?

331
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,970
<15-6,Wilson>嗨
<15-6,Wilson>Hi.

332
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,480
<16-1,Wilson>我是Wilson医生
<16-1,Wilson>I'm dr. Wilson.

333
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,360
<16-2,Boyd>我知道会换人来说
<16-2,Boyd>I knew they'd send somebody else.

334
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,190
<16-3,House>这上帝还真多嘴
<16-3,House>That god has a big mouth.

335
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,140
<16-3,House>House.
<16-3,House>House

336
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,170
<16-4,Wilson>我想知道...
<16-4,Wilson>Can I ask...

337
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,010
<16-4,Wilson>为什么你不想切掉肿瘤?
<16-4,Wilson>why you don't want the tumors removed?

338
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,920
<16-5,Boyd>上帝给我肿瘤, 自有他的理由
<16-5,Boyd>God put them there for a reason.

339
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,770
<16-6,House>你认为上帝把肿瘤当做电话和你交流吗?
<16-6,House>you think god needs a telephone in your head to talk to you?

340
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,280
<16-6,House>上帝不是无处不在的吗?
<16-6,House>Isn't he everywhere?

341
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,980
<16-6,House>难道还要靠长途电话?
<16-6,House>It's not a long distance call,is it?

342
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,450
<16-7,Boyd>这是上帝行事的方法
<16-7,Boyd>This is the way god does things.

343
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,420
<16-7,Boyd>利用自然的法则
<16-7,Boyd>Through natural law.

344
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,490
<16-7,Boyd>如果上帝整天到处显示他的神力
<16-7,Boyd>If he went around doing big, flashy miracles all the time,

345
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,790
<16-7,Boyd>人们就不需要信仰了
<16-7,Boyd>nobody would need faith.

346
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,200
<16-8,House>为什么其他人需要通过信仰
<16-8,House>How come everyone else needs faith,

347
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,210
<16-8,House>而你却能直接在耳边听到上帝的声音
<16-8,House>but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear?

348
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,490
<16-8,House>换你说
<16-8,House>Your turn.

349
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,760
<16-9,Wilson>你认为上帝想要你死吗?
<16-9,Wilson>Do you think god wants you to die?

350
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,110
<16-10,Dad>上帝经常这样对待他选中的人
<16-10,Dad>this is the way that the lord often is with his chosen ones.

351
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,400
<16-10,Dad>最喜欢的人受到最多的考验
<16-10,Dad>He gives the most trials to those that he loves the most.

352
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,710
<16-11,House>说得真好听
<16-11,House>How sweet.

353
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,780
<16-11,House>你不用履行你的职责
<16-11,House>You abdicate your authority.

354
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,270
<16-11,House>减少了许多做父母的烦恼
<16-11,House>Avoid those tricky parental issues

355
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,140
<16-11,House>如果不能决定要不要让孩子16岁开车
<16-11,House>like wther to let him drive at 16.

356
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,660
<16-11,House>就让他15岁就死掉
<16-11,House>Just let him die at 15.

357
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,520
<16-12,Wilson>那么说你觉得你儿子是
<16-12,Wilson>So you believe your son is...

358
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,850
<16-12,Wilson>恩,一个圣徒
<16-12,Wilson>um,a saint.

359
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,000
<16-12,Wilson>我是这么理解的
<16-12,Wilson>The way i understand it,

360
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,940
<16-12,Wilson>圣徒的一个特质是谦逊
<16-12,Wilson>one of the hallmarks of a saint is humility.

361
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,690
<16-12,Wilson>一个谦逊的人
<16-12,Wilson>Someone with true humility

362
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,510
<16-12,Wilson>应该会想到这种可能性
<16-12,Wilson>would consider the possibility that...

363
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,960
<16-12,Wilson>那就是神根本没有选中他
<16-12,Wilson>god hadn't chosen him for that kind of honor.

364
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,500
<16-12,Wilson>他会想到有可能...
<16-12,Wilson>He'd consider the possibility that...

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,850
<16-12,Wilson>他只是病了
<16-12,Wilson>he just had an illness.

366
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,480
<17-1,House>你有控制别人思想的天分
<17-1,House>You have a gift for manipulation.

367
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,310
<17-2,Wilson>我会注意聆听
<17-2,Wilson>I listen.

368
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,170
<17-2,Wilson>我会和他们交谈
<17-2,Wilson>I have an actual conversation with people.

369
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,830
<17-2,Wilson>这样居然可以奇迹般地让他们合作
<17-2,Wilson>Which,shockingly, does raise the odds they'll be cooperative.

370
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,950
<17-3,House>这是我的台词
<17-3,House>That's what I'm saying.

371
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,880
<17-3,House>你看透了那个孩子, 你就可以控制他了
<17-3,House>You read that kid, and you manipulated the hell out of him.

372
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,270
<17-3,House>记得带椒盐卷饼
<17-3,House>Bring pretzels.

373
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,620
<17-3,House>一听声音就知道是你
<17-3,House>I know that knock!

374
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,320
<18-1,House>你有钥匙, 我不会给你开的
<18-1,House>Use your key, I'm not getting up.

375
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,050
<18-2,House>牌局要到明天晚上
<18-2,House>Game's not till tomorrow night.

376
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,230
<18-2,House>你手里拿的也不是椒盐卷饼
<18-2,House>And those aren't pretzels.

377
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,260
<18-3,Wilson>这是几张Grace Palmieri的癌症CT片
<18-3,Wilson>I took some images of grace palmieri's cancer.

378
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,720
<18-4,House>怎么了?
<18-4,House>Yeah?

379
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,690
<18-5,Wilson>她的肿瘤变小了
<18-5,Wilson>Her tumor has shrunk.

380
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,240
<18-6,House>别告诉我的那个病人
<18-6,House>Don't tell my patient.

381
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,560
<18-6,House>我要这个奇迹女病人的所有资料
<18-6,House>I want all the records on miracle woman

382
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,340
<19-1,House>所有的检查报告和治疗方法
<19-1,House>Every test,every treatment she's ever had.

383
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,520
<19-1,House>她们在医院里回答过的所有问题
<19-1,House>Every question she's ever answered in this hospital.

384
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,530
<19-1,House>还有前任医师发过来的资料
<19-1,House>And anything sent from previous doctors.

385
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,080
<19-1,House>可能的话查下出生时的情况
<19-1,House>Go back to neonatal if you have...

386
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,550
<19-1,House>"不要让他们见面"那个字你听不懂?
<19-1,House>which part of "keep them away from each other" confused you?

387
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,590
<19-2,Chase>他们是朋友
<19-2,Chase>They're friends.

388
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,060
<19-2,Chase>她认为他救了她的命
<19-2,Chase>She thinks he saved her life.

389
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
<19-3,House>于是我们很乐意提供医学证明
<19-3,House>And we've obligingly offered medical proof

390
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,210
<19-3,House>证明他的错觉是有科学根据的
<19-3,House>that his delusions are true.

391
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,660
<19-4,Cuddy>他们不同意进行手术
<19-4,Cuddy>They've withdrawn permission for the surgery.

392
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,500
<19-4,Cuddy>我已经让律师去处理了
<19-4,Cuddy>I've put the lawyers on it.

393
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,070
<19-4,Cuddy>她的肿瘤变小了?
<19-4,Cuddy>Her tumor shrank?

394
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,210
<19-5,House>我会处理的
<19-5,House>I'm on it.

395
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,090
<19-5,House>告诉那个小耶稣,我们需要额外的24小时
<19-5,House>Tell jesus that we need another 24 hours

396
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,610
<19-5,House>来纠正他的钠离子水平
<19-5,House>to normalize his sodium level.

397
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,100
<19-6,Chase>早就纠正了
<19-6,Chase>He's already normalized.

398
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,080
<19-7,House>实际是告诉圣约瑟,(耶稣肉身的父亲)
<19-7,House>Actually,tell joseph.

399
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,730
<19-7,House>耶稣能看穿你撒谎
<19-7,House>Jesus'll know you're lying.

400
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,220
<19-7,House>我要你, Foreman还有Cameron
<19-7,House>And I want you and foreman and cameron

401
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,660
<19-7,House>逐行逐字研究那个女病人的资料
<19-7,House>to go over every line of every file on that woman.

402
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,770
<19-8,Chase>我们不是要救那个男孩吗?
<19-8,Chase>Isn't he the one we're supposed to save?

403
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,490
<19-9,House>救他的唯一办法
<19-9,House>The only way to save him

404
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,640
<19-9,House>就是证明她没有康复
<19-9,House>is to prove that she is still dying.

405
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,500
<20-1,Chase>磁核共振仪没问题
<20-1,Chase>Mri machine checks out.

406
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,130
<20-2,Foreman>也可能是放射科医生误操作了
<20-2,Foreman>Maybe the radiologist mischarted which machine they used.

407
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,280
<20-3,Chase>两个我都检查过了
<20-3,Chase>I checked both.

408
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,710
<20-3,Chase>这太变态了
<20-3,Chase>This is insane.

409
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,520
<20-3,Chase>我们居然对康复进行诊断
<20-3,Chase>We're diagnosing a recovery.

410
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,290
<20-4,Cameron>会不会是六个月以前?
<20-4,Cameron>What about six months ago?

411
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,450
<20-4,Cameron>在那时操作有误
<20-4,Cameron>Maybe there was a malfunction on her before pictures.

412
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,890
<20-4,Cameron>某些阴影会使肿瘤看起来--
<20-4,Cameron>Some shadow that made the tumor

413
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,270
<20-4,Cameron>比实际的大
<20-4,Cameron>look bigger than it really was.

414
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,180
<20-4,Cameron>我去查查看
<20-4,Cameron>I'll go see what I can find out.

415
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,330
<20-5,Foreman>可能是放射治疗的延迟效应
<20-5,Foreman>Maybe it's a delayed effect from radiation.

416
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,520
<20-5,Foreman>有时候需要一段时间
<20-5,Foreman>Sometimes it can take a while.

417
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,430
<20-6,Chase>她已经六个月没放疗了
<20-6,Chase>She hasn't had radiation for six months.

418
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,130
<20-7,Foreman>这有可能
<20-7,Foreman>Here.

419
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,420
<20-8,Chase>不可能, 记录上...
<20-8,Chase>Nowhere. Her records...

420
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,240
<20-9,Foreman>每个家庭都有一堆电器会释放辐射
<20-9,Foreman>there's about a dozen appliances in every home that give off radiation.

421
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,860
<20-10,Chase>那点辐射量对老鼠都没有影响
<20-10,Chase>Dosages that wouldn't hurt a hamster

422
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,610
<20-10,Chase>甚至整年把它绑在电器上也不会
<20-10,Chase>if it was tied to the machine for a year.

423
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,080
<20-11,Foreman>只有当电器运转正常时
<20-11,Foreman>If the machine's operating properly.

424
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,690
<20-12,Chase>有时候肿瘤自己就变小了
<20-12,Chase>Sometimes remissions just happen.

425
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,260
<20-13,Foreman>如果我们没有去她家看看,你以为House会欣然接受这种解释吗?
<20-13,Foreman>You think house will just shrug and say that if one of us doesn't check the home?

426
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,940
<21-1,House>K对9对
<21-1,House>Kings on 9s.

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,570

<22-9,Tax Accountant>you were bluffing.

450
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,580
<22-9,Tax Accountant>而他知道你在虚张声势
<22-9,Tax Accountant>He knew you were bluffing.

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,930
<22-9,Tax Accountant>你今晚运气开始变差了
<22-9,Tax Accountant>Your luck's changing tonight.

<22-10,Wilson>So did they find anything?

453
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,260
<22-10,Wilson>还是你必须接受现实
<22-10,Wilson>Or are you gonna have to accept the fact

454
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,820
<22-10,Wilson>有时肿瘤就是会自然好
<22-10,Wilson>that every now and then remissions happen?

455
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,280
<22-11,House>最好这个电话内容能有些价值
<22-11,House>This call had better be worth my time.

456
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,710
<22-12,Chase>她那时还不是我们的病人
<22-12,Chase>This is what happens when it's not our patient.

457
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,020
<22-12,Chase>我们信息有限
<22-12,Chase>We don't know enough.

458
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,550
<22-13,House>所以才让你去的
<22-13,House>That's why you're there.

459
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,280
<22-14,Chase>她有男朋友
<22-14,Chase>She's got a boyfriend.

460
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,580
<22-15,House>难道他有辐射...
<22-15,House>Unless you think he's radioactive...

461
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,140
<22-16,Chase>他随时会回来
<22-16,Chase>he could show up any minute.

462
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,770
<22-16,Chase>很荣幸为你工作
<22-16,Chase>The honor of working for you

463
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,480
<22-16,Chase>但被判入室抢劫就太不值了
<22-16,Chase>is not worth a felony charge.

464
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,210
<22-17,House>稍等一下
<22-17,House>Give me a minute.

465
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,300
<22-18,GBS>我觉得你拿到同花的几率
<22-18,GBS>I'm saying the odds of you having a straight flush

466
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,840
<22-18,GBS>非常小
<22-18,GBS>are pretty low.

467
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,980
<22-19,Chase>House!
<22-19,Chase>House!

468
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,920
<22-20,Wilson>我不跟
<22-20,Wilson>I'll fold.

469
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,540
<22-21,Dry Cleaner>不跟
<22-21,Dry Cleaner>Fold.

470
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,400
<22-21,Dry Cleaner>不跟
<22-21,Dry Cleaner>Fold.

471
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,260
<22-23,GBS>这下我瞎了
<22-23,GBS>I'm screwed,aren't I?

472
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,640
<22-24,House>同花才赢了9美金
<22-24,House>Nine bucks for a straight flush.

473
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,420
<22-24,House>他不会回家的
<22-24,House>He's not coming home.

474
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,040
<22-24,House>放心
<22-24,House>Relax.

475
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,140
<22-24,House>世界上没有什么东西
<22-24,House>There's nothing in this universe

476
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,810
<22-24,House>可以得到终极解释
<22-24,House>that can't be explained...eventually.

477
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,710
<22-24,House>比如这个牌局
<22-24,House>Take this game.

478
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,710
<22-24,House>只有两个人知道你想参加
<22-24,House>Only two people knew that you wanted in on it.

479
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,190
<22-25,Wilson>我没跟他说
<22-25,Wilson>I didn't tell him.

480
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,100
<22-25,Wilson>我跟你说了我没告诉他
<22-25,Wilson>I told you, I didn't tell him.

481
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,130
<22-26,House>怎么可能?
<22-26,House>Why would you?

482
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,280
<22-26,House>他唯一走的比较近的可以交谈的人碰巧是
<22-26,House>The only person he's been getting all intimate and conversational with

483
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,710
<22-26,House>你的患癌症的小可怜
<22-26,House>is your cancer chick.

484
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,560
<22-26,House>她怎么会知道?
<22-26,House>How would she know?

485
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,770
<22-26,House>牌局的话题
<22-26,House>The subject of my poker game

486
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,310
<22-26,House>不是病人如何交谈
<22-26,House>isn't likely to come up in the course of a patient interview.

487
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,570
<22-26,House>那些话是你对那些
<22-26,House>No,that's the kind of thing you mention to someone

488
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,060
<22-26,House>分享你全天生活的人说的
<22-26,House>you're used to sharing the details of you day with.

489
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,050
<22-27,Wilson>别说了
<22-27,Wilson>Don'T.

490
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,720
<22-28,House>你的拉比(犹太教学者)...
<22-28,House>Your rabbi...

491
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,670
<22-28,House>你的监护人
<22-28,House>a guidance counselor.

492
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,600
<22-28,House>一个母亲
<22-28,House>A parent.

493
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,580
<22-28,House>她不会是你妈妈吧?
<22-28,House>She's not your mom, is she?

494
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,960
<22-29,Wilson>我很认真地告诉你别说了
<22-29,Wilson>I'm seriously saying don'T.

495
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,350
<22-30,House>你和她上过床...
<22-30,House>You've been having sex...

496
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,290
<22-31,Wilson>不该在这说的
<22-31,Wilson>this is so not the place.

497
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,200
<22-32,House>和那个医学奇迹上床
<22-32,House>With our miracle woman.

498
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,060
<23-1,Dad>打扰了, 我可以...可以和你说几句么?
<23-1,Dad>Excuse me,am I...may I talk to you?

499
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,570
<23-2,Cameron>当然可以
<23-2,Cameron>Of course.

500
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,490
<23-3,Dad>Boyd正在穿衣服
<23-3,Dad>Boyd's getting dressed.

501
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,650
<23-3,Dad>他准备出院了
<23-3,Dad>He's ready to check out.

502
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,250
<23-4,Cameron>你没同意他不能出院
<23-4,Cameron>He can't check out without your permission.

503
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,580
<23-5,Foreman>他的钠离子水平仍然不正常
<23-5,Foreman>His sodium level still isn't normal.

504
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,530
<23-6,Dad>我和他说了, 他说上帝告诉他可以
<23-6,Dad>I told him. He said that god said it was okay.

505
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,930
<23-6,Dad>他没事了
<23-6,Dad>He was fine.

506
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,070
<23-6,Dad>你能和他谈谈么?
<23-6,Dad>Could you talk to him?

507
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,520
<24-1,Wilson>告诉他们我不叫Wilson
<24-1,Wilson>Tell them my name isn't wilson.

508
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,090
<24-2,House>大部人在你这种情况下
<24-2,House>Most people in your situation

509
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,260
<24-2,House>只会为事业发愁
<24-2,House>just have their careers to worry about.

510
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,390
<24-2,House>你除了事业最好担心一下神的惩罚
<24-2,House>You've got that and divine retribution.

511
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,400
<24-3,Wilson>告诉他们真相
<24-3,Wilson>Tell them.

512
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,510
<24-4,House>告诉他们这一切是怎么发生的
<24-4,House>Tell me how it happened,

513
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,170
<24-4,House>还有你想要达到的目的
<24-4,House>and I'll tell them whatever you want.

514
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,860
<24-5,Wilson>她那天情况很糟
<24-5,Wilson>She'd had a bad day.

515
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,200
<24-5,Wilson>很痛苦
<24-5,Wilson>Pain-wise.

516
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,590
<24-5,Wilson>他朋友也没有来接她回家
<24-5,Wilson>Her ride didn't show up to take her home.

517
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
<24-6,House>所以你送她了
<24-6,House>So you offered.

518
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:14,980
<24-6,House>没错
<24-6,House>Yeah.

519
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,520
<24-7,Wilson>家里一点日用品都没有
<24-7,Wilson>She didn't have any groceries.

520
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,230
<24-7,Wilson>她病得太厉害出不了门
<24-7,Wilson>She was too sick to go out.

521
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,920
<24-7,Wilson>我想我能抽出半小时帮帮她
<24-7,Wilson>I figured I could afford to take a half hour.

522
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,960
<24-7,Wilson>送她, 买东西
<24-7,Wilson>Pick her up and few things.

523
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,230
<24-8,House>然后留下确保她没事
<24-8,House>And stay and make sure she's okay.

524
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,030
<24-9,Wilson>恩
<24-9,Wilson>Yeah.

525
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,300
<24-10,House>然后就过夜了
<24-10,House>And never leave.

526
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,860
<24-10,House>你说你租了套房子
<24-10,House>You told me you got an apartment.

527
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,750
<24-10,House>但你事实上搬到她那住了
<24-10,House>But you moved in with her.

528
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,540
<24-10,House>你骗我
<24-10,House>You lied to me.

529
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:39,980
<24-11,Wilson>告诉他们真相
<24-11,Wilson>Tell them.

530
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,790
<24-12,House>他的名字不是Wilson
<24-12,House>His name is not wilson,

531
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,770
<24-12,House>他比我还混蛋
<24-12,House>and he's screwed up worse than I am.

532
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,770
<24-13,Wilson>好吧, 我是骗了你
<24-13,Wilson>Okay,yes, I lied to you.

533
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,970
<24-13,Wilson>我很抱歉
<24-13,Wilson>I'm sorry.

534
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,480
<24-14,House>肿瘤科医生多半对生死已经麻木了
<24-14,House>Half the doctors who specialize in oncology,turn into burnt out cases.

535
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,660
<24-14,House>而你呢? 被人需要是你的嗜好
<24-14,House>But you,you eat neediness.

536
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,300
<24-15,Wilson>祝你好运
<24-15,Wilson>Lucky for you.

537
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,620
<24-15,Wilson>今天玩得很开心
<24-15,Wilson>Thanks for the game,guys.

538
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,410
<24-15,Wilson>我想我不会再来了
<24-15,Wilson>I don't think i'll be coming back.

539
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,320
<24-16,House>你是只有用的吸血鬼
<24-16,House>You're a functional vampire.

540
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,030
<24-16,House>你救人, 你对社会有贡献
<24-16,House>Sure,you're heroic, useful to society.

541
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,930
<24-16,House>因为社会提供你需要的东西
<24-16,House>But only because it feeds you.

542
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,760
<24-17,House>我家没什么可偷的
<24-17,House>There's nothing worth stealing,

543
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,960
<24-17,House>看都别看
<24-17,House>so don't even look.

544
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,910
<24-18,House>你不仅迷恋楚楚可怜的人
<24-18,House>You don't just have a fetish for needy people,

545
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,470
<24-18,House>你娶了他们
<24-18,House>you marry them!

546
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,870
<24-19,Wilson>- 又来了,- 你自找的
<24-19,Wilson>- Here we go!,- You mean it!

547
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,660
<24-20,House>一段时间以后
<24-20,House>And then time passes,

548
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,510
<24-20,House>他们不再那么可怜了
<24-20,House>suddenly they're not so needy anymore.

549
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,280
<24-20,House>你的错
<24-20,House>Your fault.

550
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,160
<24-20,House>太照顾他们了
<24-20,House>You've been there for them too much.

551
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,210
<24-20,House>他们变得健康, 独立
<24-20,House>They're getting healthy, independent.

552
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,810
<24-20,House>然后你觉得他们没那么美了
<24-20,House>And that's just ugly.

553
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,180
<24-20,House>我的天, 你现在一定恨死上帝了
<24-20,House>God,you must be pissed at god right now.

554
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,590
<24-20,House>让她那么快乐
<24-20,House>Making her all happy.

555
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,670
<24-21,Wilson>为什么你要说这些?
<24-21,Wilson>Why are you doing this?

556
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,920
<24-22,House>因为你太蠢了
<24-22,House>Because you're being stupid.

557
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,660
<24-22,House>你知道和病人睡觉要冒很大的风险
<24-22,House>You know what you're risking by sleeping with a patient.

558
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,000
<24-23,Wilson>狗屁
<24-23,Wilson>Oh,that's crap.

559
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,210
<24-23,Wilson>你火冒三丈不是担心我的前途
<24-23,Wilson>You're not mad because i'm risking my job.

560
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,410
<24-23,Wilson>也不是因为我骗了你
<24-23,Wilson>You're not even mad because I lied to you.

561
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,590
<24-23,Wilson>真正的原因是我骗了你而你没发现
<24-23,Wilson>You're mad because i lied to you, and you couldn't tell.

562
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,460
<24-24,House>你说对了
<24-24,House>Yeah,you got me nailed.

563
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,340
<24-25,Wilson>所以你不希望我参加牌局
<24-25,Wilson>Yeah,that's why you didn't want me in your poker game.

564
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,580
<24-25,Wilson>因为如果一切都在掌握之中
<24-25,Wilson>Because when it comes to being in control,

565
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,410
<24-25,Wilson>你就会把那个靠信仰治病的孩子忘到九霄云外
<24-25,Wilson>gregory house leaves our faith healer kid in the dust.

566
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,790
<24-25,Wilson>所以宗教信仰让你恼火
<24-25,Wilson>And that's why religious belief annoys you.

567
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,310
<24-25,Wilson>因为如果世间万物都能用理论解释
<24-25,Wilson>Because if the universe operates by abstract rules,

568
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,220
<24-25,Wilson>你能学习理论并用理论保护自己
<24-25,Wilson>you can learn them, you can protect yourself.

569
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,790
<24-25,Wilson>如果上帝存在的话
<24-25,Wilson>If a supreme being exists,

570
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,350
<24-25,Wilson>随时都可以把你捏扁
<24-25,Wilson>he can squash you any time he wants.

571
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,580
<24-26,House>他知道我在哪
<24-26,House>He knows where I am.

572
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,100
<24-27,Wilson>你的电话
<24-27,Wilson>I think it's yours.

573
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,170
<24-27,Wilson>什么事
<24-27,Wilson>Yeah.

574
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,460
<24-28,House>我马上来
<24-28,House>I'll be right there.

575
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,920
<24-28,House>"耶稣"发了高烧
<24-28,House>Jesus is spiking a fever.

576
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,020
<24-28,House>产生了幻觉
<24-28,House>He's delusional.

577
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,830
<24-29,Wilson>结节性脑硬化不会引起发烧
<24-29,Wilson>Tuberous sclerosis doesn't cause fever.

578
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,810
<24-30,House>我知道
<24-30,House>I know.

579
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,900
<24-31,Wilson>我来开
<24-31,Wilson>I'll drive.

580
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,120
<25-1,House>街上随便找个人
<25-1,House>pick any random guy off the street.

581
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,380
<25-1,House>把他带来
<25-1,House>Bring him in here,

582
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,800
<25-1,House>彻底检查一下
<25-1,House>examine him exhaustively.

583
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,220
<25-1,House>会发现不下三个地方有毛病
<25-1,House>You will find at least three things wrong with him.

584
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,950
<25-1,House>这孩子得的是结节性脑硬化
<25-1,House>This kid has tuberous sclerosis.

585
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,250
<25-1,House>但不太严重
<25-1,House>A mild case.

586
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,570
<25-2,Cameron>但他的脑瘤正在变大
<25-2,Cameron>But his tumors are growing.

587
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,560
<25-3,House>我们只是推测在变大
<25-3,House>We assumed that the tumors were growing.

588
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,540
<25-3,House>因为病得更厉害了
<25-3,House>'Cause he's getting sicker.

589
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,360
<25-3,House>但是如果不是来医院检查
<25-3,House>But he could have grown old and died

590
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,260
<25-3,House>他可能变老去世后也不会知道得了这病
<25-3,House>and never known about them if he hadn't come here.

591
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,570
<25-3,House>我们要找的东西
<25-3,House>We were looking for something

592
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,530
<25-3,House>应该在他右半脑的什么位置
<25-3,House>that was more or less in the right part of the brain.

593
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,930
<25-3,House>就像我们发现有人
<25-3,House>It's like we found someone

594
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,190
<25-3,House>站在受害者身边手里拿着枪
<25-3,House>standing over a dead body holding a gun.

595
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,990
<25-3,House>就会马上逮捕, 不再追查
<25-3,House>We arrested them,didn't look any further.

596
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,070
<25-3,House>但是有时候
<25-3,House>Well,sometimes

597
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,380
<25-3,House>那人确实只是偶然闯入了犯罪现场
<25-3,House>people really do just stumble into a murder scene.

598
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,850
<25-4,Foreman>体温摄氏39.4度, 还在继续升高
<25-4,Foreman>His fever is 103 and rising.

599
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,830
<25-4,Foreman>如果不采取什么措施
<25-4,Foreman>If we don't do anything,

600
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,480
<25-4,Foreman>他马上就真的去见上帝了
<25-4,Foreman>he's gonna be chatting with god face to face real soon.

601
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,310
<25-5,House>高烧不会由长期潜伏的病症引发
<25-5,House>Fevers don't come from a long-term underlying condition.

602
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,930
<25-5,House>他那批狂热的信徒中
<25-5,House>He's a garden variety religious nut

603
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,750
<25-5,House>有人传染给他了
<25-5,House>who happens to have an infection.

604
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,330
<25-5,House>给他做腰椎穿刺术
<25-5,House>It's lumbar puncture time.

605
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,160
<25-5,House>不行
<25-5,House>No.

606
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,170
<26-1,Boyd>绝不, 上帝告诉我不能再用人类的药物了
<26-1,Boyd>No,god told me no more of man's medicine.

607
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,530
<26-1,Boyd>只要我信仰上帝, 他会把我治好的
<26-1,Boyd>If we have faith in him, he'll make me well.

608
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,750
<26-2,Cameron>只是做个检验
<26-2,Cameron>It's just a test.

609
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,360
<26-2,Cameron>我们只是想知道哪出了问题
<26-2,Cameron>We just wanna find out what's wrong.

610
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,720
<26-3,Boyd>上帝知道哪出了问题
<26-3,Boyd>God knows what's wrong.

611
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,160
<26-3,Boyd>上帝会治好我的
<26-3,Boyd>God will take care of it.

612
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,920
<26-4,Foreman>他现在神志不清, 还是未成年人
<26-4,Foreman>He's delirious, and he's a minor.

613
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,090
<26-4,Foreman>要由你来做决定, 不是他
<26-4,Foreman>This is your decision, and not his.

614
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,950
<26-5,Boyd>天国像是
<26-5,Boyd>The kingdom of heaven is like

615
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:53,970
<26-5,Boyd>藏在田野的宝藏
<26-5,Boyd>a treasure hidden in field

616
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,100
<26-5,Boyd>当你发现时
<26-5,Boyd>which when a man finds,

617
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,120
<26-5,Boyd>他又藏了起来
<26-5,Boyd>heides.

618
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,320
<26-5,Boyd>会很乐意变卖家产把那块土地买下来
<26-5,Boyd>For joy he goes and sells all he owns and buys that field.

619
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,540
<26-6,Foreman>你想买哪就买哪
<26-6,Foreman>Buy all the land you want!

620
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,780
<26-6,Foreman>别和你的大脑过不去
<26-6,Foreman>Don't blow your brains out.

621
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,460
<26-6,Foreman>你在眼睁睁看着你的孩子自杀
<26-6,Foreman>You're watching your son kill himself!

622
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,710
<26-6,Foreman>发烧使他神志不清
<26-6,Foreman>He's out of his mind with fever.

623
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,650
<26-7,Boyd>爸爸, 如果你的信仰不够坚定
<26-7,Boyd>Dad,if your faith is weak,

624
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,060
<26-7,Boyd>我会被上帝遗弃
<26-7,Boyd>I will fail.

625
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,160
<26-7,Boyd>我需要你的支持
<26-7,Boyd>I need you.

626
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,260
<26-7,Boyd>我很抱歉
<26-7,Boyd>I'm sorry.

627
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,430
<26-8,Dad>你们甚至不知道他得了什么病
<26-8,Dad>You don't even know what's wrong with him.

628
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,900
<26-8,Dad>但上帝知道
<26-8,Dad>God knows the answer.

629
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,300
<26-8,Dad>与其相信你们我宁可托付给上帝
<26-8,Dad>And I would rather leave it in his hands than yours.

630
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,690
<26-8,Dad>Wilson.
<26-8,Dad>Wilson

631
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,610
<27-1,House>该你出马了
<27-1,House>I need you to do your thing.

632
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,910
<27-2,Wilson>你知道我不是真的有魔力吧?
<27-2,Wilson>You do know that I don't actually have magical powers.

633
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,010
<27-3,House>我对你有信心
<27-3,House>I have faith.

634
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,610
<27-4,Wilson>你最好在他的饭菜里下些抗生素
<27-4,Wilson>You're better off trying to slip some antibiotics into a meal...

635
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,790
<27-5,House>哪种?
<27-5,House>which antibiotics?

636
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,510
<27-5,House>我们不知道他感染了什么
<27-5,House>We don't know what infection he's got.

637
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,880
<27-6,Wilson>越广谱越好
<27-6,Wilson>Go as broad as you can.

638
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,490
<27-7,House>算了吧
<27-7,House>Forget it.

639
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,610
<27-7,House>最大的希望就是你那三寸不烂之舌
<27-7,House>Our best hope is your silver tongue.

640
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,660
<27-8,Wilson>如果不是感染呢?
<27-8,Wilson>What if it's not an infection?

641
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,780
<27-9,House>你有没有用心
<27-9,House>Where you not paying attention

642
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,670
<27-9,House>听我讲犯罪现场的比喻?
<27-9,House>when I was doing my murder scene metaphor?

643
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,620
<27-10,Wilson>如果结节性脑硬化的确是凶手?
<27-10,Wilson>What if the tuberous sclerosis is guilty?

644
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
<27-10,Wilson>手里拿着枪
<27-10,Wilson>It had the gun in its hand,

645
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,500
<27-10,Wilson>站在...
<27-10,Wilson>it was standing over...

646
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,760
<27-11,House>不会引发高烧
<27-11,House>doesn't cause fever.

647
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,020
<27-12,Wilson>会导致其他症状
<27-12,Wilson>It causes everything else.

648
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,340
<27-12,Wilson>如果高烧就是无辜的旁观者?
<27-12,Wilson>What if the fever's the innocent bystander?

649
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,270
<27-12,Wilson>高烧可以由他接触的任何东西引发
<27-12,Wilson>Fever could have been set off,by something he picked up anywhere.

650
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,900
<27-12,Wilson>比如医院里的一只小虫
<27-12,Wilson>Could have been a bug he got here.

651
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,850
<27-13,House>或是他带来的小虫
<27-13,House>Or a bug he gave here.

652
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,460
<27-13,House>他传染给你的病人
<27-13,House>He gave it to your patient.

653
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,750
<27-13,House>所以肿瘤变小了
<27-13,House>That's why her tumor shrank.

654
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,840
<27-13,House>因为病毒先杀死癌细胞
<27-13,House>The virus went after the cancer first.

655
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,390
<27-13,House>你指病毒攻击了她的肿瘤?
<27-13,House>Are you saying a virus attacked her tumor?

656
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,800
<27-14,House>200年来
<27-14,House>For 200 years,

657
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,590
<27-14,House>有许多病例发现野生型病毒会攻击癌细胞
<27-14,House>there have been reports of wild viruses that target tumors.

658
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,620
<27-14,House>19世纪初
<27-14,House>Early 1900s,

659
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,270
<27-14,House>一期意大利医学杂志,报道了一个患子宫癌的妇女
<27-14,House>an italian medical journal wrote up a woman with cervical cancer

660
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,150
<27-14,House>通过注射一种活性不强的狂犬病毒治疗
<27-14,House>who was injected with a weak strain of rabies.

661
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,160
<27-14,House>我不知道怎么会想到这么做
<27-14,House>I have no idea why they did that,

662
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,680
<27-14,House>但是她的肿瘤萎缩了
<27-14,House>but her tumor shrank.

663
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,170
<27-15,Wilson>你觉得他把狂犬病传染给了她?
<27-15,Wilson>You think he gave her rabies?

664
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,620
<27-16,House>一种倾向于攻击癌细胞的病毒
<27-16,House>One of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells

665
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,840
<27-16,House>就是疱疹
<27-16,House>is herpes.

666
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,880
<27-16,House>疱疹病毒性脑炎
<27-16,House>Herpes encephalitis.

667
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,910
<27-17,Wilson>符合所有的情况
<27-17,Wilson>It would fit.

668
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,480
<27-17,Wilson>癫痫发作, 钠离子水平过低
<27-17,Wilson>Seizure,low sodium.

669
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,110
<27-17,Wilson>还有视觉模糊
<27-17,Wilson>Even the blurred vision.

670
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,640
<27-17,Wilson>而且这意味着
<27-17,Wilson>And it would mean

671
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,670
<27-17,Wilson>如果你是对的
<27-17,Wilson>if you're right,

672
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,720
<27-17,Wilson>Grace的癌症会继续恶化
<27-17,Wilson>grace's cancer is coming back.

673
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
<27-17,Wilson>你不可能说服他们的
<27-17,Wilson>You're not gonna be able to convince them.

674
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,950
<27-17,Wilson>他们拒绝任何的检验
<27-17,Wilson>They don't want any more tests.

675
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,790
<27-17,Wilson>不愿意...
<27-17,Wilson>They don't wanna...

676
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,660
<27-18,House>"该隐的记号"可以让他们屈服,(该隐是圣经中人物)
<27-18,House>they can't argue with the mark of cain.

677
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,940
<27-19,Boyd>我不会改变主意的
<27-19,Boyd>I'm not gonna change my mind.

678
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,230
<27-19,Boyd>不做任何检验
<27-19,Boyd>No more tests.

679
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,370
<27-19,Boyd>上帝会料理一切的
<27-19,Boyd>God knows the way.

680
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,710
<27-20,House>好吧, 我们从衬衣开始
<27-20,House>Okay,let's start with his shirt.

681
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,630
<27-21,Boyd>你要做什么?
<27-21,Boyd>What are you doing?

682
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,790
<27-21,Boyd>你要做什么?
<27-21,Boyd>What are you doing?

683
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,600
<27-22,House>这是上帝指派的任务
<27-22,House>I'm on a mission from god.

684
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,030
<27-22,House>如果你不让我脱
<27-22,House>If you won't let me undress you,

685
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,130
<27-22,House>那就自己脱
<27-22,House>then strip.

686
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,860
<27-23,Dad>他在做什么? 究竟怎么回事?
