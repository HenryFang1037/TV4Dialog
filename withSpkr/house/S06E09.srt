<5-6,Chase>- 我不是在和Cameron约会 - 抱歉 我不是故意...
<5-6,Chase>- I wasn't dating cameron.- I'm sorry.I didn't mean to--

111
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,240
<5-8,Chase>我知道你是想帮我 我很感激你 但我自己能处理好
<5-8,Chase>I know what you're doing and I appreciate it,But I've got it under control.

112
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,060
<5-9,Foreman>Dibala的事你也是这么说的 很显然你没处理好
<5-9,Foreman>that's what you said about the dibala incident.And obviously you didn't.

113
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,580
<5-10,Chase>你这么快人快语真是帮到我了
<5-10,Chase>And talking about it obviously made things so much better.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,040
<6-1,Taub>你不觉得那人有点奇怪吗?
<6-1,Taub>Didn't you think there was something weird about that guy?

115
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,790
<6-2,Thirteen>不觉得 实际上他看起来挺正常的
<6-2,Thirteen>Not really.In fact,he seemed pretty normal.

116
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,590
<6-3,Taub>我就是这意思
<6-3,Taub>That's my point.

117
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,720
<6-3,Taub>智商超高的人通常都很...不正常
<6-3,Taub>Guys with iqs off the chart are usually completely...  abnormal.

118
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,470
<6-4,Thirteen>说到House 你为什么回来?
<6-4,Thirteen>Speaking of house,why'd you come back?

119
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,010
<6-4,Thirteen>你的收入肯定大幅下降了
<6-4,Thirteen>I mean,you must've taken a major pay cut.

120
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,690
<6-5,Taub>- 人生苦短 没时间担心钱的问题 - 你太太也这么觉得吗?
<6-5,Taub>- Life's too short to worry about money. - Your wife feel the same way?

121
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,980
<6-6,Thirteen>她乐意削减一些的...比如说性生活
<6-6,Thirteen>She's happy to cut back on some things... Like sex.

122
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,700
<6-7,Taub>- 你为什么回来? - 我为什么不能回来?
<6-7,Taub>- Why'd you come back? - why wouldn't i?

123
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,830
<6-8,Thirteen>就像Foreman说的 没人生气
<6-8,Thirteen>Like foreman said,nobody's angry.

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,320
<6-8,Thirteen>没人受到伤害
<6-8,Thirteen>nobody's hurt.

125
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,660
<7-1,Taub>有裂红细胞
<7-1,Taub>Schistocytes.

126
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,130
<6-9,Taub>那说明是TTP了
<6-9,Taub>That means ttp.

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,360
<6-10,Thirteen>我们也是这么认为的 记得吗? 这可是好事
<6-10,Thirteen>which is what we thought it'd be.Remember?this is a good thing.

128
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,830
<6-11,Taub>这太简单了
<6-11,Taub>this is an easy thing.

129
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,260
<6-11,Taub>House不会选太简单的案子 也就是说他得的不是TTP
<6-11,Taub>And house doesn't take cases that are easy,which means it's not ttp,

130
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,820
<6-11,Taub>他想看看我们要花多久 才能赶上他的水平
<6-11,Taub>And he wants to see how long it takes us to catch up to him.

131
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,840
<7-1,Taub>裂红细胞说明他得的是TTP
<7-1,Taub>Schistocytes suggest ttp.

132
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,470
<7-2,House>很好 现在该怎么办?
<7-2,House>Good. now what?

133
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,730
<7-3,Thirteen>一般来说我们会使用血浆取出法 但病人对蛋白胶质过敏
<7-3,Thirteen>Normally,we'd try plasmapheresis,But the patient has an albumin colloid allergy.

134
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,850
<7-4,House>所以?
<7-4,House>So?

135
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,030
<7-5,Taub>所以我们得给他做脾切除术
<7-5,Taub>So that means we have to give him a splenectomy.

136
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,440
<7-6,House>对 没错
<7-6,House>Yes,it does.

137
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,190
<7-7,House>是Wilson吗?
<7-7,House>wilson?

138
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,820
<7-9,House>- 不是 - 知道他在哪吗?
<7-9,House>- no. - do you know where he is?

139
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,160
<7-10,Man in stall>反正不在这
<7-10,Man in stall>not in here.

140
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,850
<7-11,Thirteen>你真的要我们切除他的脾脏吗?
<7-11,Thirteen>you're sure you want us to take out his spleen.

141
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,470
<7-12,House>"脾切除术"是这意思? 我还以为是要给他吃冰激凌呢 糟糕
<7-12,House>is that what a "splenectomy" is?I thought it was an ice cream treat.Yuck.

142
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,600
<7-13,Taub>你真觉得他得了TTP? 你并不是在测试我们
<7-13,Taub>So you do really think he has ttp?you're not just testing us.

143
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,640
<7-14,House>对 我可没空逗你们玩
<7-14,House>Yeah,like I have time for games.

144
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,810
<7-15,Taub>那你究竟为什么接这个案子?
<7-15,Taub>So why did you really take this case?

145
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,810
<7-16,House>看不出来吗? 我在等人请我吃晚饭
<7-16,House>Isn't it obvious?I'm fishing for a dinner invite.

146
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,140
<8-1,House>吃早餐时我没看到你
<8-1,House>Missed you at breakfast this morning.

147
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,230
<8-1,House>午饭也没见到你
<8-1,House>And lunch.

148
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,950
<8-2,Wilson>我去看牙医了
<8-2,Wilson>I had a dentist appointment.

149
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,190
<8-3,House>知道Cuddy的姐姐住哪吗?
<8-3,House>you know where cuddy's sister lives?

150
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,640
<8-4,Wilson>这就是为什么 我从不回你的紧急传呼
<8-4,Wilson>You see,this is why I don't answer your urgent pages.

151
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,470
<8-4,Wilson>因为它们从来都不紧急
<8-4,Wilson>Because they're not urgent pages.

152
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,480
<8-5,House>我决定拿Cuddy和Lucas怎么办了
<8-5,House>I've decided what I'm gonna do about cuddy and lucas.

153
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,110
<8-5,House>- 我要拆散他们 - 当然了
<8-5,House>- I'm going to break them up. - of course.

154
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,940
<8-7,House>我的人生又有了存在意义和目标
<8-7,House>it's given me a purpose in life,a goal,a raison d'etre.

155
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,340
<8-8,Wilson>哪怕这是一个自私邪恶且幼稚的目标
<8-8,Wilson>albeit a selfish,mean-spirited,childish raison.

156
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,800
<8-9,House>在我看来 我这是做善事
<8-9,House>I think of it more as benevolent.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,340
<8-9,House>他们的关系只有两个结果
<8-9,House>There's only two possible outcomes for their relationship.

158
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,540
<8-9,House>分手 或白头偕老
<8-9,House>They split,or they stay together forever.

159
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,330
<8-9,House>要是注定分手 来得越早对大家越好
<8-9,House>If it's split,Then the sooner it happens the better for everyone.

160
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,750
<8-9,House>要是注定白头偕老 我怎捣乱也无伤大局
<8-9,House>If it's stay,then my meddling won't matter.

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,820
<8-9,House>要他们扛住了 说不定感情会更牢固
<8-9,House>In fact,if they survive it,It might even make their bond stronger.

162
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,470
<8-10,Wilson>自我中心被你掰成造福他人 真叫人叹为观止
<8-10,Wilson>How you manage to elevate your narcissism To beneficence is masterful.

163
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,410
<8-10,Wilson>我决定在感恩节晚餐上行动
<8-10,Wilson>****Indinner.

164
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,240
<9-1,House>因为我是个感性的人
<9-1,House>Just 'cause I'm sentimental.

165
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,260
<9-1,House>- 晚餐在Cuddy姐姐家进行 这就-- - House 别这么做
<9-1,House>- Dinner is at cuddy's sister's,which brings us back-- House,don't.

166
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,460
<9-3,House>我暗示Cuddy邀请我 她不上当 我只能不请自来了
<9-3,House>I fished for an invite.cuddy wasn't biting,So I'll have to crash.

167
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,530
<9-4,Wilson>我不知道Cuddy的姐姐家在哪
<9-4,Wilson>I have no idea where cuddy's sister lives.

168
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,910
<9-5,House>请求 便给你们 (引圣经)
<9-5,House>Ask and thou shalt receive.

169
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,880
<9-6,Wilson>别指望我会帮你干这个
<9-6,Wilson>You can't honestly think I would help you with this.

170
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,730
<9-7,House>不是帮我 帮Cuddy 记得吗?
<9-7,House>Not help me,help cuddy.remember?

171
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,600
<9-7,House>如果你不帮忙 就逼我用非常手段了
<9-7,House>If you don't get it,I'll be forced to use more nefarious methods.

172
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,480
<9-8,Wilson>节日快乐
<9-8,Wilson>Happy holidays.

173
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,840
<10-1,Chase>情况不错
<10-1,Chase>looks great.

174
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,070
<10-2,Dara>那么说他正在好转?
<10-2,Dara>So he's all better?

175
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,550
<10-3,Chase>他可能得长期服药 体重也轻了10盎司
<10-3,Chase>Probably be on some long-term meds,And he's about ten ounces lighter.

176
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,960
<10-3,Chase>除此以外 没别的问题
<10-3,Chase>Other than that,won't even know it's gone.

177
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,120
<10-4,Dara>听到了吗 亲爱的?
<10-4,Dara>Did you hear that,honey?

178
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,670
<10-4,Dara>你很快就会好起来了
<10-4,Dara>you're gonna be just fine.

179
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,160
<10-5,Sidas>我什么时候才能出院?
<10-5,Sidas>When can I get out of here?

180
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,110
<10-6,Chase>一切正常的话 一周之内
<10-6,Chase>Everything checks out,less than a week.

181
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,020
<10-7,Sidas>好极了 那些盒子为啥五颜六色的
<10-7,Sidas>good,'cause those boxes Aren't gonna deliver colors.

182
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,490
<10-8,Chase>颜色?
<10-8,Chase>Colors?

183
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,900
<10-9,Sidas>绿色...橘色...还有天花板
<10-9,Sidas>green...  And orange... And ceiling.

184
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,810
<10-10,Chase>Sidas先生 你知道自己在哪吗?
<10-10,Chase>Mr.sidas,do you know where you are?

185
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,120
<10-11,Sidas>咬住
<10-11,Sidas>Chewing.

186
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,670
<10-12,Dara>Jimmy?
<10-12,Dara>Jimmy?

187
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,790
<10-13,Sidas>- 衬衣... - 他中风了
<10-13,Sidas>- Shirt... - He's stroking.

188
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,330
<10-14,Chase>通知心脏插管室
<10-14,Chase>call the cath lab now.

189
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,630
<10-15,Dara>噢 上帝
<10-15,Dara>Oh,my god.

190
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,560
<11-1,Chase>及时恢复供血 没有造成永久性伤害
<11-1,Chase>Blood flow's restored.there appears to be no permanent damage.

191
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,290
<11-2,House>好消息是 这成了一个刺激好玩的病例
<11-2,House>Good news is it turns out to be an exciting,action-packed Thrill ride of a case after all.

192
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,220
<11-3,Chase>坏消息是 我们白白摘掉了他的脾
<11-3,Chase>Bad news is we took out his spleen for nothing.

193
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,500
<11-4,House>感谢上帝 他的阑尾和扁桃腺都还在
<11-4,House>Thank god he's still got his appendix and tonsils.

194
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,880
<11-4,House>那么 什么临床症状像TTP 检测结果像TTP 却不是TTP?
<11-4,House>so what looks like ttp,acts like ttp,Tests like ttp,but isn't ttp?

195
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,780
<11-5,Taub>中枢神经系统血管炎可以解释 共济失调 贫血 也许还有中风
<11-5,Taub>Cns vasculitis explains ataxia,and anemia,maybe the stroke.

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,420
<11-6,Foreman>照CT时应该有所发现
<11-6,Foreman>Ct would've picked up something.

197
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,690
<11-7,House>嗨 我叫Greg House 你妹妹Lisa的朋友
<11-7,House>Hi,I'm greg house,a friend of your sister lisa.

198
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,290
<11-8,Thirteen>可能是弥散性血管内凝血
<11-8,Thirteen>Could be dic.

199
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,660
<11-9,House>Lisa Cuddy

<11-10,Thirteen>- 对不起 打错了 - 你要问吗?
<11-10,Thirteen>- sorry.wrong number. - You gonna ask?

201
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,430
<11-11,Taub>我敢肯定他有个完美的合理解释
<11-11,Taub>I'm sure he's got a perfectly logical explanation.

202
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,540
<11-12,House>不是弥散性血管内凝血 没有出血症状
<11-12,House>Can't be dic.no hemorrhaging.

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,220
<11-12,House>我要打遍方圆100里内的 12个Julia Cuddy
<11-12,House>And I'm calling all 12 julia cuddys Within a 100-mile radius.

204
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,350
<11-13,Taub>看到没? 多合理啊
<11-13,Taub>See?completely reasonable.

205
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,720
<11-13,Taub>获得性再生性贫血?
<11-13,Taub>acquired pancytopenia.

206
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,010
<11-14,Chase>- 白血球计数正常 - 嘿 Julia
<11-14,Chase>- wbc's normal. - Hey,julia.

207
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,370
<11-15,House>你是 呃-- 你是Lisa的姐姐 对吧?
<11-15,House>you're,uh-- you're lisa's sister,right?

208
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,090
<11-15,House>你确定? 因为你是12号了
<11-15,House>You sure?'cause you are number 12.

209
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,480
<11-16,Thirteen>可能她嫁人后改了姓
<11-16,Thirteen>Maybe she got married and changed her name.

210
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,330
<11-18,House>- Otis Campbell (电视角色) - 总不会名字都改了吧
<11-18,House>- Otis campbell. - Probably kept her first name.

211
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,330
<11-19,Foreman>毒理学记忆法 O代表有机磷酸酯类 T是三环类 I是胰岛素类
<11-19,Foreman>the mnemonic for toxins.O for organophosphates,t for tricyclics,i for insulin.

212
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,970
<11-19,Foreman>我记的是"moist place" (潮湿的地方)
<11-19,Foreman>Or as I remember it,"moist place.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,440
<11-20,Thirteen>但这个place有两个l 还有个不发音的b
<11-20,Thirteen>" That's "place" spelled with two "l"s and a silent "b.

214
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,720
<11-20,Thirteen>但毒物筛检呈阴性
<11-20,Thirteen>" Except the tox screen was negative.

215
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,290
<11-21,Chase>只是常规性毒检-- 不能验出非常规性毒素
<11-21,Chase>Standard tox screen--unstandard toxins don't show up on it.

216
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,890
<11-22,House>你们俩做个非常规毒检 你们俩去搜索他家
<11-22,House>You two do an unstandard tox screen,You two search his home.

217
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,330
<11-22,House>Otis Campbell肯定藏在某个地方
<11-22,House>Otis campbell's got to be hiding somewhere.

<13-11,Cuddy>你要么在耍我 要么是想让我知道 你真的变了
<13-11,Cuddy>either you're trying to screw with me,Or you're trying to show me that you've really changed.

261
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,170
<13-12,House>究竟是哪个? 我很想知道
<13-12,House>So which is it?I'm dying to know.

265
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,630
<14-2,Wilson>这可有三小时车程

<14-2,Wilson>你有没想过 这地址可能是假的?

<14-3,House>你认为她会把我骗到一个 空荡荡的停车场过感恩节?
<14-3,House>You think she'd send me to a vacant lot For thanksgiving dinner?

00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,950
<17-9,Thirteen>那么说我们在浪费时间
<17-9,Thirteen>So it was a waste of time.

328
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,290
<17-10,Taub>除非不是肝的问题致白蛋白升高 而是肾
<17-10,Taub>unless it's not his liver that's elevating his albumen.It's his kidneys.

329
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,150
<17-11,Thirteen>肾衰竭解释了贫血
<17-11,Thirteen>renal failure explains the anemia.

330
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,880
<17-11,Thirteen>如果血钙过多 就解释了共济失调
<17-11,Thirteen>If he developed hyperkalemia,that would explain the ataxia.

<17-12,Taub>漂亮
<17-12,Taub>Nice.

333
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,310
<17-13,Thirteen>但我们得留下检查他的肾了
<17-13,Thirteen>Except now we have to stay and test his kidneys.

334
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,020
<18-1,House>钥匙在门毯下

<18-2,Lucas>我没把钥匙放门毯下
<18-2,Lucas>There's no key under the mat.

336
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,350
<18-3,House>哦 对了
<18-3,House>oh,right.

337
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,130
<18-3,House>你得在厨房窗户下重新放把钥匙了
<18-3,House>You need to replace one of your kitchen windows.

<18-3,House>你对她不适合
<18-3,House>you're not right for her.

341
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,110
<18-5,House>- 你就适合了? - 没那么离谱
<18-5,House>- And you are? - Less wrong.

342
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,880
<18-6,Lucas>我开始想...
<18-6,Lucas>Then I started thinking...

343
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,150
<18-7,House>我说什么来着?
<18-7,House>What was I saying?

344
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,450
<18-8,Lucas>- 你说时候不早了 你该... - 她邀请我去了
<18-8,Lucas>- You were saying it's late,and... - She invited me.

345
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:12,730
<18-9,House>她不知是否该这么做 她想知道 我是真的变了...
<18-9,House>she didn't know if she should.She was trying to figure out if I really have changed or...

346
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,910
<18-9,House>抑或还是原来那个混蛋
<18-9,House>If I'm just the same old s.o.b.I've always been.

347
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,150
<18-9,House>她总是给我机会
<18-9,House>But she always gave me a chance.

348
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,750
<18-9,House>832次机会
<18-9,House>832 chances.

349
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,950
<18-9,House>每一次都白费了
<18-9,House>and I used up every one of them.

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,980
<18-9,House>832是她的极限 你记下来
<18-9,House>832's her limit.Make a note.

351
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,380
<18-10,Lucas>喝杯咖啡么?
<18-10,Lucas>How 'bout a cup of coffee?

352

<18-10,Lucas>It's just instant,but...

353
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,100
<18-11,House>我真可悲
<18-11,House>I'm pathetic.

354
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,580
<18-11,House>我配不上她
<18-11,House>I don't deserve her.

355
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,620
<18-12,Lucas>好了 来
<18-12,Lucas>Okay,okay,all right.

<18-12,Lucas>Uh,here.

357
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,720
<18-12,Lucas>倒在这儿更好
<18-12,Lucas>Maybe you should crash here.

358
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,050
<18-12,Lucas>这是张沙发床
<18-12,Lucas>It's a sofa bed.

365
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,190
<19-5,Chase>所以估计不赖

<19-10,Chase>如果引起他咳嗽的不是感冒呢?
<19-10,Chase>Well,what if his cough is more than just a cold?

371
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,800
<19-11,Thirteen>他没咳嗽
<19-11,Thirteen>He hasn't been coughing.

<19-12,Chase>他病史里有 而且他药柜里有止咳糖浆
<19-12,Chase>It's in his history,and we found A new bottle of cough syrup in his medicine cabinet.

<19-16,Foreman>他不回传呼 我们应该可以做主
<19-16,Foreman>he's not answering his pager.Looks like he's leaving it up to us.

<20-4,Chase>- What if you don't? - Then we keep doing it until he gets a transplant.

382

<20-5,Dara>之前你们很确定是脾脏的问题 后来又说是肝脏
<20-5,Dara>you were sure it was his spleen,And then you were sure it was his liver,

383
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,350
<20-5,Dara>当时他还反驳过 现在你们又确定是肾脏出问题了
<20-5,Dara>which he told you it wasn't,and now you're sure it's his kidneys.

384
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,860
<20-6,Thirteen>肯定是肾脏问题没错
<20-6,Thirteen>it's definitely his kidneys.

385
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,890
<20-6,Thirteen>只是还不知病因是什么
<20-6,Thirteen>We just don't know why it's his kidneys.

<21-3,Thirteen>I started seeing a counselor after my diagnosis.

389
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,760
<21-3,Thirteen>她挺不错的
<21-3,Thirteen>She's really good.

390
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,060
<21-4,Chase>为啥大家都觉得天下所有人一样呢?
<21-4,Chase>Why does everyone assume that everyone works In the exact same way?

391
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,430
<21-4,Chase>本来就差不多啊
<21-4,Chase>We pretty much do.

392
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,240
<21-5,Thirteen>我们以为人人都不相同 像雪花那样 但这只是自负作祟
<21-5,Thirteen>Our egos want us to think we're all snowflakes,No two alike,

393
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,740
<21-5,Thirteen>但实质上我们想要的都一样

<22-2,House>我都不记得自己是咋过来的 更别提说了些啥了
<22-2,House>I don't remember how I got here,never mind what I said.

<22-3,Cuddy>我刚跟他聊过 他说我们最好不要再见面了
<22-3,Cuddy>well,i just talked to him.And he said he thought it'd be better If we stopped seeing each other.

400
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,200
<22-3,Cuddy>他说他没意识到 我跟你之间还有那么多未了之情
<22-3,Cuddy>Said he didn't realize How much there still was between you and me,

<22-3,Cuddy>他不想破坏我们可能的未来
<22-3,Cuddy>And he didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.

402
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,110
<22-4,House>我当时醉了
<22-4,House>I was drunk.

403
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,970
<22-4,House>- 不管我说了啥 他都不该... - 我真的受够了 House
<22-4,House>- Whatever I said,he can't really--  I've had enough,house.

404
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,840
<22-5,Cuddy>骗了你之后 我还真觉得内疚
<22-5,Cuddy>I actually felt bad about scamming you.

405
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,330
<22-5,Cuddy>可你不仅辜负了我的期望 而且还得寸进尺
<22-5,Cuddy>But then you lived down to my expectations and then some.

<22-5,Cuddy>从没有"我们"这回事
<22-5,Cuddy>There is no "us.

<23-2,Wilson>求你告诉我 你说的是某医疗手段
<23-2,Wilson>Please tell me you're talking about a medical procedure.

<23-4,Wilson>你觉得她接下来就会跟你约会了?
<23-4,Wilson>And you think she'll start dating you?

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,550
<23-4,Wilson>我敢肯定 她恨死你了
<23-4,Wilson>I'm sure she hates you.

414
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,470
<23-5,House>但她的眼神是说 "网球课的钱我该咋付给你呢?"
<23-5,House>But her eyes say,"how will I ever pay you for that tennis lesson?

<24-8,Dara>Why would you do that?

440
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,110
<24-8,Dara>你那么有天赋 为何要糟蹋掉呢?
<24-8,Dara>If you had a-- A gift,why would you just throw it away?

441
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,200
<24-9,Sidas>我不是要糟蹋掉 只是不想要那么聪明
<24-9,Sidas>I didn't throw it away.I just turned it down a little.

442
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,790
<24-9,Sidas>我脑袋不那么灵光的时候 就不会感觉那么痛苦
<24-9,Sidas>When my brain was on low,Everything didn't seem so miserable anymore.

<24-13,Sidas>没了它 我想我活不下去
<24-13,Sidas>I don't think I can live without it.

<24-14,House>不要太惊讶 人没了啥都能活
<24-14,House>You'd be surprised what you can live without.

<25-9,Sidas>差91分哎 亲缘关系上她跟长臂猿更相近哎
<25-9,Sidas>91 points.In relation,she's closer to a gibbon than she is to me.

466
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,980
<25-9,Sidas>跟她做爱简直就像兽奸
<25-9,Sidas>Having sex with her would be an act of bestiality.

467
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,950
<25-10,Foreman>我猜想你不是因为她 精通应用物理才娶她的吧
<25-10,Foreman>I assume you didn't marry her for her skill in applied physics.

468
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,660
<25-11,Sidas>她连这个词都拼不对
<25-11,Sidas>I just wish she could spell it.

469
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,100
<25-12,Foreman>你真觉得 跟个拼写功夫更厉害的人一起 你会更开心?

<25-13,Sidas>这就是问题所在
<25-13,Sidas>That's the problem.

472

<25-13,Sidas>我自己才是个混账 我欠她一辈子
<25-13,Sidas>I'm the one who's a jerk.But I owe her everything.

<25-13,Sidas>我很希望自己想跟她在一起
<25-13,Sidas>I want to want to be with her.

474
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,560
<25-13,Sidas>但我意识清醒时 我做不到
<25-13,Sidas>And when I'm clear,i... I can't.

<26-2,Ronnie>看病是不是都得等这么久?
<26-2,Ronnie>Is the wait always this long?

477
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,310
<26-3,House>每周只有七天是这样 腹泻? 减重?
<26-3,House>Only on days that end in "day." Diarrhea,weight loss?

478

<26-4,Ronnie>有点吧
<26-4,Ronnie>A bit.

479
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,290
<26-4,Ronnie>你都不刮胡子的咩?
<26-4,Ronnie>Don't you ever shave?

<26-6,Ronnie>every now and then.Are you this rude to all your patients?

483
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,980
<26-7,House>当然了 别以为你是例外
<26-7,House>Oh,yes.don't think you're special.

484
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,890
<26-7,House>好啦 我们有了这么多 模糊的 无法证实的症状
<26-7,House>So we've got a lot of vague,unverifiable symptoms.

485
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,090
<26-7,House>但所有体征都无比正常
<26-7,House>Yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal.

486
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,900
<26-9,House>- 你觉得我得了啥病? - 我不确定 但我觉着是...
<26-9,House>- What do you think I have? - I'm not sure,but I think it's...

<26-9,House>- 一份破任务 - 什么?
<26-9,House>- A lame job. - What?

488
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,070
<26-11,House>你是卧底吧 保险公司派你 来试探我们医疗水平如何
<26-11,House>You're a rat.Insurance company sends you out To check on the quality of medical care.

489
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,250
<26-12,Ronnie>- 亏你想得出 - 我说对了吧?
<26-12,Ronnie>- that's ridiculous. - Is it really?

490
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,410
<26-13,House>因为你不爱回答问题 反而对问问题更感兴趣
<26-13,House>'cause you seem a lot more interested In asking questions than answering them.

491
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,850
<26-13,House>你病历上的字显然不是个医生写的 因为我全都能读懂哎
<26-13,House>Handwriting on your medical records is obviously Not a doctor's 'cause I can almost read it.

492
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,940
<26-13,House>而且你刚出去取尿样的时候 我翻了下你的小包包
<26-13,House>And when you went out for a urine sample,I looked in your purse.

493
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,980
<26-13,House>找到个小单子 上面写着 你来门诊之前要背过的问题
<26-13,House>Found the list of questions you were supposed to memorize Before you came to the clinic.

494
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,040
<26-13,House>我本来是想找口香糖的
<26-13,House>I was looking for gum.

<26-14,Ronnnie>- 你可真混账 - 写到你报告里呗
<26-14,Ronnnie>- You're an ass. - Put it in your report.

<26-15,House>这样吧 要是你一会出门的时候 假装我人很好的样子 我就给你20块
<26-15,House>I tell you what.I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I'm not When we leave this room.

497
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,060

<27-1,House>Remember,first ice,then heat.If you have any problems,don't hesitate to call me.

<27-4,Jeffrey>Gone for the day.

501
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,630
<27-5,House>抱歉 我不记得是否就 你一个大男人做小护士的事取笑过你
<27-5,House>Sorry.I can't remember if I've mocked you yet For being a male nurse.

502
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,430
<27-6,Jeffrey>这次就是了
<27-6,Jeffrey>I think this counts.

503
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,790
<27-7,House>不错
<27-7,House>Fair enough.

504
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,770
<28-1,Dara>我嫁的男人不是这样的
<28-1,Dara>That isn't the man I married.

505
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,210
<28-2,Foreman>还是他 只是聪明了些 给他点时间吧
<28-2,Foreman>Yes,he is.He's just smarter.give him some time.

506
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,780
<28-3,Dara>- 我敢肯定... - 他恨我啊
<28-3,Dara>- I'm sure-- He hates me.

507
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,420
<28-4,Foreman>他的身体正在康复 他正在适应
<28-4,Foreman>his body is going through withdrawal.He's adjusting.

508
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,480
<28-5,Dara>也许他从没爱过我 没真爱过我
<28-5,Dara>maybe he never loved me.not really.

509
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,820
<28-5,Dara>也许我们之间 其实什么都没有
<28-5,Dara>Maybe we never really had anything at all.

510
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,940
<28-6,Sidas>来个人啊!
<28-6,Sidas>somebody help!

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,680
<28-6,Sidas>我的腿没知觉了
<28-6,Sidas>I can't feel my legs.

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,860
<28-6,Sidas>整条腿 都没感觉
<28-6,Sidas>Anywhere.Nothing.

00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,090
<29-1,Taub>我们得谈谈这事
<29-1,Taub>We have to talk about this.

514
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,410
<29-2,Rachel>很晚了 我累了
<29-2,Rachel>It's late.I'm tired.

515
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,760
<29-3,Taub>我知道收入会变少 但赚钱的机会总是有
<29-3,Taub>I know it's a big pay cut,Bubut I'll always have the chance to make money.

516
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,700
<29-3,Taub>我做这份工作的机会却仅此一次
<29-3,Taub>i won't always have the chance to do this job.

517
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,910
<29-4,Rachel>你是这么以为的? 以为我在乎的是钱?
<29-4,Rachel>That's what you think?that it's about the money?

518
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,410
<29-5,Taub>那你是不满 我没先问问你就接了这工作?
<29-5,Taub>So it's that I didn't consult you  before I took the job?

519
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,020
<29-6,Rachel>那的确让人恼火 但也不是这原因
<29-6,Rachel>That was offensive,but it's not about that either.

520
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,040
<29-7,Taub>那是...
<29-7,Taub>so then...

521
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,210
<29-7,Taub>起码告诉我首字母是啥吧?
<29-7,Taub>Can you give me the first letter?

522
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,440
<29-8,Rachel>我们刚结婚的时候 你还是实习生 没日没夜地干苦力活
<29-8,Rachel>When we got married,You were an intern working 30-hour shifts doing grunt work.

523
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,660
<29-8,Rachel>但我们都熬过来了 因为我们都知道苦尽会甜来
<29-8,Rachel>and we both put up with it   because we knew that it was leading to something better.

524
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,650
<29-8,Rachel>你自己开诊所时 你就是老大
<29-8,Rachel>in your private practice,you are the boss.

525
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,120
<29-8,Rachel>啥事都由你做主 但你现在都40了 你还是在给人干苦力活
<29-8,Rachel>You call the shots,But now you're 40 years old,you're still doing grunt work.

526
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,110
<29-9,Taub>你就是为这生气? 你觉得我是个懦夫?
<29-9,Taub>That's what this is about?you think I'm a wuss?

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,910
<29-10,Rachel>他让你错过了感恩节晚餐

551
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,150
<31-9,Cuddy>否则我就必须让他接受心理咨询

<38-10,Cuddy>- 好吧 - 明天见
<38-10,Cuddy>- Okay. - I'll see you tomorrow.

650
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,440
<39-1,House>他们没分手
<39-1,House>They didn't split up.

651
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,080
<39-1,House>她不肯接受这票
<39-1,House>She wouldn't take the tickets.

652
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,180
<39-2,Wilson>当然了 这是"我们没分手"的风中密码
<39-2,Wilson>Of course.Windtalker code for "we never split up.

653
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,600
<39-2,Wilson>House 她告诉你无数次她不想跟你扯上关系
<39-2,Wilson>" House,she told you multiple times She wants nothing to do with you.

654
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,690
<39-3,House>我又不去
<39-3,House>I wasn't gonna be there.

655
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:41,390
<39-3,House>她只是因我感到内疚而内疚 所以她不能拿
<39-3,House>She just felt guilty that I felt guilty,so she couldn't take them.

656
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,670
<39-4,Wilson>也有可能是她不想满足你
<39-4,Wilson>Either that or she didn't want to appease you.

657
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,830
<39-5,House>我没想要修复关系
<39-5,House>These weren't reparations.

658
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:50,370
<39-5,House>只是表现得很自责 但她一挥手就拒绝了
<39-5,House>Just a simple gesture of remorse,And she slapped it down.

659
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,340
<39-7,House>他们没分手
<39-7,House>They didn't break up.

660
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,110
<39-5,House>她只是想让我这么想然后自己退却
<39-5,House>She just wanted me to think that so I'd back off.

661
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,450
<39-6,Wilson>我能问问你以后怎么打算吗?
<39-6,Wilson>Dare I ask what you're gonna do?

662
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,330
<39-6,Wilson>没打算
<39-6,Wilson>Nothing.

663
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,010
<39-7,House>我说过他们要么分手要么白头偕老 他们没分手
<39-7,House>I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together.They didn't break up.

664
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,850
<39-8,Wilson>而你对这没意见?
<39-8,Wilson>And you're okay with that?

665
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,430
<39-9,House>就这样吧
<39-9,House>It is what it is.

666
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,950
<39-10,Wilson>能这么想就好
<39-10,Wilson>Good for you.

667
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,120
<40-1,Cuddy>House知道我骗了他
<40-1,Cuddy>House knows I lied.

668
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,320
<40-2,Lucas>为什么? 他说什么了?
<40-2,Lucas>Why? what'd he say?

669
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
<40-3,Cuddy>没什么 我能看出来
<40-3,Cuddy>Nothing.I could just tell.

670
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,320
<40-4,Lucas>- 你想表演另一场分手吗? - 不
<40-4,Lucas>- You want to stage another breakup? - No.

671
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,760
<40-5,Cuddy>看起来他好像放弃了
<40-5,Cuddy>It seems like he's gonna leave us alone.

672
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,250
<40-6,Lucas>他为什么这么做?
<40-6,Lucas>Why would he do that?

673
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,030
<40-7,Cuddy>我也不完全肯定
<40-7,Cuddy>I'm not completely sure.

674
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,550
<40-8,Lucas>那么 我们得到他的祝福了?
<40-8,Lucas>So,we have his blessing?

675
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,390
<40-9,Cuddy>我想是吧
<40-9,Cuddy>I guess so.

676
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:05,230
<40-10,Lucas>可能House毕竟没那么坏
<40-10,Lucas>Maybe House isn't so bad after all.

677
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,240
<40-11,Cuddy>这很好 不是吗?
<40-11,Cuddy>That would be nice,wouldn't it?
