00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,670
<9-13,AMBER VOLAKIS>为什么你要隐藏一切?
<9-13,AMBER VOLAKIS>Why are you hiding everything?

225
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,930
<9-13,AMBER VOLAKIS>之所以这么问是因为你把一切藏心底
<9-13,AMBER VOLAKIS>And I'm asking you that question/because you're hiding everything.

226
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,180
<9-13,AMBER VOLAKIS>你有不妥
<9-13,AMBER VOLAKIS>There's something/seriously wrong with you.

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,520
<9-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>我认为你是有意这么做的
<9-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>I think you're doing this on purpose

231
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,610
<9-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>因为你知道House容易被激起好奇心
<9-14,AMBER VOLAKIS>because you know house/will be intrigued.

<9-19,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Ankles.They buried the/guy the wrong way around.

239

<10-1,LISA CUDDY>医生休息室满是泥巴
<10-1,LISA CUDDY>The doctor's lounge is covered in mud.

240

<10-3,LISA CUDDY>你要不是让他们去挖尸
<10-3,LISA CUDDY>Either you had them dig up a body,

244

<10-3,LISA CUDDY>就是准备建条铁路
<10-3,LISA CUDDY>or you're building a railroad.

245

<10-4,GREG HOUSE>一点点脑组织而已 不然浪费了
<10-4,GREG HOUSE>A little tiny piece of/his brain.Seemed a waste.

246
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,360
<10-4,GREG HOUSE>- 反正他不会再用了/- 这就是你的辩护?
<10-4,GREG HOUSE>- He wasn't using it anymore./- That's your defense?

247
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,330
<10-5,LISA CUDDY>"我们就这样肢解了他"?
<10-5,LISA CUDDY>"we just dismembered him"?

248
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,550
<10-6,GREG HOUSE>他们在查克雅氏病病原
<10-6,GREG HOUSE>They're looking for creutzfeldt-jakob.

<10-10,GREG HOUSE>刚好有个人能干这活

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,150
<10-13,GREG HOUSE>别担心 剩下那个不是因为原则而不同意
<10-13,GREG HOUSE>But don't worry,the one who/didn't didn't stand on principle.

258
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,420
<10-13,GREG HOUSE>只是要换尿片而已
<10-13,GREG HOUSE>He just had a diaper to change.

259
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,130
<10-13,GREG HOUSE>我实在想不出要淘汰谁了
<10-13,GREG HOUSE>I really think there are no/bad choices in this group.

260
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,620
<11-1,GREG HOUSE>你们进来时不擦脚吗?
<11-1,GREG HOUSE>You guys don't wipe your feet/when you come in the house?

261
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,360
<11-2,GREG HOUSE>医生休息室 赶紧去
<11-2,GREG HOUSE>Doctor's lounge.Let's go.

262
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,590
<11-3,CHRIS TAUB>为什么是我?
<11-3,CHRIS TAUB>Why me?

263
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,070
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>我不能叫黑人或女人去做啊
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>I can't ask the black guy or/one of the chicks to do it,

264
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,320
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>这样太不善解人意了
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>that would be insensitive.

265
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,340
<11-5,CHRIS TAUB>你又不能让Bosley做
<11-5,CHRIS TAUB>And you can't ask bosley

266
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,910
<11-5,CHRIS TAUB>因为这样你就请了非医生做闲事了
<11-5,CHRIS TAUB>because that'd look like you only hired/the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.

267
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,200
<11-6,GREG HOUSE>拖延时间 你还是得去清洁
<11-6,GREG HOUSE>You keep stalling,you're/still gonna clean up,

268
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,050
<11-6,GREG HOUSE>到时候可没有拖把了
<11-6,GREG HOUSE>but I won't let you have the mop.

269
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,260
<11-7,TRAVIS BRENNAN>克雅氏病阴性
<11-7,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Sample came back negative/for creutzfeldt-jakob.

270
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,560
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>这次讨论持续不久啊
<11-8,GREG HOUSE>Well,that discussion didn't last long.

271
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,440
<11-9,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我想不出还有别的了
<11-9,TRAVIS BRENNAN>I just don't know what else there is.

272
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,220
<11-9,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我们有个想法
<11-9,TRAVIS BRENNAN>We had an idea.

273
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,630
<11-9,TRAVIS BRENNAN>却是错的
<11-9,TRAVIS BRENNAN>It was wrong.

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,280
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>那我们可以回家了
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>Well,we can go home.

275
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,370
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>我们不知道她得了什么病
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>I mean,we have no idea/what's wrong with her.

276
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,170
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>那么有可能是良性的
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>Which means it could/be completely benign.

277
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,400
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>或者运气不好的话会害死她
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>Or,on the off chance/that it'skillingher,

278
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,100
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>我们可以从头再来
<11-10,GREG HOUSE>we could take it again from the top.

279
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,660
<12-1,IRENE WALESA>你们已经全验过了
<12-1,IRENE WALESA>You've already done everything.

<13-1,GREG HOUSE>冒犯了尸体 挖出了死尸
<13-1,GREG HOUSE>violated a cadaver's/privacy,dug up a body,

292
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,730
<13-2,GREG HOUSE>却错过了一个事实
<13-2,GREG HOUSE>but missed the fact

<13-3,GREG HOUSE>It'd be nice if one of you/angels、morons had a clue why.

296
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,170
<13-4,CHRIS TAUB>我们问过病史了/她从没提过见到听到不寻常的东西
<13-4,CHRIS TAUB>We did a full history.She never mentioned/seeing or hearing anything unusual.

<13-5,GREG HOUSE>要是她什么都没说
<13-5,GREG HOUSE>Oh,well,as long as she/never said anything.

301
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,070
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>那么我们所有检查都做一次
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>Then either we're about to/meet the alpha and omega,

302
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,260
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>否则一定会错过什么

322
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,980
<14-2,AMBER VOLAKIS>那我们或许能把范围缩小点
<14-2,AMBER VOLAKIS>if you could rember what/your mother died from.

427
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,990
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>因为-如果那个濒临脑死亡的病人/觉得我相信了她
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>Because if my soon-to-be brain-dead/patient thinks that I believe her,

428
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,790
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>也许她会允许我和她妈妈的灵魂聊聊
<18-10,GREG HOUSE>maybe she'll let me chat/with her mother's ghost.

429
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,990
<18-11,JAMES WILSON>和那个不存在的妈妈聊?
<18-11,JAMES WILSON>The one you don't believe exists.

430
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,390
<18-12,GREG HOUSE>没错 那灵魂是她的幻觉/也就是妄想症的一种体现
<18-12,GREG HOUSE>Exactly. The ghost is a hallucination,/ which is the result of a delusion

431
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,790
<18-12,GREG HOUSE>基本可以推断是遗传类疾病
<18-12,GREG HOUSE>which most likely is the/result of a hereditary disease

432
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,890
<18-12,GREG HOUSE>也就是她四岁时 她母亲的死因
<18-12,GREG HOUSE>that her mother died from/when the patient was four.

433
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,990
<18-13,JAMES WILSON>而你认为你可以通过和她的幻觉沟通
<18-13,JAMES WILSON>And you think you can tap/into her subconscious memory

434
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,090
<18-13,JAMES WILSON>从而找到深藏在她记忆下的潜意识
<18-13,JAMES WILSON>by tapping into her hallucination.

435
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,890
<18-14,GREG HOUSE>她也许不清楚她母亲的死因
<18-14,GREG HOUSE>She might not know what/caused her mother's death,

436
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,390
<18-14,GREG HOUSE>但是她应记得她母亲死前的一些症状
<18-14,GREG HOUSE>but she will know how/she acted before she died.

437
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,090
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>你很佩服自己是吧
<18-15,JAMES WILSON>You're quite impressed with/yourself right now, aren't you?

438
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,690
<18-16,GREG HOUSE>谁不会呢
<18-16,GREG HOUSE>Who wouldn't be?

439
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,790
<18-16,GREG HOUSE>好了 差不多是时候了
<18-16,GREG HOUSE>Well,that should be long enough.

440
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,890
<18-16,GREG HOUSE>马上回来
<18-16,GREG HOUSE>Back in a flash.

441
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,690
<18-17,JAMES WILSON>不用急
<18-17,JAMES WILSON>Take your time.

442
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,690
<19-1,GREG HOUSE>我祖父还在吗
<19-1,GREG HOUSE>Is my grandfather still here?

443
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,690
<19-2,IRENE WALESA>不
<19-2,IRENE WALESA>no.

444
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,590
<19-3,CONNIE WALESA>应该等会就回来了
<19-3,CONNIE WALESA>He should be right back.

445
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,390
<19-4,IRENE WALESA>他出去买些热牛奶
<19-4,IRENE WALESA>He just went to get some warm milk.

446
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,690
<19-5,GREG HOUSE>那你母亲还在吧
<19-5,GREG HOUSE>But your mom's still here, right?

447
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,290
<19-6,IRENE WALESA>当然
<19-6,IRENE WALESA>Yes,of course.

448
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,290
<19-7,GREG HOUSE>我知道她现在很健康/不过在你4,5岁的时候 她是不是病了
<19-7,GREG HOUSE>I know she's fine now, but when/you were 4 or 5,she got sick.

449
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,490
<19-8,IRENE WALESA>没有
<19-8,IRENE WALESA>no.

450
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,690
<19-9,GREG HOUSE>你确定?
<19-9,GREG HOUSE>You sure?

451
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,290
<19-9,GREG HOUSE>她有没有感到疼痛
<19-9,GREG HOUSE>She wasn't in any pain?

452
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,090
<19-10,CONNIE WALESA>我没觉得哪里痛
<19-10,CONNIE WALESA>I wasn't in pain.

453
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,690
<19-11,IRENE WALESA>她只是经常疲劳
<19-11,IRENE WALESA>She was just tired.

454
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,890
<19-11,IRENE WALESA>有些时候她会整日卧床
<19-11,IRENE WALESA>And sometimes she would/stay in bed all day.

455
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,990
<19-12,GREG HOUSE>她曾跌倒过吗
<19-12,GREG HOUSE>Did she ever fall down?

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,190
<19-12,GREG HOUSE>当然
<19-12,GREG HOUSE>Of course.

457
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,490
<19-13,CONNIE WALESA>谁都会偶尔跌倒
<19-13,CONNIE WALESA>Everyone falls down once in awhile.

458
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,590
<19-14,IRENE WALESA>有时 没那么频繁
<19-14,IRENE WALESA>Sometimes.Not that often.

459
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,890
<19-15,GREG HOUSE>大约多久一次
<19-15,GREG HOUSE>How often?

460
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,390
<19-16,CONNIE WALESA>也许比偶尔多一些
<19-16,CONNIE WALESA>Maybe it was actually/more than once in awhile.

461
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,990
<19-16,CONNIE WALESA>记得在洗手间那次吗
<19-16,CONNIE WALESA>Remember that time in the bathroom?

462
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,490
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>有那么几次吧
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>A few times.

463
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,090
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>曾有一次她的头撞到了盥洗池上
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>Once she hit her head/on the bathroom sink.

464
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,590
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>地板上都全都是血
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>There was blood all over the floor.

465
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,190
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>连我套衫上都是
<19-17,IRENE WALESA>I got it on my sweater.

466
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,190
<19-18,IRENE WALESA>他们把她送走了
<19-18,IRENE WALESA>They took her away.

467
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,890
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>对 把她送去医院治疗
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>To the place where the/doctor made her better.

468
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,590
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>在她摔倒之前/你有留意她的手脚活动吗
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>But before that, what/about her arms and legs?

469
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,790
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>是否有时走路有点滑稽
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>Did she ever walk funny?

470
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,990
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>有些勾背
<19-19,GREG HOUSE>Like sort of bent over?

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,190
<19-20,CONNIE WALESA>我一直以为/那是小时候在农场干活累出来的
<19-20,CONNIE WALESA>I thought that was from/growing up on the farm.

472
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,890
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>她的手是什么状况
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>What about her hands?

473
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,990
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>是不是做针线很困难
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>She ever have any difficulty sewing,

474
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,190
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>钉扣子困难?
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>buttoning a shirt?

475
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,290
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>没有
<19-21,GREG HOUSE>no.

476
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,590
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>不过有时 我的手会不由自主的颤抖
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>But sometimes, my hands would,um,shiver.

477
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,290
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>就好像我冻着了那样
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>Like I was cold.

478
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,290
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>但我并不觉的冷
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>But I wasn't.

479
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,890
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>我一直不太明白
<19-22,CONNIE WALESA>I never quite understood.

480
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,990
<19-23,IRENE WALESA>她过去经常颤抖/就好像感冒了那样
<19-23,IRENE WALESA>She used to get the/shivers like she was cold.

481
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,690
<20-1,GREG HOUSE>给她服用 左旋多巴和溴麦角环肽
<20-1,GREG HOUSE>Start her on l-dopa and bromocriptine.

482
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,190
<20-1,GREG HOUSE>只不过是帕金森综合症而已
<20-1,GREG HOUSE>It's just parkinson's.

483
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,890
<20-1,GREG HOUSE>Cole.
<20-1,GREG HOUSE>Cole.

484
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,790
<21-1,ALLISON CAMERON>你们病人的情况怎么样
<21-1,ALLISON CAMERON>How's it going with your patient?

485
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,990
<21-2,JEFFREY COLE>仍然"看"得到一些东西
<21-2,JEFFREY COLE>Still seeing stuff.

486
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,490
<21-3,ALLISON CAMERON>我听说House把你唾弃的一文不值
<21-3,ALLISON CAMERON>I hear house is treating you like crap.

487
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,790
<21-4,JEFFREY COLE>他对谁都态度恶劣
<21-4,JEFFREY COLE>He treats everyone badly.

488
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,690
<21-5,ALLISON CAMERON>是 但我听说对你更是多加关照
<21-5,ALLISON CAMERON>Yeah,but I heard you're special.

489
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,290
<21-6,JEFFREY COLE>我倒还能承受
<21-6,JEFFREY COLE>Oh,I can handle it.

490
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,790
<21-7,ALLISON CAMERON>也许你不该逆来顺受
<21-7,ALLISON CAMERON>Maybe you shouldn't.

491
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,090
<21-7,ALLISON CAMERON>你越容忍他 他越整治你
<21-7,ALLISON CAMERON>He's gonna walk all/over you if you let him.

492
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,390
<21-8,JEFFREY COLE>你还是没说我应该怎么办
<21-8,JEFFREY COLE>That says nothing about me, just him.

493
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,190
<21-9,ALLISON CAMERON>House只会对勇于和他唱反调的人给与尊重
<21-9,ALLISON CAMERON>House respects people/who aren't afraid of him.

494
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,790
<21-9,ALLISON CAMERON>当面对峙
<21-9,ALLISON CAMERON>Get in his face.

495
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,790
<21-9,ALLISON CAMERON>吼两句也无妨
<21-9,ALLISON CAMERON>Yell if you have to.

496
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,190
<21-10,JEFFREY COLE>我不需要得到他的尊重
<21-10,JEFFREY COLE>I don't need his respect.

497
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,590
<21-11,ALLISON CAMERON>你会的 如果你想得到这份工作的话
<21-11,ALLISON CAMERON>You do if you want the job.

498
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,090
<21-12,JEFFREY COLE>多谢指点
<21-12,JEFFREY COLE>Thanks for the advice.

499
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,890
<22-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你尽量别动
<22-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>You have to hold still!

500
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,390
<22-2,IRENE WALESA>我已经在尽力了!
<22-2,IRENE WALESA>I'm trying!

501
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,290
<22-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>该死的! 按牢她!
<22-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Damn! Hold her down!

502
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,890
<22-4,IRENE WALESA>不! 不要!
<22-4,IRENE WALESA>No! Stop it!

503
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,390
<22-2,IRENE WALESA>让我来!
<22-2,IRENE WALESA>Let me do it!

504
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,290
<22-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>抓牢她!
<22-3,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Hold her down!

505
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,790
<22-6,IRENE WALESA>不! 不! 不!
<22-6,IRENE WALESA>No! No! No!

506
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,090
<22-6,IRENE WALESA>不
<22-6,IRENE WALESA>no

507
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,990
<22-7,IRENE WALESA>Irene.
<22-7,IRENE WALESA>Irene.

508
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,890
<22-7,IRENE WALESA>Irene?
<22-7,IRENE WALESA>Irene?

509
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,890
<22-8,IRENE WALESA>你扎了我
<22-8,IRENE WALESA>You stabbed me.

510
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,490
<22-8,IRENE WALESA>你只是做了个恶梦 那都不是真的
<22-8,IRENE WALESA>You were having a nightmare.Wasn't real.

511
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,990
<22-9,IRENE WALESA>我的手臂在流血
<22-9,IRENE WALESA>My arm is bleeding.

512
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,290
<22-9,IRENE WALESA>不用担心 你的手臂没...
<22-9,IRENE WALESA>No,it's okay now.Your arm's not...

513
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,190
<23-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>帕金森综合症无法解释她的皮肤损伤
<23-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>Lesions aren't explained by parkinson's.

514
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,890
<23-2,GREG HOUSE>有什么解释?
<23-2,GREG HOUSE>Any theories?

515
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,290
<23-3,GREG HOUSE>鬼缠舌?
<23-3,GREG HOUSE>A ghost got your tongue?

516
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,590
<23-3,GREG HOUSE>我没事
<23-3,GREG HOUSE>I'm fine.

517
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,390
<23-4,HENRY DOBSON>会不会是脉管炎
<23-4,HENRY DOBSON>What about vasculitis?

518
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,490
<23-5,CHRIS TAUB>磁共振显示没有脑局部缺血现象
<23-5,CHRIS TAUB>Mri didn't indicate/any cerebral ischemia.

519
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,290
<23-6,HENRY DOBSON>但她有局部肌无力和尿潴留症状
<23-6,HENRY DOBSON>But she has shown some focal/weakness,urinary retention.

520
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,190
<23-7,CHRIS TAUB>这都不是关键的症状
<23-7,CHRIS TAUB>Yes,those are her big mystery symptoms.

521
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,390
<23-7,CHRIS TAUB>最重要的幻觉/却是脉管炎无法解释的
<23-7,CHRIS TAUB>Not the hallucinations that/vasculitis doesn't explain.

522
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,590
<23-8,HENRY DOBSON>视网膜脉管炎可以解释
<23-8,HENRY DOBSON>Unless it's retinal vasculitis.

523
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,190
<23-9,CHRIS TAUB>House 这家伙也许真的很聪明/我敢肯定他还是个优秀的酒肉哥们
<23-9,CHRIS TAUB>House,this guy may be smart,and I'm/sure he's great to share a beer with.

524
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,390
<23-9,CHRIS TAUB>但如果他不知道/视觉病症是神经系统上的问题
<23-9,CHRIS TAUB>But if he doesn't know that visual/symptoms are an electrical issue,

525
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,290
<23-9,CHRIS TAUB>而不是血管上的/这是两个完全分离的系统
<23-9,CHRIS TAUB>not vascular,two separate systems...

526
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,090
<23-10,HENRY DOBSON>这就好比银行和电力公司
<23-10,HENRY DOBSON>So are the banks and the power grid.

527
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,790
<23-10,HENRY DOBSON>如果我不去银行交费/就会被掐断电源
<23-10,HENRY DOBSON>But if I don't pay my/bills,my lights go out.

528
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,390
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>脉管炎限制了神经血流供应
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>Vasculitis restricts/blood flow to nerves,

529
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,290
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>扰乱神经电信号
<23-11,GREG HOUSE>messes with electrical function.

530
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,590
<23-12,CHRIS TAUB>拿急性间歇卟啉症来解释倒更贴切些
<23-12,CHRIS TAUB>Acute intermittent/porphyria's a better fit.

531
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,390
<23-13,HENRY DOBSON>如果你关于卟啉症的诊断有误/错误的药物足以废了她的肾脏
<23-13,HENRY DOBSON>If you're wrong about porphyria,the/treatment could box her kidneys.

532
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,090
<23-13,HENRY DOBSON>治疗脉管炎的用药是皮质类固醇
<23-13,HENRY DOBSON>Vasculitis is treated/with corticosteriods.

533
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,290
<23-13,HENRY DOBSON>危害较小
<23-13,HENRY DOBSON>Relatively harmless.

534
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,490
<23-14,GREG HOUSE>开始对她使用类固醇
<23-14,GREG HOUSE>Start her on the steroids.

535
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,490
<23-15,CHRIS TAUB>House 这...
<23-15,CHRIS TAUB>House,this gu...

536
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,090
<23-16,GREG HOUSE>并同时检验血管炎和卟啉症两项/省得他再发牢骚
<23-16,GREG HOUSE>And test for both so he'll stop whing.

537
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,190

<24-1,ALLISON CAMERON>很不错
<24-1,ALLISON CAMERON>Great.

542
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,990
<24-2,GREG HOUSE>要想激得他发脾气/恐怕只能当众扒他裤子了
<24-2,GREG HOUSE>The only way he could turn any more/cheeks is by pulling down his pants.

543
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,090
<24-3,ALLISON CAMERON>他不是胆小鬼
<24-3,ALLISON CAMERON>He's not a wuss.

544
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,190
<24-3,ALLISON CAMERON>你的力气还不够扒他...
<24-3,ALLISON CAMERON>It takes a lot more strength...

545
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,590
<24-4,GREG HOUSE>我们赌的可不是他的力气
<24-4,GREG HOUSE>Hey,we didn't bet on how strong he was.

546
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,190
<24-5,ALLISON CAMERON>那么你打算解雇他 赢下100块/只因为他是个讲究原则的人?
<24-5,ALLISON CAMERON>So you're gonna collect $100 and/fire him because he has principles?

547
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,490
<24-6,GREG HOUSE>你的目的到底是什么
<24-6,GREG HOUSE>What's your agenda here?

548
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,390
<24-6,GREG HOUSE>很明显你并不在乎输掉那100块
<24-6,GREG HOUSE>Obviously don't care about the $100.

549
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,190
<24-7,ALLISON CAMERON>他是一个聪明正派的...
<24-7,ALLISON CAMERON>He's a decent, smart...

550
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,290
<24-8,GREG HOUSE>你不在意团队怎样
<24-8,GREG HOUSE>You don't care about the team.

551
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,690
<24-9,ALLISON CAMERON>Wilson有没有说过/你这种问话又不想听回答的态度让他很烦
<24-9,ALLISON CAMERON>Does it annoy wilson when you ask/questions and ignore the answers?

552
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,190
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>烦透了
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>Very much.

553
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,990
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>你只在乎我聘用了谁 又解雇了谁
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>You only care about who/I hire and who I fire,

554
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,290
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>因为你怀念帮我处理信件的时光了
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>'cause you miss going through my mail.

555
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,090
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>你就是忍不住想控制我
<24-10,GREG HOUSE>You can't stop controlling me.

556
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,690
<24-11,ALLISON CAMERON>没人能控制你
<24-11,ALLISON CAMERON>No one controls you.

<24-12,GREG HOUSE>- 想回来工作?/- 不
<24-12,GREG HOUSE>- Want your job back?/- no.

<24-14,GREG HOUSE>太糟了 想回来也不要你
<24-14,GREG HOUSE>Too bad.You can't have it.

559
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,690
<24-15,GREG HOUSE>这些由她来付
<24-15,GREG HOUSE>She'll take care of this.

560
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,990
<24-16,GREG HOUSE>你可以从欠我的100块中扣掉
<24-16,GREG HOUSE>You can take it out of the/$100 you're gonna owe me.

561
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,790
<24-16,GREG HOUSE>五年前的一个会议上/我曾见过House一面
<24-16,GREG HOUSE>I met house at a conference/about five years ago.

<24-16,GREG HOUSE>他确实是个人物
<24-16,GREG HOUSE>He's quite a character.

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,890
<25-1,ERIC FOREMAN>是 他是的
<25-1,ERIC FOREMAN>Yes,he is.

564
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,590
<25-1,ERIC FOREMAN>他的医学思维/可能是我们这个时代最棒的
<25-1,ERIC FOREMAN>Probably one of the best/medical minds of our generation.

565
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,090
<25-2,ERIC FOREMAN>我赞同/我从他那里学到了很多
<25-2,ERIC FOREMAN>I agree. I learned/an awful lot from him.

566
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,490
<25-2,ERIC FOREMAN>我相信是的
<25-2,ERIC FOREMAN>I'll bet you did.

567
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,790
<25-2,ERIC FOREMAN>这里写着你刚刚在慈爱医院工作过
<25-2,ERIC FOREMAN>I see here,just did a/stint at mercy. Great.

568
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,990
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>07年至今
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>It says here "'07 to present."

569
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,190
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>你在那呆了多久
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>How long were you there?

570
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,390
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>大约一个月
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>About a month.

571
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,590
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>Schaffer医生十分优秀/但我不太适应那里
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>Dr. Schaffer was great, but/just wasn't the right fit.

572
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,790
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>等一下 Schaffer医生的那个淋巴瘤病人?
<25-3,ERIC FOREMAN>Wait,was that you with Dr./Schaffer and the lymphoma patient?

573
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,190
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>是的 情况比较复杂
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>It was,um,it was a tough situation.

574
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,590
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>也许我本来可以做的更好一些
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>I probably could've handled it better.

575
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,590
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>不是这个意思/教训一下Schaffer医生是应该的
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>No. Dr. Schaffer's got/a stick up her rear.

576
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,290
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>你做的很好
<25-4,ERIC FOREMAN>Good for you.

577
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,890
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>是什么让你这么肯定是淋巴癌
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>What made you so sure it was lymphoma?

578
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,790
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>在其中一项她的试验报告中/她的乳酸水准偏高
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>There was an unusual lactic/acid level in one of her labs.

579
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,690
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>而我几个月前刚好有一个类似的诊断经历
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>I had a similar case a few months ago.

580
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,990
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>太妙了
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>Beautiful.

<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>老天 我真希望我能拥有你的魄力
<25-5,ERIC FOREMAN>God,I wish I had your stones.

<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>我的魄力可以为你所用
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>Well,my stones areon the market.

583
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,790
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>说真的 我希望拥有你的胆识
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>No,I mean,seriously, I/wish I had your stones.

584
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,890
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>那我就可以帮你说服董事们聘用你
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>Then I could cram you down/the board of directors.

585
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,190
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>但是我没有
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>But I don't.

<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>当你的视网膜收到了图象/它们会向大脑输送电信号
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>When your retina sees something,they/send electrical signals to your brain.

589
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,590
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>而这些镜片会捕捉到那些信号
<25-6,ERIC FOREMAN>These lenses will pick up those signals.

590
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,090
<26-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>如果信号不正常
<26-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>If the signals are misfiring,

591
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,690
<26-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>说明无照行医的老头子比我们更聪明
<26-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>it'll confirm that an old man without a/medical license is smarter than all of us.

592
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,190
<26-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>也就是说你的幻觉是由于...
<26-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>That your hallucinations/were caused by...

593
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,090
<26-2,IRENE WALESA>这不是幻觉
<26-2,IRENE WALESA>They're not hallucinations.

<26-3,CONNIE WALESA>他们一定很清楚他们在做什么
<26-3,CONNIE WALESA>They must know what they're doing.

597
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,890
<26-4,IRENE WALESA>如果他们称职 怎么会害死那人的狗
<26-4,IRENE WALESA>If they know what they're doing,how'd/they kill that poor man's dog?

598
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,590
<26-5,AMBER VOLAKIS>别告诉我 你一点也没被吓到
<26-5,AMBER VOLAKIS>Come on,this has got to be/freaking you out a little bit.

<26-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>这没什么丢脸的
<26-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>There's nothing to be ashamed of here.

601
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,190
<26-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>如果被你害死的男人的灵魂没有干扰到你
<26-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>If the ghost of a man you killed/doesn't screw with your head,

602
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,190
<26-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>那你才真的出了问题
<26-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>there's something wrong with your head.

<26-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>看到了吗  我也被吓到了
<26-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>See,that freaks me out.

604
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,890
<26-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>一定是有人丢在这里的
<26-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>Someone must've left it in here.

605
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,490
<26-8,AMBER VOLAKIS>是是 这合情合理
<26-8,AMBER VOLAKIS>Oh,absolutely.That makes sense.

606
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,190
<26-8,AMBER VOLAKIS>某条狗在这里检查检查眼睛之后/忘记把它的项链戴回去了
<26-8,AMBER VOLAKIS>The dog was in here getting his eyes/checkedand forgot to put his jewelry back on.

607
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,590
<26-9,IRENE WALESA>这样没用
<26-9,IRENE WALESA>This isn't working.

608
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,390
<26-9,IRENE WALESA>就像他说的那样/你们是在让我病上加病而已
<26-9,IRENE WALESA>You're just making me/sicker like he said you...

609
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,990
<26-9,IRENE WALESA>出了什么事
<26-9,IRENE WALESA>What's wrong?

<27-1,ROBERT CHASE>你们还以为是脉管炎?
<27-1,ROBERT CHASE>You guys thought it was vasculitis?

<27-2,JEFFREY COLE>你以前是在House的团队里对吗
<27-2,JEFFREY COLE>You used to be on house's team,right?

<27-6,JEFFREY COLE>你总是对他的凌辱逆来顺受吗
<27-6,JEFFREY COLE>Did you always put up with his crap?

625
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,490
<27-9,ROBERT CHASE>跟这个没关系
<27-9,ROBERT CHASE>It was irrelevant.
