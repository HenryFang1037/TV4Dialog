<1-3,Marie>躺在手术台上的是我姐姐

<1-4,Brock>也是我未婚妻
<1-4,Brock>And my fiancee.

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,520
<1-5,Marie>你喝多了
<1-5,Marie>You're drunk.

8
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,220
<1-5,Marie>会害她送命的
<1-5,Marie>You could kill her.

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,500
<1-6,Brock>只有这样我的手才能不抖
<1-6,Brock>It's the only way to stop/my hands from shaking.

<1-13,Evan>你是世上唯一信以为真的人
<1-13,Evan>you're gonna be the only/one in the world who did.

00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,440
<1-16,Director>影迷一定会喜欢的
<1-16,Director>The fans are gonna love it.

30
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,760
<2-1,Evan>我住在西边啊
<2-1,Evan>My apartment's on the west side.

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,180
<2-1,Evan>你得往另一边开
<2-1,Evan>Excuse me,you need to go the other way.

32
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,530
<2-1,Evan>你听到了吗?
<2-1,Evan>Hey,did you hear what I said?

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,300
<2-1,Evan>搞什么鬼?
<2-1,Evan>What the hell's going on here?

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,940
<2-1,Evan>你想要什么?

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,320
<2-2,House>亲笔签名照就不错

<2-2,House>噢...还想顺便救你一命
<2-2,House>Oh... and I'm also gonna save your life.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,020
<2-2,House>你可能要考虑重新设斑马线
<2-2,House>You might want to think about/repositioning the crosswalk.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,570
<3-1,Conway>技术上说现在不算违规
<3-1,Conway>It's technically not a violation,

42
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,920
<3-1,Conway>但斑马线越靠近入口就利用率就越高
<3-1,Conway>but the closer they are to the entrance,/the more likely they are to be used.

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,320
<3-2,Cuddy>有道理
<3-2,Cuddy>Makes sense.

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,870
<3-2,Cuddy>我以为你下个月才来
<3-2,Cuddy>I actually wasn't expecting/you till next month.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,060
<3-3,Conway>这就是计划检查的问题所在
<3-3,Conway>Yeah,that's the problem/with planned visits.

46
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,250
<3-3,Conway>管理层会为此事先准备
<3-3,Conway>Administrators plan for them.

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,930
<3-3,Conway>谈到最新的新泽西医院评估要求
<3-3,Conway>So the most recent new jersey/hospital accreditation requirements.

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,720
<3-4,Cuddy>是的 我熟悉—
<3-4,Cuddy>Yeah,I'm familiar with—

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,390
<3-5,Conway>这是谁?
<3-5,Conway>Who is that?

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,770
<3-6,Cuddy>我不认识
<3-6,Cuddy>I have no idea.

51
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,650
<3-6,Cuddy>我们可以开始检查了吗?
<3-6,Cuddy>Shall we get started?

52
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,520
<3-7,Evan>让我走
<3-7,Evan>Just let me go.

53
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,320
<3-7,Evan>我不会告你的
<3-7,Evan>I won't press charges.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,720
<3-7,Evan>会把整件事都忘掉
<3-7,Evan>Forget the whole thing.

55
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,040
<3-8,House>可能真会忘掉
<3-8,House>That's probably true.

56
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,310
<3-8,House>得看你的脑瘤恶化到什么程度了
<3-8,House>Seeing as how you have a brain tumor.

57
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,270
<3-9,Evan>原来你就是那个疯医生/不断打电话骚扰我的公关
<3-9,Evan>You're that nut job doctor that/keeps calling my publicist.

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,030
<3-10,House>事实上我是诊断部门的疯头头
<3-10,House>Actually,I'm the nut job/head of diagnostic medicine.

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,050
<3-11,Evan>我每天坚持跑步

<3-11,Evan>也没头痛 我好的很
<3-11,Evan>I don't get headaches. I'm fine.

<3-12,House>- 所以你要是不介意--/- 我很介意
<3-12,House>- So if you don't mind--/- actually,I do mind.

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,500
<3-12,House>我才不在意你的死活/但要是Brock Sterling死了
<3-12,House>I don't care if you die,but/if brock sterling dies,

63
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,300
<3-12,House>Anna就永远都不知道/他就是Marie孩子他爸了
<3-12,House>anna never finds out he's/the father of marie's baby.

<3-14,House>这里
<3-14,House>Here.

68
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,840
<3-14,House>最近一个月你念台词的速度/从平均2.1秒降慢到2.9秒了
<3-14,House>Look,in the last month,your average line/reading has slowed from 2.1 seconds to 2.9.

69
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,820
<3-14,House>更常停顿了
<3-14,House>You're pausing more.

70
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,770
<3-14,House>并且都在相同的间隔
<3-14,House>Always at the same intervals.

71
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,470
<3-14,House>每7到9个词停一下
<3-14,House>Every seven to nine words.

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,300
<3-14,House>说明你看提词机的一侧有困难
<3-14,House>Which means you're having trouble/reading one side of the teleprompter.

73
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,910
<3-14,House>证明你的周围视力有问题
<3-14,House>Which means it's a/peripheral vision problem.

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,410
<3-14,House>说明你的枕叶有肿瘤
<3-14,House>Which means a tumor/in your occipital lobe.

75
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,560
<3-14,House>只要做一个测试
<3-14,House>Just one test.

<3-14,House>要是没事的话 我马上送你回家
<3-14,House>If there's nothing wrong,I'll/take you right back home.

77
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,170
<3-15,Evan>给我出租车费就好
<3-15,Evan>Make it cab fare.

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,320
<3-15,Evan>我才不要你靠近我家
<3-15,Evan>I don't want you anywhere near my house.

79
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,460
<3-16,House>停到我的停车位上
<3-16,House>Uh,just put it in my spot.

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,130
<4-1,Cuddy>评估委员会是来保护我们及病人的
<4-1,Cuddy>The accreditation board is here/to protect us and our patients.

81
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,720
<4-1,Cuddy>所以跟调查员打交道时
<4-1,Cuddy>So in dealing with/the on-site inspector,

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,330
<4-1,Cuddy>请表现好点 不要被看出是装出来的
<4-1,Cuddy>please behave as if it wasn't/also an enormous pain in the ass.

<4-1,Cuddy>谢谢合作

<4-1,Cuddy>Chase Foreman Cameron 请过来一下
<4-1,Cuddy>Chase,foreman,cameron,up here,please.

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,530
<4-1,Cuddy>为什么House开豪华轿车来?
<4-1,Cuddy>Why is house driving a limo?

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,530
<4-2,Foreman>不知道
<4-2,Foreman>Don't know.

87
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,580
<4-3,Cameron>不必知道
<4-3,Cameron>Don't have to know.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
<4-4,Chase>不想知道?
<4-4,Chase>Don't...care?

89
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,270
<4-5,Cuddy>不对! 检查结束前你们得看着House
<4-5,Cuddy>Wrong! Until this inspection is/over,you're back on house watch.

90
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,540
<4-5,Cuddy>你负责当前的病例 你负责以前的病例
<4-5,Cuddy>Current case,past cases.

91
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,680
<4-6,Foreman>他现在没有病例
<4-6,Foreman>He doesn't have a current case.

92
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,120
<4-7,Cameron>我还得负责整个部门
<4-7,Cameron>I have a whole department.

93
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,020
<4-8,Chase>要是我们不照做你会解雇我们吗?
<4-8,Chase>Are you gonna fire us if we don't?

94
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,610
<4-9,Cuddy>我只是想你们帮帮忙而已
<4-9,Cuddy>I was just asking for your help.

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,060
<4-9,Cuddy>我上次查急诊室的档案时
<4-9,Cuddy>The last time I checked the E.R.,

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,800
<4-9,Cuddy>发现你写的病历是全院做得最好的
<4-9,Cuddy>You had the best-kept/charts in the building.

97
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,100
<4-9,Cuddy>上次我查四楼看门人的储藏室时/发现了该House写的病历
<4-9,Cuddy>The last time I checked the fourth floor/janitor's closet,I found house's charts.

98
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,080
<4-9,Cuddy>自从你走了他没做过任何档案
<4-9,Cuddy>He hasn't filed anything since you left.

99
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,510
<4-9,Cuddy>也许House不在乎医院的评估是否降格
<4-9,Cuddy>Now,house may not care whether this/hospital's accreditation gets downgraded.

100
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,210
<4-9,Cuddy>给我发工资的人却很在乎
<4-9,Cuddy>The people who sign my paychecks do.

101
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,610
<4-9,Cuddy>我再重复一次 你负责当前 你负责过去的
<4-9,Cuddy>So I repeat,current,past.

102
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,150
<4-10,Foreman>他现在没有病例啊
<4-10,Foreman>He doesn't have a current case.

103
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,450
<4-11,Cuddy>他跟你说过豪华轿车的事没?
<4-11,Cuddy>Did he tell you about the limo?

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,980
<5-1,Evan>见到光就按这个按钮就行了?
<5-1,Evan>So I just press this button/every time I see a light?

105
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,660
<5-2,House>能让我知道你的盲区在哪
<5-2,House>It tells me where your blind spots are.

106
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,370
<5-2,House>那么...那对双胞胎
<5-2,House>So...the twins.

107
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,270
<5-2,House>都是你的?
<5-2,House>They're gonna turn out/to be yours,aren't they?

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,190
<5-3,Evan>我说过不能跟你谈这些的
<5-3,Evan>I told you I can't/talk about that stuff.

109
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,850
<5-4,House>但是你想快点结束这个吧?
<5-4,House>But you want to be done with this,right?

110
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,020
<5-5,Evan>一个是我的 一个是Julio的
<5-5,Evan>One's mine,one's julio's.

111
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,710
<5-6,House>我早知道!
<5-6,House>I knew it!

112
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,480
<5-6,House>Julio在她患阑尾炎之前把她肚子搞大了/-- 你后来才上了她
<5-6,House>Julio knocked her up before her/appendix burst-- you got her after.

113
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,630
<5-7,Evan>你怎么会看这些东西?
<5-7,Evan>How can you watch that stuff?

114
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,130
<5-8,House>因为是部很棒的剧
<5-8,House>'Cause it's awesome.

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,810
<5-9,Evan>剧情很荒谬
<5-9,Evan>It's preposterous.

116
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,950
<5-9,Evan>我演了这么久/没有一刻是真实世界中存在的
<5-9,Evan>Not one real moment since/I've been on the show.

117
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,040
<5-10,House>和表达真实世界的剧集相反 例如...
<5-10,House>As opposed to shows that represent/the world exactly the way it is,like...

118
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,550
<5-10,House>我举不出例子
<5-10,House>I can't think of any.

119
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,220
<5-11,Foreman>发生了什么事?
<5-11,Foreman>What's going on?

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,360
<5-12,House>医院正被检查 Cuddy派你来看着我/这就是所发生的事
<5-12,House>The hospital is being inspected,and/cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me.

121
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,160
<5-12,House>我刚刚停了一部豪华轿车在救护车道上
<5-12,House>I just parked a town/car in an ambulance bay.

122
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,570
<5-12,House>cuddy没有破口大骂 却装作不认识我
<5-12,House>And instead of  ripping me one,cuddy/acted like she didn't know me.

123
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,080
<5-12,House>要不是有检查就是她患动脉瘤了
<5-12,House>It's either an/inspection or an aneurysm.

124
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,370
<5-13,Evan>测试显示出什么?
<5-13,Evan>What's the test say?

125
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,400
<5-14,House>像我怀疑的一样
<5-14,House>As I suspected.

126
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,470
<5-14,House>你视野的右上方有相当大的缺失
<5-14,House>You have significant losses in the upper/right quadrant of your visual field.

127
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,540
<5-15,Evan>真的?
<5-15,Evan>Are you serious?

128
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,400
<5-16,House>开玩笑的
<5-16,House>No,it's a joke.

129
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,830
<5-16,House>两朋友走进一酒吧/其中一个视野的右上方有缺失
<5-16,House>Two guys go into a bar,and one has significant losses/in the upper right quadrant of his visual field.

130
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,470
<5-16,House>另一个就说"那你得做个磁共振/确认一下肿瘤的形状和位置了"
<5-16,House>And the other one says,"you're gonna need an mri/to confirm the type and location of the tumor."

131
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,510
<5-17,Foreman>读数显示他的视力正常
<5-17,Foreman>That readout says his vision's fine.

132
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,190
<5-18,House>不正常
<5-18,House>no,it doesn't.

133
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,990
<5-19,Foreman>正常
<5-19,Foreman>Yes,it does.

134
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,960
<5-20,Evan>你骗了我?
<5-20,Evan>You lied to me?

135
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,340
<5-21,House>我绑架了你
<5-21,House>I kidnapped you.

136
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,740
<5-21,House>我要是骗了你还有什么好惊讶的?
<5-21,House>You're surprised that I lied to you?

137
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,860
<5-21,House>这只说明你的症状是间歇的
<5-21,House>It just means that the/symptoms are intermittent.

138
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,590
<5-22,Evan>你要是再接近我 我就报警了
<5-22,Evan>Yocome near me again,I'm/calling the police.

139
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,400
<5-23,Foreman>你绑架了他?
<5-23,Foreman>You kidnapped him?

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,900
<5-24,House>知道我还能让你惊讶真好
<5-24,House>It's sweet that I haven't lost/the ability to surprise you.

141
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,570
<6-1,House>你在学我吗?
<6-1,House>Are you mocking me?

142
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,240
<6-2,Wilson>我的背 疼死了
<6-2,Wilson>My back. My back is killing me.

143
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,470
<6-3,House>才不在乎 我很忙
<6-3,House>Don't care. Busy.

144
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,110
<6-4,Wilson>Amber的可恶床垫
<6-4,Wilson>Amber's damn mattress.

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,350
<6-5,House>那太糟了
<6-5,House>Well,that sucks.

146
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,130
<6-5,House>别买新的啊
<6-5,House>Don't buy a new one.

147
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,720
<6-6,Wilson>是不是在讽刺我?
<6-6,Wilson>Are you being sarcastic?

148
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,770
<6-6,Wilson>因为我们正要买
<6-6,Wilson>Because we are buying one.

149
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,720
<6-7,House>她做任何事/都非得搞得双方都得不到好处
<6-7,House>She's incapable of doing anything that matters/without turning it into a zero-sum game.

150
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,820
<6-8,Wilson>我们是在为我们双方买床垫
<6-8,Wilson>We're buying a mattress for us.

151
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,390
<6-9,House>我现在走得比你快了
<6-9,House>Wow,I'm faster than you right now.

152
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,010
<6-9,House>一切以她和哪个倒霉的售货员为主
<6-9,House>It's all about her and whatever/hapless salesman wanders into her sights.

153
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,190
<6-9,House>她会偷讹拐骗 牺牲你的品味/去达到她的目的
<6-9,House>She's gonna lie,steal,and trade your/testes to get whatever she wants.

154
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,750
<6-9,House>等等 不能让他按(911)第二个1
<6-9,House>Hold on,I've just gotta do something/before he dials the second "1."

155
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,500
<6-9,House>你最终会卑躬屈膝地提着她的包
<6-9,House>You're going to end/up humiliated,holding her purse,

156
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,920
<6-9,House>回家睡在你讨厌的新床垫上
<6-9,House>and going home to sleep on/a new mattress you hate.

157
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,580
<6-10,Wilson>你在搞什么鬼?
<6-10,Wilson>What the hell are you doing?

158
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,600
<6-11,House>他需要做核磁共振
<6-11,House>He needs an mri.

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,550
<7-1,House>给我照皮层下一毫米厚的片
<7-1,House>give me one-millimeter/slices from the cortex down.

160
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,230
<7-2,Thirteen>MRI是无痛检查/为什么你要给病人注射镇静剂?
<7-2,Thirteen>Any particular reason you decided to sedate a/patient for a procedure that's completely painless?

161
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,850
<7-3,House>这人在手术过程中有过激行为史
<7-3,House>The guy has a history of violent/outbursts during surgical procedures.

162
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,710
<7-4,Taub>那是在电视上
<7-4,Taub>Yeah,on tv.

163
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,220
<7-4,Taub>他是Evan Greer.
<7-4,Taub>It's evan greer.

164
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,260
<7-4,Taub>他是House爱看的剧里面的头号种马
<7-4,Taub>He's the main stud on house's soap.

165
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,650
<7-4,Taub>额叶皮质没事 没肿瘤
<7-4,Taub>Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.

166
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,930
<7-5,House>放大一点看枕叶
<7-5,House>Increase the magnification on/the occipital lobe.

167
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,680
<7-5,House>你看那部剧是因为你喜欢还是因为我?
<7-5,House>You watch because you/like or because I like?

168
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,290
<7-6,Taub>我当时失业了 而且我--
<7-6,Taub>I was/unemployed,and I--

169
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,230
<7-6,Taub>打住! 不好意思
<7-6,Taub>bzzzt! Sorry.

170
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,340
<7-7,House>那不是个回答 是个道歉
<7-7,House>That's not an answer. That's an apology.

171
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,530
<7-7,House>如果我们曾脱离了黑暗 我们应为此骄傲--
<7-7,House>If we are ever to come out of the/darkness,we have to be proud--

172
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,460
<7-8,Thirteen>枕叶 额叶 顶叶都没事
<7-8,Thirteen>occipital,frontal,temporal/lobes are clean.

173
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,900
<7-8,Thirteen>视神经也一样
<7-8,Thirteen>So is the optic nerve.

174
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,070
<7-8,Thirteen>肯定不是肿瘤
<7-8,Thirteen>Definitely no tumors.

175
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,870
<7-9,House>他没事?
<7-9,House>He's fine?

176
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,620
<7-10,Thirteen>而且还苏醒了
<7-10,Thirteen>And...awake.

177
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,470
<7-11,Taub>我们该怎么跟他说?
<7-11,Taub>Uh,what should we tell him?

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,750
<7-12,House>看能不能说服他别告我
<7-12,House>See if you can talk him out of suing me.

179
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,650
<8-1,Evan>他绑架了我!
<8-1,Evan>He kidnapped me!

180
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,890
<8-1,Evan>给我下药了!
<8-1,Evan>He drugged me!

181
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,110
<8-2,Taub>也许你可以从后门走
<8-2,Taub>Perhaps you should go out the back way.

182
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,770
<8-3,Evan>我才不按你们说的去做
<8-3,Evan>I'm not going anywhere you/people tell me to go.

183
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,630
<8-4,Taub>他只是你的 嗯 影迷
<8-4,Taub>It's just someone of your/fame--I--I figured fans--

184
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,140
<8-5,Evan>你们想把我藏起来
<8-5,Evan>you're trying to hide me.

185
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,000
<8-5,Evan>你不想我把事情闹大
<8-5,Evan>You don't want me making a scene.

186
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,760
<8-6,Thirteen>医院今天有人来检查
<8-6,Thirteen>The hospital's being inspected today.

187
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,430
<8-7,Evan>你们还指望我帮忙?
<8-7,Evan>And you want me to do you a favor?

188
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,240
<8-8,Thirteen>不是我们 是我们的院长
<8-8,Thirteen>not us. Our dean of medicine.

189
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,660
<8-8,Thirteen>House很讨厌她
<8-8,Thirteen>And house hates her.

190
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,970
<8-8,Thirteen>你要是投诉的话 就帮House大忙了
<8-8,Thirteen>You'd be doing house/a favor by complaining.

191
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,550
<9-1,Evan>这家医院的职员都是疯子和罪犯!
<9-1,Evan>This hospital is staffed with/lunatics and crimals!

192
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,990
<9-1,Evan>Cuddy医生在哪?
<9-1,Evan>Excuse me,where's dr. Cuddy?

193
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,690
<9-1,Evan>我脚出问题了
<9-1,Evan>it's my foot.

194
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,630
<9-1,Evan>他对我做了什么?
<9-1,Evan>What did he do to me?

195
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,460
<9-2,Cuddy>House做了什么?
<9-2,Cuddy>What did house do?

196
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,360
<9-3,Thirteen>没什么--我一直跟他在一起
<9-3,Thirteen>Nothing--I was with/him the whole time.

197
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,450
<9-4,Evan>我脚麻了
<9-4,Evan>It's numb.

198
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,950
<9-4,Evan>我感觉不到脚了
<9-4,Evan>I can't feel it.

199
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,100
<9-4,Evan>我不能走了
<9-4,Evan>I can't walk.

200
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,140
<10-1,Thirteen>脚部无知觉可以有很多诊断
<10-1,Thirteen>Foot numbness has a huge differential.

201
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,880
<10-2,House>加上周围视觉问题 范围就大大缩小了
<10-2,House>It gets a lot narrower when you/add in peripheral vision problems.

202
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,530
<10-3,Foreman>如果没有证据他有视觉问题的话/那范围又扩大了
<10-3,Foreman>Which gets a lot wider when there's/no proof he ever had a vision problem.

203
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,410
<10-4,Kutner>这么说 最初的症状House搞错了
<10-4,Kutner>so house was wrong/about the first symptom,

204
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,050
<10-4,Kutner>几小时后 这家伙恰巧又冒出/第二个毫不相关的症状了?
<10-4,Kutner>but the guy just happened to develop a/second unrelated symptom a few hours later?

205
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,690
<10-5,Taub>他先把人家给绑架了/又硬给人家打了镇静剂
<10-5,Taub>he already kidnapped and/sedated the guy against his will.

206
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,090
<10-5,Taub>他要是给那人下药让他腿使不上劲/走不了路 一点都不奇怪
<10-5,Taub>Makes sense he'd also do something to/numb his foot so he couldn't leave.

207
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,850
<10-6,House>这讲不通
<10-6,House>But it doesn't make/sense to include a symptom

208
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,820
<10-6,House>若是这个医生急着想弄清楚/又怎么会再整个症状出来
<10-6,House>that he caused in a differential he's/so desperate to solve.

209
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
<10-7,Cameron>除非这并不是他有意而为之的
<10-7,Cameron>Unless he didn't mean to cause it.

210
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,800
<10-8,House>亲爱的 好好整文档
<10-8,House>Stick to the filing,sweetheart.

211
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,690
<10-8,House>让大夫做大夫的事
<10-8,House>Let the doctors do the doctoring.

212
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,560
<10-8,House>要么是中毒 要么是维生素不足
<10-8,House>Either toxins or vitamin deficiency.

213
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,460
<10-9,Cameron>估计你给他下镇静剂时/没扶住他放到地上
<10-9,Cameron>I'm guessing when you drugged him you/didn't catch him and ease him to the floor.

214
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
<10-9,Cameron>他可能在倒地时 压到脚踝的神经了
<10-9,Cameron>He ould've pinched a nerve in/his ankle when he fell.

215
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,980
<10-9,Cameron>你要做个肌电图检查/看看有没有运动神经受到压迫
<10-9,Cameron>You need to run an emg test/for motor nerve entrapment

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,280
<10-9,Cameron>不然调查员让你吃不了兜着走
<10-9,Cameron>or the inspector will own your ass.

217
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,780
<10-10,House>Kutner 出去
<10-10,House>Kutner,leave the room.

218
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,500
<10-10,House>30分钟后回来告诉她检查结果为阴性
<10-10,House>Wait 30 minutes. And come back/and tell her the test was negative.

219
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,270
<10-11,Kutner>我要是用这段时间/真去做那个检查可以么?
<10-11,Kutner>Is it okay if I use that/time to do the test?

220
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,550
<10-12,House>出去吧你
<10-12,House>Get out of here.

221
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,400
<10-13,Cameron>其他人可以帮我处理下这些
<10-13,Cameron>And the rest of them can/help me with all this stuff.

222
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,880
<10-13,Cameron>他们没空
<10-13,Cameron>They're busy.

223
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,400
<10-14,House>说起来真叫人恼火
<10-14,House>Which is really annoying because/I wanted to be able to say that

224
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,330
<10-14,House>我说他们会很忙 就是想跟你捣乱
<10-14,House>they're busy for no other/reason than to screw with you.

225
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,410
<10-14,House>做研究
<10-14,House>Research.

226
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,990
<11-1,Evan>这么说那个疯子没说错
<11-1,Evan>So the nutjob was right.

227
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,650
<11-2,Kutner>他常常是对的
<11-2,Kutner>Usually is.

228
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,680
<11-3,Evan>他说我就快死了
<11-3,Evan>He said I was dying.

229
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,800
<11-4,Kutner>他也有很多事说错了
<11-4,Kutner>He's wrong a lot too.

230
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,130
<11-4,Kutner>所以我们要做检查
<11-4,Kutner>That's why we do these tests.

231
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,100
<11-4,Kutner>身为热播连续剧的男主角/那感觉肯定很棒吧
<11-4,Kutner>I bet it's pretty cool,you/know,being the star of a hit tv show.

232
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,700
<11-5,Evan>只是个日间肥皂剧
<11-5,Evan>It's a daytime soap.

233
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,440
<11-5,Evan>我也就比剧院餐厅的演员强点
<11-5,Evan>It pretty much puts me one/step above dinner theater.

234
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
<11-6,Kutner>好啦 你每天都上电视
<11-6,Kutner>Come on. You're on tv every day.

235

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,530
<19-14,Taub>我们难道不先确诊一下吗?
<19-14,Taub>before destroying one of the/most important glands in his body?

461
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,610
<19-15,House>如果那个腺体已在心脏上开了一个大洞/就不用
<19-15,House>If that gland has drawn a/bull's-eye on his heart,then no.

<19-16,Cameron>我们?
<19-16,Cameron>we?

465

<19-17,House>有人想在甲状腺让Brock岌岌可危之时/做这个没用的测试吗?
<19-17,House>Anyone else want to run a useless test,while/brock's thyroid plots its next lethal move?

466
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,940
<19-17,House>征求意见是开玩笑
<19-17,House>It was rhetorical.

<19-18,Thirteen>You were sure about b-6 toxicity too.

<19-21,Foreman>如果甲状腺分泌持续增高 他会死
<19-21,Foreman>If he goes into full-on/thyroidstorm,he'll die.

472
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,910
<19-21,Foreman>得放射摧毁他的甲状腺
<19-21,Foreman>We gotta nuke his thyroid.

<20-1,Foreman>挂掉电话
<20-1,Foreman>Hang up the phone.

474
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,780

<20-2,Thirteen>Why? If we're gonna nuke his thyroid-

475
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,210

485
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,740
<21-5,Cuddy>那是因为本来就是别人的食物
<21-5,Cuddy>That's 'causeit's everyone else's food.

<22-6,House>我让垃圾堆积起来 等待最为自虐的组员
<22-6,House>I let the crap pile up,and/then I see which team member

526
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,370
<22-6,House>在忍无可忍后 清理这些垃圾
<22-6,House>is the most self-flagellating,breaks/down,clears up the mess.

<23-1,Evan>碘味道很奇怪
<23-1,Evan>that iodine left a /really weird aftertaste.

542
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,830
<23-2,Taub>那是追踪剂在作怪
<23-2,Taub>That's the tracer in it.

<23-2,Taub>你肯定有不少女性崇拜者
<23-2,Taub>You must do okay with women,huh?

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,970
<23-3,Kutner>我已经问过他了
<23-3,Kutner>I already asked him that.

547
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,780
<23-5,Evan>没外人想象的那么精彩
<23-5,Evan>It's not all it's cracked up to be.

548
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,310
<23-6,Kutner>感觉很空虚
<23-6,Kutner>He feels unfulfilled.

549
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,790
<23-7,Taub>我很怀疑
<23-7,Taub>I doubt it.

550
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,540
<23-8,Evan>我在撒谎?
<23-8,Evan>I'm lying?

551
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,970
<23-9,Taub>我曾经是一个整形医生
<23-9,Taub>I used to be a plastic surgeon.

552
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,910
<23-9,Taub>我一般都说自己的工作浅薄 没有意义
<23-9,Taub>I talk about my work as/shallow and meaningless.

553
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:09,500
<23-9,Taub>但其实 我爱死了隆胸 腹部除皱
<23-9,Taub>Truth is,I loved every/boob job,every tummy tuck.

554
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,520
<23-9,Taub>意义没有那么重要
<23-9,Taub>Meaning doesn't mean that much.

555
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,670
<23-10,Evan>但你不再是整形医生了
<23-10,Evan>But you're not a plastic surgeon anymore.

556
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,920
<23-11,Taub>说来话长
<23-11,Taub>It's complicated.

557
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,200
<23-12,Evan>你现在比以前更快乐吗?
<23-12,Evan>Are you happier?

558
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,690
<23-11,Taub>这很复杂
<23-11,Taub>It's complicated.

559
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,880
<23-14,Kutner>他的甲状腺看起来很正常
<23-14,Kutner>His thyroid looks normal.

560
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,220
<23-15,Evan>是好消息 对吗?
<23-15,Evan>So that's good news,right?

561
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,700
<23-16,Kutner>你觉得看起来是不是太亮了?
<23-16,Kutner>Everything look too bright to you?

562
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,630
<23-17,Taub>显示器的问题
<23-17,Taub>It could be the monitor.

563
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,890
<23-18,Kutner>不是显示器
<23-18,Kutner>It's not the monitor.

564
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,230
<23-18,Kutner>是碘
<23-18,Kutner>It's the iodine.

565
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,180
<23-18,Kutner>到处都是
<23-18,Kutner>It's everywhere.

566
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,400
<23-18,Kutner>他的身体一点都没有吸收
<23-18,Kutner>His body's not filtering it.

567
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,790
<23-19,Taub>肾脏在衰竭
<23-19,Taub>His kidneys are failing.

568
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,940
<24-1,House>我让你毁了他的甲状腺
<24-1,House>I told you to nuke his thyroid.

569
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,110
<24-2,Foreman>幸亏没有这么做
<24-2,Foreman>It's a good thing we didn't.

570
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,090
<24-2,Foreman>肾衰竭表明并非甲亢
<24-2,Foreman>Kidney failure means it wasn't graves.

571
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,180
<24-3,House>那么你的测试打败了我/也毁了病人的肾
<24-3,House>So your test screwed me and/our patient's kidneys.

572
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,830
<24-3,House>确切的说你让他碘中毒了
<24-3,House>Practically poisoned him with iodine.

573
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,810
<24-4,Foreman>如果它的肾脏健康就不会碘中毒
<24-4,Foreman>Which he could have handled easily/if his kidneys were healthy.

574
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,510
<24-4,Foreman>我们做的只是揭示了一个新症状
<24-4,Foreman>All we did was reveal a new symptom.

575
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,670
<24-4,Foreman>通常 这会是你想要的
<24-4,Foreman>Usually,you're all for that.

576
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,100
<24-5,House>肯定是你腐臭的背叛气息倒了我的胃口
<24-5,House>Must be the rancid tinge of/betrayal that's put me off.

577
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,130
<24-6,Foreman>你判断错了
<24-6,Foreman>You were wrong.

578
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,620
<24-7,House>那就正面告诉我啊
<24-7,House>So tell me to my face.

579
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,330
<24-7,House>你之前从不犹豫
<24-7,House>You never hesitated before.

580
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,000
<24-7,House>委员会让你变成一个懦夫了
<24-7,House>The board's turned you into a coward.

581
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,930
<24-8,Foreman>我那样做是因为那是正确的事情
<24-8,Foreman>I did it because it/was the right thing to do.

582
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,520
<24-9,House>你那样做是为了通过审查
<24-9,House>You did it to pass an inspection.

583
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,410
<24-10,Taub>这重要吗?
<24-10,Taub>Does it matter?

584
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,070
<24-10,Taub>肾衰竭加上其他症状 表明这是自身免疫系统问题
<24-10,Taub>Kidney failure on top of the other/symptoms points to an autoimmune condition,

585
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,520
<24-10,Taub>也就是接下来任何一个器官都可能出问题
<24-10,Taub>which means that any of his/other organs could be next.

586
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,530
<24-10,Taub>我们已经开始给他做透析
<24-10,Taub>We've already started dialysis.

587
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,040
<24-10,Taub>我们现在需要测抗核抗体/来确诊是自身免疫的问题
<24-10,Taub>We need to run anas for autoimmune.

588
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,320
<24-10,Taub>你说的对
<24-10,Taub>You're right.

589
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,280
<24-11,House>你和其他成员 去测量天花板吧
<24-11,House>You and the team,go/measure the ceilings.

590
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,570
<24-12,Taub>抱歉?
<24-12,Taub>Excuse me?

591
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,460
<24-13,House>评估委员会的准则有写到/物品离天花板的距离要大于18英寸
<24-13,House>Accreditation board guidelines state that no/object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling.

592
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,890
<24-13,House>确保我们的都符合标准
<24-13,House>Make sure we're in compliance.

593
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,600
<24-14,Foreman>我们办公室里没有不符合要求的...
<24-14,Foreman>There's nothing in our/office that would be less--

594
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,560
<24-15,House>我说的不是我们 是整个医院
<24-15,House>I don't mean us. I/mean the whole hospital.

595
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,220
<25-1,Amber>我们试试新床怎么样
<25-1,Amber>Let's see how this baby handles.

596
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,810
<25-2,Wilson>怎么了?
<25-2,Wilson>What?

597
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,090
<25-3,Amber>你买了硬床垫
<25-3,Amber>You bought the firm mattress.

598
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,780
<25-4,Wilson>我以为这是你喜欢的
<25-4,Wilson>I thought that's the one you wanted.

599
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,270
<25-4,Wilson>是
<25-4,Wilson>It was.

600
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,740
<25-5,Amber>你为什么这么做?
<25-5,Amber>Why would you do that?

601
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,180
<25-6,Wilson>因为...
<25-6,Wilson>Because—

602
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,720
<25-6,Wilson>是脑筋急转弯吗?
<25-6,Wilson>This is a trick question?

603
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,780
<25-7,Amber>我想让你自己拿主意
<25-7,Amber>I left it up to you.

604
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,690
<25-7,Amber>你应该买你自己喜欢的
<25-7,Amber>You were supposed to/get the one you wanted.

605
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,310
<25-8,Wilson>我是因为爱你 才买了你想要的
<25-8,Wilson>I got the one you/wanted because I love you.

606
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,440
<25-8,Wilson>不是
<25-8,Wilson>No.

607
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,870
<25-9,Amber>你这么做是因为你一贯如此
<25-9,Amber>You did it because that's what you do.

608
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,540
<25-9,Amber>就像对所有的前妻一样/你尽力满足她们的需求 因为那样更省事
<25-9,Amber>With all your ex-wives,you did whatever/they wanted because it was easier,

609
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,110
<25-9,Amber>可最后都以你对她们厌恶告终
<25-9,Amber>and you ended up resenting them.

610
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,540
<25-9,Amber>你别想那么对我
<25-9,Amber>Don't you dare do that to to me.

611
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,790
<25-10,Wilson>什么 照顾你吗?
<25-10,Wilson>What,take care of you?

612
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,770
<25-11,Amber>你还不了解我吗?
<25-11,Amber>Have you met me?

613
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,340
<25-11,Amber>我能照顾自己
<25-11,Amber>I can take care of me.

614
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,370
<25-11,Amber>我要你照顾好自己
<25-11,Amber>I need you to take care of you.

615
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,500
<25-11,Amber>我得做事了
<25-11,Amber>I have work to do.

616
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,690
<26-1,House>你在第8页
<26-1,House>You made it to page eight.

617
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,430
<26-1,House>"肥皂剧中的医生神秘造访医院"
<26-1,House>"Mysterious hospital visit for soap doc."

618
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,550
<26-2,Evan>喔 我该给我妈妈寄一份
<26-2,Evan>Wow,I'll be sure to send my mom a copy.

619
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,420
<26-2,Evan>他们告诉我 我患的是自身免疫疾病
<26-2,Evan>They told me I have/an autoimmune disease.

620
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,000
<26-2,Evan>像狼疮或肉状瘤
<26-2,Evan>Like lupus or sarcoidosis.

621
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,370
<26-3,House>我们也想知道是不是
<26-3,House>That's what we're here to find out.

622
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,600
<26-4,Evan>你是不是真的如大家想的那么厉害?
<26-4,Evan>You really as good as/everyone seems to think you are?

623
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,390
<26-5,House>你是不是真像大家想的那么可怜呢?
<26-5,House>Are you really as miserable as/everyone seems to think you are?

624
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,860
<26-6,Evan>我只想做些有意义的事
<26-6,Evan>I just want to do something that matters.

625
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,300
<26-7,House>没有有意义的事
<26-7,House>Nothing matters.

626
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,760
<26-7,House>我们不过是凡夫俗子
<26-7,House>We're all just cockroaches.

627
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,360
<26-7,House>羚羊死在河边
<26-7,House>Wildebeests dying on the river bank.

628
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,870
<26-7,House>没什么事情会有永恒的意义
<26-7,House>Nothing we do has any lasting meaning.

629
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,980
<26-8,Evan>你认为我很可悲
<26-8,Evan>And you think I'm miserable.

630
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,920
<26-9,House>如果你在飞机上不开心的话/跳下来就是
<26-9,House>If you're unhappy on/the plane,jump out of it.

631
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,950
<26-10,Evan>我也想 可我办不到
<26-10,Evan>I want to,but...I can't.

632
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,410
<26-11,House>嗯 这就是暗喻的问题所在
<26-11,House>Hmm,that's the problem with metaphors.

633
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,680
<26-11,House>需要解释一下
<26-11,House>They need interpretation.

634
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,530
<26-11,House>从飞机上往下跳是件很愚蠢的事
<26-11,House>Jumping out of the plane is stupid.

635
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,340
<26-12,Evan>要是我不在飞机上呢?
<26-12,Evan>Well,what if I'm not in a plane?

636
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,700
<26-12,Evan>而是在一个我不想待的地方呢?
<26-12,Evan>What if I'm just in a/place I don't want to be?

637
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,080
<26-11,House>这又是暗喻的另一个问题了
<26-11,House>That's the other problem with metaphors.

638
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,120
<26-13,House>你在一辆冰淇淋车上/ 被糖果 鲜花 美女簇拥 怎么样?
<26-13,House>Yes,what if you're actually in an ice cream truck/and outside are candy and flowers and virgins?

639
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,750
<26-13,House>你是在飞机上
<26-13,House>You're on a plane.

640
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,610
<26-13,House>我们都在飞机上
<26-13,House>We're all on planes.

641
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,620
<26-13,House>生活很危险也很复杂
<26-13,House>Life is dangerous and complicated.

642
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,240
<26-13,House>路也很长
<26-13,House>And it's a long way down.

643
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,710
<26-14,Evan>那么你害怕改变咯?
<26-14,Evan>So you're afraid of change?

644
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,390
<26-14,Evan>不 是你怕
<26-14,Evan>No,you're afraid to change.

645
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,940
<26-15,House>你幻想自己能逃避 却不愿尝试
<26-15,House>You'd rather imagine that you can/escape instead of actually try.

646
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,020
<26-15,House>因为你一旦失败 就会一无所有
<26-15,House>'Cause if you fail,then/you've got nothing.

647
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,630
<26-15,House>所以你不愿真正去尝试/这样你至少还有期望
<26-15,House>So you'll give up the chance of something/real so that you can hold on to hope.

648
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,270
<26-15,House>问题是 期望是留给孬种的
<26-15,House>The thing is,hope is for sissies.

649
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,350
<26-16,Evan>等我出去之后 我什么都不会怕了
<26-16,Evan>When I get outta here,I'm/not gonna be afraid anymore.

650
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,640
<26-16,Evan>有多少人能有再来一次的机会?
<26-16,Evan>I mean,how many guys get a second chance?

651
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,220
<26-17,House>多得是
<26-17,House>Too many.

652
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,660
<26-17,House>一半我救的人都不配有这个机会
<26-17,House>Half the people I save don't/deserve a second chance.

653
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,950
<26-18,Evan>既然我有这个机会/我就要洗心革面
<26-18,Evan>Now that I've got mine,I'm/gonna set things right.

654
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,790
<26-18,Evan>我要做你的好爸爸
<26-18,Evan>I'm gonna start by being a/better father to you.

<26-20,House>你知道自己在背上一季的台词吧
<26-20,House>You realize you're reciting/lines from last season.

<26-22,House>Do you know where you are?

<27-4,Foreman>We need to identify the infection and/get him on more targeted meds fast.

<27-12,Kutner>Where you going?

684
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,180
<27-13,House>去躺一下
<27-13,House>To lie down.

685
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,900
<27-13,House>我要思考一下
<27-13,House>I need to think.

686
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,060
<28-1,House>可能是鼠咬热
<28-1,House>Could be rat bite fever...

687
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,190
<28-1,House>可他的淋巴又没有肿
<28-1,House>but his glands aren't swollen.

688
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,880
<28-1,House>你准备买哪张?
<28-1,House>Which one are you gonna get?

689
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,340
<28-2,Wilson>她让我想买哪张买哪张
<28-2,Wilson>she told me to get the one I want.

690
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,910
<28-3,House>那就买呗
<28-3,House>So get it.

691
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,460
<28-3,House>李斯特杆菌可以解释败血/心脏衰竭也能说得通
<28-3,House>Listeria explains the sepsis,possibly/also the heart problem.

692
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,330
<28-4,Wilson>可无法解释麻痹
<28-4,Wilson>But not the numbness.

693
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:22,140
<28-5,House>如果李斯特杆菌引起脑脊髓炎/就能引起麻痹...
<28-5,House>If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis,which/then caused the numbness...

694
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,050
<28-6,Wilson>我想要张水床
<28-6,Wilson>I want a waterbed.

695
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,110
<28-7,House>我一直都想要一张
<28-7,House>I've always wanted one.

696
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,720
<28-7,House>我知道这很滑稽 只是...
<28-7,House>I know it's ridiculous. It's just--

697
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,470
<28-8,Wilson>一想到被水簇拥着入睡/就觉得很炫
<28-8,Wilson>there's something nice about the thought/of being rocked to sleep in water.

698
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,330
<28-8,Wilson>你不打算嘲笑我?
<28-8,Wilson>No mocking?

699
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,770
<28-8,Wilson>不准备做一番弗洛伊德式的评析/例如水床暗示着我想钻入女人阴道?
<28-8,Wilson>No freudian analysis of how the waterbed is/really a great big vagina I want to crawl into?

700
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,560
<28-9,House>我忽视你是因为 你让我很伤心
<28-9,House>I'm ignoring you because you make me sad.

701
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,980
<28-9,House>他用了氨苄/如果是李斯特杆菌的话 他应该有所好转
<28-9,House>He's on ampicillin,which means if it was/listeria,he'd have shown some improvement.

702
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,330
<28-10,Wilson>不 你得换全套
<28-10,Wilson>No,it's a whole thing.

703
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,220
<28-10,Wilson>你得要专门的床单和保险...
<28-10,Wilson>You need special/sheets and insurance--

704
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,250
<28-10,Wilson>那又怎样?
<28-10,Wilson>who cares?

705
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,970
<28-11,House>你一直都想要
<28-11,House>You wanted one your whole life.

706
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,170
<28-11,House>你是个成年人了
<28-11,House>You're a grown-up.

707
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,250
<28-11,House>你买得起 商店也有卖的
<28-11,House>You can afford it. Stores sell them.

708
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,800
<28-12,Wilson>大多数成年人不像你那样 House/随便起个怪点子 都非得满足
<28-12,Wilson>Most adults don't go through life like/you do,house,indulging our every whim.

709
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,030
<28-13,House>活该你快活不起来
<28-13,House>You don't deserve to be happy.

710
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,610
<28-14,Wilson>我很快活啊
<28-14,Wilson>And yet I am.

711
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,980
<28-14,Wilson>你呢?
<28-14,Wilson>You?

712
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,520
<28-15,House>Amber会觉得这很可笑的
<28-15,House>Amber'll think it's stupid.

713
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,740
<28-15,House>是很可笑
<28-15,House>It is stupid.

714
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,330
<28-15,House>去实现你的梦想吧 Wilson
<28-15,House>Live the dream,wilson.

715
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,420
<29-1,House>这不是传染病
<29-1,House>it's not an infection.

716
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,420
<29-1,House>是过敏
<29-1,House>It's an allergy.

717
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,590
<29-1,House>这就是为什么抗生素不起作用的原因
<29-1,House>That's why it's not/responding to antibiotics.

718
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,190
<29-2,Foreman>这可不是拍电视 House
<29-2,Foreman>This isn't a soap opera,house.

719
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,200
<29-2,Foreman>你不能一给病人下药/就指望他会立马苏醒
<29-2,Foreman>People don't just wake up from/comas the second you give 'em drugs.

720
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,080
<29-3,House>特别是下错药的时候
<29-3,House>Especially if we give/him the wrong drugs.

721
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,420
<29-3,House>检验结果如何?
<29-3,House>What do the sts say?

722
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,760
<29-4,Foreman>真菌和寄生虫的结果呈阴性/不过也不能说明...
<29-4,Foreman>It was negive for fungus and/parasites,but that doesn't mean—

723
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,080
<29-5,House>我们排除的感染越多/就越说明这不是感染
<29-5,House>the more infections we rule out,the more/likely it is that it's not an infection.

724
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,380
<29-6,Foreman>他没有过敏或哮喘病史
<29-6,Foreman>He has no history of allergies or asthma.

725
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,000
<29-6,Foreman>最重要的是/他没有一个症状与过敏反应相似
<29-6,Foreman>Most importantly,none of his symptoms/remotely resemble an allergic reaction.

726
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,470
<29-7,House>过敏原会导致过敏性血管炎
<29-7,House>Allergens could trigger an/allergic vasculitis.

727
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,750
<29-7,House>那就可以解释所有症状了
<29-7,House>That would explain the symptoms.

728
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,140
<29-8,Foreman>百万分之一的几率
<29-8,Foreman>One in a million times.

729
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,180
<29-8,Foreman>败血性感染能解释他的症状
<29-8,Foreman>Septic infection always/explains his symptoms.

730
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,730
<29-9,House>没有一种感染能抵御所有抗生素
<29-9,House>But an infection is never/resistant to every antibiotic.

731
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,670
<29-10,Foreman>不 是感染少有抗药性
<29-10,Foreman>No,infection is rarely resistant.

732
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,500
<29-11,House>而抗生素从来对过敏症没作用
<29-11,House>And allergy never/responds to antibiotics.

733
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,590
<29-11,House>"从不"打败"很少"
<29-11,House>Never beats rarely.

734
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,980
<29-11,House>证明完毕 我赢了
<29-11,House>Qed,I win.

735
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,880
<29-11,House>他的更衣室里有菊花
<29-11,House>There were chrysanthemums in/his dressing room.

736
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,390
<29-12,Foreman>上帝 你干嘛不说他暴露于地球生物
<29-12,Foreman>My god,why didn't you say/he'd been exposed to plant life.

737
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,970
<29-13,House>菊花里面含有除虫菊酯
<29-13,House>Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.

738
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,360
<29-13,House>一种神经毒素 也是种过敏原
<29-13,House>It's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.

739
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,250
<29-14,Foreman>他得的是感染
<29-14,Foreman>He has an infection.

740
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,990
<29-14,Foreman>给他注射类固醇的话 会害死他的
<29-14,Foreman>If we give him steroids,we'll kill him.

741
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,940
<29-15,House>他得的是过敏症
<29-15,House>He has an allergy.

742
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,510
<29-14,Foreman>不给他类固醇 才是让他死
<29-14,Foreman>If we don't give him/steroids,we'll kill him.

743
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,560
<29-16,Foreman>可没死得这么快
<29-16,Foreman>Not as fast.

744
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,870
<29-17,House>会很快的
<29-17,House>Fast enough.

745
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,000
<29-17,House>你没时间做其他的检测了/我们不能坐以待毙
<29-17,House>You don't have time for the rest of/the tests. We have to do something.

746
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,330
<29-17,House>我们现在做的没起作用
<29-17,House>And what we're doing/right now isn't working.

747
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,070
<30-1,House>100毫克甲强龙
<30-1,House>100 milligrams methylprednisolone.

748
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,790
<30-2,Pharmacist>哪些病人?
<30-2,Pharmacist>Patients' names?

749
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,480
<30-3,House>只有一个病人
<30-3,House>It's one patient.

750
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,000
<30-4,Pharmacist>你要给一个病人100毫克的剂量?
<30-4,Pharmacist>You want to give one/patient 100 milligrams?

751
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,440
<30-4,Pharmacist>那足够启动一辆车的了
<30-4,Pharmacist>That'll jump start a car.

752
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,600
<30-5,House>正好 因为我的病人刚好/是辆陷入昏迷的69年产福特
<30-5,House>Perfect,'cause my/patient's a '69 ford coma.

753
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,120
<30-6,Pharmacist>超过50毫克需要Cuddy医生的签名
<30-6,Pharmacist>Anything over 50 milligrams,I/need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.

754
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,220
<30-6,Pharmacist>这是规矩
<30-6,Pharmacist>It's protocol.

755
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,260
<30-7,House>视察员也在这儿呢
<30-7,House>And the inspector's here.

756
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,910
<30-7,House>我99%确定她一定会同意的
<30-7,House>I am 99% certain that she'll consent.

757
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,600
<30-7,House>不过鉴于那1%的可能性/要不我就自己...
<30-7,House>But for the sake of the/1% why don't I just--

758
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,520
<30-8,Pharmacist>你不能进来
<30-8,Pharmacist>you're not allowed back here.

759
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,870
<30-9,House>你可以让视察员记我一笔
<30-9,House>Well,tell the inspector he/can put it on my tab.

760
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,750
<30-9,House>我不是说现在
<30-9,House>I didn't mean now.

761
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,700
<31-1,Cuddy>100毫克的甲强龙过量了
<31-1,Cuddy>100 milligrams of/methylprednisolone is an overdose.

762
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,530
<31-2,House>我们搞错了 不是感染
<31-2,House>We were wrong about the infection.

763
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,040
<31-2,House>他这是严重过敏反应
<31-2,House>He's suffering from a/severe allergic reaction.

764
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,330
<31-3,Cuddy>小组没有进行过敏测试
<31-3,Cuddy>The team hasn't finished/the test for allergy.

765
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,130
<31-3,Cuddy>他的症状不是...
<31-3,Cuddy>His symptoms don't--

766
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,400
<31-4,House>在极少情况下...
<31-4,House>in rare cases--

767
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
<31-4,House>相信我 到最后 我是对的
<31-4,House>trust me,at the end of this/conversation,I'm right.

768
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,340
<31-5,Cuddy>那就证明给我看
<31-5,Cuddy>Then confirm it.

769
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,770
<31-5,Cuddy>给他验血
<31-5,Cuddy>Get a blood test.

770
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,230
<31-6,House>这么严重深度的昏迷
<31-6,House>What is it about this/severe and deepening coma

771
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,830
<31-6,House>你居然还觉得有时间按规章办?
<31-6,House>that makes you think we/got time for protocol?

772
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,750
<31-7,Cuddy>管理规章已经防止你的病人/甲状腺受损 血液被抽干
<31-7,Cuddy>Protocol has saved your patient from having/his thyroid destroyed and his blood drained.

773
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,570
<31-8,House>如果你觉得我错了 就直说
<31-8,House>If you think I'm/wrong,tell me I'm wrong.

774
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,850
<31-8,House>别给我提规章
<31-8,House>Don't talk about protocol.

775
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,980
<31-9,Cuddy>我的工作岌岌可危
<31-9,Cuddy>My job's on the line.

776
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,300
<31-9,Cuddy>你也是
<31-9,Cuddy>Your job is on the line.

777
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,580
<31-10,House>好吧 你这么办 等我三分钟/然后你就叫保安
<31-10,House>Okay,here's what you do: You wait/three minutes,then you call security.

778
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,280
<31-10,House>他们来拷我的时候/我的事也做完了
<31-10,House>By the time they get here and/lock me up,I'll be done.

779
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,250
<31-10,House>他可以接着活下去
<31-10,House>He gets to live.

780
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,620
<31-10,House>也能保住你的位子
<31-10,House>Your ass gets to be covered.

781
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,120
<31-11,Cuddy>如果他死了 告诉我...
<31-11,Cuddy>If he dies,let me know...

782
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,530
<31-11,Cuddy>好让我收拾东西滚蛋
<31-11,Cuddy>so I can pack my things.

783
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,260
<31-11,Cuddy>*昨夜感觉真好*
<31-11,Cuddy>*Last night it was so good*

784
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,970
<31-11,Cuddy>*我想哭*
<31-11,Cuddy>I felt like crying*

785
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,180
<31-11,Cuddy>*我想哭*
<31-11,Cuddy>I felt like crying*

786
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,100
<31-11,Cuddy>*昨夜虽然你冷冷淡淡*
<31-11,Cuddy>*last night though you looked so cold*

787
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,890
<31-11,Cuddy>*可我想笑*
<31-11,Cuddy>*I felt like smiling*

788
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,020
<35-1,Amber>*我想笑着死去*
<35-1,Amber>*smiling when I'm dying*

789
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,000
<35-2,Wilson>*昨夜真的感觉不错*

791
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,880
<35-4,Wilson>*我想哭*
<35-4,Wilson>*I felt like crying*

792
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,170
<35-5,Amber>*昨夜你看起来苍老*
<35-5,Amber>*last night though you looked so old*

793
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,740
<25-5,Amber>*可我想笑*
<25-5,Amber>*I felt like smiling*
