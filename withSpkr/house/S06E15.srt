<3-15,Thirteen>Her photos may be digital

84
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,450
<3-15,Thirteen>但不意味着她没有暴露在其他毒素里

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,140
<4-20,Stuart>从一只雪纳瑞猎犬嘴里
<4-20,Stuart>right out of the mouth of the schnauzer

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,240
<4-20,Stuart>拽出过一大块
<4-20,Stuart>From down the hall.

130
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,570
<5-6,House>生活就是选美比赛
<5-6,House>Life is a beauty pageant.

<5-10,Chase>都归结到我的颧骨高度上吗[帅气脸庞]
<5-10,Chase>I've ever had to the height of my cheekbones?

137
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,690
<5-11,Wilson>并不是从头至尾的恋情
<5-11,Wilson>Not the whole relationship.

00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,320
<5-12,House>-只是开头  -剩下的是你头发的作用
<5-12,House>- Just the beginning. - The rest is your hair.

<5-14,House>你不可以告诉别人你是名医生
<5-14,House>You can't tell anyone you're a doctor.

<6-31,House>填一些答案  但是你并不想
<6-31,House>Filled in some answers, but you couldn't be bothered

202
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,900
<6-31,House>真的攻克它们  所以你只是随便填了些数字
<6-31,House>To work at it, so you just put in random letters.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,700
<6-31,House>你有做撒谎者的天赋
<6-31,House>You have some natural talent as a liar,

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,390
<6-31,House>不过想要通关  你还不够格
<6-31,House>But not enough brains to see it through.

205
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,320
<6-31,House>我大胆断言你并不是警察
<6-31,House>I'm gonna assume you're not a cop.

<8-5,Frankie>我确定每次扔完老鼠药都洗过手
<8-5,Frankie>And I'm sure I washed my hands after I threw out the rat poison.

217
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,070
<8-6,Foreman>很显然  你一段时间内
<8-6,Foreman>Apparently you did it multiple times

218
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,650
<8-6,Foreman>要重复很多次
<8-6,Foreman>Over a course of days.

219
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,750
<8-6,Foreman>所以不能下定论
<8-6,Foreman>Can't be too certain.

<8-11,Taub>个人觉得  你没有那么高傲
<8-11,Taub>Personally, I don't think you're condescending at all.

226
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,180
<8-12,Frankie>我不是这么写的
<8-12,Frankie>That's not what I wrote.

227
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,490
<8-12,Frankie>当你问我要病史的时候
<8-12,Frankie>When you were taking my history,

<8-12,Frankie>I told you I went whitewater rafting six months ago,

229
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,830
<8-12,Frankie>你说  这看起来无关吧
<8-12,Frankie>And you said, "It was unlikely to be related."

230
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,280
<8-12,Frankie>我只是在提供信息
<8-12,Frankie>I was just giving information.

<8-12,Frankie>别遮掩了  你确实语气有点差
<8-12,Frankie>Let's face it. You got a little snarky.

232
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,630
<8-13,Foreman>你不能书写语调吧
<8-13,Foreman>You can't convey a tone of voice in writing.

233
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,790
<8-14,Frankie>我只写了你所说的
<8-14,Frankie>I just put what you said.

234
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,500
<8-14,Frankie>如果你不想让人们觉得你傲慢
<8-14,Frankie>If you don't want people To think you're condescending,

<8-14,Frankie>也许你就不应该讲些傲慢的事情
<8-14,Frankie>Maybe you shouldn't say condescending things.

<8-14,Frankie>可以等一下再说吗  我想去厕所
<8-14,Frankie>Can this wait a second? 'cause I have to pee.

237
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,890
<8-14,Frankie>我觉得人们之所以行为不端
<8-14,Frankie>You know, I think people behave badly

238
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,270
<8-14,Frankie>是因为我们的言行没有被记录下来
<8-14,Frankie>Because there are no records Of what we say or do.

239
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,950
<8-14,Frankie>没有人再相信上帝正注视着我们
<8-14,Frankie>And nobody believes anymore that God's watching.

240
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,580
<8-14,Frankie>上帝虽然没有  但是我有
<8-14,Frankie>Well, God's not, but I am.

241
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,900
<8-14,Frankie>任何事都被记录下来
<8-14,Frankie>Everything is on the record,

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,440
<8-14,Frankie>包括我做过的每件事
<8-14,Frankie>Including everything I do.

243
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,180
<8-14,Frankie>我觉得
<8-14,Frankie>I don't think

244
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,200
<8-14,Frankie>我的尿液不应该是泥土色吧
<8-14,Frankie>My pee is supposed to be mud-colored.

245
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,210
<8-15,Foreman>我们关于鼠毒诊断是错的
<8-15,Foreman>We were wrong about the rat poison.

246
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,200
<9-1,House>凝血病加肾脏问题等于什么
<9-1,House>Coagulopathy plus kidney equals what?

247

<9-4,Foreman>Normal creatinine levels. She has elevated cholesterol.

249
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,560
<9-5,House>喂  威尔森
<9-5,House>Hey, Wilson!

250
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,150
<9-5,House>找不到我的黄色录像带了
<9-5,House>Can't find my pornos.

251
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,060
<9-6,Wilson>你没有试试悬赏吗
<9-6,Wilson>Have you tried offering a reward?

252
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,170
<9-7,Taub>高雪氏疾病
<9-7,Taub>Gaucher's disease.

253
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,280
<9-7,Taub>那会影响她合成维他命K的能力
<9-7,Taub>It would affect her ability to synthesize vitamin k.

254
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,980
<9-8,Chase>她是半素食主义者
<9-8,Chase>She's on a semi-vegetarian diet.

255
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,680
<9-8,Chase>意味着她获得了足量的维他命K
<9-8,Chase>Means she gets plenty of vitamin k.

256
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,930
<9-8,Chase>更像是萧格伦综合症
<9-8,Chase>Sjogren's is more likely.

257
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,230
<9-9,House>我以为你打扫的时候把它们收起来了
<9-9,House>I assume you moved them while you were dusting.

258
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,040
<9-9,House>我检查了抽屉  窗台
<9-9,House>I checked the drawers, windowsill,

259
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,470
<9-9,House>还有你房间里的dvd播放器

<9-9,House>沉默者多数总是性压抑的一群
<9-9,House>The quiet ones are always deeply repressed.

261
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,130
<9-10,Wilson>我把它们还了
<9-10,Wilson>I returned them to the store.

262
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,370
<9-11,Foreman>她前几天吃了一顿鱼宴
<9-11,Foreman>She had a fish dinner a couple of nights ago.

263
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,340
<9-11,Foreman>可能是哈罗病引起的狂犬病毒
<9-11,Foreman>Could be Haff disease causing rhabdo.

264
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,930
<9-12,House>什么  你为什么要还回去呢
<9-12,House>What? Why did you return them to the store?

265
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,800
<9-13,Wilson>又不麻烦
<9-13,Wilson>It's no trouble.

266
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,870
<9-13,Wilson>我顺便要在旁边的商店取干洗的衣服
<9-13,Wilson>I had to stop next-door for my dry cleaning anyway.

267
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,540
<9-14,Chase>萧格伦不会抑制凝固酶
<9-14,Chase>Sjogren's wouldn't inhibit the clotting enzymes,

268
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,090
<9-14,Chase>渗透到了肾脏  一切真相大白
<9-14,Chase>Infiltrate the kidneys-- explains everything.

269
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,040
<9-15,Foreman>哈罗病也可以
<9-15,Foreman>So does Haff disease.

270
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,860
<9-16,House>我不是在谢谢你  我在问你为什么
<9-16,House>I'm not thanking you. I'm asking you why.

271
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,310
<9-17,Wilson>因为如果我昨晚真的碰巧带了一个女人回家
<9-17,Wilson>Because if I did happen to bring a woman home last night,

272
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,770
<9-17,Wilson>我希望那里是黄色禁区
<9-17,Wilson>I wanted it to be a porn-free zone.

273

<9-18,House>你应该知道装进袜柜里的东西不一定非要是袜子吧
<9-18,House>You do realize things don't have to be socks To go into a sock drawer.

274
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,690
<9-19,Wilson>对不起
<9-19,Wilson>I'm sorry.

275
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,390
<9-19,Wilson>非常  非常抱歉
<9-19,Wilson>Horribly, horribly sorry.

276
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,440
<9-19,Wilson>我以为你  已经全部看完了
<9-19,Wilson>I thought you'd... watched them all.

277
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,250
<9-20,House>你彻底毁掉了我的上午
<9-20,House>You completely ruined my morning.

278
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,050
<9-20,House>我不得不翻你的家庭旧照
<9-20,House>I had to pull out your old family photos.

279
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,540
<9-20,House>你妈妈很性感
<9-20,House>Your mom was pretty hot.

280
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,070
<9-20,House>哈罗病最符合时间序列
<9-20,House>Haff disease fits the timing best.

281
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,890
<9-20,House>给她使用盐溶液和甘露醇
<9-20,House>Start her on saline and mannitol.

282
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,840
<10-1,Wilson>你读了你病人的博客吗
<10-1,Wilson>You reading your patient's blog?

285
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,350
<10-3,Wilson>也许能发现一些线索
<10-3,Wilson>Could be some clues.

286

<10-4,House>线索太多  就像做全身扫描一样
<10-4,House>Too many. Be like doing a whole body scan.

<10-4,House>会指出8个错误的方向
<10-4,House>Send us up eight blind alleys.

288
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,790

<10-5,Wilson>她提到你了

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,630
<10-6,House>她还没见过我
<10-6,House>She's never met me.

291
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,520
<10-7,Wilson>你是看不见的精灵
<10-7,Wilson>You're an unseen presence,

292
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,080
<10-7,Wilson>像奥兹国的巫师一样[出自绿野仙踪]
<10-7,Wilson>Like the wizard of OZ.

293
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,510
<10-7,Wilson>他以前是个骗子
<10-7,Wilson>He was a fraud.

294
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,370
<10-8,House>她为什么不能跟着keyser soze走呢[超强黑社会老大]
<10-8,House>She couldn't have gone with keyser soze?

295
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,270
<10-8,House>说到电影的不合理
<10-8,House>Speaking of movies that don't make any sense,

296
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,840
<10-8,House>我去了租赁店  把色情片拿了回来
<10-8,House>I stopped at the rental store to get those pornos back.

<10-8,House>我告诉店员我很感谢
<10-8,House>I told the guy at the counter I was so grateful

298
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,680
<10-8,House>你帮我还了片子  不过我想要回来
<10-8,House>That you'd returned them, but I wanted them.

299
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,470
<10-8,House>你猜怎么样

300
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,370
<10-8,House>你只还了两部

301
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,740
<10-8,House>把第三部弄掉了
<10-8,House>You lost the third.

302
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,390
<10-8,House>你真好心帮我付了钱
<10-8,House>It's decent of you to pay for it,

303
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,260
<10-8,House>没有算在我的账上
<10-8,House>Not let them put it on my bill.

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,010
<10-9,Wilson>其实...
<10-9,Wilson>You know...

305
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,530
<10-9,Wilson>我可以解释是怎么回事
<10-9,Wilson>I can explain what happened.

306
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,610
<10-10,House>我知道你可以
<10-10,House>I'm sure you could.

307
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,270
<10-10,House>不过比起听你说谎
<10-10,House>But rather than listen to your lies,

308
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,500
<10-10,House>我觉得开车到镇的那头去借同样的版本
<10-10,House>I thought it'd be more fun to drive all over town

309
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,580
<10-10,House>会更有意思
<10-10,House>And get another copy.

310
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,990
<10-11,Wilson>它现在在你手里吗
<10-11,Wilson>You have-- you have it here?

311
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,380
<10-12,Wilson>噢  天呢

312
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,400
<10-12,Wilson>噢  天呢
<10-12,Wilson>Oh, god!

313
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,830
<10-12,Wilson>好吧  第一
<10-12,Wilson>Okay, first,

314
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,880
<10-12,Wilson>那不是我
<10-12,Wilson>That's not me.

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,310
<10-12,Wilson>那不是  大部分都不是
<10-12,Wilson>It's not-- mostly not--

316
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,810
<10-12,Wilson>我当时在读大学
<10-12,Wilson>I was in college.

317
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,190
<10-12,Wilson>我不是...我室友当时辅修
<10-12,Wilson>I don't...my roommate was minoring

318
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,280
<10-12,Wilson>摄像课程
<10-12,Wilson>In film.

319
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,090
<10-13,House>你是否得了换气过度
<10-13,House>Are you hyperventilating?

320
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,920
<10-13,House>记住  堵住嘴巴和一只鼻孔可以缓解
<10-13,House>Remember that covering your mouth and one nostril can help.

321
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,040
<10-13,House>他为了某门课有成绩必须交这个他当时十分绝望
<10-13,House>He had to get this in for some grade, And he was desperate.

322
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,710
<10-14,House>我去做这个的唯一原因是我以为别人永远也不会看到
<10-14,House>And the only reason I did it was because no one would ever see it.

323
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,050
<10-14,House>谁知道他会真的变成导演
<10-14,House>Who knew he'd become an actual director?

324
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,780
<10-14,House>他不是个导演
<10-14,House>He's not a director.

325
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,350
<10-14,House>他是艺术家
<10-14,House>He's an artist.

326
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,320
<10-14,House>他驾驭光影...和胸部的能力
<10-14,House>The way he plays with light and darkness and...boobs.

327
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,390
<10-15,Wilson>这个不是我
<10-15,Wilson>That's not me.

328
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,400
<10-15,Wilson>你是什么
<10-15,Wilson>What are you?

329
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,960
<10-16,Moon Woman>你为什么抱着我
<10-16,Moon Woman>Where are you taking me?

330
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,600
<11-2,Thirteen>千万别怕
<11-2,Thirteen>Be not afraid.

331
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,890
<10-14,House>森林女神已经教过我如何取悦女人了
<10-14,House>The forest nymphs have taught me how to please a woman.

332
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,280
<10-15,Wilson>这不是我
<10-15,Wilson>That's not me.

333
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,150
<10-17,Wilson>这不是...你可以清楚看到这不是我
<10-17,Wilson>That's not...I mean, you can see it's not me.

334
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,170
<10-17,Wilson>他加了一段
<10-17,Wilson>He added extra scenes

335
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,910
<10-17,Wilson>所以他能以色情片发行
<10-17,Wilson>So he could release it as a porno.

336
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,650
<10-18,House>千万别怕  威尔森
<10-18,House>Be not afraid, wilson.

337
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,640
<10-18,House>你是为艺术献身的
<10-18,House>You took risks for your art.

338
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,060
<10-19,Wilson>噢
<10-19,Wilson>Oh, boy.

339

<10-20,Wilson>没人...嗨  看着我
<10-20,Wilson>No one...hey, look at me.

340
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,460
<10-20,Wilson>永远不能让别人看到这个
<10-20,Wilson>No one can know about this.

341
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,390
<10-21,House>从这一刻开始  我会守口如瓶的
<10-21,House>From this moment on, my lips are sealed.

342
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,510
<11-2,Thirteen>-对不起  -没事
<11-2,Thirteen>- Sorry. - It's okay.

343
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,060
<11-2,Thirteen>千万别怕
<11-2,Thirteen>Be not afraid.

344
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,530
<11-2,Thirteen>发现什么吗
<11-2,Thirteen>Find anything?

345
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,400
<12-1,Thirteen>没发现相关的
<12-1,Thirteen>Relevant? No.

346
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,140
<12-2,Chase>倒是有有意思的
<12-2,Chase>Interesting. I guess.

347
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,410
<12-2,Chase>她什么都和别人分享
<12-2,Chase>There's nothing that she doesn't share.

348
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,320
<12-2,Chase>"愤怒中的性生活被过高评价了"
<12-2,Chase>"Angry sex is overrated.

349
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,020
<12-2,Chase>"他怎会期望我在对他如此生气时有性欲呢"
<12-2,Chase>"How can he expect me to be aroused when I'm so pissed at him?"

350
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,190
<12-3,Thirteen>揭露这样的真相也许能帮她获得一个新肾脏
<12-3,Thirteen>Revelations like that might just earn her a new kidney.

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,560
<12-3,Thirteen>她在博客上写她肾衰竭后的一小时
<12-3,Thirteen>An hour after she blogged about her kidney failure,

352
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,790
<12-3,Thirteen>医院就会接到新加坡打来的电话
<12-3,Thirteen>The hospital got a call from Singapore.

353
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,540
<12-3,Thirteen>弗兰琪的某个读者询问如何捐赠肾脏的事
<12-3,Thirteen>One of Frankie's readers asking how hard it would be to donate.

354
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,780
<12-4,Chase>我到底有多帅
<12-4,Chase>How good-looking am I?

355
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,380
<12-4,Chase>我不是问你  你是否被我吸引
<12-4,Chase>I'm not asking if you're attracted to me.

356
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,040
<12-4,Chase>我在寻求一个客观的答案
<12-4,Chase>I'm looking for an objective answer.

357
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,290
<12-5,Thirteen>这样啊  那倒真是个合适的问题啊
<12-5,Thirteen>Oh, okay, then it's an appropriate question.

358
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,910
<12-6,Chase>昨晚  我表现地像个傻瓜
<12-6,Chase>Last night, I acted like a complete tosser

359
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,590
<12-6,Chase>为向豪斯证明  女人不因为长相 和我约会
<12-6,Chase>To prove to house that women don't go out with me for my looks.

360
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
<12-6,Chase>我损失了100美金
<12-6,Chase>Cost me a hundred bucks

361
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,100
<12-6,Chase>让我开始不了解自己
<12-6,Chase>And my definition of myself.

362
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,870
<12-7,Thirteen>还有女人们和男人约会吧
<12-7,Thirteen>And women. So date men.

363
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,020
<12-7,Thirteen>他们一点也不肤浅
<12-7,Thirteen>They're not shallow at all.

364
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,200
<12-8,Chase>一切都是有关肉体
<12-8,Chase>Everything's physical.

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,620
<12-9,Thirteen>是  人类是肉体的动物
<12-9,Thirteen>Yes. We are physical beings.

366
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,970
<12-9,Thirteen>或多或少
<12-9,Thirteen>Some more than others.

367
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,490
<12-9,Thirteen>请不要以一个晚上来定义我的性别
<12-9,Thirteen>Please don't define my entire gender based on one night.

368
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,530
<12-10,Chase>不  会不会她的问题是一个生理反应
<12-10,Chase>No, what if the patient's problem is a physical reaction,

369
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,660
<12-10,Chase>而不是情感上的
<12-10,Chase>Not an emotional one?

370
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,990
<12-10,Chase>她缺乏性欲是否与他们的争吵毫无关系呢
<12-10,Chase>What if her lack of arousal Had nothing to do with their fight?

371
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,360
<12-10,Chase>干燥综合征会抑制她阴道液体的分泌
<12-10,Chase>Sjogren's would inhibit her normal secretions.

372
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,370
<13-1,Chase>抱歉让你熬夜
<13-1,Chase>Sorry for keeping you up.

373
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,300
<13-1,Chase>我认为最好不要等到明天早上
<13-1,Chase>I thought it better not to wait till morning.

374
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,520
<13-2,Frankie>哦 没事
<13-2,Frankie>Oh, it's no problem.

375
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,280
<13-2,Frankie>我是个夜猫子
<13-2,Frankie>I'm a night owl.

376
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,530
<13-2,Frankie>你觉得我可能得了干燥综合征吗
<13-2,Frankie>So you think I might have this sjogren's

377
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,930
<13-2,Frankie>-因为我阴道分泌减少吗  -对
<13-2,Frankie>- cause of my lack of discharge? - Yeah.

378
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,810
<13-3,Chase>幸好你写在博客上了
<13-3,Chase>It's lucky you wrote about that.

379
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,900
<13-4,Frankie>你是否在想  我分享那么多私事
<13-4,Frankie>And a little crazy, you're thinking,

380
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,900
<13-4,Frankie>有些疯狂
<13-4,Frankie>To share that much?

381
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:33,910
<13-5,Chase>不疯狂
<13-5,Chase>Not crazy.

382
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,420
<13-5,Chase>只是不寻常  你和陌生人如此亲密
<13-5,Chase>Unusual to be so intimate with people you don't know.

383
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,640
<13-6,Frankie>但我确实了解他们
<13-6,Frankie>But I do know them.

384
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,810
<13-6,Frankie>他们读我的博客  我也评论他们的
<13-6,Frankie>They read my blog, I comment on theirs.

385
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,820
<13-6,Frankie>你没有亲眼见过某人
<13-6,Frankie>Just cause you haven't met someone physically

386
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,900
<13-6,Frankie>不代表你不了解他
<13-6,Frankie>Doesn't mean you don't know them.

387
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,020
<13-6,Frankie>你呢  你在谈恋爱吗
<13-6,Frankie>What about you? Are you in a relationship?

388
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,010
<13-7,Chase>刚结束
<13-7,Chase>It recently ended.

389
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,600
<13-8,Frankie>哦  对不起
<13-8,Frankie>Oh. I'm sorry.

390
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,410
<13-9,Chase>平躺下来
<13-9,Chase>Lie flat on your back all the way.

391
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,670
<13-10,Frankie>你们之前天天见面是吧
<13-10,Frankie>But you saw each other every day, right?

392
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,820
<13-10,Frankie>你所想的  有多少告诉了她呢
<13-10,Frankie>How much did you tell her about what you were thinking?

393
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,130
<13-10,Frankie>还是你们的对话都最后流于
<13-10,Frankie>Or did you just end up talking

394
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,300
<13-10,Frankie>讨论关于去哪里吃饭
<13-10,Frankie>About where you were going to dinner

395
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,090
<13-10,Frankie>或是谁去洗衣服之类呢
<13-10,Frankie>And who needed to do the laundry?

396
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,100
<13-11,Chase>你和泰勒的关系是如此的吗
<13-11,Chase>Is that what your relationship with Taylor is like?

397
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,070
<13-11,Chase>不是
<13-11,Chase>No.

398
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,480
<13-12,Frankie>也许有一点点
<13-12,Frankie>Oh, maybe a little.

399
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,040
<13-12,Frankie>他真的很好  不过有时候
<13-12,Frankie>You know, he's great, but sometimes it's easier

400
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,820
<13-12,Frankie>对素不相识的人敞开心扉反而更容易
<13-12,Frankie>To open up to people who aren't looking at you.

401
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,040
<13-13,Chase>你需要躺平才能做X光检查
<13-13,Chase>You need to lie flat for us to get the x-ray.

402
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,980
<13-14,Frankie>我其实背上不舒服
<13-14,Frankie>I'm actually not comfortable on my back.

403
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,210
<13-14,Frankie>我们不能这样做吗
<13-14,Frankie>Can't we do it this way?

404
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,650
<13-15,Chase>-你扭伤肌肉了吗  -没
<13-15,Chase>- Did you strain a muscle? - No.

405
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,600
<13-16,Frankie>怎么了
<13-16,Frankie>What's wrong?

406
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,800
<14-1,Chase>我已经为病人安排了心脏手术
<14-1,Chase>I've booked our patient in for heart surgery.

407
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,390
<14-1,Chase>我之前给她做涎管X线
<14-1,Chase>I was doing a sialogram on her,

408
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,770
<14-1,Chase>她不想平躺下
<14-1,Chase>And she didn't want to lie on her back.

409
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,270
<14-1,Chase>这是有心脏瓣膜问题的病人
<14-1,Chase>That's a complaint you hear from people

410
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,740
<14-1,Chase>常见的不适 症状全符合
<14-1,Chase>With heart valve issues. It fits.

411
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,950
<14-1,Chase>干燥综合症损伤了她的心脏
<14-1,Chase>Sjogren's damaged her heart,

412
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,260
<14-1,Chase>引起凝血问题
<14-1,Chase>Causing her clotting problems,

413
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,550
<14-1,Chase>还造成了肾衰竭
<14-1,Chase>Causing her kidneys to fail.

414
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,970
<14-2,Taub>你就凭她不愿躺下的现象
<14-2,Taub>You based all that on the fact

415
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,320
<14-2,Taub>作出了这样的判断吗
<14-2,Taub>That she didn't want to lie down?

416
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,410
<14-3,Chase>不仅如此  在她抱怨不想平躺后
<14-3,Chase>Well, that and the cardiac echo I performed

417
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,680
<14-3,Chase>我还做了心脏超声
<14-3,Chase>After she didn't want to lie down.

418
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,840
<14-4,House>二尖瓣几乎没有了
<14-4,House>Her mitral valve is nearly gone.

419
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,570
<14-4,House>说明她也几乎快死了
<14-4,House>Which means she's nearly gone.

420
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,860
<14-4,House>天呢  你真的很漂亮
<14-4,House>God, you're pretty.

421
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,320
<14-4,House>我们可以用猪瓣膜或塑料瓣膜
<14-4,House>So we can replace the mitral valve

422
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,890
<15-1,Chase>置换你的二尖瓣
<15-1,Chase>With a pig valve or with a plastic one.

423
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,140
<15-2,Frankie>真的从猪身上取吗
<15-2,Frankie>From an actual pig?

424
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,020
<15-3,Taub>如果有一天你想要孩子 这是个更好的选择
<15-3,Taub>It's the better choice if you want To have children someday.

425
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,710
<15-3,Taub>用塑料瓣膜你就必须服用抗凝剂
<15-3,Taub>A plastic valve requires you to be on anticoagulants,

426
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,290
<15-3,Taub>它会导致婴儿先天缺陷
<15-3,Taub>Which are known to cause birth defects.

427
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,110
<15-3,Taub>另一方面来说
<15-3,Taub>On the other hand,

428
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,220
<15-3,Taub>猪瓣膜磨损地很快
<15-3,Taub>The pig valve wears out quickly,

429
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,260
<15-3,Taub>十年内  你将需要第二次心脏手术
<15-3,Taub>So you'd need to have heart surgery again in ten years.

430
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,750
<15-4,Chase>我知道你对生孩子还犹豫不决
<15-4,Chase>I know that you're on the fence about having kids,

431
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,460
<15-4,Chase>不过泰勒很想要孩子
<15-4,Chase>But Taylor really wants them.

432
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,020
<15-4,Chase>博客里写着
<15-4,Chase>It's in the blog.

433
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,180
<15-4,Chase>恐怕你们两个需要决定是否要孩子前
<15-4,Chase>I'm afraid you two will need to agree on that decision

434
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,080
<15-4,Chase>达成一致
<15-4,Chase>Earlier than planned.

435
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,720
<15-5,Taylor>你决定
<15-5,Taylor>It's your call.

436
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,730
<15-6,Frankie>能把我的笔记本递给我吗
<15-6,Frankie>Can you pass me my laptop?

437
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,640
<15-7,Taylor>当真吗
<15-7,Taylor>Seriously?

438
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,710
<15-8,Frankie>我要看看大家的意见
<15-8,Frankie>I want to get some feedback.

439
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,810
<15-9,Taylor>你真觉得陌生人不假思索的回答
<15-9,Taylor>You really think that asking strangers for some off-the-top- of-their-head response

440
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,150
<15-9,Taylor>会有帮助吗
<15-9,Taylor>Is gonna be helpful here?

441
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,330
<15-9,Taylor>很多你的读者支持保护动物
<15-9,Taylor>A lot of your readers are into animal rights.

442
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,330
<15-9,Taylor>他们让你差不多成了素食主义者
<15-9,Taylor>They've got you 2/3 of the way to vegan.

443
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,430
<15-9,Taylor>他们会怎么说
<15-9,Taylor>What are they gonna say

444
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,480
<15-9,Taylor>要是知道了你花钱用猪的命救自己的命
<15-9,Taylor>about you buying your life with the life of a pig?

445
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,200
<15-10,Frankie>无论他们说什么  我不是非做不可
<15-10,Frankie>Whatever they say, I don't have to do it.

446
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,700
<15-11,Taylor>结果不会这样的
<15-11,Taylor>It won't work out that way.

447
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,670
<15-11,Taylor>我们才是不得不接受这一切的人
<15-11,Taylor>And we're the ones that are gonna have to live with this.

448
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,910
<15-11,Taylor>求你了  弗兰琪
<15-11,Taylor>Please, Frankie.

449
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,270
<15-11,Taylor>不要告诉他们
<15-11,Taylor>Don't tell them.

450
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,870
<15-12,Frankie>要是我开始有所保留
<15-12,Frankie>If I start picking and choosing,

451
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,120
<15-12,Frankie>我就是不诚实
<15-12,Frankie>I'm being dishonest.

452
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,640
<15-12,Frankie>对不起
<15-12,Frankie>I'm sorry.

453
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,610
<16-1,Sandy>谢谢
<16-1,Sandy>Thanks.

454
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,110
<16-2,Sandy>不过我还是要谢谢
<16-2,Sandy>Though I guess I should thank

455
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,650
<16-2,Sandy>教会你取悦女性的那个人
<16-2,Sandy>Whoever taught you how to please a woman.

456
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,040
<16-2,Sandy>或许是林中仙子
<16-2,Sandy>Maybe it was the forest nymphs.

457
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,480
<16-3,Wilson>把我的迷魂记海报弄回来了
<16-3,Wilson>Get my vertigo poster back.

458
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
<17-1,Cashier>千万别怕  精确找零
<17-1,Cashier>Be not afraid. It's exact change.

459
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,780
<17-2,Wilson>好
<17-2,Wilson>Okay.

460
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,900
<17-3,Chase>你好
<17-3,Chase>Hello?

461
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,500
<17-4,Wilson>我期待有关于豪斯的不利消息
<17-4,Wilson>I'm looking to get something on House.

462
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,420
<17-5,Chase>你就不能直接找爱情仙子打探秘密吗
<17-5,Chase>Couldn't you just ask the love nymphs for the secret?

463
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,230
<17-6,Wilson>不  我的任务是找到豪斯不愿公开的事情
<17-6,Wilson>Don't. My mission is to find something that House would not like to see made public

464
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,450
<17-6,Wilson>并公诸于众
<17-6,Wilson>And make it public.

465
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,670
<17-6,Wilson>入伙
<17-6,Wilson>In.

466
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,470
<17-7,Chase>不过你比任何人都了解他
<17-7,Chase>But you know him better than anyone.

467
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,030
<17-7,Chase>为什么还要我帮忙
<17-7,Chase>Why do you need my help?

468
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,210
<17-8,Wilson>豪斯不会在公寓里留下任何秘密
<17-8,Wilson>House would never leave anything secret around the condo.

469
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,270
<17-8,Wilson>不过你们和他在一个办公室工作
<17-8,Wilson>But you've worked in the same office with him,

470
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,840
<17-8,Wilson>断断续续  几年了
<17-8,Wilson>On and off, for years.

471
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,400
<17-8,Wilson>回想一下
<17-8,Wilson>Think back.

472
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,480
<17-8,Wilson>过去有没有什么古怪的来电
<17-8,Wilson>Were there ever any odd phone calls

473
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,680
<17-8,Wilson>或者来访者
<17-8,Wilson>Or visitors from the past?

474
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,030
<17-9,Chase>他都明着带妓女来医院
<17-9,Chase>He openly brings prostitutes into the hospital,

475
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,060
<17-9,Chase>他找赌注经纪人下注赌马因为他懒得去马场赌
<17-9,Chase>And he gambles with bookies 'cause he's too lazy to go to the OTB.

476
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,690
<17-9,Chase>你还问
<17-9,Chase>And you're asking for some--

477
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,290
<17-10,Wilson>什么  什么
<17-10,Wilson>What? What?

478
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,300
<17-10,Wilson>什么
<17-10,Wilson>What?

479
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,930
<17-11,Chase>他在读《金色情挑》
<17-11,Chase>He's reading the Golden Bowl.

480
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,630
<17-12,Wilson>金色  Henry James写的
<17-12,Wilson>The gold-- by Henry James?

481
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,370
<17-12,Wilson>对
<17-12,Wilson>Yeah.

482
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,400
<17-13,Chase>不  不  他不是真的在读
<17-13,Chase>No, no, he's not really reading it.

483
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,110
<17-14,Wilson>我不明白
<17-14,Wilson>Okay. I don't understand.

484
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,590
<17-15,Chase>那本书少说有400页
<17-15,Chase>That book's at least 400 pages long.

485
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,420
<17-15,Chase>无论他读的什么  只有一半厚
<17-15,Chase>Whatever he's reading is only half that thick.

486
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,560
<17-16,Wilson>或许他读的是小字版
<17-16,Wilson>Maybe he's reading a version with a smaller font.

487
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,250
<17-17,Chase>他没用老花镜
<17-17,Chase>He's not using his reading glasses.

488
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,040
<17-18,Wilson>有道理
<17-18,Wilson>That's a good point.

489
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,490
<17-19,Chase>他取下《金色情挑》的封面
<17-19,Chase>He took the cover off the Golden Bowl

490
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,490
<17-19,Chase>放在另一本书的外面  那样就没人知道 他在读什么了
<17-19,Chase>And put it onto this other book so no one would know what he was reading.

491
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,720
<17-19,Chase>无论是什么  他都难以启齿
<17-19,Chase>Whatever it is, he's ashamed of it.

492
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,040
<18-1,Frankie>我决定用塑料的
<18-1,Frankie>I'm going with plastic.

493
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,130
<18-1,Frankie>更合理
<18-1,Frankie>It just makes more sense.

494
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,450
<18-1,Frankie>我不想以后再做手术了
<18-1,Frankie>I don't want another operation later.

495
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,780
<18-2,Taylor>你这么做不是因为这个
<18-2,Taylor>That's not why you're doing this.

496
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,570
<18-2,Taylor>当你第一次告诉我
<18-2,Taylor>Look, when you were first telling me

497
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
<18-2,Taylor>为何你喜欢互联网的时候  你说
<18-2,Taylor>About why you love the internet, you said

498
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,480
<18-2,Taylor>没人会再感觉孤独了
<18-2,Taylor>That no one has to be alone again.

499
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,810
<18-2,Taylor>无论是谁  无论你喜欢什么
<18-2,Taylor>Whoever you are, whatever you love,

500
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,090
<18-2,Taylor>你总能和某人相联系
<18-2,Taylor>You can connect with someone.

501
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,720
<18-2,Taylor>要是你打算再现波士顿倾茶事件
<18-2,Taylor>If you want to recreate the Boston Tea Party

502
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,890
<18-2,Taylor>同时打扮成党卫军的样子
<18-2,Taylor>While dressed as imperial storm troopers,

503
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,620
<18-2,Taylor>你能找到另外10个人
<18-2,Taylor>You can find the ten other people in the world

504
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,390
<18-2,Taylor>也想这么干
<18-2,Taylor>That have always wanted to do that.

505
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,710
<18-3,Frankie>现在还是一样
<18-3,Frankie>That hasn't changed.

506
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,410
<18-3,Frankie>但是你变了
<18-3,Frankie>But you have.

507
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,370
<18-4,Taylor>你现在做的  已经不是关于联系了
<18-4,Taylor>This thing that you do, it's not about connection anymore.

508
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,530
<18-4,Taylor>是关于观众
<18-4,Taylor>It's about an audience.

509
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,860
<18-4,Taylor>是场表演  你时刻关注点击率
<18-4,Taylor>It's a performance, and you've got one eye on the number of hits.

510
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,310
<18-4,Taylor>你把我们的生活变成了他们的娱乐
<18-4,Taylor>You've turned our lives into their entertainment.

511
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,410
<18-4,Taylor>你很聪敏
<18-4,Taylor>You're smart,

512
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,510
<18-4,Taylor>读你的东西很有趣
<18-4,Taylor>You're fun to read,

513
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,790
<18-4,Taylor>没有问题
<18-4,Taylor>It's okay.

514
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,030
<18-4,Taylor>不过不要把决定权交给他们
<18-4,Taylor>But don't give them this.

515
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,030
<18-4,Taylor>要是你说了  不要
<18-4,Taylor>Or if you do, don't...

516
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,030
<18-4,Taylor>再指望我留在这里
<18-4,Taylor>Expect me to be here.

517
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,920
<19-1,Wilson>是个不错的掩护
<19-1,Wilson>Well, it's a good cover choice.

518
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,410
<19-1,Wilson>不是每个人都会看的
<19-1,Wilson>It's not like anyone would pick it up.

519
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,400
<19-2,Chase>是卡梅隆最喜欢的书
<19-2,Chase>It's Cameron's favorite book.

520
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,080
<19-2,Chase>我都不知道是说什么的
<19-2,Chase>I don't even know what it's about.

521
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,900
<19-3,Wilson>别为难自己
<19-3,Wilson>Don't do that to yourself.

522
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,860
<19-3,Wilson>这是什么
<19-3,Wilson>What the hell?

523
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,620
<19-4,Wilson>给他个电脑就像是把钚交给诺博士
<19-4,Wilson>Giving him a computer is like giving plutonium to Dr. No.

524
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:34,960
<19-5,Chase>找到了
<19-5,Chase>Got it.

525
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,100
<19-6,Wilson>循序渐进  每日布道
<19-6,Wilson>Step by step: sermons for everyday life?

526
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,120
<19-7,Chase>这些是经文布道
<19-7,Chase>These are literal sermons,

527
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,560
<19-7,Chase>牧师写的
<19-7,Chase>Written by a minister.

528
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,900
<19-7,Chase>爱你的邻居即便他们的音响吵得你整夜无眠
<19-7,Chase>Loving thy neighbor even when thy neighbor's stereo is keeping you up at night.

529
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,970
<19-7,Chase>他为何读这个
<19-7,Chase>Why would he read this?

530
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,260
<19-8,Wilson>他为何藏着这个
<19-8,Wilson>Why would he hide it?

531
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,560
<19-8,Wilson>他读圣经  他读古兰经
<19-8,Wilson>He reads the bible, he reads the koran,

532
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,730
<19-8,Wilson>他说他想知道人们都犯些什么错
<19-8,Wilson>He says he likes to know what mistakes people are making.

533
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,190
<19-9,Chase>你觉得他说真诚的吗
<19-9,Chase>You think he's sincere?

534
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,370
<19-9,Chase>你觉得他真能从中悟到什么吗
<19-9,Chase>You think that he's actually getting something out of this?

535
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,320
<19-10,Wilson>不知道
<19-10,Wilson>I don't know.

536
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,780
<19-11,Chase>真是个伪君子
<19-11,Chase>What a hypocrite.

537
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,410
<19-11,Chase>能怎么利用这事  让他痛苦却还有趣
<19-11,Chase>How can we use this in a cruel yet funny way?

538
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,040
<19-12,Wilson>你知道吗
<19-12,Wilson>You know what?

539
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,680
<19-12,Wilson>别对任何人说
<19-12,Wilson>Don't mention this to anyone.

540
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,190
<19-13,Chase>那还有什么意思呢
<19-13,Chase>Well, so what was the point?

541
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,890
<20-1,Frankie>我醒的时候  你会在吗
<20-1,Frankie>Are you gonna be here when I wake up?

542
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,140
<20-1,Frankie>我讨厌你不写博客
<20-1,Frankie>I hate that you don't have a blog.

543
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,740
<20-1,Frankie>我讨厌我不知道你在想什么
<20-1,Frankie>I hate that I don't know what you're thinking.

544
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,440
<20-2,Taylor>我们现在不要谈这个
<20-2,Taylor>Let's not get into it right now.

545
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,030
<20-2,Taylor>我们需要你撑过手术
<20-2,Taylor>We need to get you through surgery.

546
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,410
<20-3,Frankie>我不想进去  还知道你会陪我度过手术期
<20-3,Frankie>I don't want to go in there knowing that you'll stick with me through surgery

547
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,850
<20-3,Frankie>只因为这是善良的人该做的
<20-3,Frankie>'cause that's what good guys do,

548
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,440
<20-3,Frankie>可是一旦我好了  你就会离开
<20-3,Frankie>But once I'm better, you'll be gone.

549
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,680
<20-4,Taylor>我们不要谈这些
<20-4,Taylor>Let's not get into it now.

550
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,770
<20-5,Frankie>疼
<20-5,Frankie>It hurts.

551
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,350
<20-6,Surgeon>是她的心脏吗
<20-6,Surgeon>Is it her heart?

552
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,620
<20-7,Frankie>不  在这里
<20-7,Frankie>No, it's here.

553
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,670
<20-7,Frankie>这里
<20-7,Frankie>Here.

554
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,040
<20-8,Foreman>把她推进去
<20-8,Foreman>Get her inside.

555
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,630
<21-1,Chase>你阑尾破裂
<21-1,Chase>Your appendix burst.

556
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,680
<21-1,Chase>我们不得不摘除
<21-1,Chase>We had to remove it.

557
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,710
<21-2,Foreman>活检证实了都是非正常细胞和淋巴癌一致
<21-2,Foreman>And the biopsy confirms it was full of abnormal cells consistent with lymphoma.

558
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,660
<21-3,Frankie>我得了癌症吗
<21-3,Frankie>I have cancer?

559
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,950
<21-4,Foreman>我们推迟了心脏瓣膜手术
<21-4,Foreman>We've postponed putting in the new valve.

560
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,270
<21-5,Frankie>我的意思是  我想我们做 什么  化疗之类的
<21-5,Frankie>So I mean, I guess we do, what, chemo and all that stuff?

561
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,380
<21-6,Chase>对  不过显然你患病有段时间了
<21-6,Chase>Yes, but apparently you've had this for some time.

562
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,450
<21-6,Chase>当你盲肠破裂时  就好象水坝坍塌
<21-6,Chase>When your appendix burst, it was like a dam giving way.

563
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,410
<21-6,Chase>癌细胞在你体内循环
<21-6,Chase>The cells went streaming throughout your body.

564
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,520
<21-7,Frankie>你们是说会进行治疗  但不认为会有效
<21-7,Frankie>So you're saying you'll treat, but you don't expect it to work.

565
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,300
<21-7,Frankie>所以不做心脏瓣膜手术了
<21-7,Frankie>That's why no valve.

566
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,840
<21-7,Frankie>没有意义
<21-7,Frankie>It's pointless.

567
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,220
<21-8,Foreman>我们医学院院长
<21-8,Foreman>Our dean of medicine

568
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,290
<21-8,Foreman>已同意一项临床试验
<21-8,Foreman>Has approved an experimental treatment.

569
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,400
<21-8,Foreman>我们用你独有的癌症细胞标志
<21-8,Foreman>We use your unique cancer cell signature

570
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,460
<21-8,Foreman>制备针对淋巴癌的疫苗
<21-8,Foreman>To create a targeted lymphoma vaccine.

571
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,100
<21-9,Frankie>好的  那个能治愈我吗
<21-9,Frankie>Okay, so that'll cure me?

572
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,860
<21-10,Chase>我们不确定结果会怎样
<21-10,Chase>Well, we're not actually sure what it'll do,

573
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,220
<21-10,Chase>但目的在于培养你的免疫系统
<21-10,Chase>But the intention is to train your immune system

574
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,250
<21-10,Chase>识别并杀死具有相同恶性标志的细胞
<21-10,Chase>To recognize and kill cells bearing the same malignant signature

575
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,040
<21-10,Chase>同时不伤害健康细胞
<21-10,Chase>While leaving healthy cells alone.

576
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,950
<21-10,Chase>不过  就像福曼医生说的
<21-10,Chase>But, as Dr. Foreman says,

577
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,310
<21-11,Frankie>-是试验性的  -我明白
<21-11,Frankie>- It's experimental. - I see.

578
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,390
<21-12,Taylor>没有这个的话  我们还有多少时间
<21-12,Taylor>So without it, what kind of time are we talking about

579
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,450
<21-13,Chase>确切的预期是不可能的
<21-13,Chase>An exact prognosis is impossible.

580
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,640
<21-14,Taylor>那么大概呢
<21-14,Taylor>Well, how about a guess?

581
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,380
<21-14,Taylor>总是有的吧
<21-14,Taylor>Something, please.

582
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,080
<21-15,Foreman>根据病况和你类似的人的情况...
<21-15,Foreman>Based on people in situations like yours...

583
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,400
<21-15,Foreman>可能是一年
<21-15,Foreman>Maybe a year.

584
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,890
<21-16,Taylor>宝贝  该怎么办就怎么办
<21-16,Taylor>Baby, whatever we have to do, we'll do.

585
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,830
<21-16,Taylor>我会照顾好你
<21-16,Taylor>I can take care of you.

586
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
<21-16,Taylor>我能在家工作
<21-16,Taylor>I can work from home.

587
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,910
<21-17,Frankie>听起来不错
<21-17,Frankie>Sounds good.

588
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
<21-17,Frankie>谢谢你们让我知道
<21-17,Frankie>Thank you for letting me know.

589
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,720
<21-17,Frankie>准备好了  我们就可以开始治疗了
<21-17,Frankie>We'll start with the treatment whenever it's ready.

590
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,610
<22-1,Chase>她会勇敢地承受化疗  还是毫无反应呢
<22-1,Chase>Is she being a good soldier, or is she in denial?

591
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,080
<22-2,Foreman>毫无反应是最常见的第一反应
<22-2,Foreman>Denial's not unusual for a first reaction.

592
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,510
<22-3,Chase>或者也可能成为一种病症
<22-3,Chase>Or it could be a symptom.

593
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,610
<22-3,Chase>某些淋巴瘤会影响感知
<22-3,Chase>Some lymphomas affect cognition.

594
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,980
<22-4,Foreman>如果是毫无反应  她需要时间适应
<22-4,Foreman>If it is denial, she needs time to process.

595
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,610
<22-4,Foreman>如果是病症
<22-4,Foreman>If it's a symptom,

596
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,650
<22-4,Foreman>希望疫苗疗法可以起作用
<22-4,Foreman>Hopefully treatment with the vaccine will help.

597
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,570
<22-5,Chase>你好  桑迪
<22-5,Chase>Hey, Sandy.

598
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,870
<22-5,Chase>我能借一下你的车吗
<22-5,Chase>Can I borrow your car?

599
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,560
<23-1,Chase>她给了我钥匙
<23-1,Chase>She gave me the keys.

600
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,730
<23-2,Thirteen>你是医生  她不过在讨好你
<23-2,Thirteen>You're a doctor. She was doing you a favor.

601
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,870
<23-3,Chase>她几乎不认识我
<23-3,Chase>She barely knows me.

602
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,020
<23-3,Chase>我曾一度自我欺骗
<23-3,Chase>I've been deluding myself

603
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,040
<23-3,Chase>觉得自己擅长和人交往
<23-3,Chase>That I'm actually connecting with people.

604
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,590
<23-4,Thirteen>我的初恋  后来被证明
<23-4,Thirteen>The first person I ever fell in love with

605
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,120
<23-4,Thirteen>简直就是个演员
<23-4,Thirteen>Turned out to be a total tool.

606
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,390
<23-4,Thirteen>我们邂逅时  他幽默  有风度
<23-4,Thirteen>I mean, he came across all funny and charming

607
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,920
<23-4,Thirteen>又很有思想  但都是装出来的
<23-4,Thirteen>And thoughtful, but it was an act.

608
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,210
<23-4,Thirteen>他要得到一切他想要的东西
<23-4,Thirteen>He saw something he wanted,

609
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,420
<23-4,Thirteen>而且他知道他得伪装成什么样子来得到
<23-4,Thirteen>And he knew he had to behave a certain way to get it.

610
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,300
<23-4,Thirteen>回头看看  当时我才17  他已经30了
<23-4,Thirteen>In retrospect, the fact that I was 17 and he was 30

611
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,440
<23-4,Thirteen>理所当然啊
<23-4,Thirteen>Should have been a clue.

612
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,030
<23-4,Thirteen>读懂一个人需要时间
<23-4,Thirteen>Figuring out who people are takes time.

613
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,350
<23-4,Thirteen>大概是别人试着让你留下印象的两倍时间
<23-4,Thirteen>It takes twice as much time if they're trying to impress you.

614
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,640
<23-4,Thirteen>现在我要么从中领悟  不管谁会借给我车
<23-4,Thirteen>Now I could take from this that anyone who loans me their car

615
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,940
<23-4,Thirteen>都别有心机
<23-4,Thirteen>Has an ulterior motive,

616
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,700
<23-4,Thirteen>要么我会接受这是学雷锋做好事
<23-4,Thirteen>Or I can accept that it's just a nice thing to do

617
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,090
<23-4,Thirteen>但人敬我一尺  我敬人一丈
<23-4,Thirteen>And take people as they come.

618
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,110
<23-4,Thirteen>你要打第一针吗
<23-4,Thirteen>You wanna do the first injection?

619
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,950
<24-1,Wilson>你为什么要读牧师写的书
<24-1,Wilson>Why are you reading a book by a unitarian minister?

620
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,480
<24-2,House>是从读书俱乐部来的
<24-2,House>Book club.

621
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,640
<24-2,House>-奥普拉(电视主持人)一直说...  -我是认真的
<24-2,House>- Oprah was going on and on... - I'm serious.

622
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,870
<24-3,Wilson>这  这太扯了
<24-3,Wilson>This--this is messed up.

623
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,420
<24-4,House>病人写的
<24-4,House>Patient wrote it.

624
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,230
<24-5,Wilson>不  你没有过叫这名字的病人
<24-5,Wilson>No, you've never treated a patient with this name.

625
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,180
<24-5,Wilson>我查过了
<24-5,Wilson>I looked it up.

626
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,830
<24-6,House>是我的心理医生留给我的作业
<24-6,House>It's an assignment from my therapist.

627
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,850
<24-7,Wilson>不  不是的
<24-7,Wilson>No, it wasn't.

628
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,970
<24-7,Wilson>你尊敬的人是不会期待给你这种东西来帮助你的
<24-7,Wilson>No one you respect would give you this and expect it to be helpful.

629
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,690
<24-8,House>不过是本书罢了
<24-8,House>It's a book!

630
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,330
<24-9,Wilson>关于布道的
<24-9,Wilson>Of sermons.

631
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,530
<24-9,Wilson>对别人来说  是灵魂的启蒙
<24-9,Wilson>For anyone else, spiritually enlightening.

632
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,680
<24-9,Wilson>对你来说  简直就是脑袋里进水
<24-9,Wilson>For you, it's practically a psychotic break.

633
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,890
<24-9,Wilson>我知道有时候不用维可丁
<24-9,Wilson>I know that you have trouble sometimes with the pain

634
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,750
<24-9,Wilson>你的腿疼会给你造成困扰  是因为这个吗
<24-9,Wilson>Without the vicodin-- is that it?

635
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,290
<24-9,Wilson>难道你已经别无选择
<24-9,Wilson>Are you so out of options,

636
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,340
<24-9,Wilson>要靠那些你认为毫无理性的东西来寻求答案吗
<24-9,Wilson>You're looking for answers in what you consider irrationality?

637
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,340
<24-10,House>我没事  相信我
<24-10,House>I'm all right. Trust me.

638
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,870
<24-11,Wilson>没事是因为你又吃维可丁了吗
<24-11,Wilson>Are you all right because you're back on vicodin?

639
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,370
<24-12,House>我说过了  相信我
<24-12,House>I said, "Trust me."

640
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,460
<24-13,Wilson>我知道这其中有所意义
<24-13,Wilson>I know this means something.

641
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,420
<24-14,House>介意还给我吗
<24-14,House>Do you mind?

642
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,430
<24-14,House>我还没看完
<24-14,House>I haven't finished it yet.

643
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,370
<25-1,Taub>多谢你的礼物
<25-1,Taub>Thanks for the gifts

645
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,830
<25-1,Taub>但如果这些故事能让你安度
<25-1,Taub>But if these stories have helped you

646
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,090
<25-1,Taub>灵魂上的不安...
<25-1,Taub>Through some spiritual turmoil--

647
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,570
<25-2,House>看看第六章
<25-2,House>Read chapter six,

648
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,250
<25-2,House>名字是  "闭嘴"
<25-2,House>Entitled "Shut the hell up."

649
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,370
<25-3,Foreman>我倒很欣赏这章  药物治疗前
<25-3,Foreman>I appreciated the inscription about the benefits of prayer

650
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,640
<25-3,Foreman>祈祷的好处
<25-3,Foreman>Before medical treatments.

651
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,770
<25-3,Foreman>而且我认为
<25-3,Foreman>And I think it's great

652
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,930
<25-3,Foreman>你能成为上帝的证人  真好
<25-3,Foreman>That you have been called to witness by the lord.

653
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,720
<25-4,House>第二章  "去死"
<25-4,House>Chapter two, "Bite me."

654
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,810
<25-5,Chase>13正要给我们的病人
<25-5,Chase>Thirteen's giving our patient

655
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,650
<25-5,Chase>注射她的第三针疫苗
<25-5,Chase>Her third vaccine injection.

656
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,130
<25-5,Chase>目前为止  她反应良好
<25-5,Chase>She's responding well so far.

657
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,420
<25-6,House>你们从哪来的这些书
<25-6,House>Where'd you get all these copies?

658
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,210
<25-6,House>书已经卖完了啊
<25-6,House>It's out of print.

659
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,290
<25-7,Chase>我给作者打过电话
<25-7,Chase>I called the author.

660
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,430
<25-7,Chase>他地下室里有好几箱呢
<25-7,Chase>He's got cartons of the thing in his basement.

661
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,230
<25-8,House>你打电话给他了吗  你说了什么
<25-8,House>You called him? What'd you say?

662
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,030
<25-9,Chase>我认识的某人从这本书里得到了
<25-9,Chase>That I knew some people who could benefit spiritually

663
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,370
<25-10,House>-灵魂上的升华  -你提到我了吗
<25-10,House>- From the book. - Did you mention me?

664
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,220
<25-10,House>没有
<25-10,House>Mm, no.

665
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,490
<26-1,Thirteen>高烧华氏104度
<26-1,Thirteen>Fever's at 104.

666
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,670
<26-1,Thirteen>抗体破坏了她的自身免疫反应系统
<26-1,Thirteen>The antibodies tripped her autoimmune response.

667
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,420
<26-1,Thirteen>疫苗正在害死她
<26-1,Thirteen>The vaccine is killing her.

668
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,060
<26-1,Thirteen>很显然不起作用
<26-1,Thirteen>Well, clearly it's not working.

669
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,410
<27-1,Cuddy>必须停止疫苗治疗
<27-1,Cuddy>You have to stop the vaccine.

670
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,400
<27-2,House>没错  放弃治疗吧  让她按计划去死吧
<27-2,House>Sure. Give up. Let her die on schedule.

671
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,580
<27-3,Cuddy>总比在死的更快要好一些
<27-3,Cuddy>It's better than speeding up the schedule.

672
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,910
<27-3,Cuddy>这种症状来的有多快
<27-3,Cuddy>How quickly did this come on?

673
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,590
<27-4,Thirteen>今天下午我叫醒她
<27-4,Thirteen>She was all right when I woke her this afternoon

674
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,790
<27-4,Thirteen>准备打第二针疫苗时还好好的
<27-4,Thirteen>To give her the second injection.

675
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,960
<27-5,Cuddy>是因为应激
<27-5,Cuddy>Of the stimulating agent,

676
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,780
<27-5,Cuddy>加上第一针疫苗
<27-5,Cuddy>Which, added to the first injection,

677
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,020
<27-5,Cuddy>让她的免疫系统负担过重
<27-5,Cuddy>Switched her immune reaction into overdrive.

678
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,100
<27-6,House>她怎么会睡着呢
<27-6,House>Why was she sleeping?

679
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,140
<27-6,House>有谁能在白天的医院里睡着呢
<27-6,House>Who can sleep in a hospital during the daytime?

680
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,380
<27-7,Chase>我一点也不惊讶  她很累
<27-7,Chase>I'm not surprised. She's tired.

681
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,720
<27-7,Chase>她一直是个夜猫子
<27-7,Chase>She's always been a night owl.

682
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,650
<27-7,Chase>在治疗她的过程中
<27-7,Chase>Just by treating her,

683
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,460
<27-7,Chase>我们完全颠倒了她的生物钟
<27-7,Chase>We've completely disrupted her schedule.

684
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,690
<27-8,House>她博客上是这么说的吗
<27-8,House>Is that what her blog says?

685
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,150
<27-8,House>她是个夜猫子吗
<27-8,House>She's a night owl?

686
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,180
<27-9,Chase>不  是她告诉我的
<27-9,Chase>No, she told me.

687
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,800
<27-10,House>什么时候  现在  曾经
<27-10,House>In what tense? Is? Was?

688
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,930
<27-10,House>还是将来呢
<27-10,House>Will have been?

689
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,050
<27-11,Chase>我不清楚
<27-11,Chase>I'm not sure.

690
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,340
<27-12,Cuddy>你在看什么
<27-12,Cuddy>What are you onto?

691
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,470
<27-13,House>看看这个帖子上的时间
<27-13,House>Look at the time stamp on this post.

692
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,180
<27-13,House>凌晨2点半
<27-13,House>2:30 a.M.

693
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,270
<27-13,House>这张是凌晨4点
<27-13,House>Here's one at 4:00 a.M.

694
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,130
<27-14,Foreman>不管他在看什么  都改变不了事实
<27-14,Foreman>Whatever he's onto doesn't change the fact

695
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,580
<27-14,Foreman>她有淋巴瘤  而我们给她用了危险的疫苗
<27-14,Foreman>That she has lymphoma and we gave her a dangerous vaccine.

696
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,230
<27-15,House>-我们需要...  -看看6个月以前
<27-15,House>- We need to-- - six months ago,

697
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,900
<27-15,House>她还是白天写帖子的
<27-15,House>She's posting in the daytime.

698
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,620
<27-15,House>2年前  也是白天
<27-15,House>Two years ago, daytime.

699
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,890
<27-15,House>那是她的自然生物钟
<27-15,House>That's her natural rhythm.

700
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,910
<27-16,Taub>黑白颠倒
<27-16,Taub>Day-night reversal.

701
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,500
<27-17,Chase>难道不是肝病的症状吗
<27-17,Chase>Sign of liver disease?

702
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,990
<27-18,House>那些不像是淋巴瘤的病症
<27-18,House>Which doesn't fit lymphoma.

703
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,460
<27-19,Taub>但我们知道她已经有淋巴瘤了
<27-19,Taub>But we know she has lymphoma.

704
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,160
<27-20,House>我们知道她有看起来像是
<27-20,House>We know she has the cell atypia

705
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,440
<27-20,House>淋巴瘤的异常细胞
<27-20,House>That indicates lymphoma.

706
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,520
<27-20,House>给她的肝脏做活检
<27-20,House>Biopsy her liver.

707
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,860
<27-20,House>我刚才说的很酷  不是吗
<27-20,House>That was pretty cool what I did, right?

708
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,530
<27-20,House>你想弄明白吗
<27-20,House>You wanna make out?

709
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,270
<28-1,Chase>你没有得淋巴瘤
<28-1,Chase>You don't have lymphoma.

710
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,410
<28-2,Frankie>但你说过我的阑尾上都是癌症细胞
<28-2,Frankie>But you said my appendix was full of cancer cells.

711
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,950
<28-3,Foreman>你阑尾上确实满是看起来像是淋巴瘤的异常细胞
<28-3,Foreman>Your appendix was full of cells that showed a lymphocytic atypia.

712
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,280
<28-3,Foreman>我们现在认为那是由于某些
<28-3,Foreman>We now think they were a granulomatous buildup

713
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,920
<28-3,Foreman>不明原因产生的肉芽肿增生
<28-3,Foreman>From some unknown cause.

714
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,380
<28-3,Foreman>那就是说...
<28-3,Foreman>So...

715
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,640
<28-4,Frankie>我不会死了吗
<28-4,Frankie>I'm not dying?

716
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,980
<28-5,Chase>实际上  你比我们想象的要死的快
<28-5,Chase>You're actually dying more quickly than we thought.

717
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,530
<28-6,Foreman>除非我们弄清楚
<28-6,Foreman>Unless we figure out

718
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,750
<28-6,Foreman>是什么导致了你的肝脏衰竭...
<28-6,Foreman>What's causing your liver failure...

719
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,500
<28-7,Frankie>你还有3到4天时间
<28-7,Frankie>You have three or four days.

720
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,350
<28-7,Frankie>你们说我还有3到4天是什么意思
<28-7,Frankie>What the hell do you mean I have three or four days?

721
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,950
<28-8,Foreman>看来我们跳过毫无反应这关了
<28-8,Foreman>Well, we're past denial.

722
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,420
<29-1,Foreman>可能不是我们造成她发烧的
<29-1,Foreman>Maybe we didn't cause the fever.

723
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,700
<29-2,Taub>我们给她用了疫苗
<29-2,Taub>We gave her the vaccine,

724
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,170
<29-2,Taub>而她开始发烧
<29-2,Taub>And her fever spiked.

725
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,010
<29-3,Foreman>-我看来是...  -是的  但停用
<29-3,Foreman>- Seems to me...  - Yes, but it persisted

726
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,660
<29-3,Foreman>疫苗之后她还在发烧
<29-3,Foreman>After we took her off the vaccine.

727
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,590
<29-3,Foreman>假如是一种新的病症呢
<29-3,Foreman>What if it's a new symptom?

728
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:09,960
<29-3,Foreman>好的
<29-3,Foreman>Okay.

729
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,490
<29-4,House>所以  发烧加上异常细胞  凝血障碍
<29-4,House>So we add fever to cell atypia, coagulopathy,

730
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,460
<29-4,House>肾脏  心脏  肝脏...
<29-4,House>Kidney, heart, liver...

731
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,570
<29-5,Taub>应该是一种传染病
<29-5,Taub>It has to be an infection.

732
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,480
<29-6,Thirteen>但是是什么传染病呢  她认识的人没人得病
<29-6,Thirteen>But which one? No one she knows is sick.

733
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,620
<29-6,Thirteen>她也没有出去旅游
<29-6,Thirteen>She hasn't traveled anywhere.

734
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,240
<29-6,Thirteen>在她给我们的病史里没有任何发现
<29-6,Thirteen>There's nothing in the history she gave us.

735
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
<29-6,Thirteen>在她的博客里也一无所获
<29-6,Thirteen>Nothing in her blog.

736
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,540
<29-7,House>感染源肯定很特殊
<29-7,House>There has to be something unique to this infection.

737
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,890
<29-7,House>它的传播以及呈现方式也很特殊
<29-7,House>Something about its transmission and the way it manifests.

738
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,230
<29-7,House>她肯定遗漏了一些信息
<29-7,House>There has to be something she's not telling us.

739
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,390
<29-8,Chase>没有
<29-8,Chase>There isn't.

740
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,500
<29-8,Chase>她把所有一切都告诉了大家
<29-8,Chase>She's told us, and everyone else, everything.

741
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,650
<29-9,House>给她用广谱抗生素
<29-9,House>Start her on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

742
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,600
<29-9,House>既然我们都知晓一切
<29-9,House>Since we know everything,

743
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,540
<29-9,House>我们就该治疗一切
<29-9,House>we might as well treat for everything.

744
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,580
<29-10,Wilson>我随手拿了一本奇斯放在休息室里的书
<29-10,Wilson>I picked up one of the copies of the book that Chase left in the lounge.

745
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,780
<29-11,House>如果你继续这样
<29-11,House>If you're gonna be this way,

746
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,920
<29-11,House>我不会邀请你参加我的洗礼
<29-11,House>I'm not gonna invite you to my baptism.

747
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,370
<29-12,Wilson>这还是我第一次看见真的书封皮
<29-12,Wilson>First time I'd seen the real dust jacket.

748
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,300
<29-12,Wilson>后面是作者的照片
<29-12,Wilson>The inside back flap, there was a picture of the author.

749
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,310
<29-12,Wilson>当我认出相片的人物时我无比惊讶
<29-12,Wilson>Imagine how surprised I was when I recognized him.

750
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,660
<29-12,Wilson>你的生父是一名牧师吗
<29-12,Wilson>Your biological father is a minister?

751
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,760
<29-13,House>自然选择规律不总是万无一失的
<29-13,House>Natural selection is not an infallible force.

752
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,440
<29-13,House>我不明白
<29-13,House>I don't get it.

753
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,740
<29-14,Wilson>他是你们家一名朋友
<29-14,Wilson>I mean, okay, he was a friend of the family.

754
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,260
<29-14,Wilson>你只有在小时候见过他
<29-14,Wilson>You'd only known him when you were a kid.

755
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,090
<29-14,Wilson>可如果你现在想见他
<29-14,Wilson>But if you wanted to meet him now,

756
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,170
<29-14,Wilson>想知道他现在的容貌
<29-14,Wilson>Get an idea of what he's like,

757
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,350
<29-14,Wilson>为什么不直接去找他呢
<29-14,Wilson>Why not just go talk to him?

758
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,790
<29-15,House>你好  我叫格雷戈  你曾睡了我母亲
<29-15,House>"Hi, it's Greg. You slept with my mother."

759
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,370
<29-16,Wilson>这种事情你做得出来
<29-16,Wilson>You're capable of it.

760
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,820
<29-17,House>我只是稍微有些好奇
<29-17,House>I was mildly curious.

761
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,090
<29-17,House>但仅能驱使我去阅读他的著作 还不足以驱使我去给他打电话
<29-17,House>Enough to read a book, not enough to make a phone call.

762
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,970
<29-18,Wilson>不是吧  你不仅仅看这本书
<29-18,Wilson>Please. You didn't read this.

763
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,560
<29-18,Wilson>你深入研究了它  为什么
<29-18,Wilson>You studied it. Why?

764
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,920
<29-18,Wilson>你这辈子都认为这上面说的都是废话
<29-18,Wilson>All your life, you've thought this was crap.

765
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,850
<29-18,Wilson>你不可能突然之间改变
<29-18,Wilson>You can't suddenly turn around

766
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,620
<29-18,Wilson>在一堆废话上建立一个新的世界观
<29-18,Wilson>and build a whole new worldview based on crap.

767
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,340
<29-19,House>废话
<29-19,House>Crap.

768
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,760
<29-20,Wilson>你最好不是为了逃避这严肃对话而装的
<29-20,Wilson>You better not be faking this just to get out of a tough conversation.

769
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,880
<30-1,House>你排便的吧
<30-1,House>Do you poop?

770
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,890
<30-1,House>别害羞
<30-1,House>Come on.

771
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,640
<30-1,House>每个人都排便
<30-1,House>Everybody poops.

772
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,430
<30-1,House>我上学的时候看过一本书
<30-1,House>I read the book in medical school.

773
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,050
<30-2,Chase>-漂浮还是下沉  -他就是那个怪才
<30-2,Chase>- Sinkers or floaters? - This is the wizard.

774
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,230
<30-3,House>软便带油花
<30-3,House>Greasy and soft

775
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,300
<30-3,House>还是干硬颗粒状
<30-3,House>or hard and pellet-like?

776
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,610
<30-4,Frankie>漂浮  软便带有油膜
<30-4,Frankie>Floaters and the first one.

777
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,710
<30-5,House>你不得不说谎
<30-5,House>You just had to be so swoft.

778
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,860
<30-5,House>你是个伪君子
<30-5,House>You're a hypocrite.

779
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,700
<30-5,House>虽然你不撒谎  没有秘密
<30-5,House>No lies, no secrets,

780
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,410
<30-5,House>不过你所有的秘密都停滞于你的结肠里
<30-5,House>but everything stops at your colon.

781
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,470
<30-5,House>你写了4000页的博客 却对你的粪便只字未提
<30-5,House>4,000 pages, not one word about BMs

782
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,010
<30-5,House>想必你也不会去闻它
<30-5,House>And I bet yours don't smell at all.

783
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,480
<30-6,Frankie>没人愿意听这些吧
<30-6,Frankie>Nobody wants to hear about that stuff.

784
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,060
<30-7,House>读者们是不关心
<30-7,House>Readers don't.

785
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,510
<30-7,House>不真心关心你的人们也不会在意这事
<30-7,House>People who don't really care about you don't.

786
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,500
<30-7,House>但是医生在意
<30-7,House>But doctors might.

787
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,890
<30-7,House>那些黏糊糊的东西数个月前变样了  是吗
<30-7,House>The icky stuff changed, right, a few months ago?

788
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,120
<30-8,Frankie>那是因为我吃素了
<30-8,Frankie>Well, I became a vegetarian.

789
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,750
<30-9,House>大多数人都误会素食主义者的饮食规律
<30-9,House>A lot of people misunderstand how a vegetarian diet works.

790
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,770
<30-9,House>你摄入的食物越精细
<30-9,House>You take in less unusable material,

791
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,740
<30-9,House>消化吸收效率就越高
<30-9,House>and your waste gets more efficient.

792
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,750
<30-9,House>大便越容易干结
<30-9,House>Harder and rounder.

793
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,550
<30-9,House>看看兔子的粪便就知道了
<30-9,House>Just look at the feces of rabbits.

794
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,560
<30-9,House>说真的  我好像有些
<30-9,House>Seriously. I think I might have some.

795
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,280
<30-10,Thirteen>吸收不良
<30-10,Thirteen>Malabsorption.

796
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,730
<30-10,Thirteen>她的身体无法吸收必要的营养
<30-10,Thirteen>Her system's not retaining the necessary nutrients.

797
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
<30-11,House>肠胃感染导致吸收不良
<30-11,House>A g.I. Infection causes malabsorption,

798
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,990
<30-11,House>肉芽肿筑成细胞
<30-11,House>Granulomatous buildup of cells.

799
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,610
<30-11,House>应该不是传染病  因为她周围没人得病
<30-11,House>It's not contagious since no one around her got sick--

800
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,690
<30-12,Chase and Thirteen>-惠普尔病  -惠普尔病（肠源性脂肪代谢障碍）
<30-12,Chase and Thirteen>- Whipple's disease. - Whipple's disease.

801
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,370
<30-13,House>一人一块骨头
<30-13,House>Let's split the credit.

802
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,940
<30-13,House>给她用复方磺胺甲基异恶唑
<30-13,House>Start her on co-trimoxazole.

803
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,900
<30-13,House>每个人都需要有些秘密
<30-13,House>We all need some secrets.

804
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,970
<30-13,House>只要不毒害我们 这些秘密会给予我们温暖与保护
<30-13,House>As long as they don't kill us, they keep us safe and warm.

805
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,820
<30-14,Frankie>我...
<30-14,Frankie>I'm...

806
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,560
<30-14,Frankie>我就要没事了吗
<30-14,Frankie>I'm gonna be okay?

807
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,120
<30-15,Chase>你还是要移植新的心脏瓣膜
<30-15,Chase>You'll still need a new heart valve,

808
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,440
<30-15,Chase>而且你还需要服用几年的药
<30-15,Chase>and you'll be on meds for a few years,

809
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,010
<30-15,Chase>不过基本上  是的
<30-15,Chase>But, basically, yeah.

810
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,420
<30-15,Chase>你的病会好的
<30-15,Chase>Your odds are good.

811
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:08,930
<30-16,Taylor>谢天谢地
<30-16,Taylor>Thank god.

812
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,880
<30-17,Frankie>看来我以后得用猪心瓣膜
<30-17,Frankie>I think I wanna go with the pig valve.

813
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,500
<30-18,Taylor>想必你要是不与大家分享这个消息你会抓狂的
<30-18,Taylor>I know you'll go crazy if you don't tell people.

814
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,320
<30-19,Frankie>你真贴心
<30-19,Frankie>Thank god you're an enabler.

815
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,010
<31-1,Chase>你觉得在网上聊天比面对面
<31-1,Chase>Do you think people can actually know each other better

816
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,580
<31-1,Chase>更容易了解对方吗
<31-1,Chase>on the internet than face-to-face?

817
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,400
<31-2,Thirteen>外貌会影响人的判断力
<31-2,Thirteen>Faces can be distracting,

818
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,190
<31-2,Thirteen>不过通过一个人的眼睛 能了解更多
<31-2,Thirteen>But there's nothing better than looking into someone's eyes

819
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,430
<31-2,Thirteen>以及诸如此类的问题
<31-2,Thirteen>and, well, everything that goes with that.

820
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,180
<31-2,Thirteen>我不明白
<31-2,Thirteen>I don't know.

821
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,200
<31-3,Chase>人们见面后  他们以貌取人
<31-3,Chase>People meet, they like something superficial,

822
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,960
<31-3,Chase>然后他们想当然的去揣测对方的性格
<31-3,Chase>and then they fill in the blanks with whatever they want to believe.

823
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,660
<31-4,Thirteen>为什么你为此而苦恼
<31-4,Thirteen>Why are you so hung up on this?

824
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,680
<31-4,Thirteen>我绝不相信仅仅是因为 你刚察觉自己长的帅吧
<31-4,Thirteen>I refuse to believe it's all because you just noticed you have a nice face.

825
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,970
<31-4,Thirteen>你刚结束了一段感情
<31-4,Thirteen>You just came off a relationship.

826
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,950
<31-4,Thirteen>你觉得事情更深层次
<31-4,Thirteen>You know things go deeper than...

827
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,790
<31-4,Thirteen>就是因为这些吗
<31-4,Thirteen>Is that what this is about?

828
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,740
<31-4,Thirteen>你和卡梅隆
<31-4,Thirteen>You and Cameron?

829
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,440
<31-5,Chase>起初是我先追她的
<31-5,Chase>I was the one that pursued her.

830
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,640
<31-5,Chase>或许我是有些想当然
<31-5,Chase>Maybe I was just filling in the blanks.

831
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,530
<31-5,Chase>也许...
<31-5,Chase>Maybe...

832
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,290
<31-5,Chase>或许我的第一感是正确的
<31-5,Chase>Maybe the first reaction was right.

833
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,680
<31-5,Chase>我们只是互相接近的两个人
<31-5,Chase>We were just two people who were in proximity

834
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,850
<31-5,Chase>然后发现被彼此吸引了  我不该...
<31-5,Chase>And found each other attractive, and I never should have...

835
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,900
<31-6,Thirteen>妄想症
<31-6,Thirteen>Paranoia.

836
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,740
<31-6,Thirteen>你对她是有感觉的
<31-6,Thirteen>You felt something real.

837
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,960
<31-6,Thirteen>她也如此
<31-6,Thirteen>So did she.

838
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,150
<31-6,Thirteen>别想否认这一切
<31-6,Thirteen>Don't try to take it back now.

839
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,280
<31-7,Chase>能把车借给我吗
<31-7,Chase>Can I borrow your car?

840
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,250
<31-7,Chase>不借
<31-7,Chase>No.

841
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,820
<32-1,Wilson>你为什么可以看你爸写的书
<32-1,Wilson>Why would it make more sense for you to read your father's book

842
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,330
<32-1,Wilson>而不愿意和他说话呢
<32-1,Wilson>than to go talk with him?

843
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,450
<32-2,House>你会写书吗
<32-2,House>Can you write a book?

844
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,040
<32-2,House>那我就不用跟你说话了
<32-2,House>So I can stop talking to you?

845
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,270
<32-3,Wilson>你不是在寻求精神洗礼
<32-3,Wilson>You weren't looking for some big catharsis.

846
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,470
<32-3,Wilson>你不愿意靠近他
<32-3,Wilson>You didn't want to hug the guy.

847
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,580
<32-3,Wilson>你只是想知道他的思维
<32-3,Wilson>You just wanted to know how his head works.

848
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,490
<32-3,Wilson>他的想法
<32-3,Wilson>How he thinks.

849
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,570
<32-4,House>我只是沉迷于牧师们的思考方式
<32-4,House>'cause I'm fascinated with how ministers think.

850
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,710
<32-5,Wilson>你不是泛泛之辈  豪斯
<32-5,Wilson>Because you're not ordinary, House

851
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,440
<32-5,Wilson>你属于边缘群体
<32-5,Wilson>You're way out there on the fringe somewhere.

<32-5,Wilson>我是你最好的朋友
<32-5,Wilson>I'm your best friend,

853
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,090
<32-5,Wilson>可有一半时间  我都无法理解你的行为
<32-5,Wilson>and half the time, I don't understand you.

854
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,010
<32-5,Wilson>你是孤独的
<32-5,Wilson>You're alone.

855
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,820
<32-5,Wilson>你会孤独终老
<32-5,Wilson>Been alone your whole life.

856
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,070
<32-6,Wilson>当你看那本书的时候
<32-6,Wilson>When you read that book,

<32-6,Wilson>there would be a way of thinking,

859
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,480
<32-6,Wilson>思维方式
<32-6,Wilson>a mind that you could recognize.

860
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,910
<32-6,Wilson>你想要的跟我们一样
<32-6,Wilson>You wanted what we all want.

<32-8,Wilson>At least tell me this-- did you find something there?
