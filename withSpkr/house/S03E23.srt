<2-1,CHASE>你的头还疼吗?
<2-1,CHASE>Your head still hurt?

19
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,710
<2-2,NICK>你傻啊?
<2-2,NICK>You a moron?

20
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,340
<2-3,ENID>Nate.
<2-3,ENID>Nate

21
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,850
<2-4,NATE>我j紧攥着脑袋 他还问我疼不疼?
<2-4,NATE>I'm clutching my head in,pain, and he asks if it hurts?

22
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,940
<2-4,NATE>你是什么 医学院的学生啊?
<2-4,NATE>What are you, some kind of med student?

23
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,140
<2-4,NATE>你看起来还是乳臭未干
<2-4,NATE>You look like you still,have theme birthday parties.

24
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,590
<2-5,ENID>对不起
<2-5,ENID>Sorry.

25
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,850
<2-6,CHASE>最近上课能集中精神吗?
<2-6,CHASE>Any problems concentrating,in school lately?

26
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,320
<2-7,NATE>除了想着舔遍法语老师的乳房
<2-7,NATE>Besides the dreams of running my tongue,along my french teacher's breasts?

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,720
<2-7,NATE>还成 精神挺集中的
<2-7,NATE>No,I'm doing quite great.

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,230
<2-8,CHASE>狂躁和疼痛可能是寄生虫引起的,他吃很多寿司吗?
<2-8,CHASE>The rage and pain could be caused by,a parasite. Does he eat a lot of sushi?

29
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,640
<2-9,ENID>不 直到几个月以前 他都只吃素食
<2-9,ENID>No. Uh,he was a vegetarian,until just a few months ago.

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,800
<2-10,CHASE>改变食谱后他的举止有变化吗?
<2-10,CHASE>Any changes in behavior,since the new diet?

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,350
<2-10,CHASE>没有
<2-10,CHASE>No.

32
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,930
<2-11,ENID>他从十几岁开始就这样了
<2-11,ENID>He's been this way since,he became a teenager.

33
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,850
<2-11,ENID>不管我怎么叫怎么罚 他还是会说...
<2-11,ENID>It doesn't matter how much I yell,or punish, he's still gonna say-

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
<2-12,NATE>是啊 为可怜的Nate他妈流流眼泪吧
<2-12,NATE>yeah,let's all shed a tear,for poor little nate's mother.

35
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,960
<2-12,NATE>还有什么蠢问题吗?
<2-12,NATE>Any more stupid questions?

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,620
<2-12,NATE>nate.
<2-12,NATE>Nate

37
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,380
<3-1,CHASE>我讨厌这小孩
<3-1,CHASE>I hate this kid.

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,830
<3-2,HOUSE>我喜欢这小孩
<3-2,HOUSE>I like this kid.

39
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,230
<3-3,CHASE>- 你还没见过他,- 知道你讨厌他就够了
<3-3,CHASE>- You haven't met him.,- I know you hate him.

40
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,170
<3-4,HOUSE>还需要了解别的什么?,这孩子与众不同啊
<3-4,HOUSE>What more do I need to,know? The kid's not a clich?

41
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,300
<3-4,HOUSE>普通人输了才会打架
<3-4,HOUSE>Anybody can get into,a fight after losing.

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,830
<3-4,HOUSE>但揍你刚刚击败的人一顿...有创意
<3-4,HOUSE>It takes real creativity to,beat up someone you just beat.

43
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,560
<3-5,CAMERON>他不光脑袋疼
<3-5,CAMERON>The pain's not limited to his head.

44
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,790
<3-6,CHASE>他这个学期打了17次架 四处伤痕累累
<3-6,CHASE>The rest is bumps and bruises accounted for,by the 17 fights he's been in this semester.

45
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,350
<3-7,CAMERON>脑震荡?
<3-7,CAMERON>Concussion?

46
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,480
<3-8,CHASE>核磁共振显示正常 没有额叶瘤
<3-8,CHASE>Mri was clean. No frontal lobe tumor.

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,780
<3-8,CHASE>毒性筛检也显示没有使用,可卡因或者安非他命的痕迹
<3-8,CHASE>And the tox screen showed no,trace of coke or amphetamines.

48
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,210
<3-9,FOREMAN>Nate打人野蛮粗暴 可能是...
<3-9,FOREMAN>Nate went medieval on,the other kid. Could be-

49
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,400
<3-10,HOUSE>等等 我情绪激动
<3-10,HOUSE>hold on. I'm having a moment.

50
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,610
<3-10,HOUSE>这...
<3-10,HOUSE>This...

51
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,540
<3-10,HOUSE>这可能是Foreman最后一次,错误地认为是肾上腺肿瘤
<3-10,HOUSE>this could be Foreman's last time,mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,750
<3-11,FOREMAN>肾上腺瘤会导致肾上腺素分泌过量,引起他的头疼和狂躁
<3-11,FOREMAN>Which could create excess adrenaline.,Causes the head pain and rage.

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,600
<3-12,HOUSE>但解释不了人格紊乱
<3-12,HOUSE>But not the personality disorder.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,010
<3-13,FOREMAN>没有什么人格紊乱
<3-13,FOREMAN>there is no personality disorder.

55
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,870
<3-13,FOREMAN>他处于青春期
<3-13,FOREMAN>He's a teenager.

56
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,970
<3-14,HOUSE>处于青春期,能解释一些古怪无礼的言论
<3-14,HOUSE>Being a teenager excuses the,odd inappropriate comment.

57
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,930
<3-14,HOUSE>可这孩子说的没一句像人话
<3-14,HOUSE>This kid say anything appropriate?

58
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,260
<3-14,HOUSE>他得了丛集性头痛,说不定已经许多年了
<3-14,HOUSE>He's having cluster headaches.,Probably been having them for years.

59
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,740
<3-14,HOUSE>问题在于 是由什么导致的?
<3-14,HOUSE>Question is, what's causing them?

60
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,390
<3-15,FOREMAN>如果只是丛集性头痛,他的眼睛四周应该肿胀才对
<3-15,FOREMAN>If it were just a cluster headache,,he'd have swelling around the eyes.

61
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,920
<3-16,HOUSE>急诊用布洛芬给他止痛,止不了这种头痛
<3-16,HOUSE>Er gave him ibuprofen for,the pain. Useless for this pain.

62
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,210
<3-16,HOUSE>但可能消除了肿胀,最可能是血管上的问题
<3-16,HOUSE>But it could have knocked down the,swelling. Best bet is a vascular problem.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,000
<3-17,CAMERON>正常治疗丛集性头痛是用类固醇,急诊也给他用了
<3-17,CAMERON>Normal treatment for cluster headaches,is steroids, which the ER also gave him.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,640
<3-17,CAMERON>他还是疼 也就说明...
<3-17,CAMERON>He's still in pain. Which means-

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,420
<3-18,HOUSE>正常治疗之所以叫做"正常",是因为 有时不得不用"特殊"治疗
<3-18,HOUSE>normal treatment is called normal treatment because,sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment.

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,570
<3-18,HOUSE>给他用抗凝血剂 做轻度经颅磁刺激
<3-18,HOUSE>Start him on blood thinners and give his,noggin transcranial magnetic stimulation.

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,190
<3-19,HOUSE>看你敢不敢 碰那个毒舌才子
<3-19,HOUSE>Don't you dare...,touch that acerbic wit.

68
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,130
<4-1,CHASE>你们谁去治这兔崽子 我就给谁50美元
<4-1,CHASE>50 bucks to whichever of you,steps up and treats this brat.

69
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,040
<4-2,CAMERON>不是这孩子的错 他病了
<4-2,CAMERON>Not the kid's fault, he's sick.

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,700
<4-3,CHASE>好吧 你来做
<4-3,CHASE>Fine. You do it.

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,660
<4-4,CAMERON>没门 这兔崽子是你的
<4-4,CAMERON>No way. He's your brat.

72
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,300
<4-5,FOREMAN>我去做 但我做完后要去工作面试
<4-5,FOREMAN>I'll do it. But I've got,a job interview after work.

73
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,550
<4-5,FOREMAN>后面出现什么情况 就由你们来处理了
<4-5,FOREMAN>Anything comes up later,,you guys handle it.

74
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,250
<4-6,CAMERON>- 要一封同事推荐信吗?,- 多谢了
<4-6,CAMERON>- Need a peer recommendation?,- Thanks.

75
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,560
<4-6,CAMERON>Cameron写就够了
<4-6,CAMERON>Cameron's should suffice.

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,770
<5-1,NATE>这东西不会让我变成,流口水 尿裤子的植物人吧?
<5-1,NATE>This isn't gonna turn me into some,like,,drooling vegetable that wets his pants,is it?

77
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,980
<5-2,FOREMAN>这很安全 电磁脉冲激活神经细胞,希望能消除头疼
<5-2,FOREMAN>It's safe. The magnetic pulses activate nerve,cells which will hopefully squelch the head pain.

78
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,140
<5-3,NATE>其他地方疼有办法吗?
<5-3,NATE>Is there anything you can,do about the other pain?

79
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,550
<5-4,FOREMAN>打架留下的?
<5-4,FOREMAN>From the fights?

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,410
<5-5,NATE>是啊 我的脸 肩膀 肚子
<5-5,NATE>Yeah,I mean,my face,,my shoulder. My stomach.

81
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,310
<5-5,NATE>还有 我几乎弯不了手指
<5-5,NATE>I mean,I can barely bend my fingers.

82
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,700
<5-6,FOREMAN>你已经服用止痛药了 我也没别的办法
<5-6,FOREMAN>You're already on pain,meds. Nothing more I can dO.

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,790
<5-7,NATE>你能帮忙 叫你的兄弟不要整我
<5-7,NATE>Sure you can,man. Tell your,homies to quit stomping on me.

84
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,710
<5-8,FOREMAN>我会放出消息说 你是个不错的家伙
<5-8,FOREMAN>I'll get the word out,that you're a great guy.

85
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,110
<5-9,NATE>别人在你面前 是不是说话小心翼翼的?
<5-9,NATE>So,do people watch what,they say around you?

86
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,180
<5-10,FOREMAN>因为我是黑人?
<5-10,FOREMAN>Because I'm black?

87
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,480
<5-11,NATE>不 因为你是基佬
<5-11,NATE>No,because you're gay.

88
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,140
<6-1,CHASE>丛集性头痛可能持续多年
<6-1,CHASE>cluster headaches can persist for years,

89
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,820
<6-1,CHASE>导致易怒甚至对他人的敌意
<6-1,CHASE>cause irritability or even,hostility towards others.

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,910
<6-2,ENID>你是说疾病影响了他的性格?
<6-2,ENID>You mean,the illness is,affecting his personality?

91
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,100
<6-3,CHASE>如果治疗见效的话 可能...
<6-3,CHASE>If these treatments work, it could-

92
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,370
<6-4,ENID>改变他?
<6-4,ENID>change him?

93
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,620
<6-5,CHASE>是的
<6-5,CHASE>Yeah.

94
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,770
<6-6,ENID>谢天谢地
<6-6,ENID>Oh,thank god.

95
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,960
<6-7,ENID>哦 你一定觉得我不是个好妈妈
<6-7,ENID>Oh. Oh,you must think I'm awful.

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,150
<6-7,ENID>我儿子还躺在病床上...
<6-7,ENID>Here my son's lying,in a hospital bed and-

97
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,160
<6-8,CHASE>- 我却...,- 我非常理解你的心情
<6-8,CHASE>I -I'm pretty sure I get it.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
<6-9,ENID>我认为我是个不合格的母亲
<6-9,ENID>I thought I was a bad mother.

99
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,560
<6-9,ENID>我憎恶我自己
<6-9,ENID>And I hated myself.

100
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,240
<6-9,ENID>因为我憎恶他
<6-9,ENID>Because I hated him.

101
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,950
<7-1,HOUSE>天气这么好 有何对我报?
<7-1,HOUSE>what have you got for,me this fine morning?

102
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,710
<8-2,CHASE>抗血凝剂和经颅磁刺激没效果,不是丛集性头痛
<8-2,CHASE>Blood thinners and tms had no,effect. It's not cluster headaches.

103
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,500
<8-3,HOUSE>你指责症状在骗人?
<8-3,HOUSE>You accusing the symptoms of lying?

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,920
<8-4,CAMERON>可能是血色病
<8-4,CAMERON>Could be hemochromatosis.

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,730
<8-5,HOUSE>解释不了人格紊乱
<8-5,HOUSE>Wouldn't account for the,personality disorder.

106
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,130
<8-6,CAMERON>那甲状腺机能减退呢?
<8-6,CAMERON>What about hypothyroidism?

107
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,930
<8-7,HOUSE>他的症状不是挑衅和嗜眠,而是越来越挑衅
<8-7,HOUSE>He's not getting aggressive and lethargic,he's,getting aggressive and aggressiver.

108
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,100
<8-8,CAMERON>会不会是皮样囊肿破裂?
<8-8,CAMERON>What about ruptured dermoid cyst?

109
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,150
<8-9,HOUSE>抱歉 刚刚头晕了 我本来想往右转
<8-9,HOUSE>Sorry. Just got dizzy there.,I was expecting to turn right.

110
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,080
<8-9,HOUSE>该轮到Foreman的见解遭否定了
<8-9,HOUSE>It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.

111
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,630
<8-10,FOREMAN>和Cameron想的一样
<8-10,FOREMAN>The thing that Cameron said.

112
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,600
<8-11,HOUSE>真是打破惯例思考问题的好方式啊
<8-11,HOUSE>Way to think outside the box.

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,300
<8-12,HOUSE>但脑室没有肿大

<8-16,CAMERON>治疗丛集性头痛的合法手段,只剩下脑部手术了
<8-16,CAMERON>the only approved treatment left for,cluster headaches is brain surgery.

119
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,040
<8-16,CAMERON>手术也不能保证成功
<8-16,CAMERON>And that's not even a guarantee.

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,690
<8-17,HOUSE>别废话 Foreman!
<8-17,HOUSE>Back off,Foreman!

<9-10,FOREMAN>It was one of the other petty,,socially repressed asses I work for.

132
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,970

<10-3,FOREMAN>Would it matter? No,but it'd,be the adult way to handle it.

135
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,590
<10-4,HOUSE>反正没有用 何必多费力?
<10-4,HOUSE>If the adult way doesn't,work,why bother with it?

477
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,830
<28-2,CAMERON>但那是部分缺乏,所以也可能不是kelley-seegmiller
<28-2,CAMERON>But it's a partial deficiency. So,it may not be kelley-seegmiller.

<30-5,CAMERON>Kelley-seegmiller不会引起惊厥
<30-5,CAMERON>Kelley-seegmiller didn't,cause this seizure.

549
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,480
<30-6,HOUSE>那么就多一种症状 少一种诊断
<30-6,HOUSE>So we've got one more,symptom, one less diagnosis.

550
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,350
<30-6,HOUSE>他们应该要求提供推荐人吧?,你留下我的名字了吗？
<30-6,HOUSE>I assume they're gonna call for,references? Did you give 'em my name?

552
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,450
<30-7,FOREMAN>淀粉样变性病能导致惊厥,而蛋白质堆积导致了器官衰竭
<30-7,FOREMAN>Amyloidosis can cause seizures, and the,protein buildup could cause organ failure.

553
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,040

<30-11,HOUSE>I hate this kid.

558
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,790
<30-12,CAMERON>也许我们面对的不是单一病症?,而是多重状况一起导致的?
<30-12,CAMERON>What if we're not dealing with one,condition? What if it's multiple conditions?

559
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,870

<30-14,CHASE>没什么可以同时解释这一大票症状
<30-14,CHASE>Nothing explains this,constellation of symptoms.

561
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,480
<30-14,CHASE>一定漏掉了什么,也许这孩子在用药方面说了谎
<30-14,CHASE>We've gotta be missing something.,Maybe the kid lied about some medication.

562
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,430
<30-14,CHASE>也许他在隐藏什么
<30-14,CHASE>Maybe he's hiding something.

563
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,260
<30-15,CAMERON>- 他有什么好隐藏的?,- 我怎么知道 也许他是个小混账?
<30-15,CAMERON>- Why would he be hiding something?,- I don't know,because he's evil?

564
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,590
<30-17,HOUSE>如果他真的是呢?
<30-17,HOUSE>What if he is?

565
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,070
<30-17,HOUSE>如果是症状在撒谎?,(人格紊乱不是症状)
<30-17,HOUSE>What if the symptoms lied?

566
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,370
<30-17,HOUSE>那么
<30-17,HOUSE>There.

567
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,390
<30-18,HOUSE>就只是简单一个病例,得了淀粉样变性的小混账
<30-18,HOUSE>Now all we're looking at is a,simple,evil jerk with amyloidosis.

568
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,950
<30-19,FOREMAN>你不客观
<30-19,FOREMAN>You're not being objective.

569
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,270
<30-20,HOUSE>是你提出淀粉样变性病的阿
<30-20,HOUSE>Amyloidosis was your idea.

570
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,840
<30-21,FOREMAN>你刚才说得对,解释不了全部症状
<30-21,FOREMAN>You were right,it,doesn't fit the symptoms.

571
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,090
<30-22,HOUSE>能解释了
<30-22,HOUSE>Yeah,it does.

572
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,580
<30-22,HOUSE>看着
<30-22,HOUSE>Look.

573
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,940
<30-23,FOREMAN>你把性格因素去掉,因为你想恨这个孩子
<30-23,FOREMAN>You crossed it off because,you wanna hate the kid.

574
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,570
<30-23,FOREMAN>如果他是病症受害者 你就没法恨他
<30-23,FOREMAN>And you can't hate him if he's a victim-

575
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,590
<30-24,HOUSE>你是希望他是受害者,因为你想相信人性本善
<30-24,HOUSE>you want him to be a victim because,you wanna believe that people are good.

576
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,950
<30-24,HOUSE>如果不好 一定是哪里得了病
<30-24,HOUSE>And if they're not, it's,gotta be a chemical problem.

577
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,700
<30-24,HOUSE>但有例外 有人不是好东西 也没病
<30-24,HOUSE>Except they're not,and it's not.

578
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,630
<30-24,HOUSE>给他灌免疫抑制剂
<30-24,HOUSE>Flush him with immunosuppressants,

579
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,750
<30-24,HOUSE>做个活检确认一下,再给他找个骨髓捐赠者
<30-24,HOUSE>get a biopsy to confirm,,and find him a marrow donor.

<31-1,ENID>他会怎么样呢?
<31-1,ENID>what will happen to him?

581
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,650
<31-2,CHASE>有种叫淀粉样蛋白的物质,在他的器官中堆积
<31-2,CHASE>substances called amyloid proteins,build up in the body's organs,

582
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,710
<31-2,CHASE>使它们停止运作
<31-2,CHASE>shutting them down.

583
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,900
<31-2,CHASE>这种疾病很少见 是致命的
<31-2,CHASE>It's a fairly rare disease.,And I'm afraid it can be fatal.

584
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,030
<31-3,ENID>那你准备怎么取它们出来?
<31-3,ENID>So do you operateor,something to take them out?

585
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,480
<31-4,CHASE>他需要骨髓移植
<31-4,CHASE>He needs a bone marrow transplant.

586
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,050
<31-4,CHASE>Cameron医生正在骨髓库里寻找配对的
<31-4,CHASE>Dr. Cameron is searching the donor bank.

<31-4,CHASE>我们也会测试一下你的是否可用
<31-4,CHASE>We should test you as well.

588

<31-5,ENID>when you first told me he was sick...

<33-1,FOREMAN>神经活检没有什么结果
<33-1,FOREMAN>Nerve biopsy was clean.

607
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,970
<33-1,FOREMAN>没证据表明是淀粉样变性病
<33-1,FOREMAN>No evidence of amyloidosis.

608
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,230
<33-2,HOUSE>是你想出来的 别这么快放弃阿
<33-2,HOUSE>It was your idea. Don't,give up on it so fast.

609
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,240
<33-3,FOREMAN>他发着烧 如果是两种症状,其中一种必然是炎症
<33-3,FOREMAN>He's running a fever. If it's two conditions,,one of them's gotta be an infection.

610
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,870
<33-3,FOREMAN>应该开始用抗生素,看看什么有反应 什么没有
<33-3,FOREMAN>We should start him on antibiotics,,see what clears up,what doesn't.

611
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,140
<33-4,HOUSE>他呼吸困难吗?
<33-4,HOUSE>Is he having trouble breathing?

612
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,180
<33-5,FOREMAN>嗯 胸腔里有炎症导致的粘液
<33-5,FOREMAN>Yeah,he has mucus in his,chest from an infection.

613
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,180
<33-6,HOUSE>也可能是淀粉状蛋白沉积
<33-6,HOUSE>Could also be an amyloid buildup.

614
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,000
<33-6,HOUSE>继续用免疫抑制剂,找其他地方做活检 窦管
<33-6,HOUSE>Keep him on immunosuppressants and,biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.

615
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,810
<33-7,HOUSE>看 现在有两个选择
<33-7,HOUSE>Look,you got two choices.

616
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:19,220
<33-7,HOUSE>徒劳地争辩一番 按我说的做,或直接按我说的做
<33-7,HOUSE>Engage me in a futile argument then do,what I asked, or just do what I asked.

617
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,810
<33-8,HOUSE>你还没准备好
<33-8,HOUSE>You're not ready.

618
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,840
<33-9,HOUSE>还有第三个选择,不按我说的做
<33-9,HOUSE>There was a third choice.,Don't do what I asked.

619
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,840
<33-9,HOUSE>你本可以违抗我,继续给那孩子用抗生素的 可你没有
<33-9,HOUSE>You could have defied me,stuck the,kid on antibiotics. But you didn'T.

620
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,260
<33-9,HOUSE>因为你仍然信任我的判断,比自己的还要信任
<33-9,HOUSE>Because you still trust my,judgment more than your own.

621
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,780
<34-1,CHASE>是你破坏Foreman的面试的 对不对?
<34-1,CHASE>You sabotaged Foreman's,job interview, didn't you?

622
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,650
<34-2,HOUSE>Foreman来闹过一次了,不是我
<34-2,HOUSE>Foreman's already been,over this. It wasn't me.

623
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,280
<34-3,CHASE>每个人都在疑神疑鬼
<34-3,CHASE>Everybody's chasing ghosts over this.

624
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,870
<34-3,CHASE>说明要么没有人在搞鬼,要么有人希望所有人都疑神疑鬼
<34-3,CHASE>Which means either nobody did it, or,somebody wants everybody chasing ghosts.

625
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,930
<34-3,CHASE>这听起来像谁?
<34-3,CHASE>Now,who does that sound like?

626
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,250
<34-4,HOUSE>为什么我要这么做?
<34-4,HOUSE>And why would I do that?

627
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,380
<34-5,CHASE>因为只要Foreman认定是你做的
<34-5,CHASE>Because as long as,Foreman thought you were guilty,

628
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,260
<34-5,CHASE>他在这里就基本是废物了
<34-5,CHASE>he was gonna be useless around here.

629
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,650
<34-6,HOUSE>这提醒我为什么要雇你了
<34-6,HOUSE>You know,sometimes I,forget why I hired you.

630
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,000
<34-7,CHASE>你破坏了他一个大好机会,自己什么也没得到
<34-7,CHASE>You cost him a good,opportunity and gained nothing.

631
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,910
<34-8,HOUSE>我破坏了他一个垃圾机会
<34-8,HOUSE>I cost him a crappy opportunity.

632
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,680
<34-8,HOUSE>在纽约Mercy医院只能治疖子和脓疱,养养老
<34-8,HOUSE>New york mercy's where you go to,treat boils and cysts and build a 401k.

633
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,070
<34-9,CHASE>如果你想让他留下 告诉他
<34-9,CHASE>If you want him to stay,tell him.

634
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,950
<34-10,HOUSE>我不要 这样做没有意义
<34-10,HOUSE>I don't.And there'd be no point.

635
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,690
<34-10,HOUSE>你必须
<34-10,HOUSE>You do.

636
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,430
<34-11,CHASE>意义在于让他觉得自己是被需要的
<34-11,CHASE>And the point would be to make,him feel like he's wanted.

637
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,920
<34-12,HOUSE>他不需要这个
<34-12,HOUSE>He doesn't need that.

638
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,570
<34-13,CHASE>那么让他觉得你没那么邪恶
<34-13,CHASE>All right,then. It'd make him,feel like maybe you weren't evil.

639
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,140
<34-14,CHASE>他需要这个
<34-14,CHASE>He needs that.

640
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,280
<34-15,CHASE>跟Foreman谈谈
<34-15,CHASE>Talk to Foreman.

641
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,100
<34-16,HOUSE>我们去掉了一个症状
<34-16,HOUSE>We dumped one symptom.

642
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,660
<34-16,HOUSE>但忘记了加上一个
<34-16,HOUSE>But forgot to add one.
