<8-3,Foreman>自从我们接吻以后 你一直在逃避我
<8-3,Foreman>Ever since we kissed,you'veabcbeen avoiding me.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
<8-4,Thirteen>我没有 只是很忙
<8-4,Thirteen>No, I haven't. Just been busy.

119

<8-4,Thirteen>如果吸入过多金属抛光剂会使神经受损
<8-4,Thirteen>Metal polish could cause nerveabcdamage if he inhaled enough of it.

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,850
<8-4,Thirteen>从车的光泽来看 他肯定用得不少
<8-4,Thirteen>Judging by the shine on thatabccar, he used a fair amount.

121
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,380
<8-5,Foreman>从他有家汽车美容店和这个来看abc他懂怎么保护自己
<8-5,Foreman>Judging by the fact that he owns a body shopabcand one of these, I'd say he knew not to inhale.

122

<8-5,Foreman>今晚有空吗? 我们一起吃晚饭吧

<8-7,Foreman>So making out, okay.abcMeals, too intimate?

125
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,720
<8-8,Thirteen>我也不想再跟你接吻了
<8-8,Thirteen>I don't want to kiss you again either.

126
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,750
<8-9,Foreman>为什么? 因为我们是同事?
<8-9,Foreman>Why? Because we work together?

127
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,360
<8-10,Thirteen>不 因为我喜欢你
<8-10,Thirteen>No. Because I like you.

128
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,900
<8-11,Foreman>这解释得通啊
<8-11,Foreman>That makes a lot of sense.

129
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,940
<8-12,Thirteen>我跟任何人在一起都解释不通
<8-12,Thirteen>What doesn't make sense is meabcgetting involved with anyone.

130
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,810
<8-13,Foreman>我以为你早想通了呢
<8-13,Foreman>I thought you'd gotten past th.

131
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,620
<8-13,Foreman>所以才同意接受药物试验
<8-13,Foreman>That's why you agreed to the drug trial.

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,870
<8-13,Foreman>- 你不能放弃生活就因为--abc- 我没有放弃生活
<8-13,Foreman>- You can't give upon lifeabcbecause-- - I'm not giving upon life.

133
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,420
<8-14,Thirteen>我只是放弃了你
<8-14,Thirteen>I'm just giving upon you.

134
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,890
<8-14,Thirteen>我终于觉得自己能把握住 我能接受了
<8-14,Thirteen>I finally feel like I have aabcgrip on things. I can handle this.

<8-14,Thirteen>不能接受的是把别人也拖下水
<8-14,Thirteen>What I can't handle isabcdragging anyone else down with me.

136

<8-14,Thirteen>这像鹌鹑吗?
<8-14,Thirteen>Does this look like quail to you?

<9-1,Taub>你认为他过去三年每天都吃有毒的食物?
<9-1,Taub>you think he's had food poisoningabcevery day for the last three years?

138
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,800
<9-2,Thirteen>野生鹌鹑可能有毒性 引起横纹肌溶解abc解释了疼痛
<9-2,Thirteen>wild quail can be toxic, causeabcrhabdomyolysis, which would explain his pain,

139
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,310
<9-2,Thirteen>也解释了肌酸激酶水平过高
<9-2,Thirteen>as well as the elevated C.K.Levels.

140
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,720
<9-3,Taub>他在车上吸的一氧化碳也一样
<9-3,Taub>So would the carbon monoxide heabcsucked out of his car.

141
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,230
<9-3,Taub>不是中毒反应 是身心反映
<9-3,Taub>It's not a toxic reaction.abcIt's a psychosomatic reaction.

142
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
<9-3,Taub>疼痛评估显示他太过担忧他的健康
<9-3,Taub>The pain profile showed an excessiveabcconcern about his physical health,

00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,390
<9-3,Taub>难以入睡 不愿起床
<9-3,Taub>difficulty sleeping,getting out of bed.

144
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,350
<9-4,House>他不是因为沮丧才疼
<9-4,House>He's not in pain because he's depressed.

145
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,070
<9-4,House>是因为疼而沮丧
<9-4,House>He's depressed because he's in pain.

146
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,200
<9-5,Taub>就你吩咐我做的评估不是这么说的
<9-5,Taub>Not according to theabcpain profile you ordered.

147
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,390
<9-5,Taub>不是食物的问题
<9-5,Taub>It's not a diet issue.

148
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,540
<9-5,Taub>为了他和他家人abc我们应该给他抗抑郁剂
<9-5,Taub>We should start him on antidepressantsabcfor his sake, as well as his family's.

149
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,160
<9-6,House>我们又不是给他家人诊断
<9-6,House>We're not diagnosing his family.

150
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,250
<9-7,Taub>我们也不是在给你诊断
<9-7,Taub>We're not diagnosing you either.

151
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,980
<9-8,House>是横纹肌溶解症
<9-8,House>It's rhabdo.

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,580
<9-8,House>静脉注射 尿检 肌肉组织活检
<9-8,House>Push I.V.Fluids, check hisabcurine, do a muscle biopsy.

153
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,180
<9-9,Taub>什么肌肉? 他说全身都痛
<9-9,Taub>What muscle? He says it hurts all over.

154
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,330
<9-10,House>那就全身都活检
<9-10,House>Then she'll biopsy all over.

155
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,330
<9-11,Foreman>你去哪?
<9-11,Foreman>Where are you going?

<9-12,House>我不在时有事 找Cameron去干
<9-12,House>If you need anything while I'mabcgone, just ask cameron to do it.

158
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,560
<10-1,Zach>他不吃鹌鹑 就不会痛了?
<10-1,Zach>So if he just stops eatingabcquail, the painwill go away?

159
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,070
<10-2,Thirteen>要是诊断没错的话 是可治愈的
<10-2,Thirteen>If we're right,it'sabcdefinitely treatable.

160
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,240
<10-3,Jeff>我的手臂! 开始--

<10-5,Kutner>血压下降 得头低足高放置
<10-5,Kutner>B.P.Is down. We need to getabchim in trendelenburg position.

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,740
<10-6,Thirteen>Jeff 能听见吗?
<10-6,Thirteen>Jeff, can you hear me?

164
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
<10-7,Kutner>他心跳要停止了
<10-7,Kutner>He's arresting.

<11-2,Thirteen>肺通气灌注扫描显示有肺栓塞
<11-2,Thirteen>V.Q.Scan showed a pulmonary embolism.

168
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,560
<11-3,Taub>意味着他的疼痛不是心理上的
<11-3,Taub>Means the pain's not psychosomatic.

169
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,610
<11-4,Thirteen>也意味着不是横纹肌溶解症
<11-4,Thirteen>it also means it's not rhabdomyolysis.

175
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,450
<11-9,House>肯定是心脏问题
<11-9,House>It's got to be a heart problem.

176
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,660
<11-9,House>但是心脏问题跟横纹肌溶解症一致
<11-9,House>But heart only would beabcconsistent with rhabdo,

177
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,350
<11-9,House>这样13和Foreman就要乐得开花了

<11-11,House>你认为血块是由于血凝产生的 真有帮助
<11-11,House>So you think the blood clot was causedabcby a clotting problem. That's helpful.

181
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,970
<11-12,Kutner>会是癌症综合症吗abc像Trousseau综合征?
<11-12,Kutner>What if it's a cancerabcsyndrome,like trousseau's?

<12-6,Kutner>不是 但是强烈反对某样东西abc意味着有历史--

<14-13,Kutner>血液就进不到肠部
<14-13,Kutner>it could be choking off bloodabcflow to his intestine.

242

<19-17,Jeff>Couldn't.

329
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,230
<19-18,Taub>乳酸水平正常 不是糖原
<19-18,Taub>and lactate level is steady.abcIt's not any kind of glycogen.

330
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,680
<19-19,Jeff>噢 天哪! 腿开始疼了!
<19-19,Jeff>Oh, god! Pain jumped to my leg!

<19-21,Jeff>No! My leg!

334
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,320
<19-21,Jeff>感觉好像被锯断了一样
<19-21,Jeff>It feels like it's being sawed off.

<20-5,Thirteen>你就这么追我么?
<20-5,Thirteen>Is that your way ofabcgetting into my pants?

339
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,100
<20-6,Foreman>时间不是我定的 就算是abc我也不会用做社交润滑剂
<20-6,Foreman>I don't make the schedule, and if I did,abcI wouldn't use itas a social lubricant.

340
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,680
<20-6,Foreman>而且 这是我头一回听说Janice好转了
<20-6,Foreman>And this is the first I'veabcheard of janice improving at all.

<20-6,Foreman>疼痛是从腹部开始的
<20-6,Foreman>Pain started in his abdomen.

343
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,080
<21-1,Taub>从左手转移到左腿 跳过了整个躯干
<21-1,Taub>Now it's hopped from his left thumb toabchis left leg, skipping the trunk entirely.

<21-3,Kutner>- We're getting sued?abc- Probably. That's cuddy's problem.

346
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,000
<21-5,Taub>游走的疼痛 说明是大脑而不是身体
<21-5,Taub>hopping pain, means it's somethingabcin his brain,not his body.

347
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,080
<21-6,House>大脑的两个区域分别控制两个疼痛点
<21-6,House>Except the pain's in two places thatabcconnect to two separate regions of the brain,

348
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,570
<21-6,House>说明你说话没经过大脑
<21-6,House>which means you're not using yours.

<21-8,House>我不是需要律师
<21-8,House>Didn't say I needed a lawyer.

<21-9,Taub>Pain hopped to anotherabclimb on the same side.

356

<21-10,Kutner>- 肯定是中央...abc- 排除不了边缘神经系统
<21-10,Kutner>- It's got to be central--abc- could still be peripheral.

357
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,050
<21-10,Kutner>如果椎间盘疾病的多个区域...
<21-10,Kutner>If multiple areasabcof disc disease--

<21-11,House>were consistent with aabccompletely spotless mri.

<21-11,House>Who represented the hospitalabcwhen you set that patient on fire?

<21-12,Kutner>Chris Carrick
<21-12,Kutner>Chris carrick.

361
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,910
<21-13,House>Chris? 听着就不像个好律师
<21-13,House>Chris? That doesn'tabcsound like a very good lawyer.

362
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,150
<21-14,Taub>要是我们定不下来是大脑还是身体abc永远也确诊不了
<21-14,Taub>If we can't even resolve body versusabcbrain, we're never gonna diagnose the guy.

363
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,620
<21-15,House>律所的名字叫什么?
<21-15,House>What was the name of the firm?

364
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,210
<21-16,Kutner>Caddell和Carrickabc我们又不能砍下他头 看还疼不疼了
<21-16,Kutner>Caddell and carrick. It's not like we canabcchop off his head to see if the pain goes away.

365
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,260
<21-16,Kutner>为什么不?
<21-16,Kutner>Why not?

366
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,100
<22-1,House>要砍下人头
<22-1,House>Need to cut off a guy's head.

<22-2,Cuddy>我电话里跟你说"不行"还不够?
<22-2,Cuddy>And hearing me say "no" overtheabcphone wasn't good enough?

370

<22-3,House>你不给我好过 我就不给你好过
<22-3,House>I'm inconveniencing you becauseabcyou inconvenienced me.

<22-5,House>要不是那样 也不用费老劲了
<22-5,House>If they weren't,there'dabcbe no inconvenience.

373
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,370
<22-6,Cuddy>不要逼我在孩子和...
<22-6,Cuddy>Do not try and force me toabcchoose between my child--

<22-10,Cuddy>or he leaks cns fluidabclike a fire hydrant,

381
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,050
<22-10,Cuddy>让他生不如死
<22-10,Cuddy>which would make him wish he were dead?

382
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,230
<22-11,House>擦去5号可能吧 他已经那样了
<22-11,House>You need to scratch optionabcfive. He's already there.

<22-12,Cuddy>你整天把客观挂在嘴边abc但是一碰到疼痛病人
<22-12,Cuddy>You preach objectivity, but asabcsoon as a patient comes in in pain,

<22-12,Cuddy>你只想探个究竟
<22-12,Cuddy>all you want to do isabclook under the hood.

385
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,420
<22-12,Cuddy>你不管是否有三分之一可能会杀死他
<22-12,Cuddy>You don't care if there's aabcone-in-three chance you'll kill him.

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,400
<24-5,Jeff>我还以为还有好日子可过
<24-5,Jeff>I still thought I had good days left.

<24-7,Jeff>你没有亲人 对吧?
<24-7,Jeff>You don't have a family, do you?

<24-8,House>You're alone.

403

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,430
<26-3,Jeff>四成疼 也许五成
<26-3,Jeff>Four out of ten, maybe five.

426
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,470
<26-3,Jeff>不可能
<26-3,Jeff>Can't be.

427
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,950
<26-4,House>如果是大脑造成疼痛abc那并没有消除
<26-4,House>If whatever is causing the pain isabcin your brain, it's still a ten.

428
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,350
<26-4,House>但末梢疼痛应该为零
<26-4,House>Periphery is zero.

429

<26-5,Jeff>确实 有些痛消失了 有些还在
<26-5,Jeff>It is. Some of the painabcis gone, but not all of it.

430
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,040
<26-5,Jeff>这说明什么?
<26-5,Jeff>What does this mean?

431
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,930
<27-1,Thirteen>也许Taub是对的
<27-1,Thirteen>maybe taub was right.

432
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,430
<27-1,Thirteen>是心理因素造成了身体症状
<27-1,Thirteen>It's psychosomatic after all.
