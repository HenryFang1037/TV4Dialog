146
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,310

<10-5,Cuddy>Sex with me would explain that.

157
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,090
<10-5,Cuddy>但解释不了为什么我没蜷成一团abc躲在角落里抹眼泪
<10-5,Cuddy>But it doesn't explain why I'm notabccurled up in a ball weeping in shame.

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,820
<10-5,Cuddy>我没有和House上床
<10-5,Cuddy>I did not have sex with house.

159
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,330
<10-6,Wilson>如果你们两个没有事情瞒着我abc就意味着他有事瞒着我们两个
<10-6,Wilson>If you two aren't keeping something from me,abcthat means he's keeping something from both of us.

160
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,990
<10-7,Cuddy>- 这不是什么好事abc- 也许他只是心情好 天又不会塌下来
<10-7,Cuddy>- That can't be good.abc- Or he's just in a good mood. This is not a crisis.

163
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,050
<11-1,Melanie>就是说 如果Jackson有SLE或者别的病
<11-1,Melanie>Does that mean if jackson has sleabcor whatever that other thing was,

164
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,950
<11-1,Melanie>他必须停止注射激素?
<11-1,Melanie>that he'd had to go off the hormones?

165
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,320
<11-2,Thirteen>很有可能
<11-2,Thirteen>Probably.

166
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,300
<11-3,Melanie>那Jackson会停止发育
<11-3,Melanie>Then jackson'll stop developing.

169
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,600
<11-4,Joseph>也许不是睾丸激素引起的
<11-4,Joseph>Maybe the testosterone didn't cause it.

170
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,410
<11-5,Melanie>但如果是的话 他不能变成男人了
<11-5,Melanie>Yeah, but if it is,thenabche'll never be a man.

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,590

<11-6,Joseph>你不能告诉他这是睾丸激素抑制剂abc得说是别的药
<11-6,Joseph>You'll need to tell him the testosteroneabcblocker is something else.

173
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,970
<11-7,Thirteen>也许这是告诉他真相的好机会
<11-7,Thirteen>Or maybe this is a goodabcopportunity to tell him the truth.

<22-5,Foreman>- You figured it out?abc- Yes, I'm a little slow.

335
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,710
<22-6,Kutner>有人应该提早知会我abc啥时候会被人嘲弄
<22-6,Kutner>Maybe someone should let meabcknow when I should be insulted.

336
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,440
<22-7,Foreman>那么House不知道咯
<22-7,Foreman>Then house doesn't know.

337
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,270
<22-8,Kutner>可能在上次鉴别诊断abc你们冲突时就知道了吧
<22-8,Kutner>Probably does now that you felt herabcup during that last differential.

338
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,090
<22-9,Foreman>你留意到了 可House忽略了?
<22-9,Foreman>You noticed this but house didn't?

339
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,380
<22-10,Kutner>我想是吧 他一般都会比我高明
<22-10,Kutner>Yes, I get it. He'sabcgenerally smarter than me.

340
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,850
<22-11,Foreman>- 我们可以走了吧?abc- 他总是比你高明 而不是大多数时候
<22-11,Foreman>- Can we please move on?abc- He's not generally smarter than you. He's always smarter than you.

341
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,710
<22-11,Foreman>除非...
<22-11,Foreman>Unless...

342
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,590
<24-1,Foreman>- 你好abc- House 服了海洛因
<24-1,Foreman>- Hello.abc- House is on heroin.

343
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,590
<24-2,Wilson>哦 那真...是个有趣的提醒
<24-2,Wilson>Well, that's certainly an...abcinteresting notion.

344
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,350
<24-3,Foreman>这就是为啥他窒息 同意做MRIabc还忽略 ...
<24-3,Foreman>It's why his lungs stopped. It's whyabche okay'd the mri. It's why he missed...

345
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
<24-3,Foreman>本不会忽略的事
<24-3,Foreman>things he wouldn't ordinarily miss.

346
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,700
<24-4,Wilson>我们做些检查后再告知您
<24-4,Wilson>Um, we'll run some testsabcand I'll let you know.

347
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,850
<24-5,Foreman>他和你一起 是吗?
<24-5,Foreman>he's there, isn't he?

348
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,390
<24-6,Wilson>对啊 所以回应有点文不对题
<24-6,Wilson>Well, that would certainly explainabcthe inappropriate responses.

349
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,500
<24-6,Wilson>我要挂了 好的
<24-6,Wilson>I--I gottaabcgo. Okay.

350
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,320
<24-6,Wilson>不好意思 会诊
<24-6,Wilson>Sorry. A consult.

351
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,630
<24-7,House>你啥时候点了这些?
<24-7,House>When did you order these?

352
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,090
<24-8,Wilson>你去洗手间的时候abc我觉得按理应该庆祝一下
<24-8,Wilson>When you were in the bathroom. Iabcthought a celebration was in order.

353
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,340
<24-8,Wilson>庆祝你大难不死
<24-8,Wilson>To cheating death.

354
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,390
<24-9,Wilson>你不喝威士忌? 可以点些别的啊
<24-9,Wilson>You off bourbon? We canabcget you something else.

355
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
<24-10,House>我是来吃三明治的
<24-10,House>I came here expecting a burger.

356
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,780
<24-10,House>还以为我又要听你说教了
<24-10,House>Figured I'd have to endure aabclittle lecture on moderation.

357
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,160
<24-11,Wilson>你从来都当耳边风 为啥--
<24-11,Wilson>You neverabclisten,so why--

358
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,410
<24-12,House>相反 让我喝一杯
<24-12,House>instead, I get a drink.

359
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,010
<24-12,House>今天我差点窒息了abc还给我上些呼吸抑制剂
<24-12,House>Nice little serving of respiratory depressantabcon the day that my lungs stopped working.

360
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,470
<24-13,Wilson>你挺好的啊
<24-13,Wilson>You seem fine now.

361
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,430
<24-14,House>你都不信我是吃维柯丁过量
<24-14,House>You don't believe that I od'd on vicodin.

362
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,040
<24-14,House>你觉得我吃了更强效的药
<24-14,House>You figure I'm on something stronger.

363
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,220
<24-14,House>你联想到的全是最糟糕的局面
<24-14,House>And because you can never,ever assumeabcanything but the most screwed-up scenarios,

364
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,840
<24-15,Wilson>- 到目前为止--abc- 可我总是猜对了
<24-15,Wilson>- as far as I'm concerned--abc- funny how I'm usually right.

365
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,380
<24-15,Wilson>你认为我服用了海洛因
<24-15,Wilson>You think that I'm on heroin.

366
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,170
<24-16,House>这就是你检测的办法
<24-16,House>This is your version of a tox screen.

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,570
<24-16,House>若服用了海洛因 我就不能喝酒abc因为酒会导致我再次呼吸骤停
<24-16,House>Because if I am on heroin, I can't drinkabcthat without risking another boutof not breathing.

368
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,590
<24-17,Wilson>然后?
<24-17,Wilson>Well?

369
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,800
<24-17,Wilson>晚安
<24-17,Wilson>Good night.

370
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,590
<25-1,Jackson>还要打针?
<25-1,Jackson>another shot?

371
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
<25-2,Thirteen>是的
<25-2,Thirteen>I'm afraid so.

372
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,990
<25-3,Jackson>这看起来像我爸妈给我打的维他命针abc同样的红色盖子
<25-3,Jackson>That looks like the vitamins myabcparents give me. Same red top.

373
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,390
<25-4,Thirteen>这不是维他命针
<25-4,Thirteen>These aren't vitamins.

374
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,930
<25-5,Jackson>是什么?
<25-5,Jackson>What is it?

375
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,920
<25-6,Thirteen>我不能说 你该问你爸妈
<25-6,Thirteen>I can't tell you that. Youabcshould ask your parents.

376
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,710
<26-1,Wilson>你这笨蛋!
<26-1,Wilson>you idiot!

377
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,180
<26-2,House>好啦 我承认我有暴食症
<26-2,House>Okay, I admit it. I have bulimia.

378
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,830
<26-2,House>- 我看起来还挺好的 不是吗?abc- 海洛因
<26-2,House>- I look good though,don't I?abc- Heroin.

379
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,780
<26-3,Wilson>海洛因! House 你这笨蛋--
<26-3,Wilson>Heroin!House, ofabcall the stupid--

380
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,470
<26-4,House>我没有服用海洛因
<26-4,House>I'm not on heroin.

381
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,000
<26-5,Wilson>我亲眼看见你扣喉
<26-5,Wilson>I just caught you with yourabcfingers down your throat.

382
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,550
<26-6,House>我用的是美沙酮.
<26-6,House>I'm on methadone.

383
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,440
<26-6,House>破玩意 像海洛因 却无法让人飘飘欲仙
<26-6,House>Stupid product. Heroin without the high.

384
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,090
<26-7,Wilson>没错 它的致死率是海洛因的双倍
<26-7,Wilson>Yeah, and twice the risk of death.

385
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,730
<26-8,House>可不会被抓啊
<26-8,House>But no risk of arrest.

386
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,980
<26-9,Wilson>你差点死掉
<26-9,Wilson>You nearly died.

387
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,740
<26-10,House>今天是意外 我疏忽了
<26-10,House>Today was a fluke. I nodded off.

388
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,130
<26-11,Wilson>没错 一旦睡着你就会有危险
<26-11,Wilson>Right. You're safe asabclongas you never sleep again.

389
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,220
<26-11,Wilson>服药过量了 你就会死
<26-11,Wilson>Mistime your dose, you die.

390
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,490
<26-11,Wilson>多喝几杯 你也会死
<26-11,Wilson>Couple of drinks,you die.

391
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,330
<26-11,Wilson>和禁忌药物合用 你也会死
<26-11,Wilson>Mix it with the wrong drugs, you die.

392
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,080
<26-11,Wilson>你想借此戒掉维柯丁?
<26-11,Wilson>You want to detox from vicodin?

393
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,190
<26-11,Wilson>那也选些不会伤害自己的啊
<26-11,Wilson>Pick something that won't kill you.

394
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,870
<26-12,House>我没想过戒
<26-12,House>I'm not detoxing.

395
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,080
<26-13,Wilson>如果你想找些药镇痛--
<26-13,Wilson>If you're looking for somethingabcto help with your pain--

396
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,570
<26-14,House>不是镇痛 而且消除了的疼痛
<26-14,House>doesn't help my pain.It eliminates it.

397
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,160
<26-14,House>我的腿不疼了
<26-14,House>My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

<27-2,Thirteen>他一直问 我不想撒谎了
<27-2,Thirteen>He asked a question.abcI was tired of lying.

<27-2,Thirteen>对于他基因嵌合的事 我啥也没说
<27-2,Thirteen>I didn't tell him anything aboutabchis genetic condition.

401
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,240
<27-3,Melanie>我不要她继续参与我儿子的治疗
<27-3,Melanie>I want her removed from our son's case.

402
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,530
<27-4,Cuddy>很抱歉Hadley医生害你面对这个处境abc但我爱莫能助
<27-4,Cuddy>I'm sorry for the position dr. Hadleyabcput you in, but I can't do that.

403
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,390
<27-4,Cuddy>她是House医生诊断小组的重要成员
<27-4,Cuddy>She's a valuable part ofabcdr. House's diagnostic team.

404
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,630
<27-4,Cuddy>只要他接手这个病例 她就也要在
<27-4,Cuddy>If he stays on the case,so does she.

405
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,890
<27-5,Joseph>我们得跟Jackson谈谈了
<27-5,Joseph>we have to deal with jackson.

406
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,680
<27-5,Joseph>不然他会一直怀疑
<27-5,Joseph>These questions aren't gonna go away.

407
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,560
<27-6,Melanie>他还太小
<27-6,Melanie>He's not ready for this.

408
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,780
<27-7,Joseph>只能但愿你错了
<27-7,Joseph>Let's hope you're wrong.

<27-8,Thirteen>对不起 以后我会远离他们的儿子
<27-8,Thirteen>I'm sorry. I'll stay away from their son.

<27-9,Cuddy>不 你不能
<27-9,Cuddy>No, you won't.

411

<27-9,Cuddy>大概15分钟后abc你就是这孩子唯一能信任的人了
<27-9,Cuddy>In about 15 minutes, you're theabconly person that kid's gonna trust.

412
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,380
<27-9,Cuddy>如果他需要有人紧握他的手abc你要在他左右
<27-9,Cuddy>If he needs a hand to hold,abcmake sure yours is available.

413
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,410
<28-1,Jackson>什么意思? 我到底是男是女?
<28-1,Jackson>So what? Am I a boy or a girl?

414
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,480
<28-2,Joseph>你一部分细胞是男性...
<28-2,Joseph>Some of your cells are male...

415
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,130
<28-2,Joseph>另一部分是女性
<28-2,Joseph>and some are female.

416
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,840
<28-3,Jackson>这么说 基本上我是个怪胎
<28-3,Jackson>So basically I'm a freak.

<28-6,Joseph>我们不想让你不知所措
<28-6,Joseph>We didn't want you to be confused.

<30-2,Jackson>Maybe I'm supposed to.

449
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,610

<31-6,Thirteen>外科说出血时因为胃瘘abc由坏死性胰腺炎引起
<31-6,Thirteen>Surgeon reports the bleeding was caused by aabcgastric fistula caused by necrotizing pancreatitis.

<31-7,Kutner>她一定跟你说了什么
<31-7,Kutner>She must've told you something.

471

519
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,650

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,640
<33-14,Cuddy>我不是为了你
<33-14,Cuddy>I didn't do it for you.

523
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,790
<34-1,Wilson>我们错了
<34-1,Wilson>We made a mistake.

524

<34-9,Wilson>好吧 也许是...但他是我们的朋友
<34-9,Wilson>Okay, maybe... but he's our friend.

<35-1,Foreman>高跟鞋 很好
<35-1,Foreman>the heels. Very nice.

533
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,540
<35-2,Thirteen>House又不在 没理由不穿
<35-2,Thirteen>No reason not to wear themabcnow that house is gone.

<35-4,Thirteen>- 你还好?abc- 恩 有点累而已
<35-4,Thirteen>- You okay?abc- Yeah. Just tired.

535
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,790
<35-5,Foreman>有个好消息
<35-5,Foreman>Got some good news.

536
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,760
<35-5,Foreman>消炎药多少控制了病人的硬皮病
<35-5,Foreman>Patient's scleroderma is respondingabcto the anti-inflammatory meds.

537
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,260
<35-5,Foreman>他的转氨酶水平下降了些
<35-5,Foreman>His ast level's dropped a bit.

538
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,190
<35-6,Thirteen>他死得没我们想象那么快abc真是好消息
<35-6,Thirteen>So he's dying slightlyless quicklyabcthan we thought. That's great news.

539
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,820
<35-6,Thirteen>我不好
<35-6,Thirteen>I'm not okay.

540
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,540
<35-7,Foreman>下一次只管承认就好
<35-7,Foreman>Next time just say that.

541
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,170
<35-8,Thirteen>他转氨酶水平是多少?
<35-8,Thirteen>What's his ast?

542
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,960
<35-9,Foreman>185 我记得
<35-9,Foreman>185, I think.

543
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
<35-10,Thirteen>这下降得也太快了abc确定是消炎药的功效?
<35-10,Thirteen>That's a pretty fast drop. Are weabcsure it's from the anti-inflammatories?

544
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,640
<35-11,Foreman>还能是什么?abc他停用抗生素有一阵子了
<35-11,Foreman>What else could it be from? He'sabcbeen off the antibiotics for a while.

545
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,830
<35-12,Thirteen>- 质子泵抑制剂--abc- 他又开始用睾酮了
<35-12,Thirteen>- Proton pump inhibitor's--abc- he's back on testosterone.

546
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,590
<35-13,Foreman>睾酮不可能治疗他的肝功能
<35-13,Foreman>Testosterone wouldn'tabchelp his liver function.

547
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,460
<35-14,Thirteen>但可能治疗他的肾功能abc这也会使转氨酶水平下降
<35-14,Thirteen>But it could improve his kidneyabcfunction which would also lower his ast.

548
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,390
<35-15,Foreman>但对被硬皮病损坏的肾脏不可能有效
<35-15,Foreman>But not in kidneysabcdamaged by scleroderma.

549
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,160
<35-16,Thirteen>所以不是硬皮病

<37-26,House>Why wouldn't we be?

592
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,450
<37-26,House>高跟鞋不错
<37-26,House>Nice heels.

593
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,020
<38-1,House>这一切都是你们做父母的错
<38-1,House>This is all your parents' fault.

594
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,050
<38-2,Melanie>什么?
<38-2,Melanie>Excuse me?

595

<38-3,House>在练习中和前后都喝下了许多功能饮料?
<38-3,House>Chug a lot of energy drinksabcbefore, during,and after practice?

596
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,220
<38-4,House>你的儿子进来时只是简单的脱水
<38-4,House>Your son came in here withabcsimple dehydration.

597
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,320
<38-4,House>这是他在比赛中虚脱的原因
<38-4,House>That's why he collapsed during the game.

598
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,130
<38-5,Melanie>急诊室也是那样治疗他的abc可这并没有减轻疼痛
<38-5,Melanie>The er treated him for that.abcIt didn't help the pain.

599
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,300
<38-6,House>这就是功能饮料造成的
<38-6,House>That's where the energy drinks came in.

600
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,630
<38-6,House>肾脏的负担加重 使得孩子需要abc更多的时间从最初的脱水中恢复过来
<38-6,House>They put a strainon his kidneys so he neededabcmore time to rebound from the initial dehydration.

601
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,750
<38-7,Joseph>那为什么没有好转呢?
<38-7,Joseph>Then why isn't he better?

602
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,550
<38-6,House>是你们愚蠢的行为造成的
<38-6,House>That's where your idiocy came in.

603
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,030
<38-8,House>我们本可以给他补充水分abc你们两个却坚持要我安排核磁共振
<38-8,House>Before we could give him another glassabcof water, you two insisted I do an mri.

604
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,480
<38-8,House>于是我进入了一条死胡同abc只为了寻找不存在的子宫
<38-8,House>So I go down a blind alleyabclooking for a blind uterus.

605
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,700
<38-8,House>我的手下也向他注射了造影剂
<38-8,House>And my team injectsabchim with contrast material.

606
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,540
<38-8,House>如果他的肾脏是健康的abc能在几小时里把造影剂过滤出去
<38-8,House>If his kidneys had been healthy, they would'veabcfiltered out the contrast in a couple hours.

607
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,000
<38-8,House>但肾脏功能不良 于是造影剂到处循环
<38-8,House>Since they weren't,theyabcwent around and around.

608
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,800
<38-8,House>最后被他的心脏 肝脏 胰腺所吸收
<38-8,House>Eventually getting absorbed by hisabcheart, his liver,d his pancreas,

609
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,490
<38-8,House>所到之处都造成了损伤
<38-8,House>getting in trouble everywhere it went.

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,040
<38-8,House>你儿子进来时好好的
<38-8,House>Your son was fine when he got here.

611
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,480
<38-8,House>你们慌张的过度保护差点要了他的命
<38-8,House>It was your freaked-out over protectivenessabcthat nearly killed him.

612
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,440
<38-9,Melanie>差点?
<38-9,Melanie>Nearly?

613
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:27,560
<38-10,House>他很年轻 做几个星期透析就会康复
<38-10,House>He's young. A few weeks ofabcdialysis, he should be fine.

614
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,430
<38-11,House>你生下一个反常体质的孩子
<38-11,House>You gave birthto a freak of nature.

615
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,060
<38-11,House>并不意味着要将他当作怪胎对待
<38-11,House>Doesn't mean it's a goodabcidea to treat him like one.

616
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,560
<39-1,Thirteen>感觉怎么样?

<39-7,Thirteen>没理由你不能同时做好两件事
<39-7,Thirteen>There's no reason you can't do both.

<40-3,Cuddy>孩子的父母要求做核磁共振
<40-3,Cuddy>The kids' parents wanted that mri.
