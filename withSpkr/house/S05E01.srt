<17-8,House>That's a brilliant idea.abcI'll take him outfor a beer.

<17-8,House>那就能补偿amber在棺材盒里的事实了
<17-8,House>That'll make up for theabcfactthat amber's in a pine box.

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,790
<17-8,House>告诉他宇宙的随机性和混沌性...
<17-8,House>That there's randomnessandabcchaos in the universe.

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,570
<17-9,Cuddy>跟他道歉
<17-9,Cuddy>Tell him you're sorry.

339
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,210
<17-10,House>又不是我杀了她
<17-10,House>I didn't kill her.

340
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,500
<17-11,Cuddy>你喝醉了而且--
<17-11,Cuddy>You wereabcdrunk and--

342
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,520
<17-13,Cuddy>是你半夜给她打的电话
<17-13,Cuddy>you called her upinabcthe middle of the night.

343
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,730
<17-13,Cuddy>因为你她才在那辆巴士上
<17-13,Cuddy>She was on the busbecause of you.

344
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,640
<17-14,House>我又没让她出来
<17-14,House>I didn't ask herto come out.

345
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,690
<17-14,House>又不是我开的巴士
<17-14,House>I wasn't driving the bus.

346
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,260
<17-14,House>又不是我开的垃圾车撞上了巴士
<17-14,House>I wasn't drivingthe garbageabctruck that hit the bus.

347
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,910
<17-14,House>又不是我给她开的杀死她的感冒药
<17-14,House>And I did not prescribe hertheabcflu meds that killed her.

348
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,340
<17-15,Cuddy>是我知道 你说的都对 但是...
<17-15,Cuddy>Yes, I know,that's all true. But...

349
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,630
<17-15,Cuddy>你就一点都不觉得内疚?
<17-15,Cuddy>you really don't feelany sense of guilt?

350
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,920
<17-15,Cuddy>你想留住他abc就让他知道你关心他
<17-15,Cuddy>You want to keep him, heabcneeds to knowhe's not alone.

351
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,200
<17-15,Cuddy>让他知道你也不好过
<17-15,Cuddy>Just tell him you feellike crap.

352
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,570
<17-16,House>这毫无意义
<17-16,House>It'd be meaningless.

353
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,600
<17-17,Cuddy>你就找出点意义来
<17-17,Cuddy>Well, then,find some meaning.

354
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,120
<17-17,Cuddy>做点什么
<17-17,Cuddy>And do something.

355
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,320
<18-1,Thirteen>她现在有神经科的症状了.
<18-1,Thirteen>She's gota neurological problem.

356
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,320
<18-2,Foreman>术后并发症?
<18-2,Foreman>Surgical complication?

357
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,040
<18-3,Taub>我想不是 她一直在眨眼
<18-3,Taub>Don't think so. She keeps on blinking.

358
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,510
<18-4,Thirteen>她的心脏也没有好转
<18-4,Thirteen>Her heart's not recovering either.

359
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,190
<18-5,Foreman>那怀孕只是个巧合?
<18-5,Foreman>So the pregnancywas a coincidence.

360
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,360
<18-6,Thirteen>心率降到39  阿托品已经是最大量了
<18-6,Thirteen>Pulse is down to 39. She'sabcmaxed out on atropine.

361
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,080
<18-6,Thirteen>我们安了起搏电线来避免...
<18-6,Thirteen>We're installinga pacing wire to...

<18-6,Thirteen>快来人!

<19-7,Wilson>And to do your job?

374
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,550
<19-7,Wilson>你干嘛不朝自己脑门上开一枪?
<19-7,Wilson>Why not hold a gunto your own head?

375

<19-8,House>Your conscience bleedsmoreabcfreely than my head.

<19-10,House>Your friendship mattersmoreabcto me than this patient.

<19-12,House>是 但我的更容易做
<19-12,House>Yeah. But it comes easier for me.

383
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,160
<20-1,Taub>他在哪儿? 他在哪儿?
<20-1,Taub>where is he? Where is he?

384

<21-2,Foreman>我们给她安了起搏导线 但她心脏没什么改善
<21-2,Foreman>We have a pacing wirein her, but theabcbradycardiais not getting any better.

387
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,050
<21-3,Kutner>House在吓唬我们
<21-3,Kutner>House is bluffing.

388
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,800
<21-4,Taub>我给他打了三次电话 他一次都没接abc你准备让我们怎么做?
<21-4,Taub>I called him three times. He's notabcpicking up. What do you want us to do?

389
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,370
<21-5,Cuddy>做就跟他在这儿一样的事
<21-5,Cuddy>The same thing you'd doif he was here.

390
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,350
<21-6,Taub>要是他在这儿 我们会问他该怎么做
<21-6,Taub>If he was here, we'dabcbeasking him what to do.

391
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,380
<21-7,Cuddy>- 常见怀疑是什么?abc- 没有
<21-7,Cuddy>- What are the usual suspects?abc- There aren't any.

392
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,990
<21-8,Foreman>她有过维生素B12缺乏 我们已经纠正了abc还有异位妊娠 我们也已经手术移除了
<21-8,Foreman>She had a vitamin deficiency,and we correctedabcit, an ectopic pregnancy,we removed it.

393
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,180
<21-9,Kutner>但是她的心脏症状就是好不了abc现在连脑子都有问题了
<21-9,Kutner>But her heart problemwon't go away,abcand now something's wrongwith her brain.

394
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,320
<21-10,Cuddy>我看好你们哟
<21-10,Cuddy>I have complete confidencein you guys.

395
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,690
<21-11,Taub>谁去找house来救这个病人的命?
<21-11,Taub>Who wants to goservice houseabcso this patient can live?

396
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,230
<21-11,Taub>没他我们也一样做
<21-11,Taub>We can do thiswithout him.

397
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,640
<21-12,Thirteen>也许手术中有什么意外发生了
<21-12,Thirteen>Maybe something happenedabcduring the surgery.

398
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,680
<21-13,Taub>手术做的是她的肠子 又不是脑子
<21-13,Taub>The surgery was on herabcbowel,not her brain.

399
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,210
<21-14,Kutner>焦虑 中风 tourette综合征都会导致眨眼
<21-14,Kutner>Anxiety, stroke, tourette'sabccould all cause eye blinking.

400
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,290
<21-15,Taub>那会导致她心跳加快 而不是减慢
<21-15,Taub>And cause her heart toabcbeatfaster--it's slowing down.

401
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,640
<21-16,Thirteen>多发性硬化 如果某处的脱髓鞘病变abc导致交感神经对心脏支配的缺失
<21-16,Thirteen>M.S.If a lesion took outtheabcsympathetic innervation of her heart,

402
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,480
<21-16,Thirteen>就可以解释心动过缓和眨眼的问题了
<21-16,Thirteen>it'd explain theabcbradycardia and the blinking.

403
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,400
<21-17,Taub>但没法解释维他命不足或宫外孕
<21-17,Taub>But not the vitamin deficiencyabcor the ectopic pregnancy.

404
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,030
<21-17,Taub>House希望我们给他个统一的说法
<21-17,Taub>House would want a unifying theory.

405
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,120
<21-18,Thirteen>House现在不在abc那些症状也没了
<21-18,Thirteen>House is gone,and so are those sptoms.

406
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,120
<21-18,Thirteen>多发性硬化症可以解释abc她目前的所有症状
<21-18,Thirteen>M.S.Explains everythingthat'sabcwrong with her right now.

407
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,130
<21-19,Foreman>开始给她上干扰素abc治疗多发性硬化症
<21-19,Foreman>Start her on interferonfor M.S.

408
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,880
<22-1,Cuddy>能进来吗？
<22-1,Cuddy>Mind if I come in?

409
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,520
<22-2,House>当然 我能出去吗?
<22-2,House>Not at all. You mind if I leave?

410
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,550
<22-3,Cuddy>我特意叫你别接那个病例abc去跟Wilson好好谈谈
<22-3,Cuddy>I told you not to take that casespecificallyabcso you could dealwith wilson.

411
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,660
<22-4,House>我干活谈心两不误 你觉得呢?
<22-4,House>And the two ended updovetailingabcrather nicely, don't you think?

412
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,370
<22-5,Cuddy>你就是这么对待兄弟之情的?
<22-5,Cuddy>Is this how you showyour friendship...

413
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,830
<22-5,Cuddy>让他受良心谴责而惴惴不安?
<22-5,Cuddy>by bludgeoning himwith guilt?

414
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,640
<22-6,House>因为他是我朋友 我知道他吃哪一套
<22-6,House>Because he's my friend,Iabcknow what works on him.

415
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,550
<22-7,Cuddy>我不能让你对病人置之不理
<22-7,Cuddy>Well, I can't let youwalkabcaway from a patient.

416
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,640
<22-8,House>那就开了我吧
<22-8,House>Then fire me.

417
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,090
<22-9,Cuddy>你情愿拿丢掉饭碗abc也不愿说句"对不起"
<22-9,Cuddy>You're willing to riskyour career, butabcyou're not willingto say you're sorry.

418
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,780
<22-10,House>我跟他道过歉了
<22-10,House>I told him I'm sorry.

419
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,610
<22-10,House>只是他不信
<22-10,House>He didn't believe it.

420
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,300
<22-11,Cuddy>- 那就让他信啊abc- 我都不信
<22-11,Cuddy>- Well, make him believe it.abc- I don't believe it.

421
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,020
<22-12,House>你只是不愿意去相信
<22-12,House>You don't want to believe it.

422
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,790
<22-13,Cuddy>因为一旦你告诉Wilsonabc你对他的真实感受
<22-13,Cuddy>Because if you tell wilsonhowabcyou actually feel about him,

423
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,250
<22-13,Cuddy>告诉他你对Amber辞世的感受abc反省你的作为
<22-13,Cuddy>about what happenedto amber,abcabout your partin what happened,

424
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,460
<22-13,Cuddy>你怕他仍然摔门而去
<22-13,Cuddy>and he walksoutabcthe door anyway--

425
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,990
<22-13,Cuddy>你这辈子都在装酷abc就不能脆弱一次么...
<22-13,Cuddy>if you make yourselfvulnerable for once inabcyour nerve-deadening,emotionally obliterating--

426
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,600
<22-13,Cuddy>你跟他一样
<22-13,Cuddy>you're doing the same thing he is.

427
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,060
<22-13,Cuddy>都在躲避现实
<22-13,Cuddy>You're running away.

428
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,210
<22-13,Cuddy>只不过他没连累手上的病人
<22-13,Cuddy>Only he's not killingabcanyone in the process.

429
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,150
<23-1,Lou>House医生在哪儿?
<23-1,Lou>Where's dr. House?

430
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,510
<23-2,Thirteen>他有点不舒服
<23-2,Thirteen>He's not feeling well.

431
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,360
<23-3,Lou>他觉得我得了多发性硬化症?
<23-3,Lou>Was M.S.His idea?

432
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,890
<23-4,Thirteen>是我们小组这样认为
<23-4,Thirteen>We work as a team.

433
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,940
<23-4,Thirteen>你知道的 通力协作
<23-4,Thirteen>You know how it is. Collaborative.

434
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,910
<23-4,Thirteen>有时很难说是谁想出来的
<23-4,Thirteen>Sometimes it's hard toabctellwhere an idea comes from.

435
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,230
<23-5,Lou>但你们并不是真正的小组
<23-5,Lou>But you're notreally a team.

436
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,850
<23-5,Lou>你们都是替他工作的
<23-5,Lou>You work for him.

437
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,480
<23-6,Thirteen>而你替Patty工作abc我相信她的许多想法事实上...
<23-6,Thirteen>And you work for patty.I'm sureabca lot of her ideas are actually--

438
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,780
<23-7,Lou>我不在她身边 她不会有事的
<23-7,Lou>She would be finewithout me.

439
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,840
<23-7,Lou>没了她 我什么也不是
<23-7,Lou>I'd be nothingwithout her.

440
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,260
<23-8,Thirteen>这说不定正是次机会
<23-8,Thirteen>Maybe if you just hadthe chance.

441

<30-10,Wilson>你是说痛苦不会消散?
<30-10,Wilson>Are you saying the paindoesn't go away?
