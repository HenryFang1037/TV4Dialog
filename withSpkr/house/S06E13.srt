1
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,430
<1-1,Coach>很强的爆发力  推进
<1-1,Coach>Good explosion! Drive it!

2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,930
<1-1,Coach>推进  推进
<1-1,Coach>Drive it! Drive it!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,300
<2-1,Glenda>你在观察77号吗
<2-1,Glenda>You watching 77?

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,530
<2-2,Scout>我在观察所有人
<2-2,Scout>I'm watching everybody.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,800
<2-3,Glenda>没必要观察所有人
<2-3,Glenda>You don't need to watch everybody.

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,070
<2-3,Glenda>只要观察77号就行了
<2-3,Glenda>You need to watch 77.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,300
<2-4,Scout>你是他的经纪人吗
<2-4,Scout>You're his agent?

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,240
<2-5,Glenda>我只是一个就事论事的母亲
<2-5,Glenda>Just an objective mom.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,040
<2-6,Scout>他的爆发力很强
<2-6,Scout>His explosion is impressive.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,110
<2-7,Glenda>他不仅具有很强的爆发力  他还收放自如
<2-7,Glenda>It's not just burst. He can pull too.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,840
<2-7,Glenda>这是他能进重点中学的原因
<2-7,Glenda>You know, the only reason he went to a double "A" School,

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,810
<2-7,Glenda>不过他有些大器晚成
<2-7,Glenda>he was a bit of a late bloomer.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,850
<2-7,Glenda>他现在已经成器了
<2-7,Glenda>He's a big man now.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,380
<2-8,Scout>你该做他的经纪人
<2-8,Scout>You should be his agent.

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,120
<2-9,Coach>好球  77号
<2-9,Coach>Nice pancake, 7-7!

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,820
<2-9,Coach>你在选秀榜上的排名提升了
<2-9,Coach>You're moving up those draft boards!

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,890
<2-10,Daryl>谢谢
<2-10,Daryl>Thank you, sir!

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,920
<2-11,Quarterback>突破1号位  预备
<2-11,Quarterback>On one, on one. Ready?

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,120
<2-12,All>开始
<2-12,All>Break!

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,460
<2-13,Quarterback>蓝队90  冲啊
<2-13,Quarterback>Blue 90. Hike!

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
<2-15,Another Coach>表现的不错  很棒
<2-15,Another Coach>Good job! Second level, nice!

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,640
<2-16,Daryl>别挡着我们的四分卫
<2-16,Daryl>You off our quarterback!

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,480
<2-17,Coach>训练结束  训练结束
<2-17,Coach>Play's over! The play is over!

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,820
<2-18,Coach>哨子声后就该停止进攻
<2-18,Coach>Save the aggression for between the whistles!

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,260
<2-19,Glenda>达里
<2-19,Glenda>Daryl.

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,290
<2-20,Coach>好了  你们继续训练
<2-20,Coach>All right, back to work!

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,300
<2-19,Glenda>达里
<2-19,Glenda>Daryl.

28
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,700
<2-22,Glenda>达里  住手
<2-22,Glenda>Daryl, stop!

29
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,970
<3-1,Wilson>你在做什么
<3-1,Wilson>What are you doing?

30
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,500
<3-1,Wilson>你在干嘛
<3-1,Wilson>What are you doing?

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,930
<3-2,House>划艇而已
<3-2,House>Canoeing.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,070
<3-2,House>不过貌似我是在划水
<3-2,House>But I seem to be taking on water.

33
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,540
<3-3,Wilson>这可不行  用你自己的洗手间去
<3-3,Wilson>This is not okay. Use your own bathroom.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,770
<3-4,House>我的洗手间没有划艇
<3-4,House>No canoe in my bathroom.

35
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,140
<3-4,House>我的腿又疼了  泡一泡会舒服些
<3-4,House>My leg hurts. Soaking it makes it feel better.

36
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,410
<3-4,House>你是这间公寓的主人
<3-4,House>You were the one who had to have this condo.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,110
<3-4,House>下回你该认真考虑一下房子的基础设施
<3-4,House>Maybe next time you should consider amenities,

38
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,150
<3-4,House>比如两间包含整套卫浴设备的洗手间
<3-4,House>Like two full baths,

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
<3-4,House>而不是仅以和卡迪竞拍为乐
<3-4,House>instead of just the joy Of outbidding Cuddy.

40
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,090
<3-5,Wilson>掏钱的那个人有权选择卧室
<3-5,Wilson>The guy who signs the loan gets to pick the bedrooms.

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,360
<3-5,Wilson>离我的卧室远点
<3-5,Wilson>Stay out of mine.

42
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,330
<3-6,House>把手是我安装的  你还欠我35美金
<3-6,House>Well, you owe me 35 bucks for the grab rail I installed.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,200
<4-1,House>把成人影片关了  老大来了
<4-1,House>Hit the kill screen. Boss is here.

44
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,620
<4-2,Taub>这不是色情片  是我们的新病人
<4-2,Taub>It's not porn. It's our new patient.

45
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,740
<4-3,House>真失落
<4-3,House>Bummer.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,840
<4-4,Thirteen>男性  22岁  高6尺7寸  310磅
<4-4,Thirteen>22-year-old male-- 6'7", 310 pounds.

47
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,350
<4-4,Thirteen>显然脑部有问题
<4-4,Thirteen>Clearly has brain involvement.

48
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,550
<4-4,Thirteen>该名男子完全不记得整个事件的经过
<4-4,Thirteen>The guy has no recollection of this entire incident.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,820
<4-5,House>橄榄球运动员
<4-5,House>Football player.

50
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,990
<4-5,House>这些人的头经常被撞  是吧
<4-5,House>Those the ones that get hit in the head a lot, right?

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,870
<4-6,Chase>急诊室对他做了CT
<4-6,Chase>E.R. Ct'd him--

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,320
<4-6,Chase>结果显示没有脑震荡  也没有中风
<4-6,Chase>no concussion, no stroke,

53
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,710
<4-6,Chase>也没有皮质退化
<4-6,Chase>No cortical degeneration.

54
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,830
<4-7,Taub>同时也对他做了全套心理评估
<4-7,Taub>And he had a full psyche evaluation.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,830
<4-7,Taub>他没疯
<4-7,Taub>He's not crazy.

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,360
<4-8,House>那就是固醇狂躁咯[类固醇的副作用]
<4-8,House>So it's roid rage.

57
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,060
<4-8,House>我认为他可不是自然而然就长那么强壮的
<4-8,House>I don't think they grow them that big naturally.

58
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,780
<4-9,Foreman>急诊室也测试过他体内的类固醇含量
<4-9,Foreman>E.R. also tested for steroids.

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,600
<4-9,Foreman>他没有使用类固醇
<4-9,Foreman>He's clean.

60
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,460
<4-10,House>这只能说明他搞到的是好东西
<4-10,House>Only proving that our guy got his hands on the good stuff.

61
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,200
<4-11,Foreman>阴性检测结果至少表明不太可能是类固醇
<4-11,Foreman>The negative test at least means steroids is less likely.

62
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,510
<4-11,Foreman>我们应该考虑其他的因素
<4-11,Foreman>We should discuss other possibilities.

63
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,570
<4-11,Foreman>为什么
<4-11,Foreman>Why?

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,940
<4-12,House>每次比赛前他都喷利多卡因
<4-12,House>He injects his sore ankles

66
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,180
<4-12,House>以缓解脚踝的疼痛
<4-12,House>with lidocaine every game.

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,940
<4-12,House>你觉得他会不使用类固醇吗
<4-12,House>You think he's above injecting steroids?

68
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,650
<4-13,Foreman>头部频繁受创会损伤脑基底  引发脑垂体瘤
<4-13,Foreman>Repeated head trauma could damage the base of the brain,

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,350
<4-13,Foreman>从而释放GNrH[促性腺激素释放激素]
<4-13,Foreman>Leading to a pituitary adenoma, which leaks GNrH.

70
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,820
<4-14,Thirteen>电脑断层扫描无法检测出脑垂体损伤
<4-14,Thirteen>Pituitary damage wouldn't be visible on a CT scan.

71
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,150
<4-15,Chase>导致过量分荷尔蒙素从而引起暴躁
<4-15,Chase>Could cause the excess hormones that could cause the rage

72
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,160
<4-15,Chase>这也能躲过急诊室的类固醇检验
<4-15,Chase>And would elude the E.R. steroid test.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,820
<4-15,Chase>好吧
<4-15,Chase>Fine.

74
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,330
<4-16,House>采用双侧静脉采样检测GNrH是否升高
<4-16,House>Bilateral venous sampling to find the elevated GNrh.

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,260
<4-16,House>做个核磁共振检查是否有脑垂体损伤
<4-16,House>MRI to find the pituitary damage.

76
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,500
<4-16,House>如果不是脑垂体损伤
<4-16,House>Unless, of course, there is no pituitary damage,

77
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,470
<4-16,House>那么他用的的确就是好东西了
<4-16,House>in which case, our guy got his hands on the good stuff.

78
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,680
<4-17,House>福曼  这些小事你就别操心了
<4-17,House>Foreman. Let the peasants handle the peasantry.

79
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,360
<4-17,House>你哥哥今天下午要人去接他
<4-17,House>Your brother needs to get picked up this afternoon...

80
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,680
<4-17,House>他今天出狱
<4-17,House>from prison.

81
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,890
<4-17,House>你的哥哥  如果你疑惑
<4-17,House>Your older brother, in case your confusion is--

82
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,950
<4-18,Foreman>你怎么知道的
<4-18,Foreman>How do you know about that?

83
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,860
<4-19,House>他在电话里留言了
<4-19,House>He left a message.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,020
<4-19,House>他说他打你和你家里的电话都没人接
<4-19,House>Said he couldn't get you on your cell or at home.

85
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,630
<4-19,House>我明白  你工作繁忙
<4-19,House>I get it. You're busy.

86
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,530
<4-19,House>下次他从监狱出来的时候你再去接他吧
<4-19,House>You'll pick him up the next time he comes out of prison.

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,930
<4-20,Foreman>你说完了吗
<4-20,Foreman>Is that all?

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,770
<4-21,House>其实你不忙
<4-21,House>You're officially unbusy.

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,140
<4-21,House>毕竟是一家人
<4-21,House>Family is family.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,440
<4-21,House>我放你假  去接你哥哥吧
<4-21,House>Take the rest of the day. Go see your brother.

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,010
<4-22,Foreman>我还有工作
<4-22,Foreman>I have work to do.

92
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,780
<5-1,Taub>你有没有持续性感觉到隐隐的疼痛呢
<5-1,Taub>Do you feel any pain that's deep and persistent,

93
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,380
<5-1,Taub>还是只有肌肉和关节的疼痛
<5-1,Taub>not just muscles or joints?

94
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,440
<5-2,Daryl>我全身一直都疼  这是打橄榄球的原因
<5-2,Daryl>Everything hurts all the time. That's football.

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,150
<5-3,Taub>这可能不仅仅是打橄榄球的原因
<5-3,Taub>It might not be just football.

96
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,760
<5-3,Taub>我们要检查一下你的脑垂体是否受损
<5-3,Taub>We're gonna test for damage to your pituitary.

97
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,760
<5-3,Taub>如果受损的话  就可能会分泌出过多的荷尔蒙
<5-3,Taub>If there is, it could create excess hormones,

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,990
<5-3,Taub>从而引起你的疼痛
<5-3,Taub>which could be causing your pain.

99
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,400
<5-3,Taub>这也就能解释你的暴力行为产生的原因
<5-3,Taub>It would also explain your rage attack.

100
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,000
<5-4,Daryl>如果我的脑垂体受损
<5-4,Daryl>And if my pituitary is damaged,

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,330
<5-4,Daryl>要多久才能治好
<5-4,Daryl>how long would it take to treat?

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
<5-5,Taub>我不想妄加揣测
<5-5,Taub>I don't want to get ahead of ourselves

103
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,130
<5-5,Taub>过早预测结果
<5-5,Taub>and start promising deadlines.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,270
<5-6,Glenda>不好意思  医生
<5-6,Glenda>I-I'm sorry, doctor,

105
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,310
<5-6,Glenda>可他这周六得在专业星探
<5-6,Glenda>but he's playing in front of pro scouts,

106
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,570
<5-6,Glenda>教练还有总经理们面前比赛
<5-6,Glenda>coaches, and gms this Saturday.

107
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,180
<5-6,Glenda>这是他毕生事业的面试
<5-6,Glenda>This is the job interview for the rest of his life.

108
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,450
<5-7,Taub>如果检测结果表明脑垂体受损
<5-7,Taub>If we do find something wrong,

109
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,450
<5-7,Taub>我们可以从鼻腔进入  修复损伤
<5-7,Taub>we can go in through the nose and repair the damage--

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,720
<5-7,Taub>不用做大手术
<5-7,Taub>Nothing too invasive.

111
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,950
<5-7,Taub>休息几天就可以恢复
<5-7,Taub>You'll need a couple days of recovery,

112
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,050
<5-7,Taub>到时你就可以及时回到场上比赛了
<5-7,Taub>and then we can have you back by game time.

113
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,960
<5-8,Daryl>休息你  医生
<5-8,Daryl>Thank you, doctor.

114
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,460
<6-1,House>你的眼睛没毛病
<6-1,House>There's nothing wrong with your eyes.

115
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,430
<6-2,Jim>是你的工具坏了吧
<6-2,Jim>Well, then your gizmo's broken.

116
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,770
<6-2,Jim>我眼睛发花
<6-2,Jim>I'm seeing spots.

117
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,000
<6-3,House>是你得去服役吧
<6-3,House>Or you enlisted,

118
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,870
<6-3,House>你有着帅气的发型  超赞的牛仔裤
<6-3,House>you got the cool haircut and the awesome pants,

119
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,640
<6-3,House>可一想到即将奔赴中东服役
<6-3,House>then you realized that your plane ticket to the middle east was coach,

120
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,610
<6-3,House>然后你就开始反悔了

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,050
<6-4,Jim>现在他们又想让我去
<6-4,Jim>Now they want me to go again.

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,650
<6-4,Jim>但我妻子怀孕了

125
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,750
<6-5,House>你是说你要

126
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,320
<6-5,House>舍国家为小家咯
<6-5,House>Because your private was unsafe.

127
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,890
<6-6,Jim>我和我妻子都做好完美的计划了
<6-6,Jim>Look, my wife and I planned this perfect.

128
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,900
<6-6,Jim>我的服役本该上周就结束
<6-6,Jim>My enlistment was supposed to be over last week,

129
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,470

130
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,470
<6-6,Jim>可他们告诉我我要超期服役
<6-6,Jim>Now they tell me I'm getting stop-lossed--

<6-7,House>I don't care about the fact that they don't care.

<6-8,Jim>拜托
<6-8,Jim>Hey, come on.

144
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,700
<6-13,House>要么对自己的脚开一枪
<6-13,House>or shoot themselves in the foot.

145
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,100
<6-13,House>他们才不会跑到免费诊所来
<6-13,House>They didn't come to free clinics

<7-1,House>你那小狗似的眼神告诉我
<7-1,House>I can tell from your little puppy-dog eyes

152
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,150
<7-1,House>他的垂体没问题

154
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,650
<7-2,Taub>关于类固醇你说得太对了
<7-2,Taub>You were right about the steroids.

157
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
<7-3,House>给那个骗子注射生长抑素类似物
<7-3,House>Put the cheater on a somatostatin analog

158
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,790
<7-3,House>清除他体内的类固醇吧
<7-3,House>to clear it out of his system.

159
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,660
<7-3,House>再让他回到赛场上去
<7-3,House>Send him back to his football game.

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,300
<7-3,House>我从没用过类固醇

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,030
<8-1,Daryl>你的GnRH高于正常水平
<8-1,Daryl>Well, somehow your GnRH got elevated.

162
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,600
<8-2,Taub>这可以让它恢复正常
<8-2,Taub>This will help get it back down.

163
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,970
<8-3,Daryl>妈  我发誓
<8-3,Daryl>Mom, I swear.

164

<8-4,Glenda>你都蠢到去用那东西了
<8-4,Glenda>You're stupid enough to try that stuff,

166
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,940
<8-4,Glenda>何况这周你还要面临测试
<8-4,Glenda>especially the week you know you're getting tested.

167
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,380
<8-5,Daryl>你们肯定把检查结果弄混了
<8-5,Daryl>You guys must've mixed up your labs

168
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
<8-5,Daryl>会不会是别人的血样  我从来没有
<8-5,Daryl>or got somebody else's blood, because I never--

<8-8,Daryl>Why's my heart beating like this?

172
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,560
<8-9,Taub>说明不是类固醇
<8-9,Taub>It's not steroids.

173
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,220
<8-9,Taub>我需要腺苷
<8-9,Taub>I need some adenosine!

174

205
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,610
<10-5,Marcus>我可能早就知道你过得不错了
<10-5,Marcus>every once in a while,

206
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,650
<10-5,Marcus>不过没关系  我明白

<10-5,Marcus>也不想来接我出狱
<10-5,Marcus>You don't want to pick me up.

209
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,380
<10-5,Marcus>这些你都有理
<10-5,Marcus>It's all justified.

210

<10-5,Marcus>我只是需要重新获得你的信任
<10-5,Marcus>I'll just have to win you back over.

211
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,570
<10-6,Foreman>让我来澄清一下
<10-6,Foreman>Let me explain something.

212
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,620
<10-6,Foreman>这个给你工作的人
<10-6,Foreman>This man who's offering you the job--

213
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,950
<10-6,Foreman>他可不是慈善家
<10-6,Foreman>He's not a philanthropist.

214
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,220
<10-7,Marcus>他看上去比你热情多了
<10-7,Marcus>He seems more helpful than you.

215
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,090
<10-8,Foreman>他才不是想帮你
<10-8,Foreman>He doesn't want to help you.

216
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,830
<10-8,Foreman>只是想利用你来整我罢了
<10-8,Foreman>He only wants to use you to screw with me.

217
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,690
<10-9,Marcus>你知道最好的反击是什么吗
<10-9,Marcus>You know how you can screw with him?

218
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,460
<10-9,Marcus>表现出一副你不在乎我在这儿工作的样子
<10-9,Marcus>Act like your brother getting a job doesn't screw with you.

219
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,600
<10-10,Foreman>相信我吧  如果你告诉他
<10-10,Foreman>Trust me, it'll be better for both of us

220
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,100
<10-10,Foreman>你不接受这份工作的话
<10-10,Foreman>if you go back in there and tell him

221
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,640
<10-10,Foreman>对我俩都有好处
<10-10,Foreman>you can't take the job.

222
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,770
<10-11,Marcus>我可没有资格随便拒绝
<10-11,Marcus>I'm not a person who has the luxury

223
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,440
<10-11,Marcus>一份工作
<10-11,Marcus>of turning down jobs.

224
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,980
<10-12,Foreman>找点别的事做
<10-12,Foreman>Well, figure something out...

225
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,250
<10-12,Foreman>你不能在这工作
<10-12,Foreman>'cause you cannot work here.

226
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,880
<10-12,Foreman>豪斯
<10-12,Foreman>House!

228
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,060
<10-12,Foreman>病人的心脏没有任何问题
<10-12,Foreman>Patient's heart looks fine.

229
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,260
<12-1,Taub>如果没有问题
<12-1,Taub>well, if it was fine,

230
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,790
<12-2,House>为什么你走进他的病房
<12-2,House>It wouldn't go aflutter

231
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,260
<12-2,House>他的心就开始嘣蹦乱跳呢
<12-2,House>just 'cause you walked into the room.

232
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,330
<12-3,Marcus>淡奶油  多加了两份咖啡
<12-3,Marcus>Light whip, two extra shots.

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,000
<12-3,Marcus>谢谢
<12-3,Marcus>Thank you, sir.

234
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,830
<12-4,House>看你的表情
<12-4,House>Judging by the look on your face,

235
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,510
<12-4,House>估计你哥哥没听取你的意见辞职
<12-4,House>I assume you're upset that big bro didn't

236
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,710
<12-4,House>让你很失望
<12-4,House>take your advice and skip town.

237
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,370
<12-5,Foreman>你把我们的谈话内容告诉他了吗
<12-5,Foreman>You told him about our conversation?

238
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,540
<12-6,Marcus>他给我买了早餐
<12-6,Marcus>He bought me breakfast.

239
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,280
<12-7,House>真有趣啊
<12-7,House>it was fun.

240
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,010
<12-7,House>订一下午餐吧  就你和我
<12-7,House>Put lunch in the books, just you and me.

241
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,280
<12-8,Foreman>我们的病人有可能是卵园孔未闭
<12-8,Foreman>Our patient could have a pfo.

242
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,920
<12-9,House>那么自然的你会转到泌尿系统的方向
<12-9,House>Well, naturally, you jump right to a urinary issue.

243
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,060
<12-10,Foreman>卵圆孔未闭不是泌尿系统问题  是心脏问题
<12-10,Foreman>Pfo's not urinary. It's a heart issue.

244
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,960
<12-8,Foreman>是吗  哦
<12-8,Foreman>It is? Oh.

245
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,290
<12-9,House>很自然地  你认为
<12-9,House>Well, naturally, you think

246
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,590
<12-9,House>不是泌尿系统问题
<12-9,House>It's not a urinary issue,

247
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,330
<12-11,House>因为你正为你自己
<12-11,House>'cause you're so embarrassed about your own

248
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,160
<12-11,House>过去的泌尿系统的问题而困扰
<12-11,House>Past urinary issues,

249
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,730
<12-11,House>你不敢讨论这个问题
<12-11,House>You don't dare broach the subject.

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,540
<12-11,House>别这样
<12-11,House>Oh, come on.

251
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
<12-11,House>你在波比·萨姆森家待了一整晚
<12-11,House>You spending the night over at Bobby Samson's.

252
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,780
<12-12,Foreman>我没有尿床
<12-12,Foreman>I did not wet the bed.

253
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,780
<12-12,Foreman>我只是把饮料弄洒了
<12-12,Foreman>I spilled a drink.

254
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,380
<12-13,House>我们没买饮料吧  埃里克
<12-13,House>We're not buying it, Eric.

255
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,620
<12-13,House>我们从来没买过
<12-13,House>We never bought it.

256
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,020
<12-14,Foreman>你干嘛告诉他这些事
<12-14,Foreman>Why aryou telling him these things?

257
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,320
<12-15,Marcus>有什么大不了的  已经过去25年了
<12-15,Marcus>What's the big deal? It was 25 years ago.

258
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,290
<12-16,Foreman>充满氧气的和脱氧的血液混合在一起
<12-16,Foreman>Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix,

259
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,930
<12-16,Foreman>快速血流造成了血栓  解释了心脏和头的问题
<12-16,Foreman>The rough flow causes a clot, explains the heart and head.

260
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,030
<12-17,Marcus>就像洛约拉玛莉曼特大学的那个大前锋
<12-17,Marcus>like that power forward from Loyola Marymount,

261
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
<12-17,Marcus>他  呃...
<12-17,Marcus>When he, um...

262
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,500
<12-18,Foreman>汉克·盖瑟斯吗  他们情况不一样
<12-18,Foreman>Hank Gathers? That's not what happened to him.

263
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,430
<12-19,House>让你哥哥说完
<12-19,House>Whoa, whoa, whoa, let your brother speak.

264
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,770
<12-19,House>头号主将盖瑟斯怎么了
<12-19,House>What happened to Hank Gathers?

265
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,970
<12-20,Marcus>联盟锦标赛的时候
<12-20,Marcus>conference tournament--

266
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,740
<12-20,Marcus>空中传球扣篮  把球阻断在主半场
<12-20,Marcus>Alley-oop dunk, jams it home.

267
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,240
<12-20,Marcus>然后他跑遍全场去拦截
<12-20,Marcus>Then he runs up the court and splat.

268
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,540
<12-20,Marcus>后来就因心脏病突发就死在
<12-20,Marcus>He dropped dead of a heart thing

269
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,640
<12-20,Marcus>球场上
<12-20,Marcus>Right there on the court.

270
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,980
<12-21,Taub>我记起来了
<12-21,Taub>I remember that.

271
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,750
<12-21,Taub>验尸的时候  他们发现
<12-21,Taub>On autopsy, they found he had

272
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,050
<12-22,House>他有心肌肥大症
<12-22,House>A hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

273
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,250
<12-22,House>情绪激动心动过速
<12-22,House>rage and tachycardia

274
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,680
<12-22,House>都是警告
<12-22,House>Are warning signs.

275
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,120
<12-23,Foreman>你是认真的吗
<12-23,Foreman>Seriously?

276
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,390
<12-23,Foreman>就因为我哥哥想起了一场篮球赛吗
<12-23,Foreman>Because my brother remembers a basketball game?

277
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,720
<12-24,House>我不管这些想法是从何而来
<12-24,House>Hey, I don't care where an idea comes from,

278
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,360
<12-24,House>只要讲得通而且还能让某人尴尬就行
<12-24,House>As long as it makes sense and embarrasses someone.

279
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,300
<12-25,Wilson>你是不是疯了啊
<12-25,Wilson>Are you out of your mind?

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,430
<12-26,House>作为一个曾经的精神病患者
<12-26,House>As a former psychiatric patient,

281
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,130
<12-26,House>我拒绝使用这个说法
<12-26,House>I take offense at that terminology.

282
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,470
<12-27,Wilson>我只不过是想把你赶出我的浴缸而已
<12-27,Wilson>All I did was ban you from my tub.

283
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,270
<12-27,Wilson>你就用那种方式来给我反馈吗
<12-27,Wilson>Whatever happened to proportional response?

284
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,240
<12-28,House>那种方式与我们的谈话有什么关联吗
<12-28,House>Whatever happened to coherent conversation?

285
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,780
<12-29,Wilson>那个...东东...
<12-29,Wilson>That...Thing...

286
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,480
<12-29,Wilson>打破了瓷砖  刮破了墙壁
<12-29,Wilson>Broke tiles, gashed the walls,

287
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,910
<12-29,Wilson>还到处大小便
<12-29,Wilson>And pooped everywhere.

288
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,350
<12-29,Wilson>我开了个修理费的账单...
<12-29,Wilson>Expect a bill for repairs...

289
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,750
<12-29,Wilson>你来付钱
<12-29,Wilson>And payback.

290
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,460
<12-30,Chase>到底怎么了
<12-30,Chase>What was that?

291
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,020
<12-31,House>我不知道啊
<12-31,House>I have no idea.

292
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,790
<12-31,House>大家都认为
<12-31,House>Everybody else thinks

293
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,730
<12-31,House>是心肌肥大症吗
<12-31,House>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes sense?

294
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,360
<12-31,House>那后  让病人用跑步机
<12-31,House>Good. Stick the patient on a treadmill.

295
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,170
<12-31,House>给他的心脏施压直到它停止跳动
<12-31,House>Stress his heart until it stops.

296
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,700
<12-32,Thirteen>你想诱导心搏停止吗
<12-32,Thirteen>You want to induce cardiac arrest?

297
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,540
<12-33,House>唯一对病人用作用的治疗
<12-33,House>Only real treatment is for the patient

298
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,940
<12-33,House>就是再也不要给他的心脏负担了
<12-33,House>Never to stress his heart again,

299
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,840
<12-33,House>也就是说我们要告诉他
<12-33,House>Which means we have to tell him to retire

300
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,240
<12-33,House>在他这个21岁的年龄时该退役了
<12-33,House>At the ripe old age of 21.

301
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,110
<12-33,House>让他心脏的跳动声比说话声都小
<12-33,House>Stopping his heart speaks louder than words.

302
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,410
<30-10,Glenda>去吧
<30-10,Glenda>Go.

303
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
<30-10,Glenda>也许这是件好事
<30-10,Glenda>Maybe it's a good thing.

304
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,550
<13-1,Cuddy>他给你哥哥一份工作  一份责任
<13-1,Cuddy>He gave your brother a job, responsibility.

305
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,660
<13-2,Foreman>我不是说他不该工作
<13-2,Foreman>I'm not arguing that he shouldn't have a job.

306
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
<13-2,Foreman>我就是不想他在我们那里工作
<13-2,Foreman>I just don't want him having one here.

307
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,330
<13-3,Cuddy>我理解豪斯这么做是想烦你
<13-3,Cuddy>I understand that House did this to annoy you.

308
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,530
<13-3,Cuddy>但他为什么能得逞呢
<13-3,Cuddy>But why is he succeeding?

309
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,330
<13-4,Foreman>你知道我哥哥过去做了些什么
<13-4,Foreman>you know what my brother did

310
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,800
<13-4,Foreman>上次他出狱之后
<13-4,Foreman>The last time he got out of prison?

311
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,640
<13-4,Foreman>他偷我爸妈的钱去买毒品
<13-4,Foreman>He stole money from my parents to buy drugs.

312
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,940
<13-4,Foreman>他抢劫了一家买酒的商店
<13-4,Foreman>He robbed a liquor store.

313
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,340
<13-4,Foreman>然后去买豪华车
<13-4,Foreman>Then he moved on to jacking luxury cars--

314
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,480
<13-5,Cuddy>上一次
<13-5,Cuddy>Last time.

315
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,350
<13-6,Foreman>每一次
<13-6,Foreman>Every time.

316
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,850
<13-6,Foreman>我了解他30多年了
<13-6,Foreman>I've known my brother for over 30 years.

317
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,220
<13-6,Foreman>你一天也没接触过他
<13-6,Foreman>You haven't even known him a day.

318
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,820
<13-7,Cuddy>对不起
<13-7,Cuddy>I'm sorry.

319
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,380
<14-1,Wilson>害虫驱除剂要用250美金
<14-1,Wilson>The exterminator charged $250

320
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,530
<14-1,Wilson>能够把负鼠赶走
<14-1,Wilson>To get the opossum out of there,

321
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,300
<14-1,Wilson>承包商估计
<14-1,Wilson>And the contractor estimates

322
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,750
<14-1,Wilson>要用1500美金修理浴室
<14-1,Wilson>$1,500 to fix the bathroom.

323
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,290
<14-1,Wilson>你为什么要戏弄福曼
<14-1,Wilson>And why are you jerking foreman around?

324
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,310
<14-2,House>因为那很有意思
<14-2,House>Because it's fun.

325
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,350
<14-2,House>或许你让那个
<14-2,House>Maybe you should give those bills to the guy

326
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,110
<14-2,House>把自己浴室窗户开着的家伙付账单
<14-2,House>Who left his own bathroom window open.

327
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,390
<14-3,Wilson>你的动机总要比简单的玩笑更深一层
<14-3,Wilson>Your motives always run deeper than simple fun.

328
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,570
<14-4,House>我想知道更多
<14-4,House>I want to learn more

329
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,550
<14-4,House>关于我的员工  这样我就能操控他
<14-4,House>About one of my employees so that I can manipulate him

330
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,090
<14-4,House>然后在需要的时候收拾他一顿
<14-4,House>And destroy him if and when I choose.

331
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,690
<14-4,House>信息就是力量
<14-4,House>Information is power.

332
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,630
<14-5,Wilson>-我不信  -好吧
<14-5,Wilson>- Not buying it. - Okay.

333
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,260
<14-6,House>你为什么不告诉我我的真正险恶的计划呢
<14-6,House>Why don't you tell me my real evil plan?

334
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,960
<14-7,Wilson>我不觉得有什么险恶的计划
<14-7,Wilson>I don't think there is an evil plan.

335
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,880
<14-7,Wilson>你觉得你和你的家庭
<14-7,Wilson>You regret not having a relationship

336
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,230
<14-7,Wilson>没有良好的关系  觉得很遗憾
<14-7,Wilson>With your own family,

337
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,870
<14-7,Wilson>你不想看到福曼走你的老路
<14-7,Wilson>And you don't want to see foreman go down that same path.

338
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,570
<14-7,Wilson>我觉得...
<14-7,Wilson>I think...

339
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,970
<14-7,Wilson>你其实是个好人
<14-7,Wilson>You're actually being nice.

340
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,740
<14-8,House>闭嘴吧
<14-8,House>Oh, shut up.

341
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,080
<14-8,House>你不能因为负鼠的事怪罪于我
<14-8,House>You can't accuse me of an opossum attack

342
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,980
<14-8,House>也不要以为我其实是个好人
<14-8,House>And underhanded kindness in the same visit.

343
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,180
<14-9,Wilson>我会回来的
<14-9,Wilson>Then i'll come back.

344
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,220
<14-10,Chase>跑步机检查做不了了
<14-10,Chase>Treadmill test was a bust.

345
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,430
<14-10,Chase>那个家伙有不可思议的情况
<14-10,Chase>The guy's in unbelievable shape.

346
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,460
<14-10,Chase>我们不能使他的心率达到150
<14-10,Chase>We couldn't get his heart rate above 150.

347
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,220
<14-11,Wilson>你们老板其实是个很好的人
<14-11,Wilson>Your boss is secretly a very nice man.

348
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,660
<14-12,Taub>我知道啊
<14-12,Taub>I know.

349
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,730
<14-13,Chase>如果我们引发重造心脏病的情况
<14-13,Chase>If we can't re-create the cardiac event,

350
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,200
<14-13,Chase>我们就没办法证明是心肌肥大症
<14-13,Chase>We can't prove Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

351
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,210
<14-14,House>或者我们找个更大的跑步机...
<14-14,House>Either we find a bigger treadmill...

352
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,310
<14-14,House>或者...
<14-14,House>Or...

353
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,410
<15-1,House>难道我没收到你可以自由活动的留言吗
<15-1,House>Did I miss the memo about you being released?

354
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,690
<15-2,Daryl>我感觉很好
<15-2,Daryl>I'm feeling fine.

355
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,760
<15-2,Daryl>我不能就这样躺在这儿错过训练
<15-2,Daryl>I can't keep laying here in this bed missing practices.

356
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,330
<15-3,House>说的太在点了  手臂给我
<15-3,House>All excellent points. give me your arm.

<15-4,Glenda>你要给我打什么
<15-4,Glenda>What's in the shot?

358
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,130
<15-5,House>血管扩张剂
<15-5,House>It's a vasodilator.

359
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,900
<15-5,House>既然跑步机锻炼不了你儿子的心脏
<15-5,House>Since we can't exercise your son's heart on the treadmill,

360
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,250
<15-5,House>就只好采取化学方法了
<15-5,House>I'm gonna have to do it chemically.

361
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,410
<15-6,Daryl>怎么了
<15-6,Daryl>What's wrong?

362
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,140
<15-7,House>你在变白
<15-7,House>You're turning white.

363
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,640
<15-8,Glenda>这代表什么
<15-8,Glenda>What does that mean?

364
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,310
<15-9,House>代表他再也不需要
<15-9,House>It means he doesn't need football

365
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,210
<15-9,House>借橄榄球找工作了
<15-9,House>to get a good job anymore.

366
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,230
<16-1,Taub>是雷诺氏现象
<16-1,Taub>Raynaud's phenomenon--

367
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,100
<16-1,Taub>血管痉挛阻断
<16-1,Taub>Vasospasms cut off the blood supply

368
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,670
<16-1,Taub>手指的血液供应
<16-1,Taub>to his fingers.

369
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,470
<16-1,Taub>有可能是风湿性关节炎的早期病征
<16-1,Taub>Could be early onset rheumatoid arthritis.

370
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,030
<16-2,Foreman>类风湿因子呈阴性
<16-2,Foreman>Rheumatoid factor is negative.

371
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,540
<16-3,Thirteen>动脉斑块引起的血栓
<16-3,Thirteen>Arterial plaque throwing clots

372
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,600
<16-3,Thirteen>可以解释手指  脑部和心脏问题
<16-3,Thirteen>would explain the fingers, head, heart.

373
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,010
<16-4,House>你真的觉得一个血管窄化的人
<16-4,House>You really think a guy with stenosis

374
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,620
<16-4,House>能撑过平板测验吗
<16-4,House>could've aced that treadmill test?

375
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,580
<16-5,Foreman>开玩笑吧  你竟然给他弄了张桌子
<16-5,Foreman>You're kidding me. You got him a desk?

376
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,250
<16-6,House>还有名牌呢
<16-6,House>And a nameplate.

377
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,420
<16-6,House>男人需要有自己的地盘
<16-6,House>Man's got to have a place he can call his own.

378
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,490
<16-7,Chase>会不会是多发性大动脉炎
<16-7,Chase>What about Takayasu's Arteritis?

379
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,360
<16-8,Foreman>淋巴瘤更符合  得摘掉他的脾
<16-8,Foreman>Lymphoma's a better fit. We should remove his spleen.

380
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,330
<16-9,Chase>直接跳到手术环节太鲁莽了
<16-9,Chase>Bold move to skip straight to surgery.

381
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,730
<16-10,Foreman>他的重要赛事快到了
<16-10,Foreman>His big game's coming up.

382
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,360
<16-10,Foreman>没时间在那儿做做活检
<16-10,Foreman>We don't have time to biopsy,

383
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,230
<16-10,Foreman>等等报告  再做做手术
<16-10,Foreman>wait for the pathology report, and resect.

384
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,500
<16-10,Foreman>太对了
<16-10,Foreman>Right.

385
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,470
<16-11,Chase>我们应该一点根据都没有地切了他的脾
<16-11,Chase>We should remove his spleen without confirmation

386
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,670
<16-11,Chase>好让他赶上他那重要赛事
<16-11,Chase>so he won't miss the big game.

387
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,590
<16-12,House>滴注乙醇
<16-12,House>Hang an ethanol drip.

388
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,400
<16-13,Foreman>那既不治淋巴瘤也不治
<16-13,Foreman>That won't treat

389
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,010
<16-13,Foreman>多发性大动脉炎
<16-13,Foreman>for either lymphoma or takayasu's.

390
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,810
<16-14,House>如果是淋巴瘤他就会发痒
<16-14,House>If it's lymphoma, the ethanol will make him itchy,

391
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,410
<16-14,House>福曼就能去切他的脾
<16-14,House>And foreman can remove his spleen.

392
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,410
<16-14,House>如果是大动脉炎  桡动脉就会没脉搏
<16-14,House>If it's Takayasu's, he'll lose his radial pulse,

393
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,880
<16-14,House>奇斯就能用他的类固醇了
<16-14,House>And Chase can start him on steroids.

394
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,940
<16-15,House>马克斯
<16-15,House>Marcus!

<17-2,Marcus>新任务是在敌国领土上
<17-2,Marcus>My new assignment is to shadow you

00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,800
<17-2,Marcus>记录你们对病人说的每一个字
<17-2,Marcus>And document your every word to the patient.

399
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,440
<17-2,Marcus>别说傻话
<17-2,Marcus>Just don't say anything stupid.

400
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,310
<17-3,Foreman>你不是白痴  别这么做
<17-3,Foreman>You're not an idiot. Don't do this.

401
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,650
<17-4,Marcus>拜托  兄弟
<17-4,Marcus>Come on, man.

402
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,830
<17-4,Marcus>我改过自新了
<17-4,Marcus>I'm a new person now--

403
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,320
<17-4,Marcus>不再吸毒  不再撒谎
<17-4,Marcus>no more drugs, no more lying.

404
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,890
<17-4,Marcus>要是连我家人都不给我
<17-4,Marcus>And if i can't get my own family

405
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,390
<17-4,Marcus>一个机会来证明
<17-4,Marcus>to give me an opportunity to prove that,

406
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,620
<17-4,Marcus>这又有什么意义呢
<17-4,Marcus>Then what's the point?

407
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,960
<17-5,Foreman>爸妈给过你机会
<17-5,Foreman>Mom and dad gave you a chance

408
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,020
<17-5,Foreman>一而再
<17-5,Foreman>and a second

409
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,330
<17-5,Foreman>再而三
<17-5,Foreman>and a third.

410
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,960
<17-5,Foreman>我不会再纵容你了
<17-5,Foreman>I'm not about to give you a 54th.

411
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,510
<18-1,Wilson>你家奴才怎么没来接你吃午饭呢
<18-1,Wilson>Why isn't your minion fetching your lunch?

412
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,580
<18-2,House>正忙着暗中监视他的弟弟呢
<18-2,House>He's busy spying on his little brother.

413
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,420
<18-3,House>什么
<18-3,House>What?

414
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,460
<18-4,Wilson>这可挺伤自尊的啊
<18-4,Wilson>That's very demeaning.

415
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,290
<18-5,House>显然你又要发表
<18-5,House>You obviously have a theory

416
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,130
<18-5,House>伤人自尊之不为伤人自尊的理论了
<18-5,House>as to why demeaning is not demeaning.

417
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,970
<18-6,Wilson>你在变本加厉
<18-6,Wilson>You're escalating

418
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,400
<18-6,Wilson>想证明你不像我想的那样在做好人
<18-6,Wilson>to prove I was wrong about you being nice,

419
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,100
<18-6,Wilson>只有我说对了你才会这么做
<18-6,Wilson>Which you would only do if i was right.

420
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,640
<18-7,House>你听过自己在说些什么吗
<18-7,House>Do you even listen to yourself?

421
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,500
<18-8,Cuddy>急诊室刚来了一个23岁病人
<18-8,Cuddy>23-year-old just came into the E.R.,

422
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,770
<18-8,Cuddy>指明要点你

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,880
<18-9,House>她罩杯多大
<18-9,House>What's her cup size?

424
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,970
<18-10,Cuddy>我不认为他的罩杯
<18-10,Cuddy>I don't think his cup size

425
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,440
<18-10,Cuddy>和他的状况有关系
<18-10,Cuddy>is relevant to his condition.

<18-10,Cuddy>他不小心往自己脚开了一枪
<18-10,Cuddy>He accidentally shot himself in the foot.

427
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,890
<18-10,Cuddy>说真的吗
<18-10,Cuddy>Seriously?

428
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,860
<19-1,House>我让你在移民加拿大和

429
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,090
<19-1,House>给自己的脚打一枪中间选
<19-1,House>and shooting yourself in the foot,

430
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,290
<19-1,House>你竟然选了后者吗
<19-1,House>And you chose the bullet?

431
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,260
<19-2,Jim>我不想当逃兵
<19-2,Jim>I didn't want to be a fugitive.

432
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,870
<19-3,House>你以为这就能让你退伍了吗
<19-3,House>You think this is gonna get you discharged?

433

<19-3,House>我们会给你缝好针然后直接送你回去
<19-3,House>We'll patch it up and send you right back.

434
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,360
<19-4,Jim>别帮我治疗
<19-4,Jim>Don't patch it up.

435
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,640
<19-4,Jim>听着
<19-4,Jim>Look...

436
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,140
<19-5,House>你被自己的政府搞得一团糟
<19-5,House>You got screwed over by your own government,

437
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,610
<19-5,House>那真的很恶心
<19-5,House>And that sucks.

438
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,010
<19-5,House>但你这样做只能得到
<19-5,House>But all you're gonna get out of this

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,680
<19-6,Jim>现在我要做爸爸了
<19-6,Jim>Now I'm about to be a dad.

442
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,020
<19-6,Jim>要是回去那儿
<19-6,Jim>I go back over,

443
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,780
<19-6,Jim>我的孩子很有可能会没有父亲
<19-6,Jim>there's a chance my kid grows up without a father.

444
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,090
<19-7,House>即使搞大了一个女孩的肚子
<19-7,House>You got a girl pregnant.

445
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,960
<19-7,House>你也还只是一个男孩
<19-7,House>You're still just a guy.

446
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
<20-1,Daryl>我们得等多久
<20-1,Daryl>How much longer we have to wait?

447
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,160
<20-2,Foreman>一直到你
<20-2,Foreman>We have to keep going

448
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,510
<20-2,Foreman>有些感觉为止
<20-2,Foreman>until you start feeling something.

449
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,190
<20-3,Daryl>要是你说出我该感觉到什么
<20-3,Daryl>Might help if, uh, you told me

450
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,080
<20-3,Daryl>应该会比较有帮助
<20-3,Daryl>what I'm supposed to feel.

451
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,180
<20-4,Foreman>要是我说了  你就会满脑子想着
<20-4,Foreman>If i do that, that's all you'll be thinking about.

452
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,080
<20-4,Foreman>这样你告诉我的就不是你真正的感觉了
<20-4,Foreman>then you'll be telling me that's what you're feeling--

453
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
<20-4,Foreman>暗示的力量
<20-4,Foreman>Power of suggestion.

457
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,990
<20-7,Daryl>你看他的表情
<20-7,Daryl>The way you looked at him.

00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,760
<20-7,Daryl>我们总想把对方杀掉
<20-7,Daryl>and we always want to kill each other.

460
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,940
<20-9,Foreman>有什么问题么
<20-9,Foreman>Something wrong?

461
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,970
<20-10,Daryl>还好
<20-10,Daryl>Not really.

462
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,910
<20-10,Daryl>只是有点痒
<20-10,Daryl>It just feels itchy.

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,710
<20-10,Daryl>你等的就是这个吗

<20-11,Foreman>说明更有可能是淋巴瘤
<20-11,Foreman>Means lymphoma's most likely,

465
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,780
<20-11,Foreman>但这是好消息
<20-11,Foreman>but that's actually good news.

466
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,140
<20-12,Daryl>怎么会是好消息呢
<20-12,Daryl>How could that be good news?

467
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,480
<20-13,Foreman>那是能治愈的
<20-13,Foreman>Because it's treatable.

468

<20-15,Foreman>可以在闲季的时候再做放疗
<20-15,Foreman>We can get to the radiation in the off-season.

<20-16,Daryl>妈  醒醒  快醒醒
<20-16,Daryl>Wake up, ma. Wake up.

473
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,660
<20-16,Daryl>我开始发痒了  也就是说我快能打球了
<20-16,Daryl>I'm itchy. Means I can play.

474
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,890
<20-16,Daryl>你黑灯瞎火地干嘛呢
<20-16,Daryl>What are you doing in the dark?

475
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,160
<22-1,Wilson>躺着等你
<22-1,Wilson>Lying in wait.

476
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,630
<22-2,House>天呐  你的脸怎么了
<22-2,House>Jeez. What happened to your face?

477
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,770
<22-3,Wilson>很好  装无辜这招
<22-3,Wilson>Right... play innocent.

478
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,400
<22-4,House>难道不是你想要为了那个玩笑
<22-4,House>Like you weren't looking for revenge for the prank

479
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,800
<22-4,House>报复我吗
<22-4,House>that I didn't pull.

480
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,970
<22-5,Wilson>你这是因果报应  但不是我干的
<22-5,Wilson>It's karmic justice, but I didn't do it.

481
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,840
<22-6,House>睁着眼睛说瞎话  你挑起了战争
<22-6,House>Of course you realize, this means war.

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,160
<23-2,Foreman>他的肝脏发炎了
<23-2,Foreman>Liver's inflamed.

486
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,900
<23-2,Foreman>那么发痒不是脾的原因
<23-2,Foreman>So the itching wasn't caused by his spleen.

487
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,890
<23-3,Chase>也就不是淋巴瘤
<23-3,Chase>It's not lymphoma.

488
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,440
<24-1,Thirteen>你的脸怎么了

491
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,780
<24-3,Foreman>可以肯定不是淋巴瘤
<24-3,Foreman>It's definitely not lymphoma.

492
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,310
<24-3,Foreman>肝脏活体检查只显示有
<24-3,Foreman>Liver biopsy only revealed

493
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,950
<24-3,Foreman>一般炎症
<24-3,Foreman>nonspecific inflammation.

494
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,750
<24-4,House>是不是你壮着胆子
<24-4,House>Kind of like the time you took

495

497
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,840
<24-5,Foreman>我没干过
<24-5,Foreman>That never happened.

<24-6,House>是啊  还有你在高中的昵称
<24-6,House>Right, and your nickname

499
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,330
<24-6,House>从没叫过艾丽卡
<24-6,House>all the way up through high school wasn't Erica.

500
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,200
<24-7,Foreman>没有的事
<24-7,Foreman>It wasn't.

501
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,940
<24-8,Marcus>好吧  这是我编的
<24-8,Marcus>Okay, I may have made that one up,

502
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,560
<24-8,Marcus>我本来觉得我弟弟
<24-8,Marcus>with the understanding that my brother

503
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,170
<24-8,Marcus>还有些幽默感
<24-8,Marcus>still had a sense of humor

504
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,940
<24-8,Marcus>能一起开开玩笑的
<24-8,Marcus>and would figure out to play along.

505
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,440
<24-9,Foreman>多发性肌炎可以解释
<24-9,Foreman>Polymyositis would explain

<24-9,Foreman>头部  肝脏  心脏

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,380
<24-10,House>马克斯
<24-10,House>Marcus!

510
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,360
<24-10,House>给你个实践机会
<24-10,House>Chance to redeem yourself.

511
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,520
<24-10,House>对你来说我们的病人够壮吗
<24-10,House>Does our patient look strong to you?

512
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,090
<24-10,House>抱歉  艾瑞克
<24-10,House>Sorry, Eric.

<24-11,Chase>Felty syndrome?

515
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,780
<24-12,House>你自己说过发炎的是肝不是脾
<24-12,House>You said the liver was inflamed, not the spleen.

516
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,790
<24-12,House>真不敢相信这家伙是做手术的
<24-12,House>Can you believe they let this guy perform surgery?

517
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,210
<24-13,House>-你干嘛呢  -请求一个许可
<24-13,House>- What are you doing? - Requesting permission

518
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,100
<24-14,Taub>让我阐述意见的时候
<24-14,Taub>to share my idea without being belittled

519
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,400
<24-14,Taub>不在你的新助理面前丢脸
<24-14,Taub>in front of your new assistant.

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,770
<24-15,House>请求驳回  继续
<24-15,House>Permission denied. Continue.

<24-16,Taub>病人两个踝关节都有软组织损伤
<24-16,Taub>Our patient has cartilage damage in both ankles.

522

<24-16,Taub>他在每场比赛前都会注射利多卡因
<24-16,Taub>He gets lidocaine shots before every game

523
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,310
<24-16,Taub>来麻醉  减轻疼痛
<24-16,Taub>to mask the pain.

524
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,490
<24-16,Taub>队医不小心把一个针头重复用了两次
<24-16,Taub>Team doctor uses the same needle twice by accident.

<24-16,Taub>是病毒性肝炎
<24-16,Taub>Viral hepatitis.

526
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,850
<24-17,House>你觉得他是白痴吗  马克斯
<24-17,House>You think he's an idiot, Marcus?

527
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,920
<24-18,Marcus>-我不觉得他是  -好的
<24-18,Marcus>- I don't think he's an idiot. - Okay.

528
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,390
<24-19,House>去给他验血
<24-19,House>Go test his blood.

529
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,950
<24-19,House>走吧  我们该吃午餐了
<24-19,House>Come on. We have a lunch scheduled.

530
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,130
<25-1,House>你把我忽悠了
<25-1,House>So you jerked me around.

531
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,970
<25-1,House>其实你站在你弟弟的阵营
<25-1,House>Your allegiance lies with your brother.

532
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,900
<25-1,House>我终于知道了  你真厉害
<25-1,House>I get it. Admirable.

533
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,140
<25-1,House>但问题在于
<25-1,House>Here's the problem.

534
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,140
<25-1,House>我是为了你告诉我实话才雇你的
<25-1,House>I hired you to tell me the truth.

535
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,270
<25-1,House>你要是不能实话实说  你就失业了
<25-1,House>If you don't do that, you no longer have a job.

536
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,680
<25-2,Marcus>我不明白你到底想要知道什么
<25-2,Marcus>I don't know what secret you're looking to uncover,

537
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,380
<25-2,Marcus>但我弟弟是个正直的人
<25-2,Marcus>but my brother is a decent guy.

538
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,910
<25-3,House>他因为偷车被捕过
<25-3,House>He was arrested for grand theft auto.

539
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,280
<25-4,Marcus>你要失望了
<25-4,Marcus>You're gonna be disappointed.

540
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,280
<25-5,House>你说说看
<25-5,House>Try me.

541
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,390
<25-6,Marcus>我告诉你我那时和他一起了吗
<25-6,Marcus>He tell you I was with him?

542
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,650
<25-7,House>是你出的主意
<25-7,House>Was it your idea?

543
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,960
<25-8,Marcus>我们干什么都一起
<25-8,Marcus>We did everything together.

544
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,120
<25-8,Marcus>我忘了是谁的主意了
<25-8,Marcus>I don't know whose idea it was.

545
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,130
<25-8,Marcus>我那时16岁  他才14岁
<25-8,Marcus>I was 16. he was only 14.

546
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,260
<25-8,Marcus>我们这种小混混连方向盘都碰不到
<25-8,Marcus>Little punk couldn't even see over the steering wheel.

547
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,130
<25-8,Marcus>他用一把螺丝刀开得
<25-8,Marcus>He's quicker with a flathead screwdriver

548
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,530
<25-8,Marcus>比一般人用钥匙都快
<25-8,Marcus>than most people with a key.

549
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,850
<25-9,Foreman>抱歉因为无聊的医疗破事
<25-9,Foreman>Sorry to interrupt my character assassination

550
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,270
<25-9,Foreman>打断了你们对我的名誉陷害
<25-9,Foreman>with boring medical stuff,

551
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,710
<25-9,Foreman>但我们给病人抽血时
<25-9,Foreman>but when we drew the patient's blood,

552
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,510
<25-9,Foreman>血在采血管里就凝结了
<25-9,Foreman>it clotted right there in the vacutainer.

553
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,750
<25-10,House>那就是说问题不在他血液里的东西
<25-10,House>So the problem is not in his blood,

554
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,250
<25-10,House>而是他的血液本身
<25-10,House>it's the blood itself.

555
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,720
<25-11,Foreman>他每周两次在寒冷的户外锻炼
<25-11,Foreman>He's been working out in the cold doing two-a-days.

556
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,350
<25-11,Foreman>所以得了冷凝球蛋白血症
<25-11,Foreman>It's got to be cryoglobulinemia.

557
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,490
<25-12,House>我喜欢震惊的坏消息
<25-12,House>I usually love breaking bad news.

558
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,890
<25-12,House>但这个就...
<25-12,House>But in this case...

559
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,120
<25-12,House>给病人用华法林[抗凝血药]
<25-12,House>Start the patient on warfarin.

560
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,760
<25-12,House>抱歉中途打断了  你刚才说...
<25-12,House>I'm so sorry about that. You were saying...

561
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,430
<25-13,Marcus>我们只开了10分钟就被捕了
<25-13,Marcus>We drove for about ten minutes before we got caught,

562
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,330
<25-13,Marcus>就是这样
<25-13,Marcus>and that was it.

563
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,000
<25-13,Marcus>我们的妈妈来到警察局
<25-13,Marcus>When our mom came down to the station,

564
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,300
<25-13,Marcus>再把我们带回家  一路上一语不发
<25-13,Marcus>she didn't say a word the whole ride home.

565
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,840
<25-13,Marcus>她把车开上车道  熄火
<25-13,Marcus>She came up to the driveway, turned off the car.

566
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,610
<25-13,Marcus>我们沉默地坐着
<25-13,Marcus>We're sitting in there in silence.

567
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,300
<25-13,Marcus>然后她没有转身  说道
<25-13,Marcus>Then without turning around, she said,

568
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,350
<25-13,Marcus>"我会为你们祈祷的"
<25-13,Marcus>"I'll pray for you."

569
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,390
<25-13,Marcus>再后来她下了车
<25-13,Marcus>And she got out of the car.

570
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,020
<25-14,House>你们的处罚倒是不重
<25-14,House>You got off easy.

571
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,260
<25-15,Marcus>对你我来说不重
<25-15,Marcus>Easy for you, easy for me,

572
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,760
<25-15,Marcus>但对他来说不是
<25-15,Marcus>Not easy for Eric.

573
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,530
<25-15,Marcus>从那时起  他的人生目标就是
<25-15,Marcus>His life mission became to never disappoint

574
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,540
<25-15,Marcus>再也不让妈妈对他失望
<25-15,Marcus>our mother like that again,

575
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,070
<25-15,Marcus>因为他是个好人
<25-15,Marcus>because he is a good guy.

576
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,370
<25-15,Marcus>我原以为他的悼词上会有这个故事
<25-15,Marcus>I thought he would tell that story at the eulogy.

577
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,030
<25-15,Marcus>但却没有
<25-15,Marcus>But I heard he didn't give one.

578
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,080
<25-15,Marcus>你们的...
<25-15,Marcus>Your...

579
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,010
<25-16,House>你们的母亲去世了
<25-16,House>your mother's dead?

580
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,110
<25-17,Marcus>要是他告诉你  我想他是有原因的
<25-17,Marcus>If he didn't tell you, I'm sure he had a reason.

581
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,500
<25-17,Marcus>听着  你尽可以随意愚弄他
<25-17,Marcus>Look, you can mock him all you want

582
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,120
<25-17,Marcus>嘲笑他尿床什么的
<25-17,Marcus>about peeing in the bed,

583
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,760
<25-17,Marcus>但请你...
<25-17,Marcus>Please...

584
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,400
<25-17,Marcus>请你别提我们的母亲
<25-17,Marcus>Don't bring up our mother.

585
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,100
<26-1,Foreman>你的血液里含有多的离谱的一种
<26-1,Foreman>Your blood contains an abnormally high volume

586
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,340
<26-1,Foreman>叫冷凝球蛋白的蛋白质
<26-1,Foreman>of certain proteins called cryoglobulins.

587
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,070
<26-1,Foreman>它们遇冷变稠
<26-1,Foreman>They become thick when it gets cold outside.

588
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,780
<26-1,Foreman>这就像车子跑过一段时间后
<26-1,Foreman>It's like a car trying to run

589
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,510
<26-1,Foreman>汽油变成油渣一样
<26-1,Foreman>after the oil's turned to sludge.

590
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,710
<26-1,Foreman>我们认为这才是真正的元凶
<26-1,Foreman>We think that's what's been causing all your problems.

591
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,750
<26-2,Daryl>那么我只需要换点润滑油
<26-2,Daryl>So I just need a quick oil change

592
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,050
<26-2,Daryl>就又能横冲直撞了吗
<26-2,Daryl>And I'm good to go.

593
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,250
<26-3,Foreman>换润滑油可没那么容易
<26-3,Foreman>This oil change isn't so quick.

594
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,450
<26-3,Foreman>我们得给你用血液稀释剂
<26-3,Foreman>We have to put you on blood thinners

595
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,460
<26-3,Foreman>和其他的药物
<26-3,Foreman>And other medications.

596
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,920
<26-3,Foreman>一个疗程需要两到三周
<26-3,Foreman>The process will take two to three weeks.

597
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,130
<26-4,Daryl>但是以后
<26-4,Daryl>But after that,

598
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,360
<26-3,Foreman>你就能毫无障碍的打球了
<26-3,Foreman>You should be able to play without a problem.

599
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,630
<26-4,Daryl>以后就没事了
<26-4,Daryl>After that, it's not gonna matter.

600
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,230
<26-5,Glenda>医生  如果达里在周六的比赛中没有好表现
<26-5,Glenda>Doctor, if Daryl doesn't play in front of the scouts

601
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,830
<26-5,Glenda>他就不能被球探选中选秀
<26-5,Glenda>On saturday, he won't get drafted.

602
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,600
<26-5,Glenda>不能推迟到比赛后吗
<26-5,Glenda>Can't you wait until after the game?

603
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
<26-6,Foreman>如果我们推迟治疗
<26-6,Foreman>If we wait and let him play,

604
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,130
<26-6,Foreman>他很有可能
<26-6,Foreman>There's a good chance he dies

605
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,740
<26-6,Foreman>猝死在赛场上
<26-6,Foreman>Right on the field.

606
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,960
<27-1,House>上帝显灵了
<27-1,House>I had an epiphany.

607
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,430
<27-2,Wilson>那一般意味着你又要赢了
<27-2,Wilson>Usually that precedes you walking away with purpose, so...

608
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,790
<27-3,House>一字花螺丝刀
<27-3,House>Flathead screwdriver.

609
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,100
<27-4,Wilson>我应该说什么呢
<27-4,Wilson>And then I say...?

610
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,200
<27-5,House>这不是游戏
<27-5,House>It's not a game.

611
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,640
<27-5,House>这证明不是你拆掉扶杆
<27-5,House>It's proof that you didn't rig the grab rail

612
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,800
<27-5,House>让我摔倒
<27-5,House>And make me fall.

613
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,100
<27-6,Wilson>我已经有充分的证据证明
<27-6,Wilson>I already have proof of that--

614
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,900
<27-6,Wilson>那不是我干的了
<27-6,Wilson>The fact that I didn't do it.

615
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,190
<27-7,House>我不信
<27-7,House>I can't go on that.

616
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,790
<27-7,House>但是我相信
<27-7,House>But I can go on the fact

617
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,930
<27-7,House>我不得不从诺拉手里借一字换螺丝刀
<27-7,House>That I had to borrow a flathead screwdriver from Nora

618
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,200
<27-7,House>来装东西  因为我们只有个十字花的
<27-7,House>To install the thing, 'cause we only had a phillips-head.

619
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,030
<27-7,House>然后  那天晚上晚些时候去还的时候
<27-7,House>And then, of course, I returned it late that night

620
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,630
<27-7,House>一不小心
<27-7,House>In a completely successful effort

621
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,900
<27-7,House>看到她没穿胸罩的样子
<27-7,House>To see her braless...

622
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,700
<27-8,Wilson>等下  等下
<27-8,Wilson>Whoa. wait. wait a minute. wait a minute.

623
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,970
<27-9,House>这意味你没有使用螺丝刀
<27-9,House>Which means that you didn't have the tool to sabotage

624
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,300
<27-9,House>破坏扶杆
<27-9,House>The grab rail.

625
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,040
<27-10,Wilson>只穿了毛衣
<27-10,Wilson>Braless under, like, a sweater

626
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,270
<27-10,Wilson>或是其他的
<27-10,Wilson>Or, like, a--like, a--

627
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,640
<27-11,House>现在我同样有证据证明
<27-11,House>Now I also have proof

628
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,810
<27-11,House>臭鼬事件不是我的责任
<27-11,House>That i'm not responsible for the opossum,

629
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,210
<27-11,House>因为我减轻了你的责任
<27-11,House>Because I'm absolving you

630
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,680
<27-11,House>而不是增重你的负担
<27-11,House>Of responsibility instead of escalating,

631
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,860
<27-11,House>你知道的  不像我的风格
<27-11,House>Which you know is not my nature.

632
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,420
<27-12,Wilson>那么是有人闯进咱们的房子
<27-12,Wilson>So someone is breaking into our place

633
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,950
<27-12,Wilson>只是为了挑拨咱俩的关系
<27-12,Wilson>Just to screw with us?

634
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,150
<27-13,House>臭鼬
<27-13,House>The opossum...

635
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,400
<27-13,House>是为我准备的
<27-13,House>Was meant for me.

636
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,240
<28-1,Wilson>我太累了
<28-1,Wilson>I'm so tired.

637
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,410
<28-1,Wilson>以前到半夜2点都很兴奋
<28-1,Wilson>It was exciting till about 2:00 A.M.

638
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,520
<28-1,Wilson>而现在只是一种折磨
<28-1,Wilson>Now it's just torture.

639
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,900
<28-2,House>你没上过大学吗
<28-2,House>Did you even go to college?

640
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,060
<28-3,Wilson>这就是增重我的负担
<28-3,Wilson>This is the escalation, isn't it?

641
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,760
<28-3,Wilson>熬夜到天明  然后无事发生
<28-3,Wilson>Keeping me up all night, nothing happens,

642
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,560
<28-3,Wilson>然后明天又要熬夜到天明
<28-3,Wilson>Then you keep me up all night again tomorrow.

643
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,130
<28-3,Wilson>这就是你的报复
<28-3,Wilson>This is your retaliation.

644
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,820
<28-4,House>你看  这是不符合逻辑的
<28-4,House>You see, that's just illogical,

645
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,930
<28-4,House>因为我也在熬夜
<28-4,House>'cause I'm staying up too.

646
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,340
<28-5,Wilson>也许你整天打盹呢
<28-5,Wilson>Maybe you napped all day.

647
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,140
<28-6,House>我以经验主义为证证明我没有玩弄你
<28-6,House>I gave you empirical proof that I did not prank you.

648
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,610
<28-7,Wilson>不  你没有
<28-7,Wilson>No. No, you did not.

649
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,950
<28-7,Wilson>你创造了一种经验主义并以它为证
<28-7,Wilson>You created empirical proof that I didn't prank you,

650
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,080
<28-7,Wilson>鼓吹一种概念证明你没有玩弄我
<28-7,Wilson>Selling me on the notion that you didn't prank me.

651
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,310
<28-7,Wilson>有可能是自我玩弄
<28-7,Wilson>Maybe you self-pranked.

652
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,050
<28-8,House>我从不自我玩弄
<28-8,House>I don't master-prank.

653
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,150
<28-9,Wilson>那个削去面颊的事是真的吗
<28-9,Wilson>Is that cut on your cheek even real?

654
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,980
<28-10,House>看见了吗  这正是我们的敌人所希望的
<28-10,House>See, this is exactly what our nemesis wants--

655
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,800
<28-10,House>各个击破
<28-10,House>Divide and conquer.

656
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,150
<28-10,House>-你还没看出来吗  -好吧
<28-10,House>- Can't you see that? - Okay.

657
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,920
<28-11,Wilson>我要去睡觉了
<28-11,Wilson>I'm going to bed.

658
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,340
<28-12,House>我告诉你  要是你现在去睡觉
<28-12,House>I'm telling you, if you sleep now,

659
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,780
<28-12,House>醒来你的枕边就会放着个死马头
<28-12,House>You're gonna wake up next to severed horse heads.

660
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
<28-12,House>或者更糟  无头马
<28-12,House>Or worse, the rest of it.

661
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,400
<28-12,House>豪斯
<28-12,House>House!

662
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,810
<28-13,Wilson>平板电视
<28-13,Wilson>The flat screen!

663
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,530
<28-14,Wilson>你绝对不会牺牲平板电视的
<28-14,Wilson>You would never sacrifice the flat screen.

664
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,350
<28-15,House>这小子太赞了
<28-15,House>Oh, this guy is good.

665
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,570
<29-1,Cuddy>这样做有理由吗
<29-1,Cuddy>is there a reason for this?

666
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,890
<29-1,Cuddy>当然有充分理由
<29-1,Cuddy>there is a reason

667
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,170
<29-2,House>解释这一切  我的朋友们
<29-2,House>For everything, mes amis.

668
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,470
<29-2,House>我不得不说我们中间隐藏着
<29-2,House>I am troubled to report that we have

669
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,180
<29-2,House>一个罪犯
<29-2,House>A criminal in our midst.

670
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,730
<29-3,Taub>犯什么罪了
<29-3,Taub>Guilty of what exactly?

671
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,590
<29-4,Wilson>昨晚  防火喷头把我们的房子给淹了
<29-4,Wilson>Last night, the fire sprinklers flooded our apartment.

672
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,520
<29-4,Wilson>在那之前
<29-4,Wilson>And before that,

673
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,510
<29-4,Wilson>我在我的浴缸里发现了一只臭鼬
<29-4,Wilson>I found an opossum in my bathtub.

674
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,820
<29-5,House>你们每个人都有作案动机
<29-5,House>You each had motive.

675
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,700
<29-5,House>都有作案机会
<29-5,House>You each had opportunity.

676
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,520
<29-6,Cuddy>这就是你说的紧急事件吗
<29-6,Cuddy>This is the emergency you paged me about?

677
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,750
<29-7,House>别激动
<29-7,House>Not so fast,

678
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,320
<29-7,House>卡迪小姐
<29-7,House>Mademoiselle Cuddy.

679
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,610
<29-7,House>在你们交代清楚
<29-7,House>No one leaves here

680
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,820
<29-7,House>昨晚的去向之前
<29-7,House>Until they can account for their whereabouts

681
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
<29-7,House>谁也不准离开
<29-7,House>The evening last.

682
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,600
<29-8,Cuddy>再见
<29-8,Cuddy>Bye.

683
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,090
<29-9,House>好吧
<29-9,House>okay, no one

684
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,200
<29-9,House>我雇佣的人
<29-9,House>Who is employed by me leaves here

685
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,790
<29-9,House>在交代清楚昨晚的去向前不准离开
<29-9,House>Until they account for their whereabouts the evening last.

686
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,520
<29-9,House>从你开始怎么样  奇斯医师
<29-9,House>What about you, professor Chase?

687
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,340
<29-10,Chase>为什么是我
<29-10,Chase>Why would I?

688
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,990
<29-11,House>因为你一直认为我是
<29-11,House>Because you hold me responsible for

689
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,070
<29-11,House>导致你婚姻破裂的人
<29-11,House>Breaking up your marriage.

690
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,870
<29-12,Chase>我和十三一直在这
<29-12,Chase>I was here all night with thirteen,

691
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,180
<29-12,Chase>观察病人静脉注射血液稀释剂
<29-12,Chase>Monitoring our patient's I.V. Blood thinners.

692
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,710
<29-13,House>你们谁能证明
<29-13,House>Can either of you prove that?

693
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,630
<29-14,Thirteen>病人还活着并且有病情在好转
<29-14,Thirteen>The patient's alive and improving.

694
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
<29-14,Thirteen>这还不够吗
<29-14,Thirteen>Is that proof enough?

695
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,700
<29-15,House>暂时可以  你呢  陶博上校
<29-15,House>For now. What about you, colonel Taub?

696
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,370
<29-16,Taub>我和我太太出去吃晚饭了
<29-16,Taub>I was out to dinner with my wife.

697
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,100
<29-16,Taub>真的吗
<29-16,Taub>Really?

698
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,610
<29-17,House>是你太太
<29-17,House>Your wife.

699
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,290
<29-18,Taub>是的  真的
<29-18,Taub>Yes, really.

700
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,610
<29-19,House>很好
<29-19,House>Good enough.

701
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,360
<29-19,House>因为我一直打压你
<29-19,House>'cause I had you pegged all along.

702
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,640
<29-19,House>你当然最有嫌疑
<29-19,House>You certainly had all the motive in the world.

703
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,270
<29-20,Foreman>首先
<29-20,Foreman>First of all,

704
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,650
<29-20,Foreman>我不感兴趣
<29-20,Foreman>I'm not interested.

705
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,470
<29-20,Foreman>其次  我不知道你们住在 哪
<29-20,Foreman>Second, I don't even know where you guys live.

706
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,280
<29-21,House>昨天我刚证明你是个骗子
<29-21,House>Yesterday I confirmed that you are a liar.

707
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,710
<29-22,Foreman>你在说什么
<29-22,Foreman>What are you talking about?

708
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,750
<29-23,House>至少是省略细节的撒谎者
<29-23,House>Well, at least a liar by omission.

709
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,680
<29-23,House>豪斯
<29-23,House>House!

710
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,420
<29-24,Marcus>别说
<29-24,Marcus>Don't.

711
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,570
<29-25,House>听好了  同学们
<29-25,House>Get this, class.

712
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,640
<29-25,House>福曼的妈妈去世了
<29-25,House>Foreman's mom died.

713
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,070
<29-25,House>他有告诉过你们吗
<29-25,House>He ever tell any of you?

714
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,720
<29-25,House>豪斯
<29-25,House>House,

715
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,100
<29-26,Wilson>我觉得你跑题了
<29-26,Wilson>I think you're getting off topic here.

716
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,370
<29-27,Thirteen>他说真的吗
<29-27,Thirteen>Is he serious?

717
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,830
<29-27,Thirteen>你的妈妈去世了吗
<29-27,Thirteen>Did your mom pass away?

718
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,680
<29-28,Foreman>三个月之前
<29-28,Foreman>About three months ago.

719
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,550
<29-29,Thirteen>我真的很抱歉
<29-29,Thirteen>I'm so sorry.

720
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,200
<29-30,Taub>你为什么不告诉我们呢
<29-30,Taub>Why didn't you tell anybody?

721
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,510
<29-31,House>更糟糕的是
<29-31,House>And to top it off,

722
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,440
<29-31,House>你拒绝在葬礼上为她美言几句
<29-31,House>You refused to say anything nice about her at the funeral.

723
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,140
<29-32,Foreman>我不说是因为那跟别人无关
<29-32,Foreman>I didn't talk because it isn't anyone's business.

724
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,040
<29-32,Foreman>别说了
<29-32,Foreman>Stop.

725
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,950
<29-33,Marcus>你不需要向这个人解释什么
<29-33,Marcus>You don't have to explain yourself to this guy.

726
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,680
<29-34,House>你想打我  对吧
<29-34,House>You want to hit me, don't you?

727
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,190
<29-35,Foreman>马克斯  住手
<29-35,Foreman>Marcus, don't.

728
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,000
<29-36,Marcus>我不干了
<29-36,Marcus>I quit.

729
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,280
<29-37,Thirteen>你应该去阻止他  他需要这份工作
<29-37,Thirteen>You should stop him. He needs this job.

730
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,510
<29-38,Foreman>我们的病人需要再来一次静脉注射
<29-38,Foreman>Our patient needs a fresh I.V.

731
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,440
<30-1,Daryl>我不需要两个或是三个星期
<30-1,Daryl>I don't need two or three weeks.

732
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,950
<30-1,Daryl>看到了吗  我的颜色恢复了
<30-1,Daryl>See? Got my color back.

733
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,820
<30-2,Foreman>只能说明你在恢复
<30-2,Foreman>That means you're getting better.

734
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,340
<30-2,Foreman>-但不能说明  -说明我好了
<30-2,Foreman>- But it doesn't mean - It means I am better.

735
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,420
<30-3,Daryl>我的教练让球队医生来看过了
<30-3,Daryl>My coach had the team doctor come by.

736
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,860
<30-3,Daryl>他认为我可以打球了
<30-3,Daryl>He cleared me to play.

737
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,090
<30-4,Foreman>你的球队医生有没有意识到你在使用血液化稠剂呢
<30-4,Foreman>Did your team doctor realize you're on blood thinners?

738
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
<30-5,Daryl>我现在没有用了
<30-5,Daryl>I'm off them now.

739
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,130
<30-6,Foreman>你还是很虚弱
<30-6,Foreman>You're still sick.

740
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,940
<30-6,Foreman>你还不能停止治疗
<30-6,Foreman>You're not ready to go off your meds.

741
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,240
<30-7,Glenda>达里  听他的  不值得冒险
<30-7,Glenda>Daryl, listen to him. It is not worth the risk.

742
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,470
<30-8,Daryl>我星期天会回来的  妈妈
<30-8,Daryl>I'll come back on Sunday, mom.

743
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,010
<30-8,Daryl>到那时只要病情需要  你们随便开药
<30-8,Daryl>You guys can give me all the meds I need then.

744
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,800
<30-9,Foreman>这样的治疗方式不合适
<30-9,Foreman>The treatment doesn't work that way.

745
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,580
<30-10,Glenda>请跟着他吧
<30-10,Glenda>Please go with him.

746
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,320
<31-1,House>抗生素不起作用
<31-1,House>Antibiotics aren't working.

747
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,930
<31-1,House>我们准备给你换不同的
<31-1,House>We're gonna switch you to different ones,

748
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,230
<31-1,House>不过你将失去你的指头了
<31-1,House>But you're gonna lose your toe.

749
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,280
<31-2,Jim>太好了  战士
<31-2,Jim>Outstanding, soldier.

750
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,530
<31-3,House>一般来说
<31-3,House>As a general rule,

751
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,280
<31-3,House>在你庆贺之前  先做一点研究
<31-3,House>Before you celebrate, do a little research.

752
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,860
<31-3,House>军队医疗检测协会
<31-3,House>The army's medical evaluation board

753
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,450
<31-3,House>绝对会容许
<31-3,House>Is perfectly fine

754
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,290
<31-3,House>一个只有九个脚趾的步兵通过
<31-3,House>With nine-toed infantrymen,

755
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,230
<31-3,House>只要他们还能走路和跑步
<31-3,House>As long as they can walk and run.

756
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,930
<31-4,Jim>所以我丢了一个指头却一无所获
<31-4,Jim>So I lost a toe for nothing?

757
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,820
<31-5,Hose>恐怕是这样
<31-5,Hose>Afraid so.

758
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,410
<31-5,Hose>除非你想让我继续给你使用旧的抗生素
<31-5,Hose>Unless you want me to keep you on the old antibiotics,

759
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,980
<31-5,Hose>让感染范围扩大
<31-5,Hose>Let the infection spread,

760
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,030
<31-5,Hose>这样我们就不止切除一个指头了
<31-5,Hose>And we could amputate more than just a toe.

761
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,410
<32-1,Foreman>为什么你为了这个甘愿冒生命危险
<32-1,Foreman>Why are you risking your life for this?

762
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,050
<32-1,Foreman>你妈妈并不想你去
<32-1,Foreman>Your mom doesn't want you to.

763
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,100
<32-2,Daryl>我的妈妈为我牺牲了一切
<32-2,Daryl>My mom sacrificed everything for me.

764
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,340
<32-2,Daryl>她告诉我不要来
<32-2,Daryl>Her telling me not to come here

765
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,780
<32-2,Daryl>恰恰是另一个证明
<32-2,Daryl>is just another example of that.

766
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,920
<32-2,Daryl>如果我做得好  我就能照顾
<32-2,Daryl>I do good out there, I could take care of her

767
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,210
<32-2,Daryl>她的余生
<32-2,Daryl>for the rest of her life.

768
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,850
<32-2,Daryl>如果我不为她做出牺牲  我算什么
<32-2,Daryl>Who am I if I don't sacrifice for her?

769
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,590
<32-2,Daryl>这才是一家人
<32-2,Daryl>That's family.

770
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,000
<32-3,Foreman>你还好吧
<32-3,Foreman>You okay?

771
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,210
<32-4,Daryl>所有东西都很模糊
<32-4,Daryl>Everything's blurry.

772
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
<32-4,Daryl>我什么都看不见了
<32-4,Daryl>I can't see.

773
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,930
<32-4,Daryl>带我回医院吧
<32-4,Daryl>Take me back to the hospital.

774
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,460
<33-1,Taub>失明说明我们对他估计错误
<33-1,Taub>The blindness means we were wrong about his--

775
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,830
<33-2,Foreman>事实上  我有责任
<33-2,Foreman>Actually, I'm responsible for that.

776
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,370
<33-2,Foreman>偷偷在他的水瓶里加上硝酸盐
<33-2,Foreman>Spiked his water bottle with nitrates,

777
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,370
<33-2,Foreman>使他的血压下降
<33-2,Foreman>dropped his blood pressure,

778
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,860
<33-2,Foreman>夺走了他脑部的多氧血液
<33-2,Foreman>robbed oxygen-rich blood from his brain,

779
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,070
<33-2,Foreman>让他失明
<33-2,Foreman>Making him blind.

780
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,040
<33-2,Foreman>一个暂时失明的病人
<33-2,Foreman>Figured a temporarily blind patient

781
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,550
<33-2,Foreman>比一个永久性死亡的病人好处理
<33-2,Foreman>is better than a permanently dead one.

782
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,180
<33-2,Foreman>我把他送回医院的时候
<33-2,Foreman>Vision was already coming back

783
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,640
<33-2,Foreman>他的视力已经恢复了
<33-2,Foreman>by the time I dropped him off at the hospital.

784
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,410
<33-3,House>干得好
<33-3,House>Well played.

785
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,250
<33-3,House>真希望你的医疗小把戏能
<33-3,House>If only we could combine your medical chicanery

786
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,200
<33-3,House>和你兄弟给我取摩卡咖啡的本领结合起来
<33-3,House>with your brother's ability to fetch me mochas,

787
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
<33-3,House>这样你就是个完美的福曼了
<33-3,House>You'd be the perfect foreman.

788
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,680
<33-3,House>你在哪里
<33-3,House>Where are you?

789
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,380
<33-4,Foreman>我在忙
<33-4,Foreman>I'm busy.

790
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,460
<33-5,Taub>很好  这样一来我们就没有新症状
<33-5,Taub>Great. So we don't have a new symptom.

791
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,880
<33-6,Chase>也就是说我们必须让他继续使用血液化稠剂
<33-6,Chase>Means we should just stick him back on his blood thinners,

792
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,240
<33-6,Chase>这样他过几周就能康复了
<33-6,Chase>and he should be okay to leave in a couple weeks.

793
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,340
<33-5,Taub>事实上  确实出现了一个新症状
<33-5,Taub>Actually, we do have a new symptom.

794
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,320
<33-7,House>你们没人看他的重新接纳图吗
<33-7,House>Any of you take a look at his readmittance chart?

795
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
<33-7,House>在他刚来的时候
<33-7,House>Between the time he checked in

796
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,300
<33-7,House>和他再一次报道的时候
<33-7,House>and the time he rechecked in,

797
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,760
<33-7,House>我们的病人瘦了一磅
<33-7,House>Our patient lost a single pound.

798
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,580
<33-7,House>一个那样的病人通常会减十磅
<33-7,House>Patient like that would usually shed over ten pounds.

799
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,360
<33-8,Taub>最直接的答案应该是类固醇
<33-8,Taub>The obvious answer would be steroids,

800
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,400
<33-8,Taub>但是我们已经排除了
<33-8,Taub>But since we've already ruled them out...

801
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,330
<33-9,Chase>所以他没有注射过
<33-9,Chase>So he's not injecting.

802
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,920
<33-9,Chase>但是有可能自然获得
<33-9,Chase>But he could be getting them naturally--

803
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,020
<33-9,Chase>类肿瘤性症状
<33-9,Chase>Paraneoplastic syndrome.

804
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,170
<33-9,Chase>身体产生抗生素  与癌抗衡
<33-9,Chase>The body produces antibodies, which battle cancer,

805
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,050
<33-9,Chase>看起来也像荷尔蒙增长
<33-9,Chase>which could also act like growth hormone.

806
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,610
<33-10,House>我们已经排除了淋巴瘤
<33-10,House>We've eliminated lymphoma.

807
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,040
<33-10,House>有什么其他癌类似于荷尔蒙增长呢
<33-10,House>What other cancers mimic growth hormone?

808
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,380
<33-11,Taub>肺  胰腺  肾脏  胸部
<33-11,Taub>Lung, pancreatic, renal, breast--

809
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,730
<33-12,House>这是反问句  我不在意
<33-12,House>It was a rhetorical question. I don't really care.

810
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,840
<33-12,House>把每个部分都检查一遍
<33-12,House>Go test him for all of them.

811
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,000
<34-1,Marcus>你来这干什么
<34-1,Marcus>What are you doing here?

812
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,150
<34-2,Foreman>你需要一份工作
<34-2,Foreman>You need a job.

813
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,580
<34-2,Foreman>也许我可以再跟豪斯谈谈
<34-2,Foreman>Maybe I can talk to House,

814
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,520
<34-2,Foreman>看是否能要回你的工作
<34-2,Foreman>see if I can get your job back.

815
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,130
<34-3,Marcus>一旦他知道你跟我和好了
<34-3,Marcus>Soon as he knows you're okay with me being there,

816
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,030
<34-3,Marcus>他就不会再让我回去了
<34-3,Marcus>he won't want me back.

817
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,580
<34-4,Foreman>也许我能帮你找到别的工作
<34-4,Foreman>Maybe I can help you figure out something else.

818
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,220
<34-5,Marcus>我保证
<34-5,Marcus>I promise...

819
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,130
<34-5,Marcus>我不会再让你失望了
<34-5,Marcus>I won't let you down.

820
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,380
<34-5,Marcus>别说这个
<34-5,Marcus>Don't do that.

821
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,760
<34-6,Foreman>我们就
<34-6,Foreman>Let's just...

822
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,160
<34-6,Foreman>顺其自然
<34-6,Foreman>See how it goes.

823
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,160
<34-6,Foreman>他们有规定你
<34-6,Foreman>So, uh, do they mandate you

824
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,870
<34-6,Foreman>必须住在这个过渡教习所
<34-6,Foreman>to stay here at the halfway house?

825
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,260
<34-6,Foreman>还是你可以跟家里人一起住呢
<34-6,Foreman>Or can you come stay with family?

826
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,950
<35-1,House>是福曼
<35-1,House>It's Foreman.

827
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,570
<35-2,Wilson>既然马克斯走了  应该停止了
<35-2,Wilson>Well, it should stop now that marcus left.

828
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,090
<35-3,House>这才是主要的
<35-3,House>That's the whole point.

829
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,480
<35-4,Lucas>对不起  是我的腿绊倒你了吗
<35-4,Lucas>Oh, I'm sorry. Was my leg sticking out?

830
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,090
<35-4,Lucas>最近我有点心烦
<35-4,Lucas>I'm so distracted lately, trying to think of something funnier

831
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,520
<35-4,Lucas>在想有什么比半夜爆消防栓更有趣
<35-4,Lucas>than fire sprinklers Going off in the middle of the night.

832
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,220
<35-4,Lucas>有什么提议吗
<35-4,Lucas>Any ideas?

833
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,690
<35-5,Lucas>不要激动啊老虎  我可知道你住在哪里
<35-5,Lucas>Whoa, easy there, tiger. I know where you live.

834
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,710
<35-5,Lucas>知道我怎么知道的吗
<35-5,Lucas>You know how I know?

835
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,700
<35-5,Lucas>因为那是我女朋友和我
<35-5,Lucas>'cause my girlfriend and I--

836
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,830
<35-5,Lucas>原来打算买的那个公寓
<35-5,Lucas>We tried to buy that very same condo.

837
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,670
<35-6,House>为什么要把我算进去呢
<35-6,House>Why don't you leave me out of this?

838
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,140
<35-6,House>房子是威尔森买的
<35-6,House>Wilson was the one who bought the place.

839
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,040
<35-7,Lucas>不过你住在那里
<35-7,Lucas>And you're living there.

840
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,060
<35-7,Lucas>你
<35-7,Lucas>You...

841
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,360
<35-7,Lucas>也要承担一样的责任
<35-7,Lucas>deserve to suffer equally.

842
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,020
<35-8,House>因为刚才你绊倒了我所以我承担了更多
<35-8,House>Actually, I suffered more now that you just tripped me.

843
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,380
<35-10,Lucas>他的抵消了
<35-10,Lucas>His suffering will equal out,

844
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,920
<35-10,Lucas>因为他很自责
<35-10,Lucas>'cause he actually feels remorse.

845
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,220
<35-11,House>你为什么不直接说
<35-11,House>Why would you out yourself?

846
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,920
<35-11,House>你根本想不到怎么去报复
<35-11,House>You can't even imagine the retribution.

847
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,590
<35-12,Lucas>不会再有了
<35-12,Lucas>Oh, there won't be any.

848
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,570
<35-12,Lucas>我已经停止了一切报复行动
<35-12,Lucas>I am ceasing all offensive operations.

849
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,930
<35-12,Lucas>我已经表明了我的想法  确立了优势
<35-12,Lucas>I have both made my point and established my superiority.

850
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,960
<35-12,Lucas>一旦你开始计划报复行动
<35-12,Lucas>And if you even get to the planning stages of retaliation,

851
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,820
<35-12,Lucas>我会告诉卡迪是你们两抢走了她梦想的房子
<35-12,Lucas>I will tell Cuddy that she lost her dream place to you two.

852
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,290
<35-12,Lucas>她很奇怪  一直认为你们是她的朋友
<35-12,Lucas>See, she's under this odd impression that you guys are her friends.

853
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,580
<36-1,Chase>不是癌症
<36-1,Chase>There's no cancer.

854
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,260
<36-1,Chase>我们从头到脚的检查了一遍
<36-1,Chase>We scanned him head to toe.

855
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,010
<36-1,Chase>我们还做了白血病的检查
<36-1,Chase>We checked blood smears for leukemia.

856
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,580
<36-1,Chase>还有胸部超声波看他有没有乳腺癌
<36-1,Chase>We even ultrasounded his chest looking for breast cancer.

857
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,450
<36-2,House>可能我错了  关于他的体重下降
<36-2,House>Maybe I was wrong about the weight loss.

858
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,980
<36-3,Taub>你没有错  我们发现他的尿液袋里面有血
<36-3,Taub>You weren't wrong-- we found blood in his catheter bag.

859
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,240
<36-3,Taub>他的肾脏在衰竭
<36-3,Taub>His kidneys are failing.

860
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,560
<36-4,Thirteen>所以一定是癌症
<36-4,Thirteen>so it has to be cancer.

861
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,690
<36-4,Thirteen>只有肿瘤伴随综合症
<36-4,Thirteen>Paraneoplastic syndrome is the only thing

862
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,790
<36-4,Thirteen>会导致肾脏  心脏和肝的问题  还有暴怒
<36-4,Thirteen>that can link kidney, heart, and liver-- even the rage.

863
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,020
<36-5,Foreman>为什么我们找不到它呢
<36-5,Foreman>Why can't we find it?

864
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,040
<36-5,Foreman>他的体内到处都检查过了
<36-5,Foreman>We've looked everywhere inside this guy.

865
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,060
<36-6,House>如果不是在体内呢
<36-6,House>What if it's not inside?

866
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,680
<37-1,House>你知道为什么你那么黑吗
<37-1,House>You know why you're black?

867
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
<37-2,Daryl>因为上帝爱我比爱你多吧
<37-2,Daryl>'cause god loves me more than he loves you?

868
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,000
<37-3,House>我想说的是黑色素
<37-3,House>Hmm. What I was going for was melanin.

869
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,630
<37-3,House>你有太多黑色素了
<37-3,House>You got lots of it.

870
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,270
<37-3,House>使得你的皮肤很黑
<37-3,House>It makes your skin dark,

871
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,340
<37-3,House>保护你不受到有害紫外线的伤害
<37-3,House>protects you from the sun's harmful U.V. Rays.

872
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,190
<37-4,Daryl>你在干吗
<37-4,Daryl>What are you doing?

873
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:15,080
<37-5,House>不幸的是它也妨碍了那些有医疗证书的人
<37-5,House>Unfortunately, it also prevents even those with advanced medical degrees

874
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,460
<37-5,House>考虑恶性黑色素瘤的可能性
<37-5,House>from considering melanoma as a diagnosis.

875
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,500
<37-5,House>另一只手
<37-5,House>Other hand.

876
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,990
<37-5,House>黑人得皮肤癌的机率很小
<37-5,House>On the rare occasion that black people do get skin cancer,

877
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,850
<37-5,House>一般只会在白色皮肤的位置上
<37-5,House>they usually get it on the white parts--

878
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,070
<37-5,House>比如手掌和脚底
<37-5,House>Palms and soles of the feet.

879
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,930
<37-5,House>但因为打橄榄球  你的手脚磨损的很严重
<37-5,House>But your hands and feet are so smashed up from football,

880
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,110
<37-5,House>我的手下把你皮肤上的所有伤痕都当作淤青
<37-5,House>My team are likely to have written off any skin blemish as a bruise.

881
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,010
<37-5,House>但是目前我知道的
<37-5,House>But now that I know that melanoma

882
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,030
<37-5,House>只有黑素瘤符合一切症状
<37-5,House>Is the only thing that fits...

883
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,960
<37-5,House>过来看下这个  妈妈
<37-5,House>Come take a look at this, mom.

884
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,420
<37-5,House>豹爪上的一根小刺
<37-5,House>There's the thorn in the panther's paw--

885
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,860
<36-4,Thirteen>肿瘤伴随综合症
<36-4,Thirteen>Paraneoplastic syndrome.

886
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,050
<37-5,House>你的身体在集合抗体对抗肿瘤
<37-5,House>Your body forms antibodies to fight the tumor.

887
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,930
<37-5,House>那些微小的蛋白质
<37-5,House>Those tiny little proteins

888
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,820
<37-5,House>游离在你的血液里从而造成巨大的破坏
<37-5,House>travel through your blood and wreak havoc.

889
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,860
<37-5,House>我们移走这个痣癌
<37-5,House>We remove the cancerous mole,

890
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,170
<37-5,House>你就会好了
<37-5,House>everything should be fine.

891
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,900
<37-5,House>我会让奇斯医生安排手术
<37-5,House>I'll tell Dr. Chase to schedule the surgery.

892
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,960
<37-6,Daryl>为什么要呢
<37-6,Daryl>Why bother?

893
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,640
<37-6,Daryl>我已经失去机会了
<37-6,Daryl>I missed my shot.

894
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,560
<37-6,Daryl>我的人生将会怎样呢
<37-6,Daryl>What kind of life am I gonna lead now?

895
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,360
<37-7,House>你很认真很认真地学习了吗
<37-7,House>Did you study really, really hard?

896
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,750
<37-7,House>那你会和其他那些一起毕业的家伙们
<37-7,House>Then the same crappy life that the rest of the guys

897
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,750
<37-7,House>过着一样的废柴生活
<37-7,House>You'll be graduating with are gonna lead...

898
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,040
<37-7,House>除去学生贷款
<37-7,House>minus the student loans.

899
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,980
<38-1,Lucas>你好了吗
<38-1,Lucas>Hey. You ready?

900
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,670
<38-2,Cuddy>就快了
<38-2,Cuddy>Almost.

901
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,890
<38-2,Cuddy>恩  好了
<38-2,Cuddy>And...done.

902
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,070
<38-2,Cuddy>我听说豪斯和威尔森被人捉弄了
<38-2,Cuddy>I heard house and Wilson are getting pranked by someone.

903
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,120
<38-2,Cuddy>你完全不知情是吧
<38-2,Cuddy>You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

904
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,880
<38-3,Lucas>没有
<38-3,Lucas>No.

905
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,970
<38-4,Cuddy>为什么我要相信你呢
<38-4,Cuddy>Why should I believe you?

906
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,170
<38-5,Lucas>你说过我有张让人信任的脸
<38-5,Lucas>You said I had a trusting face.

907
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,380
<38-5,Lucas>我还是不明白
<38-5,Lucas>I still don't understand

908
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,210
<38-5,Lucas>为什么你不让我报复
<38-5,Lucas>why you wouldn't let me retaliate, though.

909
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,600
<38-5,Lucas>他们偷了你的梦想
<38-5,Lucas>They stole your dream.

910
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,390
<38-6,Cuddy>太夸张了  那只是个公寓
<38-6,Cuddy>Well, that's overstating it. It's just a condo.

911
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,640
<38-7,Lucas>不是因为你对整弄豪斯有愧疚感
<38-7,Lucas>It's not because you feel guilty about hurting House

912
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,350
<38-7,Lucas>也不是对和我在一起有愧疚感吧
<38-7,Lucas>or guilty for being with me?

913
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,590
<38-8,Cuddy>我们可以买另外一个
<38-8,Cuddy>We'll buy another one.

914
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,960
<38-8,Cuddy>我只是觉得没必要为这个去争吵
<38-8,Cuddy>I just don't see the need to make a war out of it.

915
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,590
<38-9,Lucas>恩  这很合理
<38-9,Lucas>Well, I think you're rationalizing,

916
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,190
<38-9,Lucas>任何一个没我有自信的男人
<38-9,Lucas>Which a less confident man than myself

917
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,530
<38-9,Lucas>都可能会把它当作事后教育
<38-9,Lucas>might take as a sign that you're second-guessing.

918
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,450
<38-9,Lucas>恩  忘了最后一句
<38-9,Lucas>Okay, you know what? Forget that last part.

919
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,620
<39-1,Wilson>我听说福曼和他哥哥
<39-1,Wilson>I heard foreman and his brother

920
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,670
<39-1,Wilson>和好了
<39-1,Wilson>are trying to work things out.

921
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,670
<39-2,House>太好了
<39-2,House>That's nice for them.

922
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,750
<39-3,Wilson>你能这样才是太好了
<39-3,Wilson>It's nice of you.

923
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,800
<39-3,Wilson>你没有挑动马克斯
<39-3,Wilson>You didn't provoke Marcus to quit

924
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,080
<39-3,Wilson>所以恶作剧将停止
<39-3,Wilson>So the pranks would stop.

925
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,250
<39-3,Wilson>你成了他们的联合公敌
<39-3,Wilson>You were becoming the common enemy they could bond over.

926
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,220
<39-3,Wilson>你就像是那些友善的玩偶的恶毒主人
<39-3,Wilson>You are the diabolical, yet benevolent puppet master.

927
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,370
<39-4,House>我诱导马克斯辞职
<39-4,House>I provoked Marcus to quit

928
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,040
<39-4,House>是因为他已经没用
<39-4,House>because he was no longer useful to me.

929
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,170
<39-4,House>我雇他弄点消息
<39-4,House>I hired him to get information.

930
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,730
<39-4,House>他给了我要的消息
<39-4,House>I got information. Uh-huh.

931
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,390
<39-5,Wilson>那我们怎么报复卢卡斯呢
<39-5,Wilson>And how are we gonna get back at Lucas?

932
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,120
<39-6,House>没有报复
<39-6,House>We're not.

933
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,790
<39-7,Wilson>我赢了
<39-7,Wilson>I win.
