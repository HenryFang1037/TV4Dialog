448
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,790
<12-17,House >但是你这种不合时宜的愧疚感影响了你的思维
<12-17,House >But your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,550
<13-2,Adams >他要找个避风的地方
<13-2,Adams >He'd want to get out of the wind.

<13-2,Adams >What's somewhere he could see the kids arrive?

469
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,630
<13-3,Chase >他在这里

472
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,090
<13-4,Chase >这么冷的环境下还有一线生机
<13-4,Chase >Not dead until he's warm and dead.

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,430
<14-1,House >把他送去重症监护室
<14-1,House >Get him to the ICU.

474
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,520
<14-1,House >给他接上体外循环
<14-1,House >Start him on extracorporeal circulation.

475
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,820
<14-2,Adams >那样他的体温回升得太快
<14-2,Adams >That'll raise his temperature too quickly,

476
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,830
<14-2,Adams >会导致酸中毒
<14-2,Adams >It'll cause acidosis.

477
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,560
<14-3,House >我们有能力处理他的代谢障碍
<14-3,House >We can deal with his metabolism crashing,

478
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,070
<14-3,House >但是如果动作太慢就无法恢复脑部损伤了
<14-3,House >we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.

479
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,550
<14-4,Chase >不管怎么样
<14-4,Chase >Either way,

480
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,260
<14-4,Chase >如果不把他的体温升到35摄氏度
<14-4,Chase >we don't get his temperature above 95,

481
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,980
<14-4,Chase >就没什么戏了
<14-4,Chase >it's not going to matter.

482
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,580
<14-5,Adams >多通道加温灌洗更加安全
<14-5,Adams >Multiple warm lavage is safer.

483
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,200
<14-6,Foreman >按豪斯说的做
<14-6,Foreman >Do what House says.

484
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,360
<15-1,Natalie >他没有心跳也没有呼吸
<15-1,Natalie >He has no heartbeat, and he's not breathing.

485
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,910
<15-1,Natalie >这还不算死亡吗
<15-1,Natalie >How can he not be dead?

486
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,190
<15-2,Foreman >人体在低温时会自动降低代谢速度
<15-2,Foreman >The body slows down when it cools,

487
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,900
<15-2,Foreman >但是并不会完全停止
<15-2,Foreman >but it doesn't fully stop.

488
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,660
<15-2,Foreman >我们从体外给他的血液加温
<15-2,Foreman >We're warming his blood outside of his body,

489
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,790
<15-2,Foreman >然后输回体内
<15-2,Foreman >then putting it back.

490
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,070
<15-2,Foreman >可以把他的体温升到正常
<15-2,Foreman >It'll raise his temperature enough

491
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,440
<15-2,Foreman >然后他的心脏就会自然开始跳动
<15-2,Foreman >that his heart should naturally start.

492
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,650
<15-2,Foreman >然后我们可以用电击使其回归到正常节律
<15-2,Foreman >Then we can shock it back into rhythm.

493
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,130
<15-3,Natalie >如果心脏不跳呢
<15-3,Natalie >And if it doesn't start?

494
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,840
<15-4,Foreman >那我们也无能为力了
<15-4,Foreman >Then there's nothing we can do.

495
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,850
<15-5,Adams >你觉得他有可能知道自己在干什么吗
<15-5,Adams >You think it's possible he knew what he was doing?

496
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,000
<15-5,Adams >比如说他是否知道自己拖累了妻子
<15-5,Adams >Like some part of him gets what he's putting his wife through,

497
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,910
<15-5,Adams >-所以他试图  -自杀吗
<15-5,Adams >- So he tried to...  - Kill himself?

498
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,020
<15-6,Chase >换了我我就一死了之
<15-6,Chase >It's what I'd do if I were him.

499
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,930
<15-6,Chase >至少我希望我能死成
<15-6,Chase >At least I wish I would.

500
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,780
<15-6,Chase >我想说的是逃避
<15-6,Chase >I meant run away.

501
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,800
<15-6,Chase >你觉得如果对爱你的人来说
<15-6,Chase >You think you should kill yourself

502
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,820
<15-7,Chase >你变成了种负担  你就会自寻短见吗
<15-7,Chase >if you become a burden to the people who love you?

503
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,890
<15-7,Chase >如果我真心喜欢对方  那么...
<15-7,Chase >If you really love them back, then...

504
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,930
<15-7,Chase >我会的
<15-7,Chase >Yes.

505
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,310
<15-8,Adams>你真悲观
<15-8,Adams>That's really dark.

506
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,830
<15-9,Chase >是你太天真
<15-9,Chase >It's not naive.

507
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,920
<15-10,Adams >我相信换了别人
<15-10,Adams >I just believe people are capable

508
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,840
<15-10,Adams >应该能比你处理得好
<15-10,Adams >of more than you do, apparently.

509
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,940
<15-10,Adams >他脑部活动恢复了
<15-10,Adams >We've got brain activity.

510
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,600
<15-11,Chase >体温34度不到
<15-11,Chase >Temp's at 93.

511
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,460
<15-11,Chase >他的心脏应该快开始跳了
<15-11,Chase >His heart should start soon.

512
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,580
<15-11,Chase >我父亲丢下我一个人
<15-11,Chase >My dad left me alone

513
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,370
<15-11,Chase >照顾我酗酒的老妈
<15-11,Chase >to care for my alcoholic mom

514
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,480
<15-11,Chase >抚养我妹妹
<15-11,Chase >and raise my baby sister.

515
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,810
<15-11,Chase >我那时也还是个孩子
<15-11,Chase >I was just a teenager.

516
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,760
<15-11,Chase >我一半时间花在换尿布上
<15-11,Chase >I spent half my time changing diapers

517
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,910
<15-11,Chase >还有一半时间擦洗我妈的呕吐物
<15-11,Chase >and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.

518
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,080
<15-12,Adams >但是你为她们所做的
<15-12,Adams >But it must've been important

519
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,980
<15-12,Adams >对她们而言应该是意义重大吧
<15-12,Adams >that you stayed for both of them.

520
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,970
<15-13,Chase >几年后我妈死了
<15-13,Chase >Mom died after a few years.

521
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,300
<15-13,Chase >那过程痛苦得惨不忍睹
<15-13,Chase >It was ugly and painful,

522
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,040
<15-13,Chase >她至死  我都对她怀恨在心
<15-13,Chase >and she went with me hating her.

523
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,230
<15-13,Chase >我妹妹最后也开始酗酒  毁了大好年华
<15-13,Chase >My sister ended up drinking half of her life away.

524
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,010
<15-13,Chase >她恨我没有能够帮助她
<15-13,Chase >And hating me because I couldn't help.

525
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,870
<15-13,Chase >我妈走了之后  我无依无靠
<15-13,Chase >After mom, I had nothing left.

526
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,000
<15-13,Chase >我是否愿意她用枪了结生命而不是靠酒精慢性自杀
<15-13,Chase >So do I wish mom had used a gun instead of a bottle?

527
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,190
<15-13,Chase >我愿意
<15-13,Chase >Yes.

528
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,120
<15-14,Adams >我不知道有这事
<15-14,Adams >I... I didn't know.

529
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,630
<15-15,Chase >所以我才告诉你
<15-15,Chase >That's why I told you.

530

532
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,340
<15-16,Chase >小心
<15-16,Chase >Careful.

533
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,620
<15-16,Chase >我们将他的心跳节律恢复之后
<15-16,Chase >Once we establish rhythm,

534
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,270
<15-16,Chase >任何不当的移动都可能导致他发生心室纤颤
<15-16,Chase >any accidental movement could crash him back into v-fib.

535
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,480
<15-16,Chase >离手
<15-16,Chase >Clear.

536
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,770
<15-17,Foreman >我们还有很长的路要走
<15-17,Foreman >We still have a long way to go.

537

<15-17,Foreman >低温可以保护大脑
<15-17,Foreman >Cold can be protective to the brain,

538
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,690
<15-17,Foreman >但仍有脑损伤的可能
<15-17,Foreman >but there is a possibility of damage.

539
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,550
<15-17,Foreman >我们还需要确诊并治疗
<15-17,Foreman >We also need to confirm and treat

540
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,170
<15-17,Foreman >他的原发疾病
<15-17,Foreman >whatever's making him sick.

<16-1,House >我得去做一套全面常规检查
<16-1,House >I just gotta do a standard battery of tests.

<16-1,House >验血验尿以及脑电图
<16-1,House >Blood, urine, EEG...

<16-1,House >打一针免费的流感疫苗要这么麻烦吗
<16-1,House >Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?

544
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,480
<16-2,House >不好意思
<16-2,House >Excuse me.

545
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,020
<16-2,House >我得去对付某个惊慌失措的人
<16-2,House >I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.

546
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,880
<16-3,Wilson >我特别强调过
<16-3,Wilson >I specifically said

547
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,650
<16-3,Wilson >如果你联系病人我们的赌就无效
<16-3,Wilson >the bet was off if you contacted the patient.

548
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,760
<16-4,House >确实
<16-4,House >Exactly.

549
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,940
<16-4,House >对于病人的丈夫你可什么都没说过
<16-4,House >Never said anything about the patient's husband.

550
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,090
<16-5,Wilson >我们的赌注是为她不进行性生活找到医学原因
<16-5,Wilson >The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.

551
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,240
<16-6,House >我承认我黔驴技穷了
<16-6,House >I admit I was stuck,

552
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,990
<16-6,House >直到我意识到有病的不是她而是她丈夫
<16-6,House >until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.

553
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,690
<16-6,House >她是通过撒谎来作为弥补
<16-6,House >She's lying to compensate.

554
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,530
<16-6,House >这是个古老的故事了
<16-6,House >It's a tale as old as time.

555
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,800
<16-6,House >男孩遇见了女孩  女孩爱上了男孩
<16-6,House >Boy meets girl, girl falls for boy,

556
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,400
<16-6,House >男孩说我没有性欲  女孩说我也是
<16-6,House >Boy says, "I'm asexual." Girl says, "Yeah, me too."

557
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,140
<16-7,Wilson >你这扭曲的逻辑也无法掩盖
<16-7,Wilson >Your twisted logic can't hide the fact

558
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,190
<16-7,Wilson >欺骗病人进行测试是不道德的
<16-7,Wilson >that tricking a patient into being tested

559
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,910
<16-7,Wilson >这个事实
<16-7,Wilson >is completely unethical.

560
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,580
<16-7,Wilson >算了吧
<16-7,Wilson >Come on.

561
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,910
<16-8,House >你不认为她理应知道为什么
<16-8,House >Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband

562
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,960
<16-8,House >她丈夫不愿在厨柜上把她推倒吗
<16-8,House >won't bend her over the kitchen counter?

563
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,920
<16-8,House >你就喜欢这种破事
<16-8,House >You love all that caring crap.

564
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,040
<16-9,Wilson >你这么做不是因为良心发现
<16-9,Wilson >You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.

565
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,630
<16-9,Wilson >甚至不是出于对医学的好奇
<16-9,Wilson >You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.

566
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,040
<16-10,House >我觉得我已经说得很清楚我这么做是为了钱
<16-10,House >I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.

567
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,120
<16-11,Wilson >那两个人很幸福
<16-11,Wilson >Two people are happy,

568
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,470
<16-11,Wilson >而你的本能就是去破坏它
<16-11,Wilson >and your natural impulse is to destroy it.

569
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,600
<16-12,House >你怎么知道她幸福呢
<16-12,House >How do you know she's happy?

570
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,620
<16-12,House >她告诉你的吗
<16-12,House >Did she tell you?

571
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,960
<16-13,Wilson >不  她的幸福溢于言表
<16-13,Wilson >No, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.

572
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,090
<16-14,House >好吧  我承认我的本能
<16-14,House >All right, I admit that my natural impulse

573
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,810
<16-14,House >是质疑声称幸福的人们
<16-14,House >is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness,

574
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,930
<16-14,House >而你就是迫切希望别人幸福
<16-14,House >but yours is to be a sucker for them.

575
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,870
<16-14,House >你说咱俩谁更糟
<16-14,House >You tell me which one's worse.

576

<17-1,Park >他刚才睁眼了
<17-1,Park >He just opened his eyes a little while ago.

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,850
<17-1,Park >体温也稳定了
<17-1,Park >and his body temperature is stabilized.

582
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,190
<17-3,Park >是的
<17-3,Park >Yeah.

583

<17-5,Andres >我觉得很热
<17-5,Andres >Me sinto quente.

585
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,980
<17-6,Park >他在说什么
<17-6,Park >What's he saying?

586
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,510
<17-6,Park >我不知道
<17-6,Park >I don't know.

587
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,520
<17-7,Natalie >我们结婚时我想学来着
<17-7,Natalie >I tried to learn when we got married,

588
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,930
<17-7,Natalie >但是我...
<17-7,Natalie >but I just--

589
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,730
<17-7,Natalie >没关系  会好的
<17-7,Natalie >It's okay. It's okay.

590

<17-8,Park >已经高于正常值了

592
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,310
<17-8,Park >等等  我记得
<17-8,Park >Wait, I thought--

593
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,800
<17-8,Park >我记得你刚说过他的情况稳定了
<17-8,Park >I thought you said it was stable.

594
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,050
<17-9,Park >为什么体温还在升高
<17-9,Park >Why is it still rising?

595
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,170
<17-9,Park >我不知道
<17-9,Park >I don't know.

596
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,280
<18-1,Foreman >呕吐  肝脏问题  肾脏问题现在又是发热
<18-1,Foreman >Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fever.

<18-2,House >我不想告诉你该如何工作  福曼医生
<18-2,House >I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr. Foreman,

598
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,540
<18-2,House >因为告诉别人如何工作正是你的职责
<18-2,House >since telling people how to do their job is your job,

599
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,260
<18-2,House >不过如果你的不完善的入院看护程序

602
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,300
<18-4,House >发热这个症状
<18-4,House >The word "Fever."

603
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,380
<18-4,House >可能是由于患者的病
<18-4,House >could come from the patient's illness,

604
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,670
<18-4,House >也有可能是由于你允许他
<18-4,House >or it could come from the fact that you allowed him

605
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,810
<18-4,House >漫步出医院并在冰天雪地上小憩了一会所致
