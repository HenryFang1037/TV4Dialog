00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,630
<1-1,House>事无裨益  罚人于身
<1-1,House>We are condemned to useless labor.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,000
<1-2,Wilson>第四层地狱
<1-2,Wilson>Fourth circle of hell.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,100
<1-2,Wilson>撇开这些名诗雅句
<1-2,Wilson>Charting goes a lot faster

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,100
<1-2,Wilson>写病历能快很多
<1-2,Wilson>when you eliminate all classic poetry.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,670
<1-3,House>拾人牙慧  却只为无人问津
<1-3,House>Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,630
<1-3,House>相信但丁也会认同这些事毫无裨益
<1-3,House>I'm sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,850
<1-4,Wilson>你有两个多星期的病历没有补了
<1-4,Wilson>You're over two weeks behind in your charting.

8

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,870
<1-6,Cuddy>你多大  8岁吗
<1-6,Cuddy>What are you, eight?

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,080
<1-7,House>8岁小孩能做这个吗
<1-7,House>Could an eight-year-old do this?

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,700
<1-8,Cuddy>省省吧  不然就变不回去了
<1-8,Cuddy>Better stop or it'll stick that way.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,570
<1-8,Cuddy>你的病人在一号诊室
<1-8,Cuddy>You have a patient in exam one.

<1-12,House>What seems to be the problem?

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,900
<1-12,House>奥古斯丁  给他看你的手
<1-12,House>Show him your hands, Augustine.

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,230
<1-12,House>看着像皮肤红斑
<1-12,House>It looks like stigmata.

<1-13,House>You must be all the talk around the holy water cooler.

<1-13,House>最近常洗盘子吗
<1-13,House>Been washing a lot of dishes recently?

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,900
<1-14,House>我在厨房帮忙
<1-14,House>I help out in the kitchen.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,460
<1-14,House>厨房有新用具吗
<1-14,House>Anything new in the kitchen?

26

<1-14,House>这周有人捐赠了平底锅和壶
<1-14,House>We just got a donation of saucepans and pots this week.

27

<1-15,House>我打开包装清洗了一下
<1-15,House>I unpacked and washed them.

<1-15,House>杂活这事儿倒是难了
<1-15,House>It's easier on the hands.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,410
<1-15,House>接触性皮炎  你对清洗皂过敏
<1-15,House>This is contact dermatitis. You're allergic to dish soap.

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,700
<1-15,House>胡说
<1-15,House>Nonsense.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,060
<1-15,House>我们一直用的同样的肥皂
<1-15,House>We've always used that soap.

33
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,900
<1-16,House>怎么现在才出问题呢
<1-16,House>Why is there a problem now?

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,200
<1-16,House>我做医生很多年了
<1-16,House>I've been a doctor for years.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,750
<1-16,House>为什么一直要向人保证说
<1-16,House>Why do I have to keep assuring people

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,500
<1-16,House>我清楚我做的事情
<1-16,House>that I know what I'm doing

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,470
<1-16,House>人们可能对长期
<1-16,House>A person can become allergic to substances

38
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,730
<1-16,House>持续接触的物品过敏

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,490
<1-16,House>能阻断过敏反应
<1-16,House>It'll stop the allergic reaction.

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,460
<1-16,House>每8小时服一片
<1-16,House>Take one every eight hours.

43
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,270
<1-16,House>可能会觉得有点儿嗜睡
<1-16,House>It might make you feel a little sleepy.

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,710
<1-16,House>再拿些非处方的可的松软膏
<1-16,House>And get some of that over-the-counter cortisone cream.

45
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,760
<1-17,House>-谢谢你  医生  -要水吗
<1-17,House>- Thank you, Doctor. - You want some water?

46
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,850
<1-17,House>我带了茶水
<1-17,House>I have some tea.

47
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,380
<1-18,House>行  休息几分钟就好
<1-18,House>Well, you just relax for a few minutes.

48
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,110
<1-18,House>药物起效很快
<1-18,House>That stuff works pretty fast.

49
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,000
<1-19,Wilson>还是过了12点
<1-19,Wilson>Still out by 12:00.

50
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,730
<1-20,House>你怎么处理像皮炎之类的问题

<1-22,Wilson>Is she talkin' to you?

54
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,340
<1-23,House>不知道  她绝对是看着我说的
<1-23,House>I don't know.She's certainly looking at me.

55
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,040
<1-23,House>很高兴得到一个非宗教的诊断
<1-23,House>Oh, it's good to get a secular diagnosis.

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,370
<1-24,House>修女们试图
<1-24,House>The sisters tend to

57
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,840
<1-24,House>将疾病理解为神的干涉
<1-24,House>interpret their illnesses as divine intervention.

58
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,670
<1-24,House>你不这样想吗
<1-24,House>And you don't?

59
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,670
<1-24,House>你也带了个滑稽的帽子
<1-24,House>I mean, you're wearing an awfully funny hat.

60
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,090
<1-25,Wilson>天  失陪
<1-25,Wilson>Ooh, boy. Excuse me

<1-25,Wilson>要是我的腿断了  我相信是有原因的
<1-25,Wilson>If I break my leg,I believe it happened for a reason.

62
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,990
<1-25,Wilson>我相信是上帝的安排
<1-25,Wilson>I believe God wanted me to break my leg.

63
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,290
<1-25,Wilson>我也相信是他要我打上石膏
<1-25,Wilson>I also believe he wants me to put a cast on it.

64
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,040
<1-25,Wilson>医生  有些不对
<1-25,Wilson>Doctor? Something's wrong.

65
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,800
<2-1,House>抬起下巴
<2-1,House>Lift up your chin.

66
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,700
<2-1,House>修女  你哮喘发作  请你放松
<2-1,House>Sister, you're having an asthma attack. I need you to relax.

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,520
<2-1,House>请卷起她的袖子  我要给你注射肾上腺素
<2-1,House>Roll up her sleeve, please. Gonna give you epinephrine.

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,810
<2-1,House>打开你的肺  帮助你呼吸
<2-1,House>Open your lungs to help you breathe.

69
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,680
<6-6,Cameron>发生什么事了
<6-6,Cameron>What happened?

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,640
<2-2,House>-她吃药了吗  -吃了
<2-2,House>- She take the pill? - Yes.

71
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,600
<2-3,House>可能是过敏反应
<2-3,House>It was probably an allergic reaction.

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,490
<2-3,House>她对抗过敏药过敏吗
<2-3,House>She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,560
<2-4,House>你觉得是冥冥中的力量要抓走她吗
<2-4,House>You figure somebody's out to get her?

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,420
<2-4,House>-感觉如何  -好多了
<2-4,House>- How are you feeling? - Better.

00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,830

<2-5,House>I'll put you on some steroids instead

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,770
<2-5,House>我是不是应该觉得心脏不适
<2-5,House>Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,340
<2-6,House>肾上腺素会加快你的心跳
<2-6,House>It's called adrenaline.Makes your heart beat fast.

78
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,660
<2-6,House>但没这么快  请找个护士来
<2-6,House>But not this fast. Get a nurse, please.

79
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,260
<2-6,House>躺下
<2-6,House>Lay down, come on.

80
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,040
<2-6,House>谁来帮帮我们
<2-6,House>Help! Somebody help us!

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,940
<2-7,House>快来人
<2-7,House>Somebody get in here!

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,170
<2-7,House>心肺复苏急救  除颤器充电
<2-7,House>Call a code and charge up the defibrillator.

83
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,410
<2-7,House>她没有脉搏了
<2-7,House>She's got no pulse.

84
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,970
<3-1,Cuddy>你诊断病症为过敏
<3-1,Cuddy>You diagnosed the patient with allergies

85
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,460
<3-1,Cuddy>开了抗组胺药
<3-1,Cuddy>and prescribed antihistamine.

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,300
<3-1,Cuddy>随后出现呼吸窘迫
<3-1,Cuddy>She went into respiratory distress.

87
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,060
<3-1,Cuddy>然后你给她注射了肾上腺素
<3-1,Cuddy>And you injected her with epinephrine.

88
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,260
<3-1,Cuddy>估计用了1毫升
<3-1,Cuddy>Presumable one cc.

89
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,420
<3-2,House>0.1毫升  标准用量
<3-2,House>Point-one cc. That is the standard dose,

90
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,750
<3-2,House>这是我给她的用量
<3-2,House>that is what I gave her.

91
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,690
<3-3,Cuddy>0.1毫升肾上腺素
<3-3,Cuddy>People don't go into cardiac arrest

92
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,690
<3-3,Cuddy>不会导致心脏骤停
<3-3,Cuddy>from point-one cc epinephrine.

93
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,890
<3-4,House>她的心脏一定有过往病史
<3-4,House>She must have a pre-existing heart

94
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,900
<3-4,House>肾上腺素使之恶化
<3-4,House>condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.

95
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,950
<3-5,Cuddy>不幸的是没有病历记录
<3-5,Cuddy>It's too bad you didn't make a notation in the chart.

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,750
<3-6,House>我现在就能补上
<3-6,House>I can make it up right now.

97
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,370
<3-7,Cuddy>放注射器的抽屉里两种剂量都有
<3-7,Cuddy>The drawer has syringes is with both dosages,

98
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,820
<3-7,Cuddy>很容易就会拿错
<3-7,Cuddy>you could've easily reached for the wrong...

99
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,000
<3-9,Cuddy>-但是我没有  -谁都会犯错
<3-9,Cuddy>- But I didn't. - Everyone makes mistakes.

100
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,530
<3-9,Cuddy>这就是为什么要强制医生
<3-9,Cuddy>This is why doctors pay through the nose

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,730
<3-9,Cuddy>买医疗事故保险
<3-9,Cuddy>for malpractice insurance.

102
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,970
<3-10,House>放轻松  她们不会起诉的
<3-10,House>Relax, they're not gonna sue.

103
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,360
<3-10,House>她们最多就是拿戒尺打我的手
<3-10,House>Worst they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler.

104
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,510
<3-11,Cuddy>那纪律委员会呢
<3-11,Cuddy>And the discipline board,

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,610
<3-11,Cuddy>也会打打手完事吗
<3-11,Cuddy>are they gonna whack your hand too?

106
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,860
<3-13,Cuddy>-你打算上报吗  -我有选择吗
<3-13,Cuddy>- You're gonna report me? - What choice do I have?

107
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,200
<3-14,House>不上报怎样
<3-14,House>How about not report me?

108
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,920
<3-15,Cuddy>我只能留她观察24小时
<3-15,Cuddy>I can justify keeping her here for a 24-hour observation.

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,150
<3-15,Cuddy>要是到时候你找不到心脏停跳的原因
<3-15,Cuddy>If you haven't found an underlying cause for the cardiac

110
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,100
<3-15,Cuddy>我只得通知我们的律师
<3-15,Cuddy>arrest by then, I will have to notify our attorneys.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,370
<4-1,Cameron>双手红肿
<4-1,Cameron>Her hands were red and swollen.

112
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,270
<4-1,Cameron>可能是皮肤感染  蜂窝组织炎
<4-1,Cameron>Maybe she has a skin infection, cellulitis?

113
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,700
<4-1,Cameron>会有心动过速症状
<4-1,Cameron>That could manifest with tachycardia.

114
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,720
<4-2,Foreman>没有发热症状
<4-2,Foreman>There's no history of fever.

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,040
<4-2,Foreman>全血细胞计数未显示感染
<4-2,Foreman>Results from the CBC didn't indicate an infection.

116
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,470
<4-3,Cameron>嗜酸性粒细胞略微增加
<4-3,Cameron>The eosinophil were mildly elevated.

117
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,500
<4-3,Cameron>血细胞沉降些许上升
<4-3,Cameron>Sed rates up a bit.

118
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,110
<4-3,Cameron>可能是全身过敏反应吗
<4-3,Cameron>Could we be looking at a systemic allergic response?

119
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,040
<4-3,Cameron>不是过敏
<4-3,Cameron>It's no allergic, and

120
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,970
<4-4,House>过敏不会这样导致心脏停跳
<4-4,House>allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this.

121
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,290
<4-4,House>-可能是血管炎症吗  -脉管炎吗
<4-4,House>- Could be inflammation of the blood vessels. - Vasculitis?

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,340
<4-5,Foreman>脉管炎不会导致嗜酸性粒细胞增加
<4-5,Foreman>That wouldn't give you an elevated eosinophil count.

123
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,180
<4-6,House>变应性肉芽肿性血管炎可以
<4-6,House>Churg Strauss Vasculitis would.

126
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,080
<4-6,House>导致哮喘  发疹和心脏问题
<4-6,House>causing the asthma, rash, and heart problems.

127
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,290
<4-7,Cameron>-解释了全部症状  -需要活检确诊
<4-7,Cameron>- Covers all her symptoms. - Need a biopsy to diagnose.

128
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,680
<4-8,Chase>胸部断层扫面更快
<4-8,Chase>Chest CT would be quicker.

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,490
<4-9,Foreman>她可是因皮疹就医的
<4-9,Foreman>The lady just came in with a rash.

130
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,940
<4-10,House>这是什么玩意儿
<4-10,House>What the hell are those?

131
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,640
<4-11,Cameron>糖果棒
<4-11,Cameron>Candy canes.

132
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,030
<4-11,Cameron>糖果棒吗[圣经典故]
<4-11,Cameron>Candy canes?

133
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,010
<4-12,House>你在嘲笑我吗
<4-12,House>Are you mocking me?

134
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,390
<4-13,Cameron>不  圣诞节了  我想
<4-13,Cameron>No, I-it's Christmas, and I, I thought

135
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,300
<4-14,House>放轻松  逗你玩呢
<4-14,House>Relax. It was a joke.

136
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,430
<4-15,Foreman>变应性肉芽肿性血管炎的愈后很差
<4-15,Foreman>Isn't the prognosis for Churg Strauss a bit grim?

137
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,680
<4-16,Cameron>是  不治疗的话  一年存活率仅33%
<4-16,Cameron>Yeah. Untreated, only 33% of patients survive past a year,

138
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,300
<4-16,Cameron>治疗的话存活率是5年
<4-16,Cameron>treated, five years.

139
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,140
<4-17,House>那么我绝对支持治疗
<4-17,House>Then I definitely suggest treatment.

140
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,040
<4-18,Foreman>如果是另一个主治医生
<4-18,Foreman>If it was any other attending doctor,

141
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,250
<4-18,Foreman>我会说他犯了错误
<4-18,Foreman>I'd say that he made a mistake

142
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,250
<4-18,Foreman>用了过量肾上腺素
<4-18,Foreman>and gave her too much epinephrine.

143
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,440
<4-19,House>这么说  你不是在说是我错了
<4-19,House>Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake.

144
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,300
<4-19,House>就是  确实是我的错咯
<4-19,House>Saying it was my mistake.

145
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,430
<4-20,Foreman>可是你说的  每个人都会犯错
<4-20,Foreman>Everyone screws up. Your rule.

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,880
<4-20,Foreman>我觉得你也是大家中的一员
<4-20,Foreman>I think you fit within the subset of everyone

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,250
<4-20,Foreman>我没弄错
<4-20,Foreman>I didn't screw up.

148
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,150
<4-21,House>预约胸部断层扫描  给修女用强的松
<4-21,House>Order a chest CT and start the sister on Prednisone.

149
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,700
<4-21,House>40毫克  每日三次
<4-21,House>40 milligrams, TID.

150
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,790
<4-22,Chase>修女
<4-22,Chase>The sister?

151
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,440
<4-23,House>我没说吗  病人是修女
<4-23,House>Oh, didn't I mention? Patient's a nun.

152
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,610
<5-1,Cameron>奥古斯丁修女
<5-1,Cameron>Sister Augustine.

153
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,940
<4-24,Chase>我讨厌修女
<4-24,Chase>I hate nuns.

154
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,330
<4-25,House>谁不讨厌呢
<4-25,House>Who doesn't?

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,960
<5-1,Cameron>奥古斯丁修女吗
<5-1,Cameron>Sister Augustine?

156
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,070
<5-2,Augustine>我们没看
<5-2,Augustine>We weren't watching.

157
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,800
<5-3,Pius>我们只是试试这个是不是床的遥控器
<5-3,Pius>We were trying to see if this is the bed control.

158
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,210
<5-4,Cameron>这个是床的遥控器  那个是电视的
<5-4,Cameron>Oh, um, this one's the bed control. And that's the TV control.

159
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,320
<5-4,Cameron>我是卡梅隆医生
<5-4,Cameron>I'm Dr. Cameron.

160
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,300
<5-4,Cameron>这是奇斯医生和福曼医生
<5-4,Cameron>This is Dr. Chase and Dr. Forman.

161
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
<5-5,Augustine>我都20多年没看电视了
<5-5,Augustine>I haven't seen television in over 20 years.

162
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,270
<5-6,Chase>你们觉得它是魔鬼的产物
<5-6,Chase>Do you consider it the work of the Devil,

163
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,390
<5-6,Chase>还是住处没有安装有线呢
<5-6,Chase>or do you just not get cable where you live?

164
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,870
<5-7,Foreman>感觉好些了吗  修女
<5-7,Foreman>How are you feeling, Sister?

165
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,860
<5-8,Augustine>吃过药  觉得好点了
<5-8,Augustine>I seem to be a little better. They gave me some medication.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,520
<5-9,Foreman>强的松  类固醇类药物可以消除炎症反应
<5-9,Foreman>Prednisone. It's a steroid to help with the inflammation.

167
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,930
<5-10,Augustine>豪斯医生诊断出我的病症了吗
<5-10,Augustine>Has Dr. House figured out what I have?

168
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,590
<5-10,Augustine>会好吗
<5-10,Augustine>Will I be okay?

169
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,880
<5-11,Cameron>我们还不能确诊
<5-11,Cameron>We're not sure what's wrong yet.

170
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,730
<5-11,Cameron>今天下午  安排了胸部断层扫描
<5-11,Cameron>You'll have a chest CT scan this afternoon

171
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,540
<5-11,Cameron>来帮助我们诊断
<5-11,Cameron>that'll help the diagnosis.

172
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,050
<5-12,Pius>药都用了
<5-12,Pius>Dr. House was giving her medication,

173
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,650
<5-12,Pius>豪斯医生却还没搞清是什么病吗
<5-12,Pius>and he doesn't know what she has yet?

174
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,590
<5-13,Augustine>要相信  派尔斯修女  一切皆有因果
<5-13,Augustine>Trust, Sister Pious. It all happens for a reason.

175
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,670
<6-1,Foreman>他不清楚自己在做什么
<6-1,Foreman>He doesn't know what he's doing.

176
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,570
<6-1,Foreman>唯一的问题
<6-1,Foreman>The only problem that woman has is

177
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,800
<6-1,Foreman>就是豪斯拿错了注射器
<6-1,Foreman>that House grabbed the wrong syringe.

178
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,720
<6-2,Cameron>你不相信他吗
<6-2,Cameron>You don't trust him?

179
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,710
<6-3,Foreman>我不信任一个不承认自己会犯错的人
<6-3,Foreman>I don't trust a man who won't admit he might be wrong.

180
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,350
<6-3,Foreman>你不是也没急着告诉她可能
<6-3,Foreman>I notice you weren't so quick to tell her

181
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,010
<6-3,Foreman>患有变应性肉芽肿性血管炎
<6-3,Foreman>she's got Churg Strauss

182
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,720
<6-3,Foreman>没几年好活了
<6-3,Foreman>and only has a couple of years to live.

183
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,250
<6-4,Cameron>确诊前我不会告诉病人坏消息
<6-4,Cameron>I don't tell patients bad news unless it's conclusive.

184
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,170
<6-5,Foreman>因为你知道他可能错了
<6-5,Foreman>Because you know he might be wrong.

185
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,510
<6-6,Cameron>变应性肉芽肿性血管炎有待商榷
<6-6,Cameron>About Churg Strauss,

186
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,600
<6-6,Cameron>门诊上应该没出什么错
<6-6,Cameron>not about what happened in the clinic.

187
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,790
<6-7,Foreman>奇斯  你怎么想
<6-7,Foreman>What about you, Chase?

188
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,960
<6-7,Foreman>也觉得他不会犯错吗
<6-7,Foreman>You think he's infallible too?

189
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,630
<6-8,Chase>我知道的是  要是豪斯没错
<6-8,Chase>All I know is, if House didn't make a mistake,

190
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,550
<6-8,Chase>奥古斯丁修女患变应性肉芽肿性血管炎
<6-8,Chase>and Sister Augustine has Churg Strauss,

191
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,240
<6-8,Chase>他会沾沾自喜
<6-8,Chase>he'll be self-satisfied,

192
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,240
<6-8,Chase>而我们能过上几周好日子
<6-8,Chase>and our lives will be good for a few weeks.

193
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,720
<6-8,Chase>要是豪斯错了
<6-8,Chase>If House did make a mistake,

194
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,660
<6-8,Chase>他会不爽  我们就要倒霉几个月
<6-8,Chase>he'll be upset and our lives will be miserable for months.

195
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,640
<6-9,Foreman>说到点子上了
<6-9,Foreman>There is that.

196
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,510
<7-1,House>卡迪要是觉得是我的过失
<7-1,House>If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake,

197
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,910
<7-1,House>至少也应该停掉我门诊的工作
<7-1,House>the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.

198
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,830
<7-2,Wilson>她不会混淆犯错和失职
<7-2,Wilson>She doesn't confuse making a mistake with being incompetent.

199
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,210
<7-3,House>又来了  说教时间
<7-3,House>Oh, here we go. Lesson time.

200
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,250
<7-3,House>我认为自信不是我的缺点
<7-3,House>I recognize that confidence is not my short suit.

201
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,070
<7-3,House>我还认为我是凡人  可能犯错
<7-3,House>I also recognize that I am human and capable of error.

202
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,880
<7-4,Wilson>那么  是你搞砸了
<7-4,Wilson>So you might've screwed this up?

203
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,930
<7-5,House>不是
<7-5,House>No.

204
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,440
<7-6,Wilson>那么这仅仅是理论上的可能
<7-6,Wilson>So it's merely a theoretical capacity for error.

205
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,520
<7-7,House>说得好
<7-7,House>Good point.

206
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,850
<7-7,House>或许没有错误  或许是我的错误
<7-7,House>Maybe there isn't one. Maybe that's my error.

207
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,630
<7-8,Wilson>要知道  多数和你一样
<7-8,Wilson>You know, most people

208
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,630
<7-8,Wilson>只考虑自己的人
<7-8,Wilson>who think as much of themselves as you do

209
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,870
<7-8,Wilson>喜欢谈论自己
<7-8,Wilson>like to talk about themselves.

210
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,080
<7-9,House>多数人  不爱听
<7-9,House>Most people don't like to listen.

211
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,130
<7-9,House>你哪儿不舒服
<7-9,House>So what's wrong with you?

212
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,530
<8-1,House>让我猜猜
<8-1,House>Let me guess.

213
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,310
<8-1,House>肠炎
<8-1,House>Inflammatory bowel.

214
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,970
<8-2,Santa>是  味道那么重吗
<8-2,Santa>Wow, yeah. Is it that bad?

215
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,050
<8-2,Santa>确实
<8-2,Santa>Yes.

216
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,830
<8-3,House>病历上也这么说
<8-3,House>It's also written on your chart.

217
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,940
<8-3,House>血性腹泻  胀气  疼痛
<8-3,House>Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain.

218
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,030
<8-3,House>磺胺类  无效
<8-3,House>Took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work.

219
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,140
<8-5,House>接着试了类固醇灌肠剂
<8-5,House>Next tried steroid enemas,

220
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,510
<8-5,House>口服皮质类固醇  乙酰水杨酸  6-巯基嘌呤
<8-5,House>oral corticosteroids, 5ASA, 6-mercaptopurine.

221
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,570
<8-6,Santa>-我给镇住了  -被我的用药史吗
<8-6,Santa>- I'm impressed. - By my medical history?

222
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,800
<8-7,House>被上一个医生的完美病历
<8-7,House>By how well your last doctor charted.

223
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,840
<8-8,Santa>每个小时去趟洗手间并不是大问题
<8-8,Santa>It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom every hour,

224
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,780
<8-8,Santa>但要是有小孩坐在腿上  这...
<8-8,Santa>but when the kids sit on my lap, it's...

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,300
<8-8,Santa>商店会让我回家  他们会炒了我的
<8-8,Santa>The store sent me home. They're gonna fire me.

226
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,070
<8-8,Santa>不能给我开点儿乙酰水杨酸吗
<8-8,Santa>Can't you put me back on 5ASA?

227
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,810
<8-8,Santa>指不定有用
<8-8,Santa>Maybe it'll work this time.

228
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,140
<8-9,House>不太可能  我给你个处方
<8-9,House>Not likely. I'm giving you a prescription.

229
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,590
<8-9,House>价廉  物美
<8-9,House>It's cheap, which is good,

230
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,880
<8-9,House>因为保险公司不为这药买单
<8-9,House>'cause your insurance company won't pay for it.

231
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,040
<8-10,Santa>-香姻  -对  香烟
<8-10,Santa>- Cogaritis?  - Cigarettes.

<8-11,House>一天两次  一次一支
<8-11,House>One twice a day. No more, no less.

233
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,780
<8-11,House>研究表明吸烟
<8-11,House>Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is

234
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,970
<8-11,House>是控制肠炎
<8-11,House>one of the most effective ways

235
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,670
<8-11,House>最有效的方法之一
<8-11,House>to control inflammatory bowel.

236
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
<8-11,House>而且吸烟
<8-11,House>Plus it's been well-established

237
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,080
<8-11,House>能让你看上去更酷
<8-11,House>that you'll look 30% cooler.

238
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,520
<8-12,Santa>你是在开玩笑吗
<8-12,Santa>Are you kidding me?

239
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,390
<8-13,House>吸烟让你更酷吗  是的
<8-13,House>About the looking cooler? Yeah.

240
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,660
<8-13,House>剩下的倒是实话
<8-13,House>The rest is true.

241
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,290
<8-14,Santa>不过吸烟不是会上瘾而且有害吗
<8-14,Santa>Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

242
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,810
<8-15,House>我开的药几乎
<8-15,House>Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe

243
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,810
<8-14,Santa>都是易上瘾且有害的
<8-14,Santa>are addictive and dangerous

244
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,070
<8-15,House>唯一的区别是
<8-15,House>The only difference with this one

245
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,570
<8-15,House>吸烟是完全合法的
<8-15,House>is it's completely legal.

246
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
<8-15,House>圣诞快乐
<8-15,House>Merry Christmas.

247
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,950
<9-1,Augustine>我前面在和护士聊天
<9-1,Augustine>I was talking to the nurse.

248
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,930
<9-1,Augustine>埃森尼奥  你认识他吗
<9-1,Augustine>Arsenio. Do you know him?

249
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,340
<9-3,Augustine>-不认识  -他的手机可以拍照
<9-3,Augustine>- Not really. - He can take pictures with his phone.

250
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,670
<9-4,Chase>真厉害
<9-4,Chase>Cool.

251
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,310
<9-5,Augustine>实验室里那个女的也很有趣
<9-5,Augustine>That woman from the lab was interesting too.

252
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,240
<9-5,Augustine>她在成为护士之前学的是天体物理学
<9-5,Augustine>She studied astrophysics before becoming a nurse.

253
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,260
<9-6,Chase>你知道的比我都多
<9-6,Chase>You know this stuff better than I do.

254
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,140
<9-7,Augustine>我喜欢去了解他人
<9-7,Augustine>Well, I love to hear all about people.

255
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,740
<9-8,Chase>你住在修道院里
<9-8,Chase>You live in a monastery.

256
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,570
<9-9,Augustine>那是我为我们的主和社会服务的地方
<9-9,Augustine>It's where I serve our Lord and the world best.

257
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,170
<9-10,Chase>我们的主  也许吧
<9-10,Chase>Our Lord, maybe.

258
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,270
<9-10,Chase>不过其他人也许觉得
<9-10,Chase>The rest of the world, on the other hand,

259
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,460
<9-10,Chase>扶贫济困更有意义  或是...
<9-10,Chase>would probably get more out of feeding the homeless or...

260
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,610
<9-11,Augustine>或是治病救人吗
<9-11,Augustine>Healing the sick?

261
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,780
<9-13,Augustine>-的确是个例子  -你从小就想做医生吗
<9-13,Augustine>- As an example, yeah. - Did you always want to be a doctor?

262
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,580
<9-14,Chase>是的  从小
<9-14,Chase>Always.

263
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,910
<9-14,Chase>你从小就想成为修女吗
<9-14,Chase>You always want to be a nun

264
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,930
<9-15,Augustine>我六岁的时候父母就死了
<9-15,Augustine>My parents died when I was six.

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,210
<9-15,Augustine>我是被教堂开的收养所养大的
<9-15,Augustine>I was raised in a foster home run by the Church.

266
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,590
<9-15,Augustine>十八岁的时候  我去了修道院
<9-15,Augustine>When I was 18, I went to the monastery,

267
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,320
<9-15,Augustine>并且做了宣誓
<9-15,Augustine>where they let me take my vows.

268
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,400
<9-15,Augustine>我没有别的的生活  也从不想要
<9-15,Augustine>I've known no other life, and I haven't wanted to.

269
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,330
<10-1,Foreman>好的  修女  希望你躺着不要乱动
<10-1,Foreman>Okay, Sister, we need you to lie as still as possible.

270
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,350
<10-1,Foreman>如果害怕  可以告诉我们
<10-1,Foreman>If you get scared, just let us know.

271
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,970
<10-2,Augustine>正如约拿于鲸鱼腹中所言
<10-2,Augustine>As Jonah said from inside the whale,

272
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,040
<10-2,Augustine>"穷尽生之希望  唯主存于我心"
<10-2,Augustine>"When I lost all hope, I turned my thoughts to the Lord."

273
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,550
<10-3,Foreman>上帝与她同在
<10-3,Foreman>She's got God on her side.

274
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,740
<10-4,Cameron>我不相信上帝
<10-4,Cameron>I don't believe it God.

275
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,760
<10-5,Foreman>你不觉得这是不可知的吗
<10-5,Foreman>You're not even a little agnostic?

276
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,500
<10-6,Augustine>这里闻起来怪怪的  正常吗
<10-6,Augustine>Is it supposed to smell funny?

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,920
<10-7,Tech>有人今早在里面吐了
<10-7,Tech>Someone ralphed in there this morning.

278
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,020
<10-7,Tech>清理过了  但...
<10-7,Tech>We cleaned it up, but...

279
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,550
<10-8,Cameron>修女  这是正常的  再坚持几分钟
<10-8,Cameron>It's normal, Sister. I-it's just a few more minutes.

280
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,230
<10-8,Cameron>我相信有股更强大力量
<10-8,Cameron>I believe in a higher order,

281
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,330
<10-8,Cameron>控制着世间的一切
<10-8,Cameron>that can control what happens,

282
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,760
<10-8,Cameron>但不是什么被赋予人形的叫"上帝"的东西
<10-8,Cameron>but not one anthropomorphic entity called "God"

283
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,950
<10-9,Foreman>控制着我们的日常生活
<10-9,Foreman>that's concerned with the everyday workings of you and me.

284
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,440
<10-9,Foreman>除了我们的日常生活
<10-9,Foreman>What else is there to control

285
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,200
<10-9,Foreman>还有什么是需要被控制的呢
<10-9,Foreman>but the everyday workings of you and me?

286
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,300
<10-10,Cameron>你总想着你自己  福曼
<10-10,Cameron>It's always about you, Foreman.

287
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,910
<10-11,Foreman>你认为我该想什么呢  花鸟鱼虫吗
<10-11,Foreman>What are you talking about? The trees, the fish?

288
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,680
<10-11,Foreman>难道它们才应该觉得它们是一切的中心吗
<10-11,Foreman>Should they be the ones that think it's all about them?

289
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,020
<10-11,Foreman>奇斯  你呢  你相信上帝吗
<10-11,Foreman>What about you, Chase? You believe in God?

290
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,310
<10-12,Chase>我相信奥古斯丁修女没有血管病变
<10-12,Chase>I believe Sister Augustine has no vascular pathology.

291
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,640
<10-12,Chase>说明不是变应性肉芽肿性血管炎
<10-12,Chase>Which means no Churg Strauss.

292
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,060
<10-13,Foreman>也就意味着豪斯误诊了
<10-13,Foreman>Which means House made a mistake.

293
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,290
<10-14,Cameron>不  不一定  也可能是别的问题
<10-14,Cameron>No, not necessarily. It could be something else.

294
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,140
<10-14,Cameron>甲状腺毒症  或是类癌...
<10-14,Cameron>Thyrotoxicosis, or carcinoid...

295
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,620
<10-14,Cameron>你不信上帝
<10-14,Cameron>You don't believe in God,

296
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,560
<10-15,Foreman>不过却全心全意相信一个凡人吗
<10-15,Foreman>but you're willing to put complete faith in one man?

297
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,870
<10-16,Augustine>拜托  这味道...
<10-16,Augustine>Please...the smell.

298
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,300
<10-17,Foreman>快把她弄出来
<10-17,Foreman>Let's get her out of there.

299
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,340
<10-18,Cameron>我来了  修女
<10-18,Cameron>I'm coming, Sister.

300
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,110
<10-16,Augustine>哦  那气味
<10-16,Augustine>Oh, the smell.

301
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,550
<9-11,Augustine>让我觉得很难受
<9-11,Augustine>I'm gonna be sick, sick.

302
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,460
<10-20,Cameron>-没有什么味道  -噢  哦  天啊
<10-20,Cameron>- There's no smell. - Oh--oh, God!

303
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,920
<10-21,Augustine>噢  是耶稣  我看见耶稣了
<10-21,Augustine>Oh, it's Jesus. It's Jesus.

304
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
<10-21,Augustine>他是为我而来的
<10-21,Augustine>He's coming for me!

305
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,010
<10-21,Augustine>他用他的火把燃烧我
<10-21,Augustine>He's burning me with his touch!

306
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,510
<10-22,Foreman>给她用安定
<10-22,Foreman>Let's get her on some Ativan.

307
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,100
<10-22,Foreman>拜托
<10-22,Foreman>Please!

308
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,360
<10-22,Foreman>幻嗅  宗教性幻觉
<10-22,Foreman>Smells, religious visions,

309
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,760
<10-22,Foreman>脑叶肿胀的症状
<10-22,Foreman>symptomatic type of lobe swelling.

310
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,770
<10-22,Foreman>我们不能让她...
<10-22,Foreman>We don't... we don't want her to...

311
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,720
<10-24,Cameron>她在抽搐
<10-24,Cameron>She's seizing.

312
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,870
<10-24,Cameron>颌骨闭合
<10-24,Cameron>Jaw block.

313
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,270
<10-25,Foreman>帮我让她侧过身
<10-25,Foreman>Help me get her on her side.

314
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,230
<10-26,Chase>-宗教性幻觉吗  -对
<10-26,Chase>- Religious visions? - Yeah.

315
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,290
<10-27,Foreman>接下来将会是...
<10-27,Foreman>And next comes...

316
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,220
<11-1,Foreman>病人疱疹性脑炎测试呈阳性
<11-1,Foreman>Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.

317
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,290
<11-2,House>这说明什么呢
<11-2,House>So what's that tell us?

318
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,950
<11-3,Cameron>她的免疫系统功能被严重抑制
<11-3,Cameron>Her immune systemis severely compromised.

319
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,040
<11-4,Cuddy>我知道这个  强的松能抑制免疫系统
<11-4,Cuddy>Oh, I know. Prednisone compromises the immune system.

320
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,050
<11-4,Cuddy>不正是你用来治疗
<11-4,Cuddy>Isn't that the medicine that

321
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,560
<11-4,Cuddy>她根本没有的病的药吗
<11-4,Cuddy>you gave her for that thing she doesn't have?

322
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,300
<11-4,Cuddy>对...嗨
<11-4,Cuddy>Yeah, the... hey.

323
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,640
<11-5,House>这个问题真是不怀好意啊
<11-5,House>I'm thinking that's a trick question.

324
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,860
<11-3,Cameron>她的免疫系统被严重破坏
<11-3,Cameron>Her immune system is severely compromised.

325
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,000
<11-6,Cameron>两剂量的强的松不会造成如此结果
<11-6,Cameron>Two doses of Prednisone wouldn't do that.

326
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,400
<11-7,Cuddy>你是在根据症状的严重程度来判断病因吗
<11-7,Cuddy>Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?

327
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,830
<11-8,House>十秒后  我会宣布
<11-8,House>In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce

328
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,480
<11-8,House>我在门诊给了她错误剂量的药
<11-8,House>that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.

329
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,060
<11-9,Cuddy>-你准备承认失误吗  -如果你离开这里的话
<11-9,Cuddy>- You're gonna admit negligence? - Unless you leave the room.

330
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,080
<11-10,House>如果你留下  就必须要作证了
<11-10,House>If you stay, you'll have to testify.

331
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,180
<11-10,House>5...4...3...2...
<11-10,House>Five... four... three... two...

332
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,410
<11-10,House>门诊的时候我喝得的酩酊大醉  闭着眼睛
<11-10,House>So there I was in the clinic, drunk. I open the drawer,

333
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,280
<11-10,House>打开抽屉  顺手拿了一支注射器...
<11-10,House>close my eyes, take the first syringe I can find...

334
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,010
<11-10,House>哪些疾病可以解释免疫系统的损害
<11-10,House>So, what are the options for compromised immune system?

335
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,800
<11-10,House>混合性结缔组织病
<11-10,House>Mixed connective tissue disease.

336
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,480
<11-11,Chase>还能解释她在用过强的松后的病情缓解
<11-11,Chase>It'd explain why she was feeling better on the Prednisone.

337
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,820
<11-12,Foreman>你确定她的病情
<11-12,Foreman>Sure she was feeling better

338
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
<11-12,Foreman>在变得如此很严重之前缓解过吗
<11-12,Foreman>right up to the moment when it almost killed her.

339
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,370
<11-13,House>不过这确实符合她的所有症状
<11-13,House>On the other hand, it explains the symptoms.

340
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,630
<11-13,House>双手肿胀  肺部问题
<11-13,House>Swollen hands, pulmonary problems,

341
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,030
<11-13,House>心脏问题  全符合
<11-13,House>cardiac problems, it all fits.

342
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,190
<11-14,Foreman>-但他的抗核抗体检测是正常的  -再去验血
<11-14,Foreman>- Except her ANA was normal.  - So redraw the blood.

343
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,450
<11-15,House>不过治疗方法是皮质类固醇  也就是强的松
<11-15,House>But the treatment is corticosteroids, Prednisone.

344
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,540
<11-16,Foreman>因为脑炎  我们已经不能再用了
<11-16,Foreman>And we can't go there because of the encephalitis.

345
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,090
<11-17,House>那就用调节免疫
<11-17,House>Well, treat it with something that

346
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,450
<11-17,House>别用抑制免疫的药物来治疗
<11-17,House>modulates the immune system, but doesn't suppress it.

347

<11-19,House>Prep the nun.

353
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,500
<11-19,House>停掉强的松
<11-19,House>And discontinue the Prednisone.

354
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,770
<11-19,House>我既高兴又生气
<11-19,House>I am both amused and annoyed that

355
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,820
<11-19,House>你居然希望我不要和你一样固执
<11-19,House>you think I should be less stubborn than you are.

357
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,870
<11-21,House>那个以"第一不作伤害"作开头
<11-21,House>The one that starts "First, do nor harm,"

358
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,190
<11-21,House>接着叙述禁止堕胎  引诱
<11-21,House>and then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions,

359
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,320
<11-21,House>和禁止切除奴隶

<11-23,House>Every treatment has its dangers.

365
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,680
<11-24,Foreman>这就是为什么我们只在
<11-24,Foreman>Which is why we only treat if we're

366
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,590
<11-24,Foreman>确信病人需要治疗的时候才给予治疗
<11-24,Foreman>convinced the patient actually needs the treatment.

367
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,670
<11-25,House>我很确信  但你没有
<11-25,House>I'm convinced. You're not.

368
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,570
<11-25,House>问题是  你能怎么办呢
<11-25,House>The question is, what are you gonna do about it?

374
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,960
<13-1,Chase>使血液饱和
<13-1,Chase>and saturate your blood.

<13-1,Chase>这会增强白细胞活力

377
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,470
<13-2,Augustine>这能治疗
<13-2,Augustine>And that will help with

378
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,770
<13-2,Augustine>混合性结缔组织病吗
<13-2,Augustine>this mixed connective tissue disease?

<13-3,Chase>我们会做10次治疗
<13-3,Chase>We'll be doing about 10 treatments,

380
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,550
<13-3,Chase>然后重新评估
<13-3,Chase>and then we'll reevaluate.

381
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,490
<13-4,Augustine>是强的松导致了抽搐  是吗
<13-4,Augustine>The last treatment with Prednisone caused the seizures, right?

382
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,340
<13-4,Augustine>豪斯医生有多大把握呢
<13-4,Augustine>How confident is Dr. House about this?

383
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,100
<13-5,Cameron>你对强的松的过激反应
<13-5,Cameron>That you reacted so strongly to the Prednisone let

384
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,830
<13-5,Cameron>说明你的免疫系统
<13-5,Cameron>us know that you had an underlying problem

385
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,130
<13-5,Cameron>存在潜在问题
<13-5,Cameron>with your immune system.

386
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,910
<13-6,Augustine>我想这勉强算是
<13-6,Augustine>Then I guess it was a blessing.

387
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,000
<13-6,Augustine>上帝的赐福
<13-6,Augustine>Of sorts.

388
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,260

<14-1,Soap Doc>So who's your favorite reindeer, Nurse Arnold?

389
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,490
<14-3,Soap Doc>-鲁道夫  -我总觉得你会选维克森
<14-3,Soap Doc>- Rudolph. - I would have thought it was Vixen.

390
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,830
<14-4,Soap Nurse>-你在暗示什么吗  -没有
<14-4,Soap Nurse>- What are you implying? - Nothing.

391
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,440

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,270
<14-6,Eucharist>我只是在跳舞
<14-6,Eucharist>I was just doing some Christmas dancing.

394
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,040
<14-6,Eucharist>这里是礼拜堂
<14-6,Eucharist>This is a chapel.

395
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
<14-6,Eucharist>是用来祈祷的
<14-6,Eucharist>A house of prayer.

396
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,320
<14-6,Eucharist>用来祈祷的  嗯
<14-6,Eucharist>A house of prayer. Huh.

397
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,160
<14-7,House>难怪这里信号好
<14-7,House>Well, that explainsthe good reception.

398
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,190
<14-7,House>并且没人
<14-7,House>Also why nobody's ever here.

399
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,420
<14-8,Eucharist>我需要和你谈谈  豪斯医生
<14-8,Eucharist>I need to talk with you, Dr. House.

400
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,350
<14-8,Eucharist>奥古斯汀修女相信一些不真实的东西
<14-8,Eucharist>Sister Augustine believes in things that aren't real.

401
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,280
<14-9,House>我以为这是做修女工作必备的素质
<14-9,House>I thought that was a job requirement for you people.

402
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,860
<14-10,Eucharist>别人都知道她以说谎博得同情
<14-10,Eucharist>She's been known to lie to get sympathy.

403
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,950
<14-10,Eucharist>她有忧郁症
<14-10,Eucharist>She's a hypochondriac.

404
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,560
<14-11,House>你是在提醒我
<14-11,House>So you're warning me that

405
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,840
<14-11,House>我在治疗根本不存在的疾病
<14-11,House>I may be treating a non-existent ailment.

406
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,810
<14-12,Eucharist>喉咙痛  关节痛
<14-12,Eucharist>Sore throats, joint pains.

407
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,380
<14-12,Eucharist>她总有些地方不舒服
<14-12,Eucharist>There's always something wrong.

408
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,870
<14-12,Eucharist>但从没原因
<14-12,Eucharist>And there's never a reason for it.

409
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,960
<14-12,Eucharist>修道院院长居然也相信她
<14-12,Eucharist>Mother Superior plays right into it.

410
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,830
<14-12,Eucharist>免去她的工作义务
<14-12,Eucharist>Lets Augustine off work duties.

411
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,060
<14-12,Eucharist>认为她脆弱  给与特别对待
<14-12,Eucharist>Treating her as...fragile. Special.

412
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,630
<14-13,House>你一定觉得气愤吧
<14-13,House>That must make you angry.

413
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,250
<14-14,Eucharist>确实让我不快
<14-14,Eucharist>It bothers me.

414
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,070
<14-14,Eucharist>但其实这也对奥古斯汀不好
<14-14,Eucharist>It's not really in Augustine's best interest.

415
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,650
<14-15,House>要一块吗
<14-15,House>Want some?

416
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,950
<14-16,Eucharist>我不应该拿
<14-16,Eucharist>I shouldn't.

417
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,270
<14-17,House>我猜你作为修女看护
<14-17,House>I guess you gotta be good at

418
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,420
<14-17,House>一定擅长看穿人心  对吗
<14-17,House>reading people to be a good infirmarian, huh?

419
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,910
<14-19,House>你之前表现出骄傲  愤怒  嫉妒  贪吃
<14-19,House>So we got pride, anger, envy, gluttony.

420
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,460
<14-19,House>你在两分钟之内犯了七宗罪中的四宗
<14-19,House>That four out of seven deadly sins in under two minutes.

421
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,990
<14-19,House>你们在破规矩上比赛破纪录吗
<14-19,House>Do you people keep records of these things?

422
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,220
<14-19,House>难道有天主教奥运会吗
<14-19,House>Is there a Cath-lympics?

423
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,970
<14-20,Eucharist>-他们说你是天才  -他们真喜欢瞎聊
<14-20,Eucharist>- They say you have a gift.  - They like to talk.

424
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,780
<14-22,Eucharist>你总把你的智慧藏起来
<14-22,Eucharist>You hide behind your intelligence.

425
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,100
<14-23,House>对  多愚蠢啊
<14-23,House>Yeah, that's pretty stupid.

426
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,250
<14-24,Eucharist>你总嬉皮笑脸是因为
<14-24,Eucharist>And you make jokes because

427
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,960
<14-24,Eucharist>你害怕对待事情太认真
<14-24,Eucharist>you're afraid to take anything seriously.

428
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,130
<14-24,Eucharist>如果太认真  它们对你便意味着什么
<14-24,Eucharist>Because if you take things seriously, they matter.

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
<14-24,Eucharist>如果意味着什么
<14-24,Eucharist>And if they matter...

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,920
<14-25,House>一旦出问题  我会受到伤害
<14-25,House>Then when things go wrong, I get hurt.

431
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,740
<14-25,House>-我不冷酷  我只是容易受伤  -我不了解你
<14-25,House>- I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable.  - I barely know you.

432
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,230
<14-26,Eucharist>我不知道我是不是对的  我希望我是
<14-26,Eucharist>And I don't know if I'm right. I just hope I am.

433
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,740
<14-26,Eucharist>因为如果不是
<14-26,Eucharist>Because the alternative is,

434
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,830
<14-26,Eucharist>你就真的和你看起来一样可怜了
<14-26,Eucharist>you really are as miserable as you seem to be.

435
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,030
<14-27,House>从你现在看我的眼神来看
<14-27,House>You know, from the way you're looking at me right now,

436
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,220
<14-27,House>你犯了第五宗罪
<14-27,House>I'd say you just hit number five.

437
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,630
<14-27,House>色欲
<14-27,House>Lust.

<15-1,Chase>How you feeling?

440
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,940
<15-2,Augustine>-有些虚弱  -那是因为氧气的原因
<15-2,Augustine>- A little weak. - That's from the oxygen.

441
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,440
<15-4,Augustine>我嘴巴很干
<15-4,Augustine>My mouth is dry.

442
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,790
<15-5,Chase>好吧  嗯  我去帮你拿你的茶
<15-5,Chase>Okay, well, uh, I'll get you some of your tea.

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,570
<16-1,Cuddy>混合性结缔组织病吗
<16-1,Cuddy>Mixed connective tissue disease?

444
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,820
<16-1,Cuddy>她的抗核抗体几乎没有升高
<16-1,Cuddy>Her ANA is barely elevated.

445
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,340
<16-2,House>谢谢您视察我的工作
<16-2,House>Well, thanks for checking upon her.

446
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,340
<16-2,House>贴身照料我
<16-2,House>Good to know you got my back.

<16-3,Cuddy>氧饱和度下降到83
<16-3,Cuddy>O2 sats down to 83.

448
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,150
<16-3,Cuddy>肺部问题  呼吸问题
<16-3,Cuddy>Pulmonary problems, breathing problems...

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,030
<16-4,House>氧气引起的刺激很典型
<16-4,House>Irritation from the oxygen is typical.

450
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
<16-5,Cuddy>她入院时只有皮疹
<16-5,Cuddy>She comes in with a rash,

451
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,060
<16-5,Cuddy>你却治出了心脏骤停
<16-5,Cuddy>and you put herinto cardiac arrest.

452
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,220
<16-6,House>你永远都不会罢休是吧
<16-6,House>That well just never runs dry, does it?

453
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,870
<16-6,House>如果她没有任何潜在问题
<16-6,House>If there was no underlying problem,

454
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,850
<16-6,House>为什么她的心跳仍然过快
<16-6,House>why is she still having the rapid heart rate?

455
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,410
<16-7,Cuddy>也许是强的松
<16-7,Cuddy>Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis

456
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,050
<16-7,Cuddy>所引发的疱疹性脑炎引起的
<16-7,Cuddy>caused by you giving her Prednisone.

457
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
<16-8,House>她的反应是一个症状  我没有失误
<16-8,House>Her reaction is a symptom, not an error.

458
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,770
<16-9,Cuddy>总是有原因的  是吧
<16-9,Cuddy>There's always an explanation, isn't there?

459
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,160
<16-10,House>可以这么说
<16-10,House>Yes, there is,

460
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,590
<16-10,House>如果这个解释不通  我们会找别的
<16-10,House>and if this one doesn't work, we'll find another.

461
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,120
<16-11,Cuddy>不过没有一个是因为你犯错了
<16-11,Cuddy>But never one involving you screwing up.

462
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,010
<16-12,House>找一个符合所有线索的
<16-12,House>One that fits all the facts.

463
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,370
<16-12,House>我们显然意见不同
<16-12,House>Look, we obviously have a difference of opinion,

464
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,390
<16-12,House>没关系
<16-12,House>and that's fine.

465
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,830
<16-12,House>我今天做的无用功
<16-12,House>I used up all the time I

466
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,390
<16-12,House>已经够多的了
<16-12,House>budgeted today for banging my head against a wall.

467
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,430
<16-13,Cuddy>我将从一个医生的角度
<16-13,Cuddy>I am gonna do you the biggest favor

468
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,200
<16-13,Cuddy>来帮你一个大忙
<16-13,Cuddy>one doctor can do for another.

469
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,460
<16-13,Cuddy>我不会让你害死自己的病人
<16-13,Cuddy>I am gonna stop you from killing your patient.

470
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,780
<16-13,Cuddy>这病人不归你管了
<16-13,Cuddy>You're off the case.

471
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,480
<17-1,Cuddy>我们对症下药吧
<17-1,Cuddy>We're gonna treat the symptoms.

472
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,750
<17-2,Cameron>不管其它的潜在病症了吗
<17-2,Cameron>Not the underlying condition?

473
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,100
<17-3,Cuddy>没有什么潜在的病
<17-3,Cuddy>There is no underlying condition.

474
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,080
<17-3,Cuddy>她现在怎么样了
<17-3,Cuddy>What's her status?

475
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,970
<17-4,Chase>呼吸困难
<17-4,Chase>The sister's breathing is labored.

476
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,290
<17-5,Cuddy>应该是高压氧舱导致的肺炎
<17-5,Cuddy>Pneumonitis from the hyperbaric chamber.

477
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,540
<17-5,Cuddy>给她用40%的氧气
<17-5,Cuddy>Put her on 40% oxygen

478
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,770
<17-5,Cuddy>直到她血氧饱和度有所增加
<17-5,Cuddy>until her O2 sats increase.

479
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,300
<17-6,Chase>尿素酶和肌酐都在升高
<17-6,Chase>BUN and creatinine's rising.

480
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,540
<17-6,Chase>ALT和AST是正常值的两倍
<17-6,Chase>ALT and AST twice the normal range.

481
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,430
<17-7,Cuddy>可能是低血压导致的
<17-7,Cuddy>Could be from the hypotensive episode.

482
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,280
<17-7,Cuddy>继续跟进实验室检查的结果吧
<17-7,Cuddy>Let's follow them with labs.

483
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,650
<17-8,Foreman>她入院时的疹子和关节痛仍未消失
<17-8,Foreman>She still has the rash and joint pain she came in with.

484
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,630
<17-9,Cuddy>用非甾体抗炎药
<17-9,Cuddy>Order a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.

485
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,910
<17-10,Cameron>我们和豪斯医生一起鉴别诊断时
<17-10,Cameron>When we were looking at the differential diagnosis with Dr. House,

486
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,460
<17-10,Cameron>我们认为
<17-10,Cameron>we were considering...

487
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,620
<17-11,Cuddy>我不想听豪斯医生的任何看法
<17-11,Cuddy>I don't need to hear what Dr. House was considering.

488
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,160
<17-11,Cuddy>这个女人的一切症状
<17-11,Cuddy>All of this woman's symptoms

489
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,350
<17-11,Cuddy>都可能是豪斯医生治疗的结果
<17-11,Cuddy>can be traced to Dr. House's considerations.

490
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,060
<17-11,Cuddy>好吧
<17-11,Cuddy>Okay.

491
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,420
<17-11,Cuddy>咱们赶紧让病人恢复健康
<17-11,Cuddy>Let's just get this patient healthy.

492
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,940
<17-11,Cuddy>我希望她能活着出去
<17-11,Cuddy>I want her going out the front door and not the back.

493
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,250
<18-1,Foreman>嘿  我没有背叛他
<18-1,Foreman>Hey, it's not like I betrayed him.

494
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,170
<18-1,Foreman>卡迪最终肯定会发现
<18-1,Foreman>Cuddy would've found out

495
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,710
<18-1,Foreman>我们用了高压氧舱的
<18-1,Foreman>about the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

496
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,630
<18-2,Cameron>你做的是份内的事情
<18-2,Cameron>You did what you felt you had to.

497
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,370
<18-2,Cameron>在这还没待够吗
<18-2,Cameron>Can't get enough of this place, huh?

498
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,850
<19-1,Wilson>我来找听诊器
<19-1,Wilson>I came for my stethoscope.

499
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,050
<19-2,House>我是不是不该纠结于你在那个
<19-2,House>So I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you

500
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,840
<19-3,Wilson>放着肾上腺素注射器的抽屉里找听诊器
<19-3,Wilson>were looking for it in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?

501
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,540
<19-4,House>对  我是想洗脱我的嫌疑
<19-4,House>Okay. Yeah. I'd like to cure my reputation.

502
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,500
<19-5,Wilson>好吧  我忘了你有多么
<19-5,Wilson>Oh, right, I forgot how much you care

503
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,500
<19-5,Wilson>在意别人的看法
<19-5,Wilson>about what people think.

504
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,030
<19-5,Wilson>让肠炎的病人抽烟
<19-5,Wilson>Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel?

505
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,860
<19-5,Wilson>会引发肺癌的
<19-5,Wilson>They cause lung cancer, you know.

506
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,600
<19-6,House>你知道为什么乳腺癌  结直肠癌  前列腺癌
<19-6,House>You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer,

507
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,080
<19-6,House>都有代表它们的丝带[社会关爱组织标志]
<19-6,House>colorectal cancer, prostate cancer,

508
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,220
<19-6,House>而肺癌却没有吗
<19-6,House>and not for lung cancer

509
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,580
<19-7,Wilson>颜色不够了吗
<19-7,Wilson>They...ran out of colors?

510
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,100
<19-8,House>因为人们责备得肺癌的人
<19-8,House>It's because people blame lung cancer patients.

511
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,330
<19-8,House>抽烟  是他们自作自受
<19-8,House>They smoke, they screwed up, they deserve to die.

512
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,350
<19-8,House>肺癌的人都是死于内疚
<19-8,House>The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt.

513
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,430
<19-9,Wilson>没错  内疚造成的伤害很大
<19-9,Wilson>Well, guilt does a lot of damage.

514
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,090
<19-10,House>你说得很有道理
<19-10,House>You said that with great significance.

515
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,210
<19-11,Wilson>你不是来这找你的听诊器
<19-11,Wilson>You're not here to find your stethoscope.

516
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,660
<19-11,Wilson>也不是来洗脱你的嫌疑
<19-11,Wilson>You're not here to clear your reputation.

517
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,530
<19-11,Wilson>你来这  是因为你也在怀疑
<19-11,Wilson>You're here because you're having doubts.

518
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,700
<19-11,Wilson>自己可能错了
<19-11,Wilson>You might've screwed off.

519
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,950
<19-12,House>来这是为了确信我是对的
<19-12,House>I'm here because if I'm right,

520
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,540
<19-12,House>卡迪会害死那个病人的
<19-12,House>Cuddy is killing that patient.

521
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,370
<19-13,Wilson>好吧
<19-13,Wilson>Okay.

522
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,960
<19-13,Wilson>但你要是错了呢
<19-13,Wilson>But if you're wrong?

523
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,530
<19-14,House>-那她就救了她  -行
<19-14,House>- Then she's saving her. - Fine.

524
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,490
<19-15,Wilson>你得仔细查看最近两天
<19-15,Wilson>You're gonna have to go through every record of

525
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,150
<19-15,Wilson>诊所每一个病人的病历
<19-15,Wilson>every patient who's been through this clinic in the last two days.

526
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,070
<19-15,Wilson>你还希望这些
<19-15,Wilson>And you're gonna have to hope

527
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,070
<19-15,Wilson>病历确实可信
<19-15,Wilson>that those records can be trusted.

528
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,870
<19-15,Wilson>顺便说一下  你的那些都不可信
<19-15,Wilson>Which, by the way, yours can't.

529
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,090
<20-1,Chase>修女  这些药片
<20-1,Chase>These pills'll help your

530
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,130
<20-1,Chase>可以帮助你恢复肾功能
<20-1,Chase>kidneys function a little better, Sister.

531
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,430
<20-1,Chase>看看你的脉搏
<20-1,Chase>Get your wrist.

532
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,700
<20-2,Augustine>怎么样
<20-2,Augustine>What's it at?

533
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,760
<20-3,Chase>104
<20-3,Chase>104

534
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,670
<20-4,Augustine>情况好吗
<20-4,Augustine>Is that good?

535
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,610
<20-5,Chase>挺好的
<20-5,Chase>It's fine.

536
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,730
<20-6,Augustine>奇斯医生  你不擅长撒谎
<20-6,Augustine>You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

537
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,870
<20-6,Augustine>妈妈呼叫
<20-6,Augustine>Call Mom

538
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,790
<20-7,Chase>不好意思  我得出去一趟
<20-7,Chase>I have to get this. Excuse me.

539
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,380
<21-1,Chase>我妈妈都死了十年了
<21-1,Chase>My mother's been dead for ten years.

540
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,750
<21-2,House>但她永远活在你心中
<21-2,House>But she's always with you in spirit.

541
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,190
<21-2,House>你知道那个修女的事吗
<21-2,House>What do you know about the nun?

542
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,000
<21-3,Chase>哪一个
<21-3,Chase>Which one?

543
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,070
<21-4,House>那个可爱的  我觉得她喜欢我
<21-4,House>The cute one. I think she likes me.

544
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,490
<21-4,House>当然是病的那个啊
<21-4,House>The sick one, obviously.

545
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,300
<21-5,Chase>她父母在她小时候就死了
<21-5,Chase>Her parents died when she was a child.

546
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,090
<21-5,Chase>之后她就一直在教堂里生活
<21-5,Chase>And she's been with the Church ever since.

547
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,010
<21-7,Chase>-她哪儿撒谎了  -为什么这么说
<21-7,Chase>- What's she lying about?  - Why do you say that?

548
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,380
<21-8,House>我从来都这么说
<21-8,House>I always say that.

549
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,690
<21-8,House>那个老修女认为
<21-8,House>And the old nun thinks

550
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,390
<21-8,House>生病的那个是个大骗子
<21-8,House>the sick nun is a big, fat nun liar.

551
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,710
<21-8,House>你很了解修女  你怎么看
<21-8,House>You know nuns. What do you think?

552
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,670
<21-9,Chase>我不了解修女
<21-9,Chase>I don't know nuns.

553
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,660
<21-10,House>你讨厌修女
<21-10,House>You hate nuns.

554
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,440
<21-10,House>你要不了解的话  是不会讨厌的
<21-10,House>You can't hate someone if you don't know them.

555
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
<21-11,Chase>了解纳粹吗  可能我就是讨厌她们
<21-11,Chase>Know any Nazis? Maybe I hate them on principle.

556
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,350
<21-12,House>关于好孩子是怎么变好的  我有个理论
<21-12,House>I have a theory about what makes good boys good.

557
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,140
<21-12,House>并不是什么道德觉悟
<21-12,House>It's not because of some moral imperative.

558
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,300
<21-12,House>好孩子对上帝心存畏惧
<21-12,House>Good boys have the fear of God put into them.

559
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,260
<21-12,House>天主教尤其擅长这种教育
<21-12,House>Catholic Church specializes in that kind of training.

560
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,730
<21-12,House>让好孩子们害怕上帝的惩罚
<21-12,House>To make good boys afraid of divine retribution.

561
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,750
<21-12,House>所以他们会对父母唯命是从
<21-12,House>So they'll do what their daddies tell 'em.

562
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,070
<21-12,House>比如说
<21-12,House>Like, for example,

563
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,860
<21-12,House>他们不希望自己的孩子去学医
<21-12,House>going into medical school when it's the last thing they want to do.

564
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,570
<21-12,House>你觉得呢
<21-12,House>What do you think?

565
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,980
<21-13,Chase>我觉得如果她真的撒谎的话  院长会知道
<21-13,Chase>I think if she did have a secret, her boss would know.

566
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,860
<22-1,House>你们最近粉刷了或者买了新的地毯吗
<22-1,House>Did you paint or put in new carpets recently?

567
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,600
<22-2,Nun>没有
<22-2,Nun>No.

568
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,590
<22-3,House>她有可能接触到药品吗
<22-3,House>Any way she could've got access to drugs?

569
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,120
<22-4,Nun>我们的药都锁在医务室里
<22-4,Nun>Well, we lock all our medications in the infirmary,

570
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,110
<22-4,Nun>而且我们这也没有处方药
<22-4,Nun>and we don't keep prescription drugs here.

571
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,700
<22-4,Nun>为什么不直接问奥古斯丁修女呢
<22-4,Nun>Why haven't you asked sister Augustine about these things directly?

572
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,210
<22-5,House>我发现  如果你想
<22-5,House>I found that when you want to know

573
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,510
<22-5,House>真正了解一个人
<22-5,House>the truth about someone,

574
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,000
<22-5,House>一般最后才去问这个人
<22-5,House>that someone is probably the last person you should ask.

575
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,260
<22-6,Nun>你和尤凯瑞斯修女聊过了吗
<22-6,Nun>And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?

576
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,160
<22-7,House>她很快就出卖了她的同伴
<22-7,House>She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly.

577
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,230
<22-7,House>如果我是你  肯定让她回来重念修女学校
<22-7,House>If I were you, I'd have her repeat a year of nun school.

578
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,990
<22-8,Nun>修女并不是圣人
<22-8,Nun>Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.

579
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,960
<22-9,House>医生也并不能治百病
<22-9,House>Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.

580
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,150
<22-10,Nun>虽然我们住在修道院
<22-10,Nun>And just because we live in a monastery

581
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,740
<22-10,Nun>大部分时间都在祈祷
<22-10,Nun>and we spend most of our time in prayer

582
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,670
<22-10,Nun>但我们的生活同样很有戏剧性
<22-10,Nun>doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.

583
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,230
<22-11,House>那病了的修女  有些什么戏份
<22-11,House>So what is the sick one's drama?

584
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,420
<22-12,Nun>奥古斯丁修女来我们这之前
<22-12,Nun>Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care

585
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,320
<22-12,Nun>一直住在天主教寄养机构
<22-12,Nun>until she came to us.

586
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,250
<22-12,Nun>要茶吗
<22-12,Nun>Tea?

587
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,430
<22-13,House>好
<22-13,House>Sure.

588
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,610
<22-13,House>你们都会撒谎吗
<22-13,House>Do all of you lie?

589
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,590
<22-13,House>这个策略不错
<22-13,House>It's a good strategy.

590
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,490
<22-13,House>谎言重复起来很简单
<22-13,House>It's simpler when you tell the same lie.

591
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,530
<22-13,House>但她并非一直都是个好的天主教徒
<22-13,House>But she does not spend her entire life as a good Catholic.

592
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,250
<22-13,House>她心脏骤停时
<22-13,House>When she had a cardiac arrest,

593
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,120
<22-13,House>我解开她的衬衫  做心肺复苏
<22-13,House>I had to open her blouse to do CPR.

594
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,640
<22-13,House>结果发现了两件事
<22-13,House>And I learned two things.

595
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,530
<22-13,House>修女也可以有傲人的胸部
<22-13,House>Nuns can have nice breasts.

596
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,770
<22-13,House>而且她肩膀上有纹身
<22-13,House>And she has a tattoo on her shoulder.

597
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,260
<22-13,House>是只臭鼬
<22-13,House>Of a skunk.

598
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,510
<22-13,House>可能那只臭鼬是约瑟夫的化身
<22-13,House>Now, maybe this was the sacred skunk of Joseph,

599
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,250
<22-13,House>但据我所知
<22-13,House>but as far as I know,

600
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,590
<22-12,Nun>天主教寄养机构里
<22-12,Nun>Catholic foster care and monasteries

601
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,130
<22-13,House>并没有纹身店
<22-13,House>do not keep tattoo parlors in their refectories.

602
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,620
<22-14,Nun>我们认为我们的生命
<22-14,Nun>We consider that our life begins...

603
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,210
<22-14,Nun>从我们许下誓言的那一刻才正式开始
<22-14,Nun>... when we put on our habits and take our vows.

604
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,520
<22-14,Nun>在此之前发生的一切
<22-14,Nun>What happens before then...

605
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,400
<22-15,House>和你无关  但和我有关
<22-15,House>It's irrelevant to you. But it's relevant to me.

606
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,310
<22-15,House>奥古斯丁修女
<22-15,House>Sister Augustine went

607
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,710
<22-16,Nun>六岁时去了天主教寄养机构
<22-16,Nun>into foster care when she was six years old.

608
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,830
<22-16,Nun>但十二岁时她离开了
<22-16,Nun>But she left when she was 12.

609
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,420
<22-16,Nun>她流落街头  染上了毒瘾
<22-16,Nun>She lived on the streets, she got into drugs.

610
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,260
<22-16,Nun>十五岁时  她怀孕了
<22-16,Nun>When she was 15, she became pregnant.

611
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,880
<22-16,Nun>她想自己流产
<22-16,Nun>Tried to self-abort.

612
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,070
<22-16,Nun>她的孩子没了  她也病了
<22-16,Nun>She lost the child, she became ill.

613
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,160
<22-16,Nun>她回来时  我们收留了她
<22-16,Nun>We took her in when she came back.

614
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,770
<22-16,Nun>如果这些和医学相关
<22-16,Nun>If we had thought that it was medically relevant,

615
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,040
<22-16,Nun>我们肯定会告诉你的
<22-16,Nun>we would have told you.

616
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,970
<22-17,House>确实无关
<22-17,House>It's not.

617
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,260
<22-17,House>这茶味道不错
<22-17,House>This tea is delicious.

618
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,490
<22-17,House>本地的吗
<22-17,House>Local herbs?

619
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,200
<23-1,Cuddy>用药后病人情况有变化吗
<23-1,Cuddy>Any change with the medication?

620
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,420
<23-2,Chase>变得更糟了  肺功能也在恶化
<23-2,Chase>Yeah, she's getting worse. Lung functions deteriorating,

621
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,350
<23-2,Chase>尿素酶和肌酐持续上升
<23-2,Chase>BUN and creatinine continuing to rise.

622
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,500
<23-2,Chase>病人发烧  疹子也在扩散
<23-2,Chase>She's starting to run a fever, and the rash is spreading.

623
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,400
<23-2,Chase>这样下去  她活不过圣诞
<23-2,Chase>At this rate,she's not gonna make Christmas.

624
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,190
<23-3,Cameron>或许豪斯是对的
<23-3,Cameron>Maybe House was right.

625
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,220
<23-3,Cameron>或许确实有些潜在病症
<23-3,Cameron>Maybe there is an underlying

626
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,410
<23-3,Cameron>导致了这些症状
<23-3,Cameron>condition that explains the symptoms.

627
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,960
<23-3,Cameron>一些我们没考虑到的病
<23-3,Cameron>Something we haven't considered.

628
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,600
<23-4,Cuddy>比如说
<23-4,Cuddy>Like what?

629
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,520
<23-5,Cameron>可能是代谢紊乱
<23-5,Cameron>It could be a metabolic disorder.

630
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,130
<23-5,Cameron>-具体点  -可能是遗传病
<23-5,Cameron>- Specifically?  - Might be genetic.

631
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,580
<23-6,Cuddy>再具体点
<23-6,Cuddy>Specifically?

632
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,410
<23-9,Cameron>我只是说
<23-9,Cameron>I'm just saying that...

633
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,810
<23-10,Cuddy>你只是说你觉得豪斯是对的
<23-10,Cuddy>You're just saying you think House is right.

634
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,280
<23-11,Cameron>可能是对的
<23-11,Cameron>Might be right.

635
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,350
<23-12,Cuddy>他当然可能是对的
<23-12,Cuddy>Of course he might be right.

636
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,910
<23-12,Cuddy>这还可能是上帝的旨意
<23-12,Cuddy>It might be the hand of God at work.

637
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,000
<23-12,Cuddy>你要没有确凿的证据
<23-12,Cuddy>Don't say it's something else

638
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,740
<23-12,Cuddy>就不要乱说
<23-12,Cuddy>unless you've got something concrete to offer.

639
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,880
<23-12,Cuddy>这是什么  毒芹吗
<23-12,Cuddy>What's this? Hemlock?

640
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,340
<23-12,Cuddy>这是我从一个医生的角度
<23-12,Cuddy>I'm gonna do you the biggest favor

641
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,280
<23-12,Cuddy>帮你最大的一个忙
<23-12,Cuddy>one doctor can do for another.

642
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,670
<23-13,House>来阻止你害死你的病人
<23-13,House>I'm gonna stop you from killing your patient.

643
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,560
<23-13,House>这是玄参茶
<23-13,House>It's figwort tea.

644
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,730
<23-13,House>很不错的提神饮料
<23-13,House>Great for that little pick-me-up

645
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,830
<23-13,House>我们早上常喝
<23-13,House>we're all looking for in the morning.

646
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,650
<23-13,House>增加肺活量
<23-13,House>Opens the lungs,

647
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,650
<23-13,House>升血压  还刺激心脏
<23-13,House>increases the blood pressure, stimulates the heart.

648
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,520
<23-13,House>不幸的是
<23-13,House>Unfortunately,

649
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,110
<23-13,House>只要注射0.1毫升的肾上腺素
<23-13,House>if you then get injected with even 0.1cc of epinephrine,

650
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,290
<23-16,Foreman>就会造成心跳骤停
<23-16,Foreman>instant cardiac arrest.

651
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,410
<23-16,Foreman>不过  管他呢  味道挺不错的
<23-16,Foreman>Still, what the hell, it tastes great.

652
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,790
<23-15,House>奥古斯丁修女她
<23-15,House>Sister Augustine...

653
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,450
<23-15,House>经常很虔诚地喝这个茶
<23-15,House>...has been drinking it religiously, so to speak.

654
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,590
<23-16,Foreman>如果不考虑心脏问题的话
<23-16,Foreman>And if you take the cardiac arrest out of the equation...

655
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,710
<23-17,House>其它所有的症状
<23-17,House>all the rest of the symptoms can

656
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,270
<23-17,House>都可以用长期严重过敏来解释
<23-17,House>be explained by a severe long-term allergic reaction.

657
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,630
<23-18,Foreman>正如卡梅隆当初说的
<23-18,Foreman>Well, that's what Cameron said in the beginning.

658
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,180
<23-19,House>没错  她是说过
<23-19,House>Yes. She did.

659
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,340
<23-19,House>做得好
<23-19,House>Well done.

660
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,980
<23-19,House>但你不能坚持自己的诊断
<23-19,House>But your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis

661
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,870
<23-19,House>差点害死了这个女人
<23-19,House>almost killed this woman.

662
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,670
<23-19,House>多向福曼学学
<23-19,House>Take a lesson from Foreman

663
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,510
<23-19,House>如何坚持己见
<23-19,House>and stand up for what you believe.

664
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,840
<23-19,House>好了  让我们想想怎么救这个修女吧
<23-19,House>Okay. Let's go figure out how to save a nun.

665
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,170
<23-20,Chase>做也不对  不做也不对
<23-20,Chase>Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

666
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,200
<24-1,House>因为太久没有治疗
<24-1,House>'Cause it's been untreated for so long,

667
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,200
<24-1,House>这过敏从流眼泪
<24-1,House>it's gone from a simple watery eyes,

668
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,670
<24-1,House>喉咙痒
<24-1,House>scratchy throat allergy

669
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,460
<24-1,House>恶化到了能置人于死地的程度
<24-1,House>to a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy.

670
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,760
<24-1,House>威胁到了她的免疫系统
<24-1,House>Compromising her immune system,

671
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,670
<24-1,House>让她无法自愈
<24-1,House>diminishing her ability to heal,

672
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,530
<24-1,House>还损害了她的很多器官
<24-1,House>and breaking down her organ systems.

673
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,320
<24-1,House>那过敏原是什么
<24-1,House>So what's the source?

674
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,630
<24-2,Chase>清洁皂
<24-2,Chase>The dish soap.

675
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,260
<24-3,House>不  她好几天没洗碗了
<24-3,House>No, symptoms persisted days

676
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,260
<24-2,Chase>症状还是没好转
<24-2,Chase>after the dish washing episode.

677
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,490
<24-3,House>应该是她在医院
<24-3,House>It's gotta be something she's been exposed to here

678
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,300
<24-3,House>和修道院都能接触到的东西
<24-3,House>in the hospital, as well as the monastery.

679
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,200
<24-4,Foreman>会不会是那个茶
<24-4,Foreman>Well, what about the tea?

680
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,650
<24-4,Foreman>是它导致了心律不齐
<24-4,Foreman>It caused her arrhythmia.

681
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,180
<24-5,House>有可能  但不能确定
<24-5,House>Aah, could be, but it's not definitive.

682
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,550
<24-6,Chase>我们可以做皮肤测试
<24-6,Chase>We'll skin test for allergies.

683
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,840
<24-7,Cameron>暂时不行  她的过敏反应太强烈了
<24-7,Cameron>Not yet, she's too reactive.

684
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
<24-7,Cameron>所有东西都会呈阳性反应
<24-7,Cameron>She'll test positiveto everything.

685
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,380
<24-7,Cameron>我们得先让她稳定下来
<24-7,Cameron>We need to stabilize her,

686
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,050
<24-7,Cameron>把她和所有可能的过敏原隔离
<24-7,Cameron>isolate her from all possible allergens

687
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,320
<24-7,Cameron>让她的免疫系统休息一会
<24-7,Cameron>and give her system a rest.

688
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,760
<24-8,Chase>把她搬到洁净室
<24-8,Chase>Get her in the clean room.

689
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,110
<24-9,House>行  然后让她依次接触
<24-9,House>Okay, then we'll gradually

690
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,830
<24-9,House>可能的过敏原  看她的反应如何
<24-9,House>introduce allergens to see how she responds.

691
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,840
<24-9,House>当她对某样东西过敏的时候
<24-9,House>When she reacts to something,

692
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,610
<24-9,House>我们就知道罪魁祸首究竟是什么了
<24-9,House>we'll know that's what's killing her.

693
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,500
<25-1,Foreman>好了  没有电视  也没有书
<25-1,Foreman>There you go. No television, no books.

694
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,190
<25-2,Augustine>连圣经也不行吗
<25-2,Augustine>Not even my Bible?

695
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,020
<25-3,Foreman>恐怕不行
<25-3,Foreman>I'm afraid not.

696
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,200
<25-3,Foreman>这个房间里的空气和水都是过滤了的
<25-3,Foreman>This room has filtered air, filtered water.

697
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,770
<25-3,Foreman>连床单都是丝绸的
<25-3,Foreman>You even have silk sheets.

698
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,630
<25-3,Foreman>不会引起过敏的被单
<25-3,Foreman>Very decadent and hypoallergenic.

699
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,550
<25-3,Foreman>你在这里会好起来的
<25-3,Foreman>You should be feeling better here.

700
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,540
<25-4,Chase>我们过一会回来复查
<25-4,Chase>We'll be back to check on you in a little while.

701
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,160
<25-5,Augustine>其它的修女们能进来和我一起祈祷吗
<25-5,Augustine>Can the other sisters come in and pray with me?

702
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,880
<25-6,Chase>最好不要有任何的拜访者
<25-6,Chase>It'd be better if you don't have any visitors.

703
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,540
<25-6,Chase>一旦隔绝了你的过敏原
<25-6,Chase>Once we isolate what's causing your allergy,

704
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,600
<25-6,Chase>我们大家都可以放松了
<25-6,Chase>then we can be a little more relax.

705
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,080
<25-6,Chase>我可以和你一起祈祷
<25-6,Chase>I-I can pray with you.

706
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,670
<25-7,Augustine>我不想死
<25-7,Augustine>I don't want to die.

707
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,220
<25-7,Augustine>为什么上帝要抛弃我
<25-7,Augustine>Why has He left me?

708
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,300
<25-7,Augustine>当我还在神学院的时候
<25-7,Augustine>I was in seminary school.

709
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,090
<25-8,Chase>他们问我们最喜欢圣经里的哪个段落
<25-8,Chase>They asked us once what our favorite passage was.

710
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,290
<25-8,Chase>我选择了彼得前书的第一章第七节
<25-8,Chase>I chose First Peter 1:7.

711
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,970
<25-8,Chase>一切都只是在测试你的信仰
<25-8,Chase>"These trials only test your faith."

712
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,630
<25-8,Chase>试其是否坚定且纯粹
<25-8,Chase>"To see whether or not it is strong and pure."

713
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,750
<25-8,Chase>你在经历试炼
<25-8,Chase>"Your faith is being tested."

714
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,650
<25-8,Chase>就如同用火萃取真金一般
<25-8,Chase>"As fire tests gold and purifies it."

715
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,210
<25-9,Augustine>你的信仰对于上帝来说
<25-9,Augustine>"And your faith is far more precious.

716
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,810
<25-9,Augustine>比金子更宝贵
<25-9,Augustine>To the Lord than mere gold."

717
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,600
<25-9,Augustine>在经历之后
<25-9,Augustine>"So if your faith remains strong.”

718
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,680
<25-9,Augustine>信仰依然忠贞
<25-9,Augustine>"After being tested,

719
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,380
<25-9,Augustine>会带给你赞美与荣光
<25-9,Augustine>it will bring you much praise and glory and honor"

720
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,380
<25-9,Augustine>那一日  主  再临人间
<25-9,Augustine>"On the day of His return."

721
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,840
<25-10,Chase>上帝没有抛弃你
<25-10,Chase>He hasn't left you.

722
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,020
<25-10,Chase>能让你知道上帝
<25-10,Chase>The only thing in the way

723
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,020
<25-10,Chase>存在的唯一方法就是恐惧
<25-10,Chase>of you knowing He's there is your fear.

724
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,080
<25-10,Chase>你要做出选择  诚心或恐惧
<25-10,Chase>You have a choice. Faith or fear.

725
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,550
<25-10,Chase>这就是考验
<25-10,Chase>That's the test.

726
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,980
<25-11,Augustine>选择诚心并不意味着我不会死
<25-11,Augustine>Choosing faith doesn't mean I won't die.

727
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,540
<25-12,Chase>但是会影响到你对死的感知
<25-12,Chase>But it will affect how you will experience your death.

728
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,000
<25-12,Chase>还有你的余生
<25-12,Chase>And therefore your life.

729
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,080
<25-12,Chase>这是你的选择
<25-12,Chase>It's up to you.

730
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,300
<25-13,Augustine>为什么你要离开神学院
<25-13,Augustine>Why did you leave seminary school?

731
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,370
<25-13,Augustine>那个测试
<25-13,Augustine>That test...

732
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,840
<25-14,Chase>你通过了  而我没有
<25-14,Chase>...you passed, I didn't.

733
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,870
<26-1,Cameron>有变化的话我们会通知你的
<26-1,Cameron>We'll call you if anything changes.

734
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:28,660
<26-2,Eucharist>她会好起来的吧
<26-2,Eucharist>Will she be all right?

735
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,690
<26-3,Foreman>只要她不暴露在任何加剧她过敏的东西下
<26-3,Foreman>As long as she's not exposed to anything that can aggravate her allergy,

736
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,490
<26-3,Foreman>她会好的
<26-3,Foreman>she'll be fine.

737
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,230
<26-4,Chase>这里需要帮忙
<26-4,Chase>Need some help in here.

738
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,820
<26-4,Chase>别管什么程序了  她正在过敏性休克
<26-4,Chase>Screw the procedure. She's in anaphylactic shock.

739
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,010
<26-5,Foreman>不可能  他在隔离间里
<26-5,Foreman>No way, she's in the damn clean room!

740
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,910
<26-5,Foreman>你在开玩笑吗
<26-5,Foreman>Are you kidding me?

741
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,850
<26-6,Chase>快进来
<26-6,Chase>Get in here!

742
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,830
<26-6,Chase>0.1毫升肾上腺素
<26-6,Chase>Point-one cc of epi.

743
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,670
<26-7,Foreman>我们必须插管
<26-7,Foreman>We've got to intubate.

744
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,390
<26-8,Cameron>我拿到了  拿上急救袋
<26-8,Cameron>I got it. Get the ambu bag.

745
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,470
<26-8,Cameron>插好了
<26-8,Cameron>I'm in.

746
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,140
<26-8,Cameron>呼吸稳定
<26-8,Cameron>Breathing stabilized.

747
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,020
<26-9,Chase>这是隔离间
<26-9,Chase>It's a clean room.

748
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,760
<27-1,House>在隔离间里怎么能过敏呢
<27-1,House>How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room?

749
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,870
<27-2,Wilson>可能是因为IV的防腐剂
<27-2,Wilson>Maybe it was the preservatives in the IV.

750
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,580
<27-3,House>查查看
<27-3,House>Checked that.

751
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,220
<27-4,Wilson>-乳胶管呢  -也查一查
<27-4,Wilson>- Latex tubing?  - Checked that.

752
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,200
<27-5,House>每样东西都查一查
<27-5,House>Checked everything.

753
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,910
<27-6,Wilson>也可能是肥大细胞白血病
<27-6,Wilson>Well, it could be mast cell leukemia.

754
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,910
<27-6,Wilson>也可以引起过敏
<27-6,Wilson>It can cause anaphylaxis.

755
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,290
<27-7,House>我们验过血了
<27-7,House>We checked the blood levels.

756
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,800
<27-7,House>不是嗜曙红细胞过多也不是特发性过敏症
<27-7,House>And it's not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylaxis.

757
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,390
<27-8,Wilson>可能是主的意愿
<27-8,Wilson>Maybe it's just divine will.

758
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,860
<27-9,House>但非我的意愿
<27-9,House>It's not my will.

759
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,090
<27-10,Wilson>你应该知道
<27-10,Wilson>You do realize,

760
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,440
<27-10,Wilson>如果你对全局的看法是错误的话
<27-10,Wilson>if you're wrong... about the big picture, that is...

761
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,890
<27-10,Wilson>你会发火的  是吗
<27-10,Wilson>you're going to burn, right?

762
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,520
<27-11,House>那你想我怎么样  接受它  放弃它
<27-11,House>What do you want me to do? Just accept it, pack it in?

763
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,940
<27-12,Wilson>没错  我想要你接受
<27-12,Wilson>Yeah, I want you to accept

764
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,350
<27-12,Wilson>有些病人会毫无原因地死亡
<27-12,Wilson>that sometimes patients die against all reason.

765
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,420
<27-12,Wilson>有时候也会突然之间好转
<27-12,Wilson>And sometimes they get better against all reason.

766
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,190
<27-13,House>这不可能的  只是我们不知道原因而已
<27-13,House>No, they don't. We just don't know the reason.

767
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,710
<27-14,Wilson>我认为修女们会同意你的观点的
<27-14,Wilson>I think the nuns would agree with you on that.

768
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,060
<28-1,Cameron>我只是想告诉你
<28-1,Cameron>I just wanted to say that

769
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,260
<28-1,Cameron>你已经尽力了
<28-1,Cameron>I know you did everything you could.

770
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,570
<28-2,House>我不需要由来你认同我的工作
<28-2,House>I don't need verification from you to know that I'm doing my job well.

771
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,990
<28-2,House>那是你的问题  不是我的
<28-2,House>That's your problem, not mine.

772
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,550
<28-3,Cameron>我只是好心
<28-3,Cameron>I was just being nice.

773
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,850
<28-4,House>好吧  你不用总是这么做的
<28-4,House>Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that.

774
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,650
<28-5,Cameron>圣诞快乐
<28-5,Cameron>Merry Christmas.

775
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,440
<28-6,Chase>奥古斯丁修女已经能正常呼吸了
<28-6,Chase>Sister Augustine's been extubated.

776
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,690
<28-7,House>很好
<28-7,House>Good.

777
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,530
<28-8,Chase>她不听劝阻执意要出院
<28-8,Chase>She's requested to check out against medical advice.

778
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,350
<28-8,Chase>她想回修道院
<28-8,Chase>She wants to go back to the monastery.

779
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,410
<28-9,House>好吧  叫她走吧
<28-9,House>Well, talk her out of it.

780
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,600
<28-10,Chase>我认为我不应该同意她走
<28-10,Chase>I think I may have talked her into it.

781
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,950
<29-1,House>本周的住院费都交过了
<29-1,House>Room's paid up for the rest of the week.

782
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,120
<29-1,House>最好还是多住几天吧
<29-1,House>Might as well stick around.

783
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,330
<29-2,Augustine>这个病是对我信仰的考验
<29-2,Augustine>This illness is a test of my faith.

784
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,150
<29-2,Augustine>如果上帝想我死
<29-2,Augustine>If it's his will to take me,

785
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,310
<29-2,Augustine>那我在哪里死都一样的
<29-2,Augustine>it doesn't matter where I am.

786
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,990
<29-2,Augustine>我能欣然接受的
<29-2,Augustine>I can accept that.

787
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,360
<29-3,House>有人会相信你说的东西吗
<29-3,House>Does anybody believe anything you say?

788
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,480
<29-3,House>你不是在欣然接受
<29-3,House>You're not accepting.

789
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,080
<29-3,House>你是在逃避
<29-3,House>You're running away.

790
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,970
<29-3,House>你一直都这么干
<29-3,House>Just like you always do.

791
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,710
<29-3,House>你为了过平常人的生活从修道院里跑出去
<29-3,House>You ran away from the monastery to get laid.

792
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,000
<29-3,House>你觉得平常人的生活没意思了
<29-3,House>You ran away from the real world

793
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,380
<29-3,House>又跑回修道院里去了
<29-3,House>when getting laid didn't work out so good.

794
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,890
<29-3,House>今时不同往日  别逃避了
<29-3,House>Now things aren't working out again, so off you go.

795
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,420
<29-4,Augustine>为什么让你信奉上帝那么难呢
<29-4,Augustine>Why is it so difficult for you to believe in God?

796
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,790
<29-5,House>困难的原因
<29-5,House>What I have difficulty with

797
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,790
<29-5,House>是因为自信
<29-5,House>is the whole concept of belief.

798
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,200
<29-5,House>信仰不是基于逻辑和经验的
<29-5,House>Faith isn't based on logic and experience.

799
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,490
<29-6,Augustine>我每天都能感觉到上帝的存在
<29-6,Augustine>I experience God on a daily basis.

800
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,970
<29-6,Augustine>还有身边生命的奇迹
<29-6,Augustine>And the miracle of life all around.

801
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,130
<29-6,Augustine>新生命的奇迹
<29-6,Augustine>The miracle of birth.

802
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,690
<29-6,Augustine>爱情的奇迹
<29-6,Augustine>The miracle of love.

803
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,150
<29-6,Augustine>上帝与我常在
<29-6,Augustine>He is always with me.

804
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,630
<29-7,House>对于先天不足的婴儿来说  奇迹在哪呢
<29-7,House>Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby?

805
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,630
<29-7,House>她的母亲放弃了她
<29-7,House>And watching her mother abandon her

806
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,690
<29-7,House>因为她的妈妈想要正常的孩子
<29-7,House>'cause she needs another score.

807
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,330
<29-6,Augustine>爱的奇迹
<29-6,Augustine>Miracle of love.

808
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,330
<29-7,House>被所爱的人杀的机率大大超过
<29-7,House>You are over twice as likely to be killed

809
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,460
<29-7,House>被陌生人杀的机率
<29-7,House>by the person you love than by a stranger.

810
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,670
<29-8,Augustine>你是想叫我放弃信仰吗
<29-8,Augustine>Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?

811
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,140
<29-9,House>死后  你的灵魂里
<29-9,House>You can have all the faith you want

812
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,140
<29-9,House>你爱信什么信什么
<29-9,House>in spirits and the afterlife.

813
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,780
<29-9,House>还有天堂和地狱里
<29-9,House>And heaven and hell.

814
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,750
<29-9,House>但当你还在这个世界的时候  别傻了
<29-9,House>But when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot.

815
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,190
<29-9,House>你当然可以和我说
<29-9,House>'Cause you can tell me that you

816
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,290
<29-9,House>你是靠对上帝的信仰过活
<29-9,House>put your faith in God to get you through the day.

817
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,320
<29-9,House>但当你过马路的时候
<29-9,House>But when it comes time to cross the road,

818
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,500
<29-9,House>你还是会看看有没有车
<29-9,House>I know you look both ways.

819
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,970
<29-10,Augustine>我不相信他会搭救我
<29-10,Augustine>I don't believe he is inside me and is going to save me.

820
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,310
<29-10,Augustine>我相信不管我生或死他都与我同在
<29-10,Augustine>I believe He is inside me whether I live or die.

821
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,710
<29-11,House>那你最好还是活着
<29-11,House>Then you might as well live.

822
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,110
<29-11,House>押我比押上帝更容易赢
<29-11,House>You got a better shot betting on me than on Him.

823
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,470
<29-11,House>在我15岁的时候
<29-11,House>When I was 15,

824
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,650
<29-12,Augustine>我采取了所有我知道的避孕方法
<29-12,Augustine>I was on every kind of birth control known to man.

825
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,840
<29-12,Augustine>但我还是怀孕了
<29-12,Augustine>And I still got pregnant.

826
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,080
<29-12,Augustine>我恨上帝
<29-12,Augustine>I blamed God.

827
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,300
<29-12,Augustine>恨他毁了我的生活
<29-12,Augustine>I hated Him for ruining my life.

828
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,420
<29-12,Augustine>但我意识到
<29-12,Augustine>But then I realized something.

829
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,770
<29-12,Augustine>你不能对上帝生气的同时也信奉着上帝
<29-12,Augustine>You can't be angry with God  and not believe in Him at the same time.

830
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,460
<29-12,Augustine>没人可以
<29-12,Augustine>No one can.

831
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,950
<29-12,Augustine>你也不例外  豪斯医生
<29-12,Augustine>Not even you, Dr. House.

832
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,970
<30-1,Wilson>怎样了
<30-1,Wilson>How'd it go?

833
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,800
<30-2,House>她虔诚地信奉着上帝
<30-2,House>She has God inside her.

834
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,120
<30-2,House>一定对肿瘤治疗很有帮助
<30-2,House>Would've been easier to deal with a tumor.

835
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,950
<30-3,Wilson>可能她对上帝过敏
<30-3,Wilson>Maybe she's allergic to God.

836
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,080
<30-3,Wilson>我们检查过她所有能引起她过敏的地方
<30-3,Wilson>We've looked everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction

837
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,940
<30-2,House>除了一个地方
<30-2,House>except one place.

838
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,950
<30-2,House>体内
<30-2,House>Inside her.

839
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,980
<31-2,Foreman>病史里她没有做过手术啊
<31-2,Foreman>On her medical history, she didn't mention any surgery.

840
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,990
<31-3,House>有过一次
<31-3,House>She had one.

841
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,290
<31-4,Cameron>我们能拿到记录吗
<31-4,Cameron>Can we get her records?

842
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,200
<31-4,Cameron>是在什么医院做的手术
<31-4,Cameron>What hospital was it at?

843
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,470
<31-5,House>她没有在医院里做手术
<31-5,House>She didn't have it at a hospital.

844
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,560
<31-5,House>给她做个全身检查
<31-5,House>Order a full body scan.

845
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,110
<31-6,Chase>她要是拒绝怎么办
<31-6,Chase>What if she refuses?

846
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,930
<31-7,House>告诉她我在寻找奇迹
<31-7,House>Tell her I'm looking for a miracle.

847
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,780
<32-1,Foreman>没有穿孔  也没有填充物
<32-1,Foreman>No piercings. No fillings.

848
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,880
<32-1,Foreman>手臂里也没有外科手术针
<32-1,Foreman>No surgical pins in the arm.

849
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,440
<32-2,Chase>-没有植入物  -相当干净了
<32-2,Chase>- No implants. - It's clean as a whistle.

850
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,120
<32-2,Chase>豪斯到底在找什么
<32-2,Chase>What's House looking for?

851
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,260
<32-3,Foreman>那是什么东西
<32-3,Foreman>What is that?

852
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,060
<32-4,Chase>不知道
<32-4,Chase>Don't know.

853
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,160
<32-5,Foreman>锁定它  获取三维立体图
<32-5,Foreman>Lock on it. Get a 3-D representation.

854
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,670
<32-6,Cameron>噢  天啊
<32-6,Cameron>Oh, my God.

855
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,340
<33-1,House>铜环
<33-1,House>The copper cross.

856
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,310
<33-1,House>80年代用的避孕手段
<33-1,House>A form of birth control pulled off the market in the '80s.

857
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,500
<33-2,Foreman>所以她对铜过敏
<33-2,Foreman>So she's allergic to copper?

858
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,310
<33-3,House>很罕见  但是就是这样
<33-3,House>Rare, but it happens.

859
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,100
<33-4,Chase>难道她不知道她有宫内节育器吗
<33-4,Chase>Didn't she know she had an IUD?

860
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,280
<33-5,House>她流产过
<33-5,House>She had an abortion.

861
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,590
<33-5,House>宫内节育器一定是脱落了
<33-5,House>IUD must have been left in,

862
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,580
<33-5,House>埋入在子宫内膜组织上
<33-5,House>embedded in the endometrial tissue

863
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,380
<33-5,House>所以谁都没有发现
<33-5,House>where it couldn't be detected.

864
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,050
<33-6,Chase>所以我们要做的只是移除宫内节育器
<33-6,Chase>So all we have to do is remove the IUD.

865
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,770
<34-1,Chase>你就会好起来的了
<34-1,Chase>Then the symptoms should subside.

866
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,930
<34-2,Augustine>我15岁的时候就上了这个节育器
<34-2,Augustine>I got this IUD when I was 15.

867
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,260
<34-2,Augustine>都有20多年了
<34-2,Augustine>I-it's been more than 20 years.

868
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,950
<34-3,Chase>持续地暴露在低过敏症状中
<34-3,Chase>prolonged exposure to an allergen with minimal symptoms.

869
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,830
<34-3,Chase>但有些时候
<34-3,Chase>But at some point,

870
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,450
<34-3,Chase>只需要一次接触就会全面爆发
<34-3,Chase>all it takes is one last contact to cause a full-blown reaction.

871
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,630
<34-3,Chase>就像充满气的气球
<34-3,Chase>It's like a balloon filled with air.

872
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,290
<34-3,Chase>再吹一口气就会爆炸了
<34-3,Chase>One last breath, it explodes.

873
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,540
<34-4,Augustine>我第一次出现疹子
<34-4,Augustine>The first time I got the rash

874
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,200
<34-4,Augustine>是在我洗铜制的炊具的时候
<34-4,Augustine>was when I was washing the copper cookware.

875
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,250
<34-5,Chase>你之后所有的并发症
<34-5,Chase>And all your subsequent

876
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,500
<34-5,Chase>都是由于你吃了那个炊具做出来的食物
<34-5,Chase>symptoms came from ingesting food prepared in it.

877
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,600
<34-6,Augustine>豪斯医生发现了他的奇迹
<34-6,Augustine>Dr. House found his miracle.

878
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,100
<34-7,Chase>他不会这样说的
<34-7,Chase>I doubt he'll interpret it that way.

879
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,600
<34-8,Augustine>你告诉了我你最喜欢的节选
<34-8,Augustine>You told me your favorite passage.

880
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,730
<34-8,Augustine>你想知道我的吗
<34-8,Augustine>Would you like to hear mine?

881
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,760
<34-8,Augustine>高兴地欢庆吧
<34-8,Augustine>"Celebrate and be glad."

882
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,760
<34-8,Augustine>因为你的兄弟死而复生
<34-8,Augustine>"Because your brother was dead and is alive again."

883
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,920
<34-9,Chase>归回父家歌
<34-9,Chase>The prodigal son.

884
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,640
<34-10,Augustine>当你准备好的时候他会等着你的
<34-10,Augustine>He'll be waiting for you when you're ready.

885
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,150
<34-11,Chase>我们给你安排明天的手术
<34-11,Chase>We'll schedule your surgery for tomorrow.

886
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,400
<35-1,Wilson>第六地狱
<35-1,Wilson>The sixth circle of hell.

887
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,670
<35-2,House>被限于一隅方寸
<35-2,House>Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose,

888
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,180
<35-2,House>到处都是血腥味
<35-2,House>and all the tissues are soggy.

889
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,860
<35-3,Wilson>那应该是第七地狱吧
<35-3,Wilson>I think that's the seventh.

890
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,930
<35-4,House>不是  第七地狱是
<35-4,House>No, the seventh is...

891
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,220
<35-5,Wilson>天啊  你在派对上一定很好玩
<35-5,Wilson>God, you must be fun at parties.

892
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,270
<35-6,House>我们都知道那个理论的缺陷
<35-6,House>I think we both know the flaw in that theory.

893
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,920
<35-8,House>-那个修女怎样了  -心率正常
<35-8,House>- How's the sister? - Heart rate is normal,

894
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,040
<35-8,House>肾功能正常
<35-8,House>kidney is functioning.

895
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,270
<35-8,House>知道为什么吗
<35-8,House>You know how it is with nuns,

896
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,600
<35-8,House>拿走了宫内节育器后  一切都好了
<35-8,House>you take out their IUDs, they just bounce right back.

897
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,500
<35-10,House>-很好  -早说过我没有搞砸
<35-10,House>- Great. - Told you I didn't screw up.

898
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,960
<35-11,Wilson>你搞砸了
<35-11,Wilson>You screwed up.

899
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,410
<35-12,House>我给她0.1毫升的肾上腺素
<35-12,House>I gave her point-one cc of epinephrine.

900
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,900
<35-13,Wilson>是的  如果卡迪没有把你踢出这个病例的话
<35-13,Wilson>Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you off the case,

901
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,510
<35-13,Wilson>你可能杀了她了
<35-13,Wilson>you would've killed her.

902
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,550
<35-13,Wilson>想来参加圣诞晚宴吗
<35-13,Wilson>You wanna come over for Christmas dinner?

903
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,340
<35-14,House>你是犹太人
<35-14,House>You're Jewish.

904
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,240
<35-15,Wilson>是的  光明节晚宴  你介意些什么
<35-15,Wilson>Yeah, Hanukkah dinner. Wh-what do you care?

905
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,450
<35-15,Wilson>食物不对口还是人
<35-15,Wilson>It's food, it's people.

906
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,460
<35-16,House>不了  谢谢
<35-16,House>No thanks.

907
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,860
<35-17,Wilson>或许我会去你那里的
<35-17,Wilson>Maybe I'll come to your place.

908
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,960
<35-18,House>你妻子不介意一个人过圣诞节吗
<35-18,House>Your wife doesn't mind being alone at Christmas?

909
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,050
<35-19,Wilson>我是个医生  她习惯一个人了
<35-19,Wilson>I'm a doctor, she's used to being alone.

910
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,520
<35-19,Wilson>-我不想谈论这个  -我也不想
<35-19,Wilson>- I don't want to talk about it. - Neither do I.

911
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,060
<35-21,Cuddy>做的不错啊  修女的病例
<35-21,Cuddy>You did good. With the nun.

912
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,180
<35-21,Cuddy>恭喜
<35-21,Cuddy>Congratulations.

913
