79
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,010
<4-15,House>这就是第一个理由
<4-15,House>That's reason number one.

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,380
<4-15,House>我们没说她就知道那是什么病了

<4-15,House>第二 她全身都被雪弄湿了却没有颤抖

82
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,280
<4-15,House>那很奇怪
<4-15,House>That's odd.

83
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,830
<4-15,House>除非她不会出汗或者感觉不到冷热
<4-15,House>Unless she can't sweat or feel hot and cold.

<4-19,House>她的脚没有避开清洁棉布 而是迎上去
<4-19,House>she flexed into the cleaner instead of away from it.

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,400
<4-19,House>从没有过痛觉的话 很难假装
<4-19,House>It's hard to fake pain when you've never felt it.

<4-20,Foreman>可是 她说了她没有这种病
<4-20,Foreman>One the other hand, she says she doesn't have it.

96
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,180
<4-20,Foreman>如果以前没诊断出来的话,她不可能活到现在
<4-20,Foreman>And she'd be dead by now if she'd never been diagnosed.

<4-21,House>她知道如果承认有无痛症 就哪也去不了
<4-21,House>If she admits having cipa, she knows we're not letting her go anywhere

101
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,670
<4-21,House>只能去做一堆检测

<5-6,Cuddy>who can't feel pain because you always feel pain.

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,800
<5-6,Cuddy>所以你想探究
<5-6,Cuddy>So you wanna go exploring.

122
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,250
<5-7,House>她出了车祸
<5-7,House>She was in a car accident.

123
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,980
<5-7,House>她要做x光 血象 脑电图 神经切片
<5-7,House>She needs x-rays, blood tests, eeg, nerve biopsy.

124
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,340
<5-7,House>我还注意到 尽管今早大雪纷飞
<5-7,House>I also note that, although snow was coming down in sheets this morning,

125
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,070
<5-7,House>你却没戴帽子 只戴了耳罩
<5-7,House>you left your hat at home and used ear muffs.

126
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,050
<5-8,Cuddy>你检测是不是为了...
<5-8,Cuddy>Do your tests except for the--

127
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,160
<5-9,House>当大家都在担心能否来上班时
<5-9,House>so while everyone else was just worrying about getting in,

128
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,800
<5-9,House>你却只关心帽子压坏发型
<5-9,House>you were concerned with hat-head.

129
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,020
<5-9,House>相亲从不是好主意
<5-9,House>Blind dates are never a good idea.

130
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,210
<5-9,House>你披披肩的唯一理由,就是能从人群中一眼认出你
<5-9,House>Only reason to wear a scarf like that is as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.

131
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,420
<5-9,House>做你的测试吧
<5-9,House>Do your tests.

132
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,770
<5-10,Cuddy>除了神经切片
<5-10,Cuddy>Except the nerve biopsy.

133
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,900
<5-11,House>- 我需要切片的结果,- 那样她有可能瘫痪
<5-11,House>- I need the nerve biopsy.,- You'd risk paralyzing her.

134
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,640
<5-13,House>但这是神经疾病
<5-13,House>But it's neurological.

135
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,990
<5-14,Cuddy>你没有证据
<5-14,Cuddy>You have no evidence of that.

136
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,250
<5-15,House>她摔倒了
<5-15,House>She tripped.

137
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,900
<5-16,Cuddy>你还有其他任何证据吗?
<5-16,Cuddy>Do you have any evidence other than the fact that

138
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,610
<5-16,Cuddy>除了笨拙的无痛症病人在雪天摔倒
<5-16,Cuddy>a typically clumsy cipa patient tripped on an icy day?

139
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,270
<5-16,Cuddy>如果脑电图有问题 我们再讨论
<5-16,Cuddy>If the eeg reveals a problem, we can talk then.

140
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,740
<5-17,House>你可以把披肩扔家里
<5-17,House>You could have left the scarf at home and

141
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,380
<5-17,House>只要告诉他你一脸绝望就很好认
<5-17,House>just told him you'd be wearing a look of desperation.

142
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,510
<6-1,Chase>左中央区和右枕区有尖频
<6-1,Chase>Spiking on leads c3 and o2.

143
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,160
<6-2,Cameron>- 她可能会发作,- 喂
<6-2,Cameron>- She could be going into a seizure.,- Hello.

144
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,040
<6-4,Foreman>应该有更简单的解释
<6-4,Foreman>I think there's a simpler explanation.

145
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,440
<6-5,Hannah>你们什么都查不出来的
<6-5,Hannah>You're not gonna find anything.

146
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,560
<6-5,Hannah>我没事 我要见我妈妈!
<6-5,Hannah>I'm fine!I wanna see my mom!

147
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,960
<7-1,House>给她打镇定剂
<7-1,House>So sedate her.

148
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,450
<7-2,Foreman>她不会答应的
<7-2,Foreman>She won't consent.

149
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,770
<7-3,House>她才十几岁
<7-3,House>She's a teenager.

150
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,840
<7-4,Foreman>没有爸爸 妈妈还在手术
<7-4,Foreman>No dad,mom's still in surgery.

151
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,050
<7-4,Foreman>你想让我们怎么做 按倒她?
<7-4,Foreman>What do you want us to do,hold her down?

152
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,930
<7-5,House>给她注射镇定剂之后
<7-5,House>Only until you inject her with a sedative.

153
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,040
<7-5,House>你才能放开她
<7-5,House>Then you can let her go.

154
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,490
<7-6,Foreman>-我们试过了,-真的?
<7-6,Foreman>- We tried.,- Seriously?

155
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,310
<7-7,House>她力气很大 不停挣扎
<7-7,House>She's strong and doesn't care.

156
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
<7-8,Foreman>我怕还没等注入镇静剂
<7-8,Foreman>We'd have broken something before

157
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,630
<7-8,Foreman>就会先伤害到她的身体
<7-8,Foreman>we could get her to sit still enough to inject her.

158
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,310
<7-9,House>那就打断她的手
<7-9,House>So break her arm.

159
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,760
<7-9,House>她不会在意的
<7-9,House>She won't mind.

160
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,580
<7-10,Foreman>你真变态
<7-10,Foreman>You're cranky.

161
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,120
<7-10,Foreman>我很痛
<7-10,Foreman>I'm in pain.

162
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,010
<7-11,House>走 去打折她的手
<7-11,House>Come on,let's go break her arm.

<8-1,House>How long you gonna waste her time?

165
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,170
<8-2,Foreman>真庆幸我们走的路有尽头
<8-2,Foreman>So glad we're walking somewhere.

166
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,240
<8-2,Foreman>再走60英尺 就可以结束这段对话
<8-2,Foreman>Another 60 feet and this conversation is over.

167
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,760
<8-3,House>等这段研究结束 Cameron会找到个伴
<8-3,House>When you guys are out of this program, cameron will find somebody,

<8-3,House>chase will find eight somebodies, and you'll be alone.

00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,210
<8-4,Foreman>还有30英尺
<8-4,Foreman>30 feet.

170
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,640
<8-5,House>你不断地约会
<8-5,House>You'll date and you'll date.

171
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,280
<8-5,House>但你是终极达尔文主义者
<8-5,House>But you're the ultimate darwinian.

172
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,440
<8-5,House>努力奋斗
<8-5,House>You've got to fight for everything.

173
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,690
<8-5,House>身边有人只会拖累你
<8-5,House>Anybody else would just slow you down.

176
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,880
<8-6,Foreman>是
<8-6,Foreman>Yeah.

177
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,500
<8-7,House>我猜那是因为她没给你分手的借口
<8-7,House>I can only imagine it's because she hasn't given you

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,780
<8-7,House>而你也没有勇气认清现实
<8-7,House>an excuse to break up and you don't have the guts to recognize your own reality.

179
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,850
<9-1,Hannah>我要见我妈妈!

<9-2,House>Not sure I can say this without being condescending,

182
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,530
<9-2,House>你会误以为我尊敬你...
<9-2,House>but then you'd get the false impression that I respect you,so...

183
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,740
<9-2,House>你是个孩子
<9-2,House>you're a kid.

192
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,310

193
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,890
<9-6,House>比持续疼痛好得多吧

<9-6,House>到椅子上去

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,760
<12-16,Foreman>所有测试结果都是阴性
<12-16,Foreman>All the tests were negative.

286
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,300
<12-17,Chase>需要更详尽的病史
<12-17,Chase>We need a better history.

287
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,070
<12-18,Cameron>你还需要哪些文档?
<12-18,Cameron>How much more paper work do you need?

<12-20,Cameron>保险条款

292
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,930
<12-21,Chase>好吧 第二个
<12-21,Chase>Okay, second question.

293
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,720
<12-22,Foreman>直接说就好了
<12-22,Foreman>Just make your point.

294
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,070
<12-23,Chase>哪里疼?
<12-23,Chase>Where does it hurt?

295
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
<12-23,Chase>如果知道她哪疼 我们就可以诊断
<12-23,Chase>If we knew where it hurt, we could diagnose her.

296
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,430
<12-24,Foreman>你知道无痛症感觉不到疼痛吧?
<12-24,Foreman>You do know cipa meansshe can't feel pain.

297
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,480
<12-25,Chase>不 无痛症是说她对疼痛不敏感
<12-25,Chase>No, cipa means she's insensitive to pain.

298
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,820
<12-25,Chase>她还是有分散的神经纤维可以传导痛觉
<12-25,Chase>She still has scattered nerve fibers that could conduct pain,

299
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,220
<12-25,Chase>但信号传导不到大脑
<12-25,Chase>ut the signals don't make it to the brain.

300
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,770
<12-25,Chase>给她更多痛觉信号会怎么样?
<12-25,Chase>What if we give her more pain signals?

301
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,930
<12-25,Chase>很多痛觉信号
<12-25,Chase>A lot more pain signals.

302
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,750
<12-25,Chase>也许其中一些能传导成功
<12-25,Chase>Maybe some of them will make it through.

303
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,010
<12-26,Cameron>你要折磨她?
<12-26,Cameron>You wanna torture her?

304

<12-27,Chase>对别人是折磨
<12-27,Chase>Yes.We do this to anybody else, it's torture.

306
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,920
<12-27,Chase>对她 和扎扎手指头没区别
<12-27,Chase>Doing it to her is no different than pricking her finger.

307
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,820
<12-27,Chase>在她身上刺探
<12-27,Chase>We keep poking sharp sticks into her,

308
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,510
<12-27,Chase>直至找到本就疼痛的地方
<12-27,Chase>eventually we'll find the part that's already tender.

309
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,340
<13-1,Don>院长干什么?
<13-1,Don>So what does a dean of medicine do?

313
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,830
<13-3,Don>你作比喻吧
<13-3,Don>Metaphorically.

314
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,740
<13-3,Don>因为这家和医院毗邻的咖啡店
<13-3,Don>Because geographically, the coffee place around the corner

315
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,520
<13-3,Don>不是你能到达最远的距离吧
<13-3,Don>from the hospital probably isn't the furthest you could get.

316
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,010
<13-4,Cuddy>但你看这雪

318
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,590
<13-5,Don>但这儿撤退起来方便
<13-5,Don>But it's a good place to beat a retreat from.

319
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,470
<13-5,Don>你对约会不寄予很高期望?
<13-5,Don>You usually expect your dates to go wrong?

320
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,640
<13-6,Cuddy>我学会要找条撤离的路径
<13-6,Cuddy>Experience has taught me to have an escape route.

<15-6,Hannah>能说说话吗?
<15-6,Hannah>You wanna talk?

397
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,240

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,130
<15-12,Hannah>不知道什么时候该停
<15-12,Hannah>Never know when to stop.

406
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,730
<15-13,Foreman>你跟很多人作对 还是你只想惹恼你妈妈?
<15-13,Foreman>You piss a lot of people off or are you just trying to piss off your mom?

407
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,330
<15-13,Foreman>其实只有这两个选择
<15-13,Foreman>Those are pretty much the only two choices you have.

408
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,410
<15-13,Foreman>Hannah 你要我们停下吗?
<15-13,Foreman>Hannah?You want us to stop?

<15-13,Foreman>What'd you feel?

<15-13,Foreman>哪里有感觉?
<15-13,Foreman>Where did you feel it?

413
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,110
<15-13,Foreman>Hannah 我得知道你哪里疼
<15-13,Foreman>Hannah, I need to know how it hurt.

414
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,170
<15-13,Foreman>Hannah!
<15-13,Foreman>Hannah!

415
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,030

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,080
<16-1,Wilson>和董事局的怪律师好上了?
<16-1,Wilson>that weird lawyer from the board?

418
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,950
<16-2,House>有11根手指的家伙?
<16-2,House>The guy with 11 fingers?

419
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,920
<16-3,Wilson>他有11根手指?
<16-3,Wilson>He has 11 fingers?

420
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,190
<16-4,House>你怎么会没注意到?
<16-4,House>How do you not notice that?

421
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,320
<16-5,Wilson>那个护士曾经是男人
<16-5,Wilson>The nurse used to be a man.

422
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,380
<16-6,House>她现在不是了?
<16-6,House>She's not anymore?

423
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,680
<16-7,Wilson>我们不说这些
<16-7,Wilson>But we can't talk about that.

424
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,550
<16-8,House>我们在说
<16-8,House>I thought we were.

425
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,760
<16-9,Wilson>我们本来要谈这些的
<16-9,Wilson>We were supposed to talk about that.

426
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,060
<16-9,Wilson>我来就是告诉你这个
<16-9,Wilson>I came here to talk about that.

427
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,180
<16-9,Wilson>可来的路上 我遇到Cameron
<16-9,Wilson>But on the way up,I ran into cameron.

428
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,760
<16-9,Wilson>你有个无痛症患者
<16-9,Wilson>You've got a cipa patient.

429
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,640
<16-10,House>变性护士更有趣
<16-10,House>Mmm.Tranny nurse is more interesting.

430
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,900
<16-11,Wilson>这可有趣多了
<16-11,Wilson>Oh, it's way more interesting.

431
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,110
<16-11,Wilson>可我又得当你的良心
<16-11,Wilson>But instead, I've gotta be your damn conscience.

432
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,260
<16-11,Wilson>我厌倦唤起你的道德观念
<16-11,Wilson>I'm tired of being your conscience.

433
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,660
<16-11,Wilson>我不享受当你的良心
<16-11,Wilson>I don't enjoy being your conscience.

434
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,610
<16-13,Wilson>- 没人享受,- 你在研究她
<16-13,Wilson>- No one enjoys...,- you're studying her.

435
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,820
<16-14,House>她确实病了
<16-14,House>She's actually sick.

436
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,940
<16-15,Wilson>你把她绑走后才发现的
<16-15,Wilson>Which you found out after you took her on.

437
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,290
<16-16,House>我好奇
<16-16,House>I was curious.

438
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,360
<16-16,House>因为我不是猫 好奇不危险,(谚语: 好奇害死猫)
<16-16,House>Since I'm not a cat,that's not dangerous.

439
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,700
<16-17,Wilson>这句谚语不是用来警惕猫的
<16-17,Wilson>I don't think that metaphor was designed to actually warn cats.

440
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,050
<16-17,Wilson>你不关心她的病情 你在乎的是无痛症
<16-17,Wilson>You don't care about her illness, you care about cipa.

441
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,220
<16-17,Wilson>你的注意力集中在获取你的答案,而不她的
<16-17,Wilson>Which means your focus is gonna be on getting your answers, not hers.

442
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,190
<16-18,House>谢谢
<16-18,House>Thank you.

443
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,970
<16-18,House>先有所知 先有所备
<16-18,House>Forewarned is forearmed.

444
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,650
<16-19,Wilson>你想弄明白什么?
<16-19,Wilson>What do you think you're gonna figure out?

445
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,580
<16-19,Wilson>你以为她缺少痛觉的症状,能解决你的疼痛?
<16-19,Wilson>You think her lack of pain is somehow the answer to your pain.

446
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,040
<16-20,House>要是你不跟Cameron说话 当下
<16-20,House>I think if you'd stop talking to cameron, then right now,

447
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,220
<16-20,House>我们就可以给护士排排名次
<16-20,House>we could be ranking nurses in order of do-ability.

448
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,230
<16-21,Foreman>有情况
<16-21,Foreman>Need you.

<16-22,House>脊椎神经切片有发现?
<16-22,House>What did the nerve biopsy show?

450
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,160
<16-23,Foreman>没做
<16-23,Foreman>Never did it.

451
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,900
<16-24,House>那就做
<16-24,House>Then do it.

452
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,300
<16-26,House>- 做不了,- 为什么?
<16-26,House>- Can'T.,- Why?

453
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,750
<16-27,Foreman>她要从大厅扶栏往下跳
<16-27,Foreman>She's gonna jump off the lobby balcony.

454
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,580
<16-28,House>你觉得我接得住她?
<16-28,House>You think I can catch her?

455
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,690
<17-1,Hannah>离远点!
<17-1,Hannah>Get away from me!

456
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,940
<17-2,Cameron>我不会伤害你
<17-2,Cameron>I'm not gonna hurt you.

457
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,040
<17-3,Hannah>你会
<17-3,Hannah>Yes, you are.

458
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,730
<17-3,Hannah>你嫉妒我什么都能做
<17-3,Hannah>You're just jealous that I can do anything.

459
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,650
<17-4,Cameron>Hannah出现了迫害妄想
<17-4,Cameron>Hannah, you're having a paranoid delusion.

460
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,820
<17-5,Hannah>我不相信你
<17-5,Hannah>I don't believe you.

461
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,090
<17-6,Chase>觉得她会跳
<17-6,Chase>Think she would

462
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,200
<17-7,Hannah>这是真的 你们要我痛苦
<17-7,Hannah>this is real.You want me to be in pain.

<17-7,Hannah>You even said so.

464
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
<17-8,Chase>如果我们想伤害你 不会拦着你
<17-8,Chase>If we wanted to hurt you, we'd let you jump.

465
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,160
<17-9,Hannah>让我看看我妈
<17-9,Hannah>Just let me see my mother.

<17-12,Foreman>我刚和她外科医生谈过
<17-12,Foreman>I just spoke to her surgeon.

<17-13,Hannah>我不相信你!
<17-13,Hannah>I don't believe you!

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,500
<17-15,Hannah>我感觉不到腿
<17-15,Hannah>I can't feel my legs.

474
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,660
<17-16,Foreman>你要是想在10分钟内故技重施
<17-16,Foreman>If you're trying to pull the same stunt twice in ten minutes...

475
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,880
<17-17,Hannah>不是装出来的
<17-17,Hannah>I'm not pretending.

476
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,530
<17-17,Hannah>腿不疼 感觉不到了
<17-17,Hannah>They don't hurt,they're just not there.

477
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,380
<18-1,Cameron>有感觉吗?
<18-1,Cameron>Anything?

478
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,540
<18-1,Cameron>不只是疼痛感
<18-1,Cameron>We're not looking for pain.

479
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,920
<18-1,Cameron>- 什么感觉都行 刺压?,- 没感觉
<18-1,Cameron>Anything at all,pressure?Nothing.

480
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,650
<18-3,Cameron>你六根骨头碎了
<18-3,Cameron>You have  six broken  bones,

481

<18-3,Cameron>腰部之下完全失去知觉
<18-3,Cameron>and a complete lack of sensation below the waist.

483
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,230
<18-4,Hannah>我感觉挺好
<18-4,Hannah>I feel fine.

484
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,300
<18-4,Hannah>我妈妈手术做完了吗?
<18-4,Hannah>Is my mother out of surgery yet?

485
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,320
<18-5,Cameron>还没有
<18-5,Cameron>Not yet.

486
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,050
<18-5,Cameron>幸运极了
<18-5,Cameron>This is excellent.

487
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,870
<19-1,House>妄想症状消失了
<19-1,House>The paranoia seems to have dissipated.

488
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,320
<19-2,Cameron>但生命垂危
<19-2,Cameron>But her vitals keep getting worse.

489
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,520
<19-2,Cameron>可能会在数小时内死去
<19-2,Cameron>She could be dead in hours.

490
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,110
<19-3,House>如果饱受煎熬慢慢死去
<19-3,House>But...if you're gonna die a miserable,lingering death,

491
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
<19-3,House>没有痛觉幸运至极
<19-3,House>pain-free is the way to do it.

492
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,870
<19-3,House>你确定不是跌落导致瘫痪?
<19-3,House>You sure the fall didn't cause the paralysis?

493
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,190
<19-4,Chase>瘫痪导致跌落
<19-4,Chase>The paralysis caused the fall.

494
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,490
<19-4,Chase>脊椎没事
<19-4,Chase>Spine's clean.

495
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,130
<19-4,Chase>没有骨折或脊髓损伤
<19-4,Chase>No veritable fractures or spinal cord compression.

496
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,570
<19-5,House>更好了
<19-5,House>Even better.

497
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,250
<19-5,House>疯疯癫癫还瘫痪
<19-5,House>The nuttiness and paralysis

498
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,790
<19-5,House>意味着一定有某个神经部件出问题
<19-5,House>mean there's definitely  a neurological component.

499
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,090
<19-6,Foreman>可能是神经病变
<19-6,Foreman>Could be a nerve disease.

500
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,920
<19-7,House>所以我们需要检查神经切片,你却没有做
<19-7,House>Which is why we need to look at the nerve that you didn't biopsy.

501
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,090
<19-8,Chase>还有别的检查
<19-8,Chase>There are other tests...

502
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,630
<19-9,House>艾滋病 梅毒?
<19-9,House>HIV? Syphilis?

503

<19-9,House>所有性病检测都呈阴性,血管疾病 不 抗核抗体呈阴性
<19-9,House>She's negative Vascular?>No.ANA was negative.

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,370
<19-9,House>脑栓 不 核磁共振
<19-9,House>Cerebral clot? No,MRI was...

505
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,300
<19-10,Cameron>甲亢危象,(甲亢病程中出现的一种严重并发症)
<19-10,Cameron>Thyroid storm.

506
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,270
<19-11,Foreman>有理 她糖反映迟缓
<19-11,Foreman>Makes sense,given her glucose reaction was slow

507
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,140
<19-11,Foreman>血钾也降低了
<19-11,Foreman>and potassium's down.

508
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,570
<19-11,Foreman>没错
<19-11,Foreman>Yeah.

509
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,260
<19-12,House>我去和内分泌学家会诊
<19-12,House>I'll check with an endocrinologist.

510
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,740
<19-13,Cameron>Bennett值班
<19-13,Cameron>Bennett's on call.

511
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,430
<19-14,House>太好了
<19-14,House>Perfect.

512
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,450
<20-1,Cuddy>不是吧
<20-1,Cuddy>No.

513
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,650
<20-2,House>需要会诊
<20-2,House>Need a consult.

514
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,810
<20-3,Cuddy>我已经同意了你做神经切片
<20-3,Cuddy>I already okayed your nerve biopsy.

515
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,290
<20-4,House>需要内分泌学家

<20-5,Cuddy>Bennett值班

517
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,510
<20-6,House>不接电话
<20-6,House>Won't pick up.

518
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,950
<20-6,House>他的手机肯定坏了
<20-6,House>His cell phone must be broken.

519
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,630
<20-7,Cuddy>我的手机可没坏
<20-7,Cuddy>Mine's working.

520
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,690
<20-8,House>必须给你看资料
<20-8,House>Had to give you the file.

521
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,910
<20-9,Cuddy>我猜你怀疑是甲亢危象
<20-9,Cuddy>I assume you're thinking thyroid storm.

522
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,350
<20-9,Cuddy>有没有做激素检测?
<20-9,Cuddy>Have you done a hormone panel?

523
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,420
<20-10,House>正常 促甲状腺激素水平较低
<20-10,House>Normal. TSH was on the low side.

524
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,200
<20-10,House>壁炉是不是烧着火?
<20-10,House>Is that a cheery fire I hear crackling nearby?

525
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,590
<20-10,House>没有
<20-10,House>No.

526
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,100
<20-11,Cuddy>CPK(肌酸磷酸激酶)怎么样?
<20-11,Cuddy>What about CPK enzymes?

527
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,930
<20-12,House>提高了 275
<20-12,House>Elevated. 275.

528
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,850
<20-12,House>人家若是为了自己点燃炉火
<20-12,House>People light fires for themselves.

529
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,530
<20-12,House>定然不会矢口否认
<20-12,House>But then they don't deny it.

530
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,930
<20-12,House>他在这儿
<20-12,House>He's here.

531
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,510
<20-13,Cuddy>CPK还不够高
<20-13,Cuddy>CPK isn't high enough.

532
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,880
<20-13,Cuddy>血钾提高是因为支气管扩张剂的缘故
<20-13,Cuddy>Potassium's what you'd expect because of the bronchodilators.

533
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,990
<20-14,House>老天!
<20-14,House>Oh,my God!

534
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,170
<20-14,House>你没戴文胸
<20-14,House>You're not wearing a bra.

535
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,690
<20-15,Cuddy>这不是甲亢危象
<20-15,Cuddy>It's not thyroid storm.

536
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,600
<20-16,House>你们才刚见面
<20-16,House>You just met him.

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,440
<20-17,Cuddy>也喜欢做爱
<20-17,Cuddy>And I like sex.

539
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,500
<20-17,Cuddy>用不用我在胸口刺上字?
<20-17,Cuddy>Do I need to stitch a letter on my tops?

540
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,850
<20-17,Cuddy>不用
<20-17,Cuddy>No.

541
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,800
<20-18,House>不过或许可以在当地报纸上登个广告
<20-18,House>But it might be worth taking out an ad in the local papers.

542
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,160
<20-19,Cuddy>你喜欢我吗 House?
<20-19,Cuddy>Do you like me,House?

543
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,420
<20-19,Cuddy>我15分钟前刚和Bennett通过电话
<20-19,Cuddy>I was on the phone with Bennett 15 minutes ago.

544
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,130
<20-19,Cuddy>他的手机没出问题
<20-19,Cuddy>His cell phone's working.

545
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,370
<20-19,Cuddy>你原本不惜一切躲避我
<20-19,Cuddy>You're M.O. is to avoid me at all costs.

546
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,630
<20-19,Cuddy>突然 你需要我拨一拨 你动一动
<20-19,Cuddy>And suddenly, you need my input on every move you make.

547
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,040
<20-19,Cuddy>我只好认为 这是因为我在约会
<20-19,Cuddy>I can only assume it's because I'm on a date.

548
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,330
<20-20,House>见面时 我注意到
<20-20,House>When we met, I noticed--

549
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,780
<20-21,Cuddy>你注意到他是秘密兄弟会员,因他头发分路样子
<20-21,Cuddy>You noticed he was a Shriner because the way he parted his hair.

550
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,770
<20-21,Cuddy>你注意到他是个乖宝宝
<20-21,Cuddy>You noticed he was a mama's boy

551
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,620
<20-21,Cuddy>因为他眨左眼的样子
<20-21,Cuddy>because of the way he blinked his left eye.

552
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,920
<20-21,Cuddy>我不感兴趣 我不受你影响
<20-21,Cuddy>I'm not interested. I'm not impressed.

553
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,090
<20-21,Cuddy>只有两个原因
<20-21,Cuddy>There are only two reasons

554

<20-21,Cuddy>有人想要破坏我今晚的好事

555
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,540
<20-21,Cuddy>要么 他是个无私的正派人
<20-21,Cuddy>Either they're an altruistic,

556

<20-21,Cuddy>只是为了我的幸福着想

557
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,390
<20-21,Cuddy>要么他是自己想得到我
<20-21,Cuddy>Or they want me FOR THEMSELVES

558
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,600
<20-22,House>你漏了第三个可能性
<20-22,House>You left out the third option.

559
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,820
<20-22,House>想破坏别人幸福的魔鬼
<20-22,House>Evil bastard who just wants to mess with other people's happiness.

582
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,950
<20-32,Don>我想跟那个女人约会
<20-32,Don>but I'd like to go out with that woman.

583
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,820
<20-33,Cuddy>我可以让她听电话
<20-33,Cuddy>I can get her on the phone.

584
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,650
<21-1,Cameron>你去了哪里?
<21-1,Cameron>Where did you go?

585
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,860
<21-1,Cameron>她情况更糟了
<21-1,Cameron>She's getting worse.

586
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,140
<21-1,Cameron>不是甲亢危象
<21-1,Cameron>It's not thyroid storm.

587
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,490
<21-2,House>做脊髓神经切片
<21-2,House>Get me spinal nerve.

588
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,070
<21-3,Chase>还有别的检测
<21-3,Chase>There are still r tests.

589
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,500
<21-4,House>她刚说了女孩在恶化
<21-4,House>She just said the girl was getting worse.

590
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,420
<21-4,House>你们还想等待
<21-4,House>You wanna wait.

591
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,520
<21-5,Cameron>会有感染的风险 还可能使瘫痪恶化
<21-5,Cameron>We'll be risking infection,maybe make the paralysis worse.

592
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,880
<21-6,House>已经恶化了
<21-6,House>It is worse.

593
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,050
<21-6,House>我们让它越来越糟 做切片
<21-6,House>We're making it worse than worse.Do the biopsy.

594
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,400
<21-7,Chase>可能会使她瘫痪 却一无所获
<21-7,Chase>We could paralyze her and get no useful information.

595
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,840
<21-8,House>做切片
<21-8,House>Do the biopsy.

596
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,280
<21-9,Foreman>如果是外周神经疾病
<21-9,Foreman>If you're thinking peripheral neuropathy,

597
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,250
<21-9,Foreman>该选择离脊髓稍远的神经
<21-9,Foreman>we should a take a nerve a little further away from the spine.

598
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,500
<21-10,House>离真相也远了
<21-10,House>A little further from the truth.

599
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,800
<21-10,House>牵涉到瘫痪
<21-10,House>We're talking paralysis.

600
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,810
<21-10,House>很有可能是脊髓相关
<21-10,House>Good chance the spine is relevant.

601
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,090
<21-10,House>若病情发展
<21-10,House>And if this thing is progressive,

602
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,680
<21-10,House>要不了几小时 她就死了
<21-10,House>it'll kill her in hours.

603
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,220
<21-10,House>把论文还给我
<21-10,House>Give me back my papers.

604
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,000
<21-11,Wilson>他是不是坚持要脊髓神经?
<21-11,Wilson>Is he asking for a spinal nerve?

605
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,780
<21-12,Cameron>你怎么知道?
<21-12,Cameron>How did you know?

606
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,980
<21-13,Wilson>让我们单独谈
<21-13,Wilson>Give us a venute.

607
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,390
<21-13,Wilson>你可知道 最近发现一种蛋白质,能加速神经生长?
<21-13,Wilson>Did you know they recently found a protein that speeds up nerve growth?

608
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,690
<21-13,Wilson>多奇妙
<21-13,Wilson>Fascinating stuff.

609
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,030
<21-13,Wilson>如果在脊髓神经的绝缘层放上这种蛋白质
<21-13,Wilson>If you put that protein with the insulation from a spinal nerve,

610
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,980
<21-13,Wilson>就能种植自己的小花园
<21-13,Wilson>you could grow your own little garden.

611
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,230
<21-14,House>- 如果这根脊髓神经,- 是 是
<21-14,House>- If that spinal nerve...,- Yeah,yeah,yeah.

612
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,430
<21-14,House>如果恰好是来自无痛病患者
<21-14,House>If it happened to come from a person with CIPA,

613
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,110
<21-14,House>那就可以培育无痛觉神经,并植入自己的腿
<21-14,House>I could grow pain-free nerves and graft them into my own leg.

614
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,600
<21-14,House>好个邪恶的计划
<21-14,House>What an evil plan.

615
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,880
<21-15,Wilson>你得终身用免疫抑制剂
<21-15,Wilson>You'd have to be on immunosuppressors for life.

616
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,910
<21-15,Wilson>冒感染的风险 缩短寿命
<21-15,Wilson>Risking infection, shorter life span...

617
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,640
<21-16,House>短是短 可正常了
<21-16,House>Shorter. But normal.

618
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,420
<21-17,Wilson>嫉妒通常表现的方式
<21-17,Wilson>Usually jealousy expresses itself

619
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,380
<21-17,Wilson>是想摧毁别人拥有的
<21-17,Wilson>by trying to destroy what someone has.

620
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,680
<21-17,Wilson>你更雄心勃勃
<21-17,Wilson>You're more ambitious.

621
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,990
<21-17,Wilson>你想歪曲医学事实来达到目的
<21-17,Wilson>You actually wanna change medical fact to get this thing...

622
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,050
<21-18,House>医学事实一直在变化
<21-18,House>Medical fact changes all the time.

623
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,470
<21-19,Wilson>你用患者的生命来冒险
<21-19,Wilson>You're risking your patient's life.

624
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,300
<21-20,House>这样医学事实才会进步
<21-20,House>That's how medical fact changes.

625
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,210
<21-20,House>医生冒险
<21-20,House>A doctor risks--

626
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,900
<21-21,Wilson>是为了患者的健康
<21-21,Wilson>To serve their patient's health.

627
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,790
<21-21,Wilson>不是为了自己的
<21-21,Wilson>Not their own.

628
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,230
<21-22,House>这诊断没有错
<21-22,House>This is medically justified.

629
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,010
<21-23,Wilson>你确定?
<21-23,Wilson>Are you sure?

630
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,930
<21-23,Wilson>你肯定
<21-23,Wilson>Are you sure...

631
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,280
<21-23,Wilson>你能够做这个判断?
<21-23,Wilson>that you're the right one to be making this call?

632
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,780
<22-1,House>切片检查能安全取得的神经
<22-1,House>Biopsy whatever nerve you figure you can safely get at.

633
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,560
<22-1,House>天 Wilson真是讨厌
<22-1,House>GOd,Wilson's annoying.

634
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,210
<22-1,House>情人节凌晨3点
<22-1,House> Past 3:00 AM on Valentine's Day night.

635
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,320
<23-1,Cameron>我知道你和Wendy有约
<23-1,Cameron>I assume you had a date with Wendy.

636
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,150
<23-2,Foreman>她没事 知道规矩
<23-2,Foreman>She'll survive. She knows the deal.

637
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
<23-3,Cameron>你真幸运
<23-3,Cameron>You're lucky.

638
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,650
<23-4,Foreman>我是
<23-4,Foreman>I know.

639
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,620
<23-5,Cameron>以后等有了时间
<23-5,Cameron>Someday,when thers time,

640
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,500
<23-5,Cameron>我也想有社交生活
<23-5,Cameron>I would like to actually have a social life.

641
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,400
<23-5,Cameron>有朝一日?
<23-5,Cameron>Someday?

642
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,810
<23-6,Foreman>一个漂亮的女人
<23-6,Foreman>Come on.If there's one thing a good-looking woman

643
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,980
<23-6,Foreman>想要社交生活最容易不过
<23-6,Foreman>can have when she wants, it's a social life.

644
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,760
<23-7,Cameron>你指性爱生活
<23-7,Cameron>You mean a sex life.

645
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,970
<23-8,Foreman>有个陪伴不是错
<23-8,Foreman>There's nothing wrong with a little companionship

646
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,450
<23-8,Foreman>在认真的感情到来之前
<23-8,Foreman>'til the real thing comes along.

647
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,700
<23-9,Cameron>我有过认真的感情
<23-9,Cameron>I had the real thing.

648
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,000
<23-9,Cameron>我只是不想安定下来
<23-9,Cameron>Forgive me if I don't want to settle.

649
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,790
<23-10,Foreman>是么
<23-10,Foreman>Right.

650
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,330
<23-11,Cameron>这什么意思?
<23-11,Cameron>What does that mean?

651
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,190
<23-12,Foreman>没什么
<23-12,Foreman>Nothing.

652
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,550
<23-13,Cameron>你认为我没有过真正的感情?
<23-13,Cameron>You think I didn't have the real thing?

653
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,940
<23-14,Foreman>我不知道你有过什么
<23-14,Foreman>I have no idea what you had.

654
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,200
<23-15,Cameron>而你就下了判断
<23-15,Cameron>And yet you're judging it.

655
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,750
<23-16,Foreman>熬夜让我暴躁 对不起
<23-16,Foreman>It's late,I'm cranky.Sorry.

656
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,040
<23-13,Cameron>你认为我没有过真情?
<23-13,Cameron>You think I didn't have the real thing.

657
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,390
<23-17,Cameron>你根本不知道
<23-17,Cameron>How could you even know?

658
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,600
<23-18,Foreman>你和一个垂死的男人结婚
<23-18,Foreman>You married a dying man.

659
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,690
<23-18,Foreman>你想的是 6个月或一年 会很艰难
<23-18,Foreman>You thought...six months,a year, it'll be tough.

660
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,110
<23-18,Foreman>但我能挺过来 还能继续自己的生活
<23-18,Foreman>But then I'll recover and I'll have the rest of my life.

661
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,700
<23-18,Foreman>就好像不小心得感冒
<23-18,Foreman>It's like willy-nilly  getting the flu

662
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,050
<23-18,Foreman>或是不得已加入和平队,(文化外交志愿者)
<23-18,Foreman>or joining the Peace Corps.

663
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,200
<23-18,Foreman>短期的
<23-18,Foreman>Short term.

664
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,100
<23-19,Cameron>一针见血
<23-19,Cameron>Wow,you nailed it.

665
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,570
<23-19,Cameron>就好比是浪费的周末
<23-19,Cameron>It's basically like a wasted weekend.

666
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,500
<23-20,Foreman>你做出的牺牲是巨大的
<23-20,Foreman>The sacrifices you made were huge.

667
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,330
<23-20,Foreman>但你对他的爱仅此而已
<23-20,Foreman>But they were at the height  of your love for him.

668
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,960
<23-20,Foreman>承诺之所以是承诺
<23-20,Foreman>A commitment is only commitment

669
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,460
<23-20,Foreman>是因为没有到期日
<23-20,Foreman>because it has no expiration date.

670
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,610
<23-20,Foreman>你站在一人身旁
<23-20,Foreman>You stand next to someone

671
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,540
<23-20,Foreman>看他用牙线30年
<23-20,Foreman>and watch them floss for 30 years,

672
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,130
<23-20,Foreman>像我父母那样
<23-20,Foreman>like my parents have,

673
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,190
<23-20,Foreman>这才叫牺牲
<23-20,Foreman>then ask for sacrifices.

674
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,300
<23-20,Foreman>才会懂得什么叫做真感情
<23-20,Foreman>That's how you know the real thing.

675
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,040
<23-20,Foreman>Cameron...
<23-20,Foreman>Cameron

676
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,820
<23-20,Foreman>我不是指责你
<23-20,Foreman>I wasn't criticizing you.

677
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,900
<23-20,Foreman>躲避承诺的人 明白它有多沉重
<23-20,Foreman>People who avoid commitment are people who know what a big thing it is.

678
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,000
<23-21,Cameron>这不对劲
<23-21,Cameron>This isn't right.

679
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,420
<24-1,Foreman>无痛症不会导致这样的变性
<24-1,Foreman>CIPA can't cause this much degeneration.

680
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,260
<24-2,Chase>从中央切取的一些神经纤维
<24-2,Chase>A few nerve fibers we teased out of the center

681
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,750
<24-2,Chase>还有部分绝缘层
<24-2,Chase>have some insulation left.

682
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,280
<24-2,Chase>但神经束周围的绝缘层都剥落了
<24-2,Chase>But the insulation around the bundles has been stripped bare.

683
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,400
<24-3,Cameron>意味着损伤是来自外部
<24-3,Cameron>Means the damage must be coming from the outside in.

684
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,840
<24-4,House>这是次发脱髓鞘病变
<24-4,House>Which means it's secondary demyelination.

685
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,330
<24-4,House>病源在别处
<24-4,House>Which means the source is somewhere else.

686
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,220
<24-4,House>不是神经疾病
<24-4,House>Which tells us it's not a nerve disease,

687
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,290
<24-4,House>是全身性的病 影响到了神经
<24-4,House>it's something systemic that's affecting the nerves.

688
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,210
<24-4,House>我们该
<24-4,House>Which means that we need to--

689
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,940
<24-4,House>你去哪里?
<24-4,House>Where are you going?

690
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,480
<24-5,Cameron>孩子的妈妈终于手术告一段落
<24-5,Cameron>Kid's mom is finally out of surgery.

691
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,640
<24-6,House>去去就来
<24-6,House>I'll be right back.

692
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,340
<25-1,House>那又怎样?
<25-1,House>So what?

693
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,660
<25-2,Cameron>Hannah该见见她
<25-2,Cameron>Hannah should see her.

694
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,030
<25-3,House>在我们讨论完怎么救她后,她马上就能去
<25-3,House>Yes,immediately after we're done chatting about saving her life.

695
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,430
<25-3,House>最有可能是代谢类疾病
<25-3,House>Most likely causes are metabolic.

696
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,780
<25-4,Cameron>她脑肿胀
<25-4,Cameron>They found brain swelling.

697
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,510
<25-4,Cameron>就要准备让她做另一项手术
<25-4,Cameron>They're prepping her mother for another surgery.

698
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,710
<25-1,House>那又怎样?
<25-1,House>Again,so what?

699
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,810
<25-5,House>叫个护士送孩子去
<25-5,House>Get a nurse to take the kid.

700
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,920
<25-5,House>有多过60种代谢类疾病
<25-5,House>There are more than 60 different metabolic conditions

701
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,510
<25-5,House>会引起她现在的症状
<25-5,House>that could account for what she's got.

702
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,620
<25-5,House>我可只有你们3个人
<25-5,House>There's only three of you guys.

703
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,030
<25-6,Cameron>她吓坏了
<25-6,Cameron>She's scared.

704
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,150
<25-7,House>肯定的
<25-7,House>She should be.

705
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,090
<25-7,House>如果我们不诊断出 她会死
<25-7,House>She'll die if we don't diagnose her.

706
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,060
<25-8,Cameron>那就诊断出她
<25-8,Cameron>So diagnose her.

707
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,360
<26-1,Hannah>妈
<26-1,Hannah>Mom.

708
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,580
<26-2,Cynthia>有多严重?
<26-2,Cynthia>How bad is it?

709
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,020
<26-2,Cynthia>你好吗?
<26-2,Cynthia>Are u OK?

<26-3,Hannah>我会好的 我总是会好
<26-3,Hannah>I'll get better. I always get better.

712
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,660
<26-4,Cynthia>你检查过自己了 量体温?
<26-4,Cynthia>Are you checking yourself? Your temperature?

713
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,540
<26-5,Hannah>妈妈 你能不能别管了?
<26-5,Hannah>Mom,could you just let it go?

714
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,660
<26-5,Hannah>你现在不该担心
<26-5,Hannah>You shouldn't be worrying.

715
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,160
<26-5,Hannah>宝贝 是我不好
<26-5,Hannah>Oh,baby,I'm sorry.

716
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,790
<26-6,Cynthia>我该留心有车子开过来
<26-6,Cynthia>I should have  seen that car coming.

717
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,190
<26-8,Cynthia>不
<26-8,Cynthia>No.

718
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,020
<26-7,Hannah>我是自作自受
<26-7,Hannah>I did this to myself. I screwed up.

719
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,380
<26-7,Hannah>你是对的 我错了
<26-7,Hannah>You were right You were right and I was wrong.

720
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,110
<26-7,Hannah>不
<26-7,Hannah>No.No.

721
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,330
<26-9,Hannah>我不该下雪天跑出去
<26-9,Hannah>I...I shouldn't have gone out on the ice.

722
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,300
<26-9,Hannah>我不该摔跤
<26-9,Hannah>I shouldn't have  fallen down.

723
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,510
<26-9,Hannah>我不该让你
<26-9,Hannah>And I shouldn't have made you rush me

724
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,910
<26-9,Hannah>今年第十次送我进急诊室
<26-9,Hannah>to an ER for the tenth time this year.

725
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,950
<26-9,Hannah>妈?
<26-9,Hannah>Mom?

726
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,230
<26-10,Cameron>妈妈 你怎么了?
<26-10,Cameron>Mom? You okay?

727
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,390
<26-10,Cameron>得送她继续去做手术
<26-10,Cameron>We gonna have to take her  back to surgery.

728
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,260
<26-10,Cameron>Hannah 你的血压升高
<26-10,Cameron>Hannah,your BP is way up.

729
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,560
<26-10,Cameron>得休息一下
<26-10,Cameron>We need to get you some rest.

730
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,540
<26-11,Hannah>我的手湿了
<26-11,Hannah>My hand's wet.

731
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,760
<26-12,Cameron>你哭了
<26-12,Cameron>You're crying.

732
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,010
<26-12,Cameron>我不会哭
<26-12,Cameron>I can't cry.

733
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,640
<26-13,Hannah>头疼死了
<26-13,Hannah>My head is killing me.

734
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,950
<27-1,House>疼痛能告诉我们什么?
<27-1,House>So what does the pain tell us?

735
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,650
<27-2,Chase>没有刺痛麻痒 可以排除
<27-2,Chase>No tingling, no itching, so we can rule out--

736
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,850
<27-3,Foreman>什么都证实不了
<27-3,Foreman>It tells us nothing.

737
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,820
<27-3,Foreman>不是身体疼痛 是情感
<27-3,Foreman>It wasn't physical pain, it was emotional.

738
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,460
<27-4,House>没错
<27-4,House>Exactly.

739
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,280
<27-4,House>她有了头痛时 她们在干什么?
<27-4,House>What were they doing when she got the headache?

740
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,290
<27-5,Chase>说再见
<27-5,Chase>Saying good-bye.

741
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,830
<27-6,House>你说她们在争执
<27-6,House>You said they were arguing.

742
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,790
<27-7,Cameron>她们不是真的吵架
<27-7,Cameron>They weren't really arguing.

743
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,000
<27-7,Cameron>她只是很沮丧
<27-7,Cameron>She was just frustrated.

744
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,530
<27-8,House>她们在吵什么?
<27-8,House>What were they arguing about?

745
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,500
<27-9,Cameron>谁的过错
<27-9,Cameron>Whose fault it was.

746
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,530
<27-10,House>外周神经疾病 发烧
<27-10,House>Peripheral neuropathy, fever,

747
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,310
<27-10,House>间歇性妄想症
<27-10,House>and intermittent paranoia.

748
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,940
<27-10,House>很多代谢疾病都能引发
<27-10,House>Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things.

749
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,630
<27-10,House>再加上内疚会怎样?
<27-10,House>But what if we add guilt?

750
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,560
<27-11,Chase>内疚作为症状?
<27-11,Chase>Guilt as a symptom?

751
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,290
<27-12,House>阿尔兹海默症能引发欣快,疼痛引发消沉
<27-12,House>Alzheimer's can cause euphoria,pain causes depression,

752
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,760
<27-12,House>维生素B12缺乏引发内疚
<27-12,House>and B12 deficiency causes guilt.

753
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,460
<27-12,House>综合其他的
<27-12,House>Along with all that other stuff.

754
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,350
<27-13,Foreman>如果她感到内疚
<27-13,Foreman>If she felt guilty,

755
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,410
<27-13,Foreman>就不会让她妈妈生活不好过
<27-13,Foreman>she wouldn't be making her mother's life miserable.

756
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,730
<27-13,Foreman>她就不会打架
<27-13,Foreman>She wouldn't be  getting in fights,

757
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,500
<27-13,Foreman>被拘留
<27-13,Foreman>getting arrested...

758
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,560
<27-14,Cameron>也许她打架就是因为感到内疚
<27-14,Cameron>Maybe she's fighting  because she feels guilty.

759
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,150
<27-14,Cameron>她想证明给妈妈看,即使胡乱犯险 她还能平安
<27-14,Cameron>She's showing her mom she can take stupid risks and still be safe.

760
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,360
<27-14,Cameron>那妈妈就不必担心
<27-14,Cameron>Means mom can let go.

761
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,780
<27-15,Foreman>这是有逻辑的思维
<27-15,Foreman>Which is rational.

762
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,800
<27-15,Foreman>如果内疚是疾病引起的症状
<27-15,Foreman>If guilt is a symptom,it's caused by the illness,

763
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,950
<27-15,Foreman>而不是思维过程的产物
<27-15,Foreman>not by a thought process.

764
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,150
<27-15,Foreman>而且应该是新的症状
<27-15,Foreman>And it would  have to be new.

765
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,670
<27-16,Cameron>几年前 她是模仿学生
<27-16,Cameron>Couple years ago, she was a model student.

766
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,740
<27-17,Chase>没意义 如果头痛是由内疚引起的
<27-17,Chase>This is pointless.If the headache  was caused by guilt,

767
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,180
<27-17,Chase>她缺乏维生素B12
<27-17,Chase>she has a B-12 deficiency.

768
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,490
<27-17,Chase>如果只是因为她心里难过
<27-17,Chase>If it's just because she was sad,

769
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,800
<27-17,Chase>那就没办法 用什么来证明?
<27-17,Chase>it's meaningless. How the hell  do we test for that?

770
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,340
<27-18,House>不必 给她一剂维生素B12
<27-18,House>We don't.We give her a shot of B12.

771
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,690
<27-18,House>如果她转好 那我是对的
<27-18,House>When she gets better, I was right.

772
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,470
<27-19,Foreman>已经给了
<27-19,Foreman>We already did.

773
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,920
<27-19,Foreman>急诊室在她入院时就给过B12
<27-19,Foreman>ER gave her B12 when she was admitted.

774
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,460
<27-19,Foreman>多种维生素补充剂
<27-19,Foreman>Part of a multi-vitamin supplement.

775
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,100
<27-19,Foreman>很明显 她是难过
<27-19,Foreman>Apparently, she's just sad.

776
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,180
<28-1,House>你怎么还没走?
<28-1,House>Why are you still here?

777
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,340
<28-2,Wilson>想让病人试验一下新药
<28-2,Wilson>Trying to get a couple patients into a drug trial.

778
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,980
<28-2,Wilson>明天要交书面文件
<28-2,Wilson>Paperwork's due tomorrow.

779
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,190
<28-1,House>你为什么还在?
<28-1,House>Why are you here?

780
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,220
<28-3,House>还没找出为什么
<28-3,House>Still haven't figured out why...

781
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,700
<28-4,Wilson>不 你为什么来这儿 我的办公室
<28-4,Wilson>No,I meant here.In my office.

782
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,390
<28-5,House>刚推翻了一个很妙的B12缺乏症理论
<28-5,House>Just dumped a cool B12 theory.

783
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,650
<28-5,House>在考虑白血病
<28-5,House>Moved on to leukemia.

784
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,290
<28-6,Wilson>这个老套点
<28-6,Wilson>Very pedestrian.

785
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,450
<28-6,Wilson>我乐不起来
<28-6,Wilson>I'm not happy.

786
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,890
<28-7,House>她白细胞计数很低
<28-7,House>Her white blood cell count was low.

787
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,620
<28-7,House>可她又有
<28-7,House>But the one she's got...

788
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,980
<28-7,House>很多嗜曙红细胞(白细胞的一种)
<28-7,House>A whole lot of eosinophils.

789
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,190
<28-8,Wilson>免疫球蛋白E的水平到了临界点
<28-8,Wilson>The immunoglobin E level's borderline.

790
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
<28-8,Wilson>想要有100%的把握
<28-8,Wilson>If you wanna be 100% sure,

791
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,830
<28-8,Wilson>检查骨髓
<28-8,Wilson>check the bone marrow.

792
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,040
<28-9,House>已经在做活检了
<28-9,House>Team's doing a biopsy right now.

793
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,590
<28-9,House>原来
<28-9,House>So it turns out...

794
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,890
<28-9,House>那个怪律师
<28-9,House>the weird lawyer...

795
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,000
<28-9,House>知道她曾是个男人
<28-9,House>knew that she used to be a man.

796
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,110
<28-10,Wilson>他无所谓?
<28-10,Wilson>And he's cool with that?

797
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,250
<28-11,House>原来他的前女友也曾是男人
<28-11,House>Turns out that his previous girlfriend also used to be a man.

798
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,900
<28-12,Wilson>- 噢!,- 是啊
<28-12,Wilson>- Ho-ho!,- Yeah.

799
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,190
<28-14,Wilson>你能不能安分地看着我吃?
<28-14,Wilson>Is it possible  for you to just watch me eat?

800
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,930
<28-14,Wilson>还是你有原始冲动
<28-14,Wilson>Or do you get some primeval thrill

801
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,190
<28-14,Wilson>要击败别的狩猎者 争夺食物?
<28-14,Wilson>out of beating  the other hunters to the food?

802
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,350
<28-14,Wilson>回头见
<28-14,Wilson>See ya later.

803
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,870
<29-1,Hannah>你还不明白我不需要镇静剂?
<29-1,Hannah>You still haven't figured out that I don't need sedation?

804
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,270
<29-2,Chase>这样才能保证你不会乱动
<29-2,Chase>It's so you don't move during the procedure.

805
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,960
<29-3,House>这是氧化亚氮吗?
<29-3,House>Is that nitrous?

806
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,070
<30-3,Hannah>你想要杀了她?,(NO会抑制维生素B12的合成)
<30-3,Hannah>You trying to kill her?

807
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,800
<29-3,House>在做脑电图的时候就曾给她用过氧化亚氮
<29-3,House>You gave her nitrous during the EEG.

808
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,480
<29-3,House>这才让恶势力抬起了头
<29-3,House>That's what made this thing rear its ugly head.

809
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,450
<29-4,Chase>什么东西?
<29-4,Chase>What thing?

810
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,890
<29-5,House>B12缺乏症
<29-5,House>B12 deficiency.

811
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,240
<29-6,Foreman>你有没有觉得这似曾相识?,我们讨论过了
<29-6,Foreman>Are you having deja vu? We've had this conversation.

812
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,180
<29-6,Foreman>她用过B12 没有好转
<29-6,Foreman>She was given B12. She didn't get better.

813
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,290
<29-7,House>因为被别的东西吃了
<29-7,House>Because someone else ate it.

814

<29-9,House>又有迫害妄想
<29-9,House>Another paranoid delusion.

820
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,860
<29-9,House>不行 照这个速度恶化
<29-9,House>Come on. At the rate she's going downhill,

<29-9,House>来不及做核磁共振 得做手术
<29-9,House>forget the MRI, we need an O.R.

827
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,310
<30-4,House>要么你可以认为她受到病症的驱使
<30-4,House>Or you can assume that she's suffering from a medical condition.

828
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,860
<30-4,House>鉴于这里是医院 我们穿得像医生
<30-4,House>Seeing as this is a hospital and we're all  dressed like doctors,

<30-9,Bev>我体内也会有绦虫吗?
<30-9,Bev>I could have tapeworm in me?

00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,710
<32-11,Wendy>只有你们才觉得吵架也得有逻辑
<32-11,Wendy>Only you'd expect an argument to be rational.

887
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,600
<32-11,Wendy>你和你的混蛋上司
<32-11,Wendy>You and that ass boss of yours.

888
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,610
<33-1,Wilson>你可以向她要脊神经
<33-1,Wilson>You could ask her for the spinal nerve.

889
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,770
<33-2,House>她凭什么给我?
<33-2,House>She's got no reason to give it.

890
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,070
<33-3,Wilson>她欠你的
<33-3,Wilson>She owes you.

891

<33-4,House>医院会给她寄账单
<33-4,House>The hospital will send her a bill.

892
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,260
<33-5,Wilson>依我
<33-5,Wilson>I'm just saying.

893
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,230
<33-5,Wilson>你该趁她维生素B12尚缺乏时动手
<33-5,Wilson>If you wanna do it,do it while her B12 is still low.

894
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,870
<33-5,Wilson>有内疚伴随你不错
<33-5,Wilson>Guilt can be your friend.

<34-2,Cameron>给那些已经成双对的人过的节日
<34-2,Cameron>A holiday that only applies to people who are already paired up.

899
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,700
<34-2,Cameron>对于别的人 只是星期三
<34-2,Cameron>For everyone else, it's Wednesday.

900
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,920
<34-3,Chase>谢谢你泼我冷水
<34-3,Chase>Thank you for that dash of cold water.

901
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,030
<34-4,Cameron>别误会
<34-4,Cameron>Don't get me wrong,

902
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,290
<34-4,Cameron>我还是相信有真爱存在
<34-4,Cameron>I still think true love's out there,

903
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,780
<34-4,Cameron>只是非常遥远
<34-4,Cameron>it's just very far away.

904
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,940
<34-4,Cameron>有可能在另一个星系
<34-4,Cameron>Possibly in another galaxy.

905
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,000
<34-4,Cameron>得发明比光速更快的飞行方法
<34-4,Cameron>We may need to develop faster than light travel

906
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,920
<34-4,Cameron>我们才能联系上
<34-4,Cameron>before we can make contact.

907
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,480
<34-4,Cameron>我们做爱吧
<34-4,Cameron>So I'm thinking we should have sex.

908
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,600
<34-5,Chase>这有道理
<34-5,Chase>That makes sense.

909
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,000
<34-6,Cameron>除了流行歌曲的教条
<34-6,Cameron>Despite the wisdom of pop songs,

910
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,150
<34-6,Cameron>实在没必要在真爱到来前 浪费生命
<34-6,Cameron>there's no point in putting our lives on hold 'til love comes along.

911
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,030
<34-6,Cameron>我们都是健康忙碌的人
<34-6,Cameron>We're both healthy and busy people.

912
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,860
<34-6,Cameron>一起工作 这很方便
<34-6,Cameron>We work together, so it's convenient.

913
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,590
<34-7,Chase>好比微波炉批萨?
<34-7,Chase>Like microwave pizza?

914
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,580
<34-8,Cameron>在所有我共事的人中
<34-8,Cameron>And of all the people I work with,

915
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,460
<34-8,Cameron>你是我最不可能爱上的
<34-8,Cameron>you're the one I'm least likely to fall in love with.

916
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,860
<34-7,Chase>好比微波炉批萨
<34-7,Chase>Like microwave pizza.

917
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,980
<34-10,Cameron>是想让事情变得简单
<34-10,Cameron>The point here is to make things simpler,

918
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,740
<34-10,Cameron>不是更复杂
<34-10,Cameron>not more complicated.

919
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,500
<34-10,Cameron>也许以后会对谁动真情
<34-10,Cameron>Someday,there'll be time to get serious about someone.

920
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,170
<34-10,Cameron>当前 既然我们已经做过一次,感觉还不错
<34-10,Cameron>Meanwhile,we already had sex once and didn't get weird about it.

921
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,370
<34-11,Chase>我明白
<34-11,Chase>I get it. I get it.

922
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,120
<34-11,Chase>如果我对你的评价感到恼火呢?
<34-11,Chase>So what if I'm offended by your judgment?

923
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,850
<34-12,Cameron>那你就不是我要找的人
<34-12,Cameron>Then you're not the man I'm looking for.
