1
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,230
<15-4,House>好了
<15-4,House>Okay.

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,410
<1-3,House>治"聊"吧
<1-3,House>"Therafy" me.

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,700
<1-4,Nolan>你迟了
<1-4,Nolan>You're late.

4
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,420
<1-5,House>你肥了
<1-5,House>You're fat.

5
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,070
<1-6,Nolan>这有点反常啊
<1-6,Nolan>It's unusual.

6
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,820
<1-7,House>知道停车场离这多远么?
<1-7,House>You know how far the parking lot is?

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,470
<1-7,House>我腿疼
<1-7,House>My leg's been hurting.

8
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,970
<1-8,Nolan>最近有所纠结 有压力?
<1-8,Nolan>Anything been on your mind lately,any particular stress?

9
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,940
<1-9,House>没有 好像要下雨了
<1-9,House>No.Probably just gonna rain.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,660
<1-10,Nolan>等候室添了一幅莫奈的复制品 睡莲 你觉得怎样?
<1-10,Nolan>You like the new Monet reproduction in the waiting room-- the Water Lilies?

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,930
<1-11,House>我来晚了
<1-11,House>I was late.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,410
<1-11,House>没工夫欣赏室内装饰 不过听起来挺温婉舒缓的
<1-11,House>I wasn't focusing on the decor,but it sounds appropriately bland and calming.

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,020
<1-12,Nolan>压力可能导致心不在焉
<1-12,Nolan>Stress can also  make you absentminded.

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,950
<1-13,House>我没压力 你一个劲说我压力重重 倒真给我添了不少
<1-13,House>I'm not stressed... Beyond the stress induced by you telling me how stressed I am.

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,540
<1-14,Nolan>只是平常的一周?
<1-14,Nolan>Just an ordinary week.

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,810
<1-14,Nolan>那好
<1-14,Nolan>Okay.

17
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,310
<1-15,House>给我讲讲
<1-15,House>Tell me about it.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,360
<1-15,House>我接了个病人
<1-15,House>I had a patient.

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,580
<1-15,House>House
<1-15,House>House.

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,080
<1-16,Cuddy>来的正好 有个病例给你 (又意: 箱子)
<1-16,Cuddy>Good.I have a case for you.

21
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,840
<1-17,House>一箱啤酒?
<1-17,House>Beer?

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,330
<1-17,House>失忆症
<1-17,House>Amnesia.

23
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,910
<1-18,Cuddy>被发现时她正在跑步 突然失去方向感 差点被卡车撞了
<1-18,Cuddy>She was found jogging in the street,disoriented.She almost got hit by a truck.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,270
<1-18,Cuddy>MRI检测无异常
<1-18,Cuddy>The MRI showed no abnormalities.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,460
<1-18,Cuddy>她没带身份证件
<1-18,Cuddy>No I.D. on her.

26
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,920
<1-18,Cuddy>只穿了运动服 带着心率表
<1-18,Cuddy>Just her jogging clothes  and her heart rate monitor.

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,210
<1-18,Cuddy>我们对她一无所知
<1-18,Cuddy>We know absolutely nothing about her.

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,060
<1-19,House>至少知道她很有钱
<1-19,House>We know she has money.

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,130
<1-19,House>Blaze Outriggers 400块一双
<1-19,House>Blaze outriggers-- 400 bucks a pair.

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,020
<1-19,House>有钱人不会就此失踪的
<1-19,House>People who have money  don't just disappear.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,790
<1-19,House>早晚会有人来找她
<1-19,House>Sooner or later,someone's gonna show up looking for her.

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,480
<1-20,Nurse>- 给我点吃的好吗? - 她15分钟前刚吃过
<1-20,Nurse>- Can I have something to eat? - She just ate 15 minutes ago.

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,920
<1-20,Nurse>她总是忘了
<1-20,Nurse>She keeps forgetting.

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,050
<1-21,House>你想吃饭并非因为到了吃饭时间
<1-21,House>You don't eat because you remember it's time to eat.

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,660
<1-21,House>而是受饥饿驱使 她的新陈代谢正高速运转
<1-21,House>You eat 'cause you're hungry.Her metabolism is in high gear.

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,850
<1-22,Nolan>- 她经常长距离跑步 - 你去急诊室干嘛?
<1-22,Nolan>- She is an extreme long-distance runner-- Why were you in the ER?

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,840
<1-23,House>你就问这个?
<1-23,House>That's your question?

38
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,630
<1-23,House>我声情并茂地讲好玩的失忆病例 你作为心理医师只关心我的方位?
<1-23,House>You're a psychotherapist.You're hearing about a great amnesia case,and all you're asking me is geography.

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,830
<1-24,Nolan>好奇而已
<1-24,Nolan>Just curious.

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,340
<1-25,House>我在躲着Wilson
<1-25,House>I was avoiding Wilson.

41
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,810
<1-25,House>这事还是能躲则躲
<1-25,House>It's not something you couldn't have seen eight miles away.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,550
<2-1,House>Wilson是个特婆妈的人
<2-1,House>Wilson's a processor.

43
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,810
<2-1,House>我知道他有事要向我摊牌 开口就很墨迹
<2-1,House>I knew there were  some things  that he'd want  to process with me...  At length.

44
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,720
<2-2,Wilson>Sam要搬来住
<2-2,Wilson>Sam's moving in.

45
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,400
<2-3,House>如果你周五前提出 你助理就赢了
<2-3,House>If it's before Friday,your assistant wins the pool.

46
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,930
<2-4,Wilson>我只想问问你有什么打算
<2-4,Wilson>I was just wondering what your plans were.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,780
<2-6,Wilson>- 今晚? - 后半辈子
<2-6,Wilson>- Tonight? - In life.

48
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,590
<2-7,House>- Sam挺喜欢你 - 但她想让我搬出去
<2-7,House>- Sam likes you... - But she wants me to move out.

49
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,510
<2-7,House>不 是我想让你搬出去
<2-7,House>No.I want you to move out.

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,310
<2-8,Wilson>我没想到我和Sam进展会这么迅速
<2-8,Wilson>I didn't know things with Sam would happen so quickly.

51
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,070
<2-8,Wilson>我没-- 这节骨眼上我不想犯错
<2-8,Wilson>I didn't-- I don't want to make a mistake here.

52
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,930
<2-8,Wilson>- 我已经犯了不少了 - 因为你进展太快
<2-8,Wilson>- I've made a lot of mistakes. - By moving too quickly.

53
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,290
<2-9,House>按你的正常频率 我很惊讶你们还未梅凋二度
<2-9,House>Given your usual rate of commitment,I'm surprised you're not already re-divorced.

54
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,710
<2-10,Wilson>我可以帮你另找个房子
<2-10,Wilson>I could help you find a place.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,810
<2-11,House>我原来的房子怎么了?
<2-11,House>What's wrong with my old place?

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,710
<2-12,Wilson>没 我以为... 你想找个新地方 一个...
<2-12,Wilson>Nothing.I just thought... You might want to find somewhere new,somewhere...

57
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,210
<2-13,House>我没在那嗑过药和产生幻觉的地方
<2-13,House>Where I didn't abuse drugs and hallucinate.

58
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,860
<2-14,Wilson>对
<2-14,Wilson>Yes.

59
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,380
<2-15,House>我很好
<2-15,House>I'm fine.

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,670
<2-16,Nolan>你很好?
<2-16,Nolan>You're fine?

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,300
<2-16,Nolan>铁哥们把你扫地出门 你却很好?
<2-16,Nolan>Your best friend is tossing you out,and you're fine?

62
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,660
<2-17,House>有什么可郁闷的?
<2-17,House>Why wouldn't I be?

63
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,510
<3-1,Nolan>你没感到一丝... 背叛和愤怒?
<3-1,Nolan>You're not feeling  a little...  betrayed and angry?

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,080
<3-1,Nolan>Wilson买这两卧的公寓 就是为了你能搬去一起住
<3-1,Nolan>Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo specifically so that you could move in with him.

65
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,090
<3-1,Nolan>这才没多久
<3-1,Nolan>It wasn't that long ago.

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,610
<3-1,Nolan>你没觉得... 被耍了?
<3-1,Nolan>You don't feel a little... jerked around?

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,290
<3-2,House>他没法预料Sam会重投他的怀抱
<3-2,House>He couldn't foresee Sam coming back into his life.

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,160
<3-3,Nolan>你替朋友做的这番辩护很有道理
<3-3,Nolan>That's a very rational defense of your friend.

69
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,190
<3-3,Nolan>但我不信
<3-3,Nolan>And,uh,I'm not buying it.

70
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,390
<3-4,House>凭什么不信?
<3-4,House>Based on what?

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,880
<3-5,Nolan>就凭你来晚了 也没留意外面的新画
<3-5,Nolan>Based on the fact that you were late,and you didn't notice the pictures in the outer office.

72
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,310
<3-6,House>- 这又不是症状 - 对我来说是
<3-6,House>- Those aren't symptoms. - They are to me.

73
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,560
<3-7,Nolan>还有一点 你接了那病例对吧?
<3-7,Nolan>And here's another one.You took the case.Hmm?

74
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,150
<3-7,Nolan>没商量 没提条件
<3-7,Nolan>No negotiating,no bargaining.

75
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,570
<3-7,Nolan>没借机减少门诊任务
<3-7,Nolan>No clinic hours changed hands.

76
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,760
<3-7,Nolan>你是想转移注意力 以免纠结于好友赶你出门?
<3-7,Nolan>Were you looking for something to distract you from the fact that your best friend just threw you out?

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,210
<3-8,House>- 那病例够好玩 - 这既不是机能问题 又非医学谜题
<3-8,House>- Case was interesting. - It's not organic.It's not mysterious.

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,850
<3-9,Nolan>很可能是心理创伤导致 病人的大脑选择失忆以自卫
<3-9,Nolan>Most likely some psychologically traumatic event occurred that made the patient's brain choose to forget everything.

79
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,620
<3-10,House>非也
<3-10,House>Or not.

80
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,360
<3-10,House>这里
<3-10,House>Here.

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,910
<4-1,House>脑灰质和白质间无分化
<4-1,House>Loss of differentiation between gray and white matter.

82
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,240
<4-2,Taub>这无大碍
<4-2,Taub>That's subtle.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,780
<4-3,Chase>但恰在记忆区 不会只是巧合的
<4-3,Chase>But it's in the area that controls memory.Not likely it's a coincidence.

84
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,830
<4-4,Thirteen>细菌感染?
<4-4,Thirteen>Bacterial infection?

85
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,590
<4-5,Nolan>我有必要知道这些吗?
<4-5,Nolan>Do I need to know this?

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,580
<4-6,House>好吧 简单概括 Chase认为是多发性硬化
<4-6,House>Fine.I'll give you the cliff notes version-- chase--m.S.

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,550
<4-6,House>Taub认为是外伤 都被排除了 你想知道原因我可以告诉你
<4-6,House>Taub--physical trauma.I can tell you why we ruled them out.

88
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,750
<4-7,Nolan>不想
<4-7,Nolan>Or not.

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,730
<4-8,Chase>可能是毒素所致 得尽快找到致病源头 我们该检查一下她家
<4-8,Chase>It's probably a toxin,and we need to find it before it kills her.We should search her House.

90
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,520
<4-9,Thirteen>祝你好运
<4-9,Thirteen>Good luck with that.

91
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,560
<4-10,House>她的心率表上刻有序列号
<4-10,House>Her heart rate monitor has a serial number.

92
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,290
<4-10,House>根据它 经销商可以查出哪家店出售
<4-10,House>The distributor  can match the number  to the store that sold it.

93
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,630
<4-10,House>她那运动的劲头 肯定常进出那家店 店员也许能认出她
<4-10,House>She's a serious athlete.She might have been there often enough to be remembered.

94
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,900
<4-11,Foreman>厉害
<4-11,Foreman>Brilliant.

95
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,610
<4-12,Nolan>他真那么说了?
<4-12,Nolan>Did he really say that?

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,730
<4-14,Foreman>- 潜台词 - 这方法不靠谱
<4-14,Foreman>- Subtextually. - Long shot.

97
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,940
<4-15,House>就算店员不认识她 商店也可能在她住处附近
<4-15,House>Even if the store clerk doesn't know who she is,the store's probably close to where she lives.

98
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,250
<4-15,House>她看到周边景象说不定会想起什么
<4-15,House>Just seeing those surroundings might spark a memory.

99
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,520
<4-16,Taub>你要我们带她去?
<4-16,Taub>You want us to take her there?

100
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,390
<4-17,House>不 我带她去
<4-17,House>No. I'll take her.

101
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,330
<10-15,Sidney>真的?
<10-15,Sidney>Really?

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
<4-18,Nolan>亲自接触病人 这不是你风格吧?
<4-18,Nolan>Uh,it's unusual for you to spend time with a patient,isn't it?

103
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,600
<4-19,House>病人都很无聊... 人人如此
<4-19,House>Patients are boring... As people.

104
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,550
<4-19,House>这病人也不例外 但她处境很有意思
<4-19,House>This one I'm sure was no exception,but her situation was interesting.

105
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,220
<4-19,House>再说 我仍避着Wilson
<4-19,House>Besides,I was still avoiding Wilson.

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,720
<4-19,House>离开医院是最好的办法
<4-19,House>And no better way to avoid than leaving the hospital.

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
<4-19,House>也许吧
<4-19,House>Maybe.

108
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,510
<4-20,Nolan>或者你是不想回家?
<4-20,Nolan>Or were you avoiding going home?

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,410
<4-20,Nolan>人们让瘾君子远离老巢自有道理
<4-20,Nolan>There's a reason they tell addicts to stay away from old geography.

110
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,530
<4-21,House>不是不想回去 我回去过了 就在那天上班之前
<4-21,House>I wasn't avoiding going home.I'd already gone home... Before I came into work that day.

111
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,760
<5-1,House>我出了Wilson家门就直奔那了
<5-1,House>I went straight there from Wilson's.

112
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,210
<5-2,Alvie>喂 轻点儿! 草菅人命啊!
<5-2,Alvie>Hey,take it easy!You're gonna kill me!

113
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,580
<5-2,Alvie>天呐 什么人啊门都不敲? House 是你! 你去哪了?
<5-2,Alvie>God,why don't people  knock?House,it's you!Where you been?

114
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,620
<5-2,Alvie>等一下
<5-2,Alvie>Hold up a second.

115
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,410
<5-2,Alvie>Alvie?
<5-2,Alvie>Alvie?

116
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,350
<5-3,Nolan>Juan Alvarez 你让他住你那?
<5-3,Nolan>Juan alvarez-- you let him stay at your place?

117
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,600
<5-4,House>没有
<5-4,House>Not exactly.

118
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,900
<5-5,Alvie>我都怀疑你是不是永远不回来了
<5-5,Alvie>I was beginning to wonder if you were ever gonna show up.

119
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,360
<5-5,Alvie>你的家 我的家 家!
<5-5,Alvie>Su casa,mi casa.Casa!

120
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,730
<5-6,House>你怎么在这?
<5-6,House>Why are you here?

121
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,310
<5-7,Alvie>我出院后就回到老住处了
<5-7,Alvie>When I left Mayfield,I went back to the old neighborhood.

122
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,660
<5-7,Alvie>对了 你浴室窗户忘锁了
<5-7,Alvie>You know,you shouldn't leave the bathroom window unlocked.

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,420
<5-8,House>多谢你的安全小贴士 你来干嘛?
<5-8,House>Yeah,thanks for the safety lesson.Why are you here?

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,640
<5-9,Alvie>就像我说的 我回到原住处 发现移民局正四处找我
<5-9,Alvie>Like I said,when I went back to the neighborhood,I found out immigration was looking for me.

125
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,550
<5-9,Alvie>我就来老伙计House家串门了!
<5-9,Alvie>So I decided to visit my old buddy House!

126
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,390
<5-10,House>我家被你糟践得像件超大码囚服
<5-10,House>And turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit.

127
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,420
<5-11,Alvie>我Juan Alvarez可不是吃白饭的 我干活来换借宿
<5-11,Alvie>Juan alvarez is no freeloader.I do my part,earn my keep.

128
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,810
<5-11,Alvie>刚来第一周我给你做饭 你没回来
<5-11,Alvie>The first week I made your dinner,but you never showed up.

129
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,770
<5-11,Alvie>第二周我把你的东西都整了一遍
<5-11,Alvie>The second week  i organized your stuff.

130
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,070
<5-13,Alvie>- 我的东西? - 但你还是没回来
<5-13,Alvie>- My stuff? - But still,you never showed up.

131
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,180
<5-13,Alvie>所以本周 鉴于我粉刷本领强 就决定...
<5-13,Alvie>So this week,since I'm a real good painter,i decided to--

132
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,780
<5-14,House>咖啡桌-- 你把它放哪了?
<5-14,House>coffee table-- where'd you put it?

133
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,840
<5-14,House>卧室?
<5-14,House>In the bedroom?

134
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,410
<5-15,Alvie>颜料贵着呢 House 这可是定制的
<5-15,Alvie>The paint's not cheap,House.It's a custom color.

135
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,280
<5-15,Alvie>混合了钛色 黄色和赭石色
<5-15,Alvie>It's a mix of titanium,yellow,and ochre.

136
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,130
<5-15,Alvie>赭石... 我其实一点不喜欢 看上去像水果 上面还有毛
<5-15,Alvie>Ochre--I don't even like that stuff.It's like a fruit.It's got hair on it.

137
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,390
<5-16,House>- 不过他们说这是蔬菜... - 你卖了我的咖啡桌换我不要的涂料?
<5-16,House>- But they say it's a vegetable-- you sold my table to pay for paint that I don't want?

138
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,450
<5-17,Alvie>我还卖了点别的
<5-17,Alvie>I had to sell some other things too.

139
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,930
<5-19,Alvie>- 让开 - 不要 拜托 刷了试试看啊
<5-19,Alvie>- Get out. - No,papa,just give the color a chance.

140
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,250
<5-20,House>我现在去上班
<5-20,House>Look,I'm going to work now.

141
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,760
<5-20,House>等我回来时 最好墙的颜色 别这么非主流 你也给我消失
<5-20,House>And when I come back,the walls will be a less exciting color,and you will be gone.

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,100
<6-1,Nolan>Wilson把你赶走 你把Alvie赶走 你还说这周很平常?
<6-1,Nolan>So Wilson threw you out,and you threw alvie out-- just,uh,another week?

143
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,640
<6-2,House>区别是 Alvie赶不走 那天我骑摩托车上班
<6-2,House>Unlike me,alvie didn't leave.I took my motorcycle to work that day.

144
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,860
<6-2,House>等我回家取汽车时 他把天花板漆成了绛红色
<6-2,House>When I went home to get my car,he was painting the ceiling magenta.

145
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,000
<6-2,House>所以我把他绑身边 免得他糟蹋我房子
<6-2,House>So I brought him with me to protect the apartment.

146
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,430
<6-3,Nolan>为什么?
<6-3,Nolan>Why?

147
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,440
<6-4,House>免得他糟蹋我房子 这话听着耳熟
<6-4,House>To protect the apartment.Deja vu.

148
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,310
<6-5,Nolan>把他赶走 或支他去看电影
<6-5,Nolan>Tossing him out  or,uh,sending him to the movies or,

149
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,380
<6-5,Nolan>或关在卫生间 都能约束Alvie的破坏力
<6-5,Nolan>uh,locking him in the bathroom would also minimize alvie's destructive force.

150
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,370
<6-5,Nolan>你却让他呆在你身边 为什么?
<6-5,Nolan>But you chose his company deliberately.Why?

151
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,600
<6-6,House>显然因为他可以代替Wilson
<6-6,House>Obviously because  he's a Wilson substitute.

152
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,150
<6-6,House>他们简直是一个模子印出来的 尤其Wilson说唱时
<6-6,House>You can barely tell the difference between them,especially when Wilson raps about the hood.

153
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,130
<6-7,Nolan>我不是说Alvie是替代品 但他能极大地转移你的注意力
<6-7,Nolan>I'm not suggesting alvie's a substitute,but he would make a great distraction.

154
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,340
<6-8,House>- 转移什么注意力? - 正是我想知道的
<6-8,House>- From what? - That's what I'm trying  to find out.

155
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,260
<6-9,Nolan>继续说
<6-9,Nolan>Go on.

156
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,180
<7-1,Alvie>也许心率表是别人送她的礼物
<7-1,Alvie>Maybe the heart rate monitor was a gift.

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
<7-1,Alvie>所以没人认得她
<7-1,Alvie>That's why no one recognized her.

158
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,420
<7-2,House>闭嘴 Alvie
<7-2,House>Shut up,alvie.

159
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,830
<7-2,House>有什么熟悉的吗... 教堂 杂货店?
<7-2,House>Anything familiar... Church,grocery store?

160
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,820
<7-2,House>抱歉
<7-2,House>Sorry.

161
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,100
<7-3,Alvie>不要紧 也许X小姐从没来过镇上 心率表是网店买的
<7-3,Alvie>It's okay,Ms.x.Maybe she's never been to this town before,bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.

162
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,380
<7-4,House>你知道波多黎各人是美国公民吧?
<7-4,House>You know that puerto ricans are U.S. citizens,right?

163
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,810
<7-4,House>与其插手病例  你怎么不处理下你的身份问题?
<7-4,House>Instead of working the case,why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?

164
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,030
<7-5,Alvie>我本来有出生证明 但弄丢了
<7-5,Alvie>I had a birth certificate.I lost it.

165
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,140
<7-6,House>- 那办张新的 - 我去办了 House
<7-6,House>- So get a new one. - I tried that,House.

166
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,410
<7-7,Alvie>但我小时候市政厅有过火灾  档案都烧毁了
<7-7,Alvie>But the town hall had burned down when I was a kid,destroyed the records.

167
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,340
<7-8,House>他们只有一份?
<7-8,House>There's only one copy?

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,500
<7-9,Alvie>他们要我搞定一堆表格 才肯再发一份
<7-9,Alvie>They tried to make me fill out a whole bunch of forms before they'd give it to me.

169
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,470
<7-9,Alvie>所以我决定自己DIY
<7-9,Alvie>I decided it would be quicker and easier to do it myself.

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
<7-10,House>然后呢?
<7-10,House>How'd that go?

171
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,140
<7-11,Alvie>他们发现是假的 现在不管我说什么他们都不信了
<7-11,Alvie>They figured out it was forged.And now,for some reason,they don't believe anything I say.

172
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,540
<7-11,Alvie>他们连我是波多黎各人都不信了
<7-11,Alvie>They actually think I'm lying about being puerto rican.

173
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,240
<7-11,Alvie>要我去一个特别听证会证实
<7-11,Alvie>Told me I had to go to a special hearing to prove it.

174
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,380
<7-11,Alvie>如果没一样看着眼熟呢?
<7-11,Alvie>What if nothing ever looks familiar?

175
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,800
<7-12,House>没准你的丈夫 朋友会出现 告诉你是谁 是什么样一个人
<7-12,House>Then someone will show up-- a spouse,a friend-- to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling.

176
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,860
<7-12,House>他们会出现的
<7-12,House>They always do.

177
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,230
<7-12,House>我不知道他是谁... 但我很想他
<7-12,House>I don't know who that is... But I miss him.

178
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,060
<7-13,House>他们在听证会上怎么说?
<7-13,House>What did they say at the hearing?

179
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,620
<7-14,Alvie>我没去 我撒过一次谎了
<7-14,Alvie>I didn't go.I lied once.

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,110
<7-15,House>你妈妈是波多黎各人 你自然也是波多黎各人
<7-15,House>Your mother is puerto rican,therefore,you are puerto rican.

181
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,720
<7-15,House>你只要证明你妈是你亲妈 找点证明文件...
<7-15,House>All you got to do is prove your mom's your mom,find some documentation--

182
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,430
<7-16,Alvie>他们那种人是听不进我的话的
<7-16,Alvie>people like that don't listen to people like me.

183
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,000
<7-16,Alvie>甜甜圈! House 我们买点甜甜圈吧!
<7-16,Alvie>Doughnuts!Hey,House,let's get doughnuts!

184
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,000
<7-17,House>- Alvie 听证会...  - 所有人都喜欢甜甜圈...
<7-17,House>- Alvie,the hearing-- everyone loves doughnuts--

185
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,990
<7-18,Alvie>糖衣的 油炸的 象耳朵 还有里头的洞洞
<7-18,Alvie>glazed,crullers,elephant ears,even doughnut holes.

186
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,390
<7-18,Alvie>比运动商品店有爱多了 我打赌X小姐一定常去
<7-18,Alvie>Much better than the sporting goods store.I went Mrs.x went there all the time.

187
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,170
<7-19,House>我们不是来... 我突然想到... 你说到点子上了...
<7-19,House>We're not here-- And then I realized...  You make a good point.

188
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,390
<7-20,Alvie>真的? 我瞎扯的
<7-20,Alvie>Really?I was making that up.

189
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,430
<8-1,Durdanna>一打糖衣的 一打果酱的?
<8-1,Durdanna>Dozen glazed,dozen jelly-filled?

190
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,040
<8-1,Durdanna>照老样子来一份?
<8-1,Durdanna>You want the usual,right?

191
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,690
<8-2,House>你的老朋友 油炸碳水化合物
<8-2,House>Your old friend,the fried carbohydrate.

192
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,780
<8-2,House>她需要高热量食物支持她的运动量 你知道她叫什么吗?
<8-2,House>She needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit.Do you know her name?

193
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,250
<8-3,Durdanna>Sandy... 还是Shelley来着
<8-3,Durdanna>Sandy... Or shelley.

194
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,140
<8-3,Durdanna>不清楚 我听过和他同来的男人 这么叫她 我在这儿工作而已
<8-3,Durdanna>I don't know.The guy she's with  called her that once.I just work here.

195
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,310
<8-4,House>知道她住哪吗?
<8-4,House>Do you know where they live?

196
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,640
<8-5,Durdanna>他留下一张名片 参加免费甜甜圈抽奖
<8-5,Durdanna>He left a business card in our free doughnut jar.

197
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,480
<8-5,Durdanna>在中奖告示墙上
<8-5,Durdanna>It's up on the wall of winners.

198
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,530
<8-5,Durdanna>Sidney
<8-5,Durdanna>Sidney.

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,440
<9-1,Jay>天哪 我好担心你
<9-1,Jay>God,I was so worried about you.

200
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,090
<9-1,Jay>发生什么事了?
<9-1,Jay>What happened?

201
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,890
<10-1,Jay>警察说采取行动还过早  我就自己给医院打电话
<10-1,Jay>The police said it was too soon to do anything,so I started calling  hospitals on my own.

202
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,040
<10-1,Jay>普林斯顿教学医院不在我的清单上
<10-1,Jay>Princeton Plainsboro  wasn't even on my list.

203
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,990
<10-1,Jay>你觉得这里某件东西让她得病了?
<10-1,Jay>You really think  something around here  could have made her sick?

204
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,470
<10-2,House>这里 工作的地方 任何她去过的地方
<10-2,House>Here,work,anywhere  she could have been exposed.

205
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,780
<10-2,House>为什么普林斯顿教学医院不在清单上?
<10-2,House>Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?

206
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,420
<10-3,Jay>要跑很远 即便是对她而言
<10-3,Jay>Well,I mean,it's a long way to run,even for her.

207
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,550
<10-4,Sidney>我除了跑步还干什么?
<10-4,Sidney>What is it I do besides run?

208
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,130
<10-5,Jay>你是律师 处理民事纠纷 共同起诉的案子
<10-5,Jay>You're a lawyer-- civil rights,class action suits.

209
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,410
<10-5,Jay>工作压力很大
<10-5,Jay>It's a stressful job.

210
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,270
<10-5,Jay>跑步是你缓解压力的方式
<10-5,Jay>Running's the way you deal with it.

211
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,830
<10-6,Sidney>听起来不太像我
<10-6,Sidney>That doesn't sound like me.

212
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,660
<10-7,House>你觉得你应该是什么样的人?
<10-7,House>Do you have any idea  what would sound like you?

213
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,060
<10-8,Sidney>好问题
<10-8,Sidney>Good point.

214
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,180
<10-9,Nolan>当时你在想什么?
<10-9,Nolan>So what were you thinking  during all this?

215
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,130
<10-10,House>我当时的处境很微妙
<10-10,House>That it was a strange  position to be in.

216
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,000
<10-10,House>她对我比对她丈夫还亲近
<10-10,House>At that moment,she was  more comfortable with me  than with her husband.

217
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,080
<10-10,House>他开始觉得不安
<10-10,House>And he was picking up  on it.

218
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,290
<10-11,Nolan>那你呢?
<10-11,Nolan>What about you?

219
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,190
<10-12,House>我怎么了?
<10-12,House>What about me how?

220
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,900
<10-13,Nolan>那你觉得你们之间 有没建立起这种亲密关系?
<10-13,Nolan>Well,there was a sort of,um,artificial intimacy between you?

221
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,660
<10-13,Nolan>她依赖你 某程度上 你会不会被这种依赖吸引?
<10-13,Nolan>She'd been  dependent on you.Uh,did you find that  attractive on some level?

222
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,870
<10-13,Nolan>还是觉得困扰?
<10-13,Nolan>Disturbing?

223
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,060
<10-14,House>我只有这两个选择?
<10-14,House>Those are my two choices?

224
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,200
<10-14,House>两个都不是
<10-14,House>None of the above.

225
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,510
<10-14,House>她只是个病人 我觉得她有意思罢了
<10-14,House>She was just a patient.She was interesting.

226
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,260
<10-15,Sidney>我们真的...结婚了?
<10-15,Sidney>So we're really... Married?

227
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,330
<10-16,Jay>结婚四年了
<10-16,Jay>For four years.

228
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,420
<10-17,Alvie>X小姐 你的生活真如柠檬般清新
<10-17,Alvie>Ms.X,you lead a lemon fresh life.

229
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,560
<10-17,Alvie>我在水池下找到三瓶不同的清洁剂
<10-17,Alvie>Found three different  cleansers under the sink.

230
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,030
<10-17,Alvie>还把药品柜搜了一遍
<10-17,Alvie>Cleaned out the medicine cabinets too.

231
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,440
<10-18,Jay>她刚打赢一场官司 帮那些房子建在 原沼气池上的家庭获得重新安置
<10-18,Jay>You know,she just won a settlement for some families whose housing development was built on  an old methane field.

232
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,870
<10-19,House>接触甲烷能解释她的症状
<10-19,House>Toxic exposure to methane  could explain this.

233
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,570
<10-20,Sidney>我冲浪?
<10-20,Sidney>I surf?

234
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,920
<10-21,Jay>我们认识前你就不玩了
<10-21,Jay>You stopped before we met.

235
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,460
<10-21,Jay>你太忙了
<10-21,Jay>You've been too busy.

236
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,860
<10-22,Sidney>我们结婚了?
<10-22,Sidney>And we're married?

237
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,030
<10-23,Jay>是的
<10-23,Jay>Yes.

238
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,690
<10-24,Alvie>不是针对你
<10-24,Alvie>All right,it's nothing personal.

239
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,970
<10-24,Alvie>我打赌你们第一次见面时 你不是她喜欢的型
<10-24,Alvie>Bet she didn't think you were her type back when  you first met either.

240
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,710
<11-1,House>我们带她回医院验血验尿 着手治疗
<11-1,House>We'll take her back to the hospital,test her blood and urine and start treatment.

241
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,610
<11-2,Sidney>我没事
<11-2,Sidney>I'm all right.

242
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,970
<11-3,House>- 怎么了? - 我不知道
<11-3,House>- What happened? - I don't know.

243
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,780
<11-4,Sidney>我的脚突然麻痹了
<11-4,Sidney>My foot suddenly went numb.

244
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,070
<11-5,Alvie>她尿裤子了
<11-5,Alvie>Her pants are wet.

245
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,000
<11-6,House>尿失禁
<11-6,House>Urinary incontinence.

246
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,390
<11-6,House>她复杂部分性癫痫发作
<11-6,House>She's having complex partial seizures.

247
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,530
<11-6,House>不是甲烷导致
<11-6,House>This isn't methane.

248
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,350
<11-6,House>- 篮子不用拿了 我们得给她做... - 癫痫?
<11-6,House>- You can leave the bucket.We need to get her to-- Seizures?

249
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,210
<11-7,Nolan>这是你第二个联系自身情况的诊断了
<11-7,Nolan>his is the second diagnosis you've come up with that has a personal resonance for you.

250
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,390
<11-8,House>我基于私人问题作医学诊断?
<11-8,House>I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues?

251
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,600
<11-8,House>你认为她从台阶摔下还尿裤子 是因为Wilson也把她甩了?
<11-8,House>You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?

252
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,230
<11-9,Nolan>你选择告诉我这个病例 我们分析下
<11-9,Nolan>You're choosing to tell me about this case,so let's look at it.

253
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,790
<11-9,Nolan>一开始你坚持  是她过去接触的有毒物质致病
<11-9,Nolan>First you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past,

254
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,740
<11-9,Nolan>- 也许你联系到你曾接触的毒物 - 中毒是Chase想的
<11-9,Nolan>- possibly because you're worried  about a harmful toxin  from your own past. - Chase had the toxin idea.

255
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,050
<11-11,Nolan>- 只能说他太纠结我的过往 - 现在你又说是癫痫紊乱?
<11-11,Nolan>- Maybe he's obsessed with my past. - And now you're talking about a seizure disorder?

256
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,350
<11-12,House>这又不是有毒物质
<11-12,House>Which is also not a toxin.

257
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,080
<11-13,Nolan>但可能是大脑陈旧性损伤导致
<11-13,Nolan>But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain.

258
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,080
<11-13,Nolan>为什么你这么害怕你的过去?
<11-13,Nolan>W-why do you see your past as such a threat?

259
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,680
<11-14,House>我不仅不害怕它 我还想把它找回来
<11-14,House>Not only am I unthreatened by it,I was trying to get it back.

260
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,000
<12-1,House>这里有个凹槽
<12-1,House>There's a ding mark.

261
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,800
<12-2,Dutch>那是件垃圾 来时就有凹槽了
<12-2,Dutch>It's a piece of junk.It was dinged when it came in.

262
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,910
<12-3,House>本来就有杯印 刮痕 掉漆 还有那仨凹痕没错
<12-3,House>Sure,the--the cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three chips.

263
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,620
<12-3,House>但第四个是新的
<12-3,House>This fourth one is new.

264
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,340
<12-4,Dutch>我这是当铺 不是给你保管东西的 你到底要还是不要?
<12-4,Dutch>I run a pawn shop,not a storage company.Do you want it or not?

265
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,540
<12-5,Alvie>应该就这些了
<12-5,Alvie>That should be it.

266
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,470
<12-6,House>你说你当了五本 这儿只有四本
<12-6,House>You said you pawned five books.There's only four.

267
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,480
<12-7,Alvie>只有这些了
<12-7,Alvie>That's all there is.

268
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,610
<12-8,House>那本"急性腹痛治疗"呢?
<12-8,House>Where's approach  to the acute abdomen?

269
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,090
<12-9,Dutch>卖了
<12-9,Dutch>Sold it.

270
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,490
<12-10,House>- 卖给谁了? - 我不能告诉你
<12-10,House>- To? - I can't tell you.

271
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,460
<12-11,Dutch>这是规定 我也不想告诉你
<12-11,Dutch>It's a law,and it should be.

272
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,210
<12-11,Dutch>你这种无赖会追着别人要回来
<12-11,Dutch>Crazy bastards like you try to hunt down their stuff.

273
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,030
<12-12,House>这一堆多少钱?
<12-12,House>How much for the pile?

274
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,290
<12-13,Dutch>500块
<12-13,Dutch>$500.

275
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,100
<12-14,House>- 你说它是垃圾 - 不
<12-14,House>- You said it was junk. - No,no.

276
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,030
<12-15,Dutch>是你的垃圾 500块-- 不要拉倒
<12-15,Dutch>It's your junk.You want it.$500-- take it or leave it.

277
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,400
<13-1,Nolan>为什么要回这些东西对你如此重要?
<13-1,Nolan>why is it so important that you get your stuff back?

278
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,160
<13-2,House>不像其他人...  他们不在乎自己的东西易主
<13-2,House>Unlike the rest of humanity... Who's okay when their belongings are taken.

279
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,220
<13-2,House>每个人都想留住自己的东西 因为那是自己的
<13-2,House>Everyone wants their stuff.That's why it's their stuff.

280
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,430
<13-3,Nolan>但没人会付五倍价钱
<13-3,Nolan>Everyone doesn't pay five times what it's worth.

281
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,540
<13-4,House>我喜欢我的东西
<13-4,House>I like my stuff.

282
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,230
<13-4,House>Wilson动我都不能忍... 这无关Wilson
<13-4,House>I hate it when Wilson moves it-- This is not about Wilson!

283
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,840
<13-6,House>说吧
<13-6,House>Say it.

284
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,660
<13-7,Nolan>我不想说什么
<13-7,Nolan>I wasn't gonna say anything.

285
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,060
<14-1,House>31 31! 传球!
<14-1,House>31,31!Hike!

286
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,700
<14-2,Alvie>第一档进攻!
<14-2,Alvie>First down!

287
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,360
<14-3,House>再来个触地得分
<14-3,House>One more,you get a touchdown.

288
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,900
<14-5,House>传球!
<14-5,House>Hike!

289
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,620
<14-6,Alvie>House 你不能持球达阵
<14-6,Alvie>House,you can't run  for the touchdown.

290
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,880
<14-7,House>传球!
<14-7,House>And...Hike!

291
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,970
<14-7,House>等等
<14-7,House>Wait,wait,wait.Wait.

292
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,380
<14-7,House>你只告诉我Wilson出现 却不告诉我他说了什么?
<14-7,House>You seriously thought  you were gonna tell me  that Wilson showed up but not tell me what he said?

293
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,870
<15-1,House>因为我以为你很聪明 无需我赘言
<15-1,House>Because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him.

294
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,660
<15-1,House>Wilson发现我一天没去办公室
<15-1,House>Wilson noticed  that I didn't come to my office all day.

295
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,620
<15-1,House>就来找我 确定我没事-- 无聊透顶
<15-1,House>He came to find me,wanted to make sure I'm okay-- boring,boring,boring.

296
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,800
<15-2,Nolan>你却认为有必要告诉我玩橄榄球的事?
<15-2,Nolan>Um,but you thought it was important to tell me about nerf football?

297
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,000
<15-2,Nolan>抱歉 你的故事 继续
<15-2,Nolan>Sorry.Your story.Continue.

298
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,400
<15-3,Alvie>House House 打住! 停!
<15-3,Alvie>House,House,stop!Stop,stop,stop.

299
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,340
<15-4,House>你没事吧?
<15-4,House>You okay?

300
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,010
<15-5,Alvie>没事 是我妈的 我四岁时她去世了
<15-5,Alvie>Yeah.It was my mother's.She died when I was four.

301
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,900
<15-5,Alvie>这是她唯一留下的东西
<15-5,Alvie>It's all I have left.

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,810
<15-6,House>真伤心 Alvie
<15-6,House>That's very sad,alvie.

303
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,960
<15-6,House>听着 我给你预约了移民听证会
<15-6,House>Listen,I set up an immigration hearing.

304
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,960
<15-7,Alvie>不 House 我会坐牢或更糟--  被驱逐到多米尼加什么的
<15-7,Alvie>No,House,I'm gonna end up in jail or worse-- the Dominican or someplace.

305
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,370
<15-7,Alvie>天知道 不
<15-7,Alvie>Que se yo.Que no.

306
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,480
<16-1,Nolan>有意思
<16-1,Nolan>Um,interesting.

307
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,840
<16-1,Nolan>你表现得毫不在意他人的感受
<16-1,Nolan>You present yourself as,uh,not giving a damn about other people's emotions,

308
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,870
<16-1,Nolan>但行动却相反
<16-1,Nolan>but your actions  indicate otherwise.

309
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,400
<16-1,Nolan>你无视Alvie说他母亲的事 却很关心地去安排听证会
<16-1,Nolan>You dismiss alvie's story about his mother,but you cared enough to schedule a hearing.

310
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,950
<16-2,House>我只关心了八秒钟
<16-2,House>I cared for eight seconds.

311
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,820
<16-2,House>注意力就转到了别处
<16-2,House>Then I got distracted.

312
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,050
<17-1,House>- 喂 - 我们让病人保持清醒12小时
<17-1,House>- Yeah. - We've kept the patient up  for 12 hours now.

313
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,640
<17-2,Taub>没有癫痫发作的迹象
<17-2,Taub>No hint  of seizure-like activity.We should shut this down.

314
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,070
<17-3,House>试试打闪光灯 增加心理压力
<17-3,House>Try a strobe light,add more stress.

315
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,140
<17-4,Taub>- 我想她压力够大了 - 除了工作我们还做其它事吗?
<17-4,Taub>- I think there's plenty  of stress in here. - Don't we ever do anything but work?

316
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,410
<18-1,Sidney>- 你跑步 - 那也是辛苦活
<18-1,Sidney>- You run. - That's just more work.

317
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,360
<18-2,Jay>就没别的娱乐?
<18-2,Jay>What about fun?

318
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,390
<18-3,Sidney>天哪 我们怎么这么无趣?
<18-3,Sidney>God,how can we be this boring?

319
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,300
<18-4,Taub>显然 失去记忆
<18-4,Taub>Apparently,without her memory,

320
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,660
<18-4,Taub>病人的人格回到了某种原始状态
<18-4,Taub>the patient's personality has returned to what you might call its natural state.

321
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,530
<18-5,House>大学时发生的一件事 改变了她的人生轨迹
<18-5,House>Seems she had a wake-up call  while she was at college.

322
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,010
<18-5,House>她哥哥死于车祸 她决定要活出生命意义
<18-5,House>Her brother died in a car accident.She decided to make her life mean something.

323
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,430
<18-5,House>于是进了法学院
<18-5,House>Went to law school.

324
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,790
<18-5,House>现在这一切都没了
<18-5,House>Now that's all gone.

325
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,840
<18-6,Nolan>引发改变的记忆消失了... 改变也随之消失
<18-6,Nolan>The thing that caused the change is gone... So the change itself is gone.

326
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,470
<18-7,House>我就知道 这病例的心理因素 会让你感兴趣
<18-7,House>Yeah.I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you.

327
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,300
<18-7,House>我打赌你已经有结论了 是什么?
<18-7,House>Bet you got a theory already.What is it?

328
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,270
<18-8,Nolan>和诊断无关
<18-8,Nolan>It's not relevant.

329
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,240
<18-9,House>什么?
<18-9,House>What is it?

330
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,910
<18-10,Nolan>为什么关心我的结论?
<18-10,Nolan>Why do you care about my theory?

331
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,200
<18-11,House>我觉得他...让她觉得很烦
<18-11,House>I think he just... Bores her.

332
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,620
<18-11,House>她好比新生儿看到自己的未来 但这个未来使她觉得了无生趣
<18-11,House>She's at an earlier  stage of development.She's looking  at her grown-up future,and it puts her  to sleep.

333
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,030
<18-12,Nolan>如果他只是让她烦了  她会出于礼貌不表现出来
<18-12,Nolan>If he just bored her,she'd hide it to be polite.

334
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,170
<18-12,Nolan>他们的问题在于 就像你和我  House 他们不在历史的同一页
<18-12,Nolan>Their problem is synchronicity.Just like you and me,House,they're not on the same page.

335
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,780
<18-12,Nolan>他向她述说以往的共同经历
<18-12,Nolan>He talks to her like someone he shares history with.

336
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,300
<18-12,Nolan>但在她看来 他只是个陌生人 拼命向她亲近
<18-12,Nolan>But from her point of view,he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her.

337
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,140
<18-12,Nolan>她当然不会喜欢他 他帮不上忙
<18-12,Nolan>Of course she doesn't like him.He's not helping.

338
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,040
<18-12,Nolan>他感到自己正失去自己的妻子 于是越发急躁
<18-12,Nolan>He can feel  he's losing his wife,and it makes him come on stronger.

339
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
<18-13,House>他差点真失去她了
<18-13,House>He almost did lose his wife.

340
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,010
<19-1,Foreman>呼吸问题由肺部积液过量导致
<19-1,Foreman>The breathing problem was caused by fluid overload in the lungs.

341
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,480
<19-2,Thirteen>尿崩症
<19-2,Thirteen>Diabetes insipidus.

342
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,830
<19-3,Taub>尿崩症由下视丘损伤引起
<19-3,Taub>And the d.I. Came from damage to the hypothalamus.

343
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,490
<19-4,House>下视丘在这里  因此尿崩和失禁同时出现
<19-4,House>Hypothalamus here,hence the d.I. And incontinence.They mingle here.

344
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,570
<19-4,House>此处导致全面性遗忘 这是运动皮层-- 导致脚部麻痹
<19-4,House>There's the global amnesia.And the motor cortex-- that's the foot paralysis.

345
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,610
<19-4,House>什么同时导致以上问题?
<19-4,House>What do they all have in common?

346
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,990
<19-4,House>你说这些是要糊弄我
<19-4,House>Okay,now you're just  doing this to mess with me.

347
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,440
<19-4,House>这鉴别诊断和你的问题有何关系?
<19-4,House>What possible relevance does this differential have to your problems?

348
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,060
<20-1,House>这能得出牛海绵状脑炎的结论
<20-1,House>It ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis.

349
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,280
<20-1,House>我说服手下切掉病人大脑一部分
<20-1,House>I convinced the team to cut out part of this woman's brain.

350
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,470
<20-1,House>- 你对此不感兴趣? - 不
<20-1,House>- That's not interesting to you? - No.

351
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,950
<20-3,House>即便切的是杏仁核? (控制恐惧)
<20-3,House>Not even if it's the amygdala?

352
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,240
<20-3,House>会让她丧失所有长期记忆
<20-3,House>She'll lose all her long-term memory.

353
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,060
<20-4,Nolan>你无非想强调 割裂别人的过去 与你想逃避自己的过去无关
<20-4,Nolan>Well,this is where you tell me that being cavalier with someone else's past has nothing to do with avoiding your own past.

354
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,900
<20-4,Nolan>这病例根本与你不相干
<20-4,Nolan>The case is irrelevant.

355
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,690
<20-4,Nolan>你只是觉得...有趣
<20-4,Nolan>You just found it,uh... Interesting.

356
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,430
<20-5,House>心理医师不是该循循善诱吗?
<20-5,House>Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?

357
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,170
<20-6,Nolan>手册里没规定
<20-6,Nolan>Nowhere... Is that in the manual.

358
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,240
<20-6,Nolan>你接受治疗一年了
<20-6,Nolan>Look,you--you've been in therapy for a year.

359
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,640
<20-6,Nolan>你很清楚我让你说说自己 是想让你说那些影响你--
<20-6,Nolan>You know when I ask you to talk about anything,I mean anything that affects you--

360
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,530
<20-6,Nolan>使你沮丧 抓狂 轻松或高兴的事
<20-6,Nolan>what upset you,what made you mad or relieved or joyful.

361
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,880
<20-6,Nolan>但在我看来 这病例对你毫无影响
<20-6,Nolan>You want me to believe that this case means nothing?

362
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,870
<20-6,Nolan>那...
<20-6,Nolan>Then,um...

363
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,690
<20-6,Nolan>为什么我要听呢?
<20-6,Nolan>Why should I listen to it?

364
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,210
<20-7,House>这段时间你也收钱?
<20-7,House>Are you charging me for this time?

365
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,090
<20-8,Nolan>嗯
<20-8,Nolan>Yes.

366
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,430
<20-9,House>真荒谬
<20-9,House>This is ridiculous.

367
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,670
<20-10,Nolan>那是什么?
<20-10,Nolan>What's that?

368
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,530
<20-10,Nolan>你胳膊上的?
<20-10,Nolan>On the back of your arm?

369
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,730
<20-11,House>只是瘀伤 我跌倒了
<20-11,House>It's just a bruise.And I fell.

370
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,090
<20-12,Nolan>你记得自己跌倒了?
<20-12,Nolan>You remember falling?

371
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,660
<20-12,Nolan>不
<20-12,Nolan>No.

372
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,970
<20-13,House>我喝醉了... 没法保持平衡
<20-13,House>I was drunk... Hence the balance issues.

373
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,270
<20-14,Nolan>看来你倒在某人靴尖上了
<20-14,Nolan>Well,it looks like you fell on the tip of someone's boot.

374
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,850
<20-15,House>我说的话激怒了别人
<20-15,House>I said something that someone objected to.

375
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,910
<20-16,Nolan>- 如果你不记得 你怎么... - 一般别人打我都是这原因
<20-16,Nolan>- Well,if you don't remember,then how can you-- it's usually  the way it is  when someone hits me.

376
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,560
<20-17,House>你倒地后 他们踹你固然可恶 但这可恶不是没由头的
<20-17,House>People who kick when you're down are jerks,but they're generally not irrational jerks.

377
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,260
<20-18,Nolan>你喝醉卷入酒吧打斗 醒来忘了 你还坚持说你没事?
<20-18,Nolan>Yogot drunk enough to get into a bar fight and not remember,and you've been insisting that everything's fine?

378
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,610
<20-18,Nolan>为什么出去买醉?
<20-18,Nolan>W-why--why go out and get blind drunk?

379
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,870
<20-18,Nolan>你想找人打架?
<20-18,Nolan>Were you looking  for a fight?

380
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,080
<20-19,House>我不知道
<20-19,House>I don't know.

381
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,520
<20-20,Nolan>你做错了什么?
<20-20,Nolan>What have you screwed up?

382
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,410
<20-21,House>- 什么? - 你说你被打
<20-21,House>- What? - You say that when  you've been hit in the past,

383
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,350
<20-22,Nolan>是因为你挑起事端 就是说你知道其危险性
<20-22,Nolan>it's because you provoked it with something that you said,which means you're well aware of the risks.

384
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,480
<20-22,Nolan>所以某程度上 你是故意去酒吧讨打
<20-22,Nolan>So on some level,you were in that bar looking  for someone to hurt you.

385
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,390
<20-22,Nolan>人们惩罚自己  往往因为他做了 或没做某些事
<20-22,Nolan>Logically,people punish themselves  for something they did or something they didn't do.

386
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,910
<20-22,Nolan>你到底做错了什么?
<20-22,Nolan>So what... Did you screw up?

387
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,960
<20-22,Nolan>我不知道
<20-22,Nolan>I don't know.

388
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,720
<20-23,House>好吧 也许是有问题
<20-23,House>Okay,there may be a problem.

389
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,430
<20-24,Nolan>很好... 我们谈谈Wilson
<20-24,Nolan>All right... Let's talk about Wilson.

390
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,750
<21-1,Wilson>我告诉他 你的书沾染了炭疽孢子
<21-1,Wilson>I told him your book was contaminated with Anthrax spores.

391
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
<21-1,Wilson>还给了他300块
<21-1,Wilson>Then I gave him $300.

392
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,480
<21-1,Wilson>买家的地址
<21-1,Wilson>The address of the buyer.

393
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,210
<21-1,Wilson>我不该这么急着赶走你
<21-1,Wilson>Maybe I was hasty in asking you to move out.

394
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,320
<21-1,Wilson>何不和我还有Sam多住一阵?
<21-1,Wilson>Why don't you stay with me and Sam for a little while?

395
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,890
<21-1,Wilson>没必要这么急
<21-1,Wilson>There's no need to hurry things.

396
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,440
<21-2,House>为什么挽留我?
<21-2,House>What prompted this?

397
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,250
<21-3,Wilson>你从Mayfield出来后不能一个人呆着
<21-3,Wilson>Look,the whole idea was that after Mayfield,you wouldn't be on your own.

398
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,660
<21-3,Wilson>我们一起住 我可以随时和你通气---
<21-3,Wilson>I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you're staying with me than--

399
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,240
<21-4,House>看在上帝份上 Wilson
<21-4,House>God's sake,Wilson.

400
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,480
<21-4,House>你只能越描越黑
<21-4,House>You really span  the chasm  from wishy to washy.

401
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,260
<21-4,House>既然唱了白脸就唱下去
<21-4,House>If you're gonna be an ass,be an ass.

402
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,840
<21-4,House>狠心到底
<21-4,House>Stick with it.

403
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,940
<22-1,Nolan>他只想安抚你 你为什么这么苛刻?
<22-1,Nolan>Why were you being  so hard on the guy,when he was being conciliatory?

404
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,700
<22-2,House>算了吧
<22-2,House>Come on.

405
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,170
<22-2,House>是Cuddy利用他的内疚 让他这样做的
<22-2,House>Cuddy played on his guilt.She put him up to this.

406
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,920
<22-3,Nolan>你怎么知道?
<22-3,Nolan>How do you know that?

407
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,140
<22-3,Nolan>你怎知不是他自己的主意?
<22-3,Nolan>How do you know this wasn't entirely his own idea?

408
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,290
<22-4,House>原因有二--  第一 他想和Sam过二人世界
<22-4,House>Two reasons--  first,he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam.

409
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,980
<22-4,House>想我走有段时间了
<22-4,House>He's been thinking about  asking me to leave for a while.

410
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,140
<22-4,House>好容易说出口  他会突然改主意? 不可能
<22-4,House>Finally he does it and immediately turns around and changes his mind--no.

411
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,980
<22-4,House>他肯定和某人谈了
<22-4,House>He talked to somebody.

412
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,230
<22-5,Nolan>也许是Sam
<22-5,Nolan>Maybe it was Sam.

413
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
<23-1,House>也有这个可能
<23-1,House>Yeah,that's a possibility.

414
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,170
<23-2,Wilson>我希望这是我最后一段认真的感情
<23-2,Wilson>I want this to be the last serious relationship I ever have.

415
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,030
<23-2,Wilson>我希望这就是我的归宿
<23-2,Wilson>I want this to be the one.

416
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,050
<23-3,Sam>我也是
<23-3,Sam>Me too.

417
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,270
<23-3,Sam>House在哪?
<23-3,Sam>Where's House?

418
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,650
<23-3,Sam>没了他 这还有什么意思?
<23-3,Sam>It's not as meaningful without him.

419
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,880
<23-3,Sam>好吧...不是Sam
<23-3,Sam>Okay,um... Not Sam.

420
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,040
<24-1,Nolan>但还是不能说明为什么是Cuddy
<24-1,Nolan>Uh,that still doesn't answer  why Cuddy.

421
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,460
<24-2,House>因为他们谈论过我
<24-2,House>Because they've been talking about me.

422
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,290
<24-2,House>她打来叫我去查看病人 她从不无缘无故这么做
<24-2,House>She called me  to check on the patient,which she never does without a reason.

423
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,060
<24-2,House>- 我问为什么 她说... - 她是律师 House
<24-2,House>- I asked why,and she said... - She's a barracuda attorney,House.

424
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,380
<25-1,Cuddy>对待这种病人 我们要小心
<25-1,Cuddy>These are the kind of patients we like to keep happy.

425
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,980
<25-2,House>眼下 这病人记得"法律" 二字怎么写就算走运了
<25-2,House>Right now the patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.

426
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,270
<25-3,Cuddy>是的 但当她恢复记忆
<25-3,Cuddy>Yeah,but when  she gets that memory back,

427
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,100
<25-3,Cuddy>这也是我们努力的目标 她就会写"官司"二字了
<25-3,Cuddy>which we are trying  to make happen,she'll be able  to spell lawsuit.

428
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,640
<25-3,Cuddy>我只想给你通个气儿
<25-3,Cuddy>I'm just touching base.

429
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,200
<25-4,House>通个气
<25-4,House>Touching base.

430
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,780
<25-4,House>Wilson也用了同样的字眼
<25-4,House>Wilson used exactly the same phrase.

431
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,280
<25-4,House>算计我是她最爱的消遣
<25-4,House>Colluding about me is her favorite pastime.

432
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,130
<25-5,Nolan>好吧 你认为他们谈过了
<25-5,Nolan>Okay,you think they talked.

433
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,240
<25-5,Nolan>那你认为他们说了什么?
<25-5,Nolan>How do you think that conversation went?

434
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,950
<25-6,Wilson>我很担心House
<25-6,Wilson>I'm worried about House.

435
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,250
<25-6,Wilson>我也是
<25-6,Wilson>Me too.

436
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,080
<25-7,Cuddy>你就不能等等吗?
<25-7,Cuddy>Couldn't you have waited?

437
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,130
<25-7,Cuddy>要他回到从前的公寓  靠自己过活 未免为时太早
<25-7,Cuddy>It's way too early for him to be on his own,back in the old apartment.

438
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,950
<25-8,Wilson>- 你凭什么觉着他能应付? - 我说了帮他找个新住处
<25-8,Wilson>- What makes you think he can handle it? - I offered to find him a new place.

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,540
<25-9,Cuddy>你得把他接回去
<25-9,Cuddy>You have to let him  back into your condo.

440
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,510
<25-10,Wilson>Sam和我刚把他弄出去
<25-10,Wilson>Sam and I just got him  out of the condo.

441
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,830
<25-11,Cuddy>你知道House是什么人 他有自毁倾向
<25-11,Cuddy>You know what House is like.He's self-destructive.

442
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,080
<25-12,Cuddy>没人监管他 又会重新嗑药
<25-12,Cuddy>Without constant supervision,he's gonna slide back into drugs.

443
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,290
<25-12,Cuddy>如果你不干 就得我来了
<25-12,Cuddy>If you're not watching him,I've got to.

444
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,200
<25-13,Wilson>是啊
<25-13,Wilson>Yeah.

445
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,310
<25-14,Nolan>他们不信任你
<25-14,Nolan>So they don't trust you.

446
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,430
<25-14,Nolan>他们认为你会重蹈覆辙
<25-14,Nolan>They assume you'll fail.

447
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,250
<25-14,Nolan>这是他们的忧虑 还是你的?
<25-14,Nolan>Are these their fears or yours?

448
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,130
<25-15,Nolan>我们把灯打开吧?
<25-15,Nolan>Let's turn on the lights,Hmm?

449
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,340
<25-15,Nolan>也点亮你的心灯
<25-15,Nolan>In your brain.

450
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,170
<25-15,Nolan>可能他们真谈过了 但...  你怎知道不是这样?
<25-15,Nolan>Maybe they did talk about you,but... How do you know it didn't happen like this?

451
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,360
<25-17,Cuddy>- 我很担心House - 为什么?
<25-17,Cuddy>- I'm worried about House. - Why?

452
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,600
<25-18,Wilson>自打从Mayfield出院以后 这是他第一次独立生活
<25-18,Wilson>It's the first time he'll be on his own since Mayfield.

453
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,080
<25-19,Cuddy>你过分保护他了 House不需生活在温室里
<25-19,Cuddy>Now you're being  overprotective.House doesn't need  to be wrapped in cotton wool.

454
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,830
<25-19,Cuddy>你很清楚这点 否则不会叫他搬出去
<25-19,Cuddy>But you know that,or you wouldn't have asked him to move out.

455
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,520
<25-19,Cuddy>好吧
<25-19,Cuddy>Okay.

456
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,120
<25-20,Wilson>我想是我想多了
<25-20,Wilson>I guess this is really about me.

457
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,970
<25-20,Wilson>但...我觉得自己很混
<25-20,Wilson>It's just... I feel like a jerk.

458
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:54,210
<25-20,Wilson>当然 Sam和我到头来还是会独处 但我没给他时间去适应
<25-20,Wilson>Sure,Sam and I are gonna want to be on our own eventually,but I kind of  sprang this on him.

459
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,930
<25-20,Wilson>我该让他别着急着走 呆到能独立生活为止
<25-20,Wilson>The right way  would have been  to just tell him  to take as long as he needed,that there's no hurry.

460
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,410
<25-21,Cuddy>过程拖的再长 结果还不是一样
<25-21,Cuddy>So it's not what you did,but how you did it.

461
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,960
<25-22,Wilson>但对友情来说 过程很重要
<25-22,Wilson>That matters in a friendship.

462
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,720
<25-22,Wilson>我必须作出补救
<25-22,Wilson>I need to fix this.

463
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,520
<25-23,Cuddy>你让他搬回来不就好了
<25-23,Cuddy>Why don't you talk to him about moving back in?

464
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,210
<25-23,Cuddy>只是通个气儿
<25-23,Cuddy>Just touch base.

465
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,110
<25-24,Taub>病人在同意书上有争论
<25-24,Taub>We're having a consent issue with the patient.

466
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,550
<25-25,Nolan>等等 Taub不该在这
<25-25,Nolan>Wait a minute.Taub's not here.

467
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,060
<25-24,Taub>- 不 他在 - 病人在同意书上有争议
<25-24,Taub>- Yeah,he is. - We're having a consent issue with the patient.

468
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,130
<25-28,Nolan>Taub跑到我想象的 Wilson和Cuddy对话中干什么?
<25-28,Nolan>What's Taub doing in my imaginary version of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?

469
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,790
<25-29,House>你的想象该结束了 因为根本不靠谱
<25-29,House>Your version needed to be ended,'cause it's crap.

470
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,100
<25-29,House>里头充斥着脉脉温情  相信我最终会走上正途
<25-29,House>It's all sweetness and light and... Faith that I'm gonna choose the right path.

471
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,140
<25-29,House>听起来就像Wilson
<25-29,House>Yeah,that sounds like Wilson.

472
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,550
<26-1,Nolan>我的想象是有事实支持的
<26-1,Nolan>I have as much evidence  for mine  as you do for yours.

473
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,830
<26-1,Nolan>据我所知 Wilson是你朋友
<26-1,Nolan>I know Wilson's your friend.

474
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,720
<26-1,Nolan>他开始担心这么做是不对的
<26-1,Nolan>So he could be wondering if he did right by you.

475
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,770
<26-1,Nolan>我也相信 如果他不确定你能独立生活
<26-1,Nolan>And I know he wouldn't have asked you to move out in the first place unless

476
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,050
<26-1,Nolan>一开始就不会叫你搬出去
<26-1,Nolan>he was convinced you could handle life on your own.

477
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,820
<26-2,House>但据我所知 他和Cuddy曾背着我  商量怎么对付我
<26-2,House>And I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House problem.

478
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,160
<26-3,Nolan>两个版本都有可信之处
<26-3,Nolan>So there's truth in both versions.

479
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,670
<26-3,Nolan>但你宁愿相信让你难过那个
<26-3,Nolan>But you choose to focus on the parts that make you uncomfortable.

480
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,440
<26-3,Nolan>那么...
<26-3,Nolan>So...

481
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,360
<26-3,Nolan>为什么你和Wilson是朋友?
<26-3,Nolan>Why are you and Wilson... Friends?

482
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,080
<26-3,Nolan>你认为这样的友情已是你的极限?
<26-3,Nolan>Do you think this friendship is the best you can do?

483
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,400
<26-4,House>Wilson不是个安慰奖
<26-4,House>Wilson is not a consolation prize.

484
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,040
<26-5,Nolan>你在替他说话
<26-5,Nolan>There... You're defending him.

485
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,570
<26-5,Nolan>一分钟前 他还是密谋算计你的埃古  (出自奥赛罗)
<26-5,Nolan>And a minute ago,he was skulking around in the background like some sort of manipulative iago.

486
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,640
<26-6,House>他是我的朋友
<26-6,House>He's my friend.

487
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,590
<26-7,Nolan>那你看重他什么呢?
<26-7,Nolan>So what do you value in him?

488
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,070
<26-8,House>我可以随心所欲对他说任何话  他也不会抛弃我
<26-8,House>I can say whatever I want to him,and he'll never leave.

489
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,190
<26-9,Nolan>他这不是抛弃你了
<26-9,Nolan>He's sort of leaving.

490
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,640
<26-9,Nolan>至少他不能经常陪着你了 因为他把Sam放在第一位
<26-9,Nolan>At least,he won't be around as much... Because he's putting Sam first.

491
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,650
<26-10,House>暂时而已
<26-10,House>For now.

492
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,960
<26-10,House>他们分手后 就会让我搬回去
<26-10,House>After the divorce,he'll probably ask me to move in again.

493
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,840
<26-10,House>我目光比较长远
<26-10,House>I take the long view.

494
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,890
<26-11,Nolan>你对Wilson说了吗?
<26-11,Nolan>You say that to Wilson?

495
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,430
<26-12,House>开玩笑么? 这种论调他还不恨死我
<26-12,House>Are you kidding?That's the kind of remark that leads people to hate you.

496
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,700
<26-13,Nolan>也许你一开始是对的
<26-13,Nolan>Uh,maybe you've been right from the beginning.

497
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,420
<26-13,Nolan>不是Wilson的问题
<26-13,Nolan>Maybe this isn't about Wilson.

498
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,380
<26-14,House>我好容易跟上你节奏 你却说这个?
<26-14,House>You say that now that I finally agree with you?

499
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,510
<26-14,House>你非得和我唱反调吗?
<26-14,House>Do you just argue the opposite of whatever I say?

500
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,160
<26-15,Nolan>我不是说Wilson的事没影响你
<26-15,Nolan>I don't mean the Wilson thing doesn't,uh,bother you,

501
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,970
<26-15,Nolan>但听来 他是你最可靠的朋友
<26-15,Nolan>uh,but it sounds like he's the closest you can come to a safe relationship.

502
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,870
<26-15,Nolan>要搞砸这段友谊没那么容易
<26-15,Nolan>You'd have to do something major to screw it up.

503
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,970
<26-15,Nolan>这星期你还做了什么?
<26-15,Nolan>Um,what--what else have you been involved in this week?

504
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,000
<26-15,Nolan>为什么你要惩罚自己?
<26-15,Nolan>What would you want to punish yourself for?

505
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,670
<26-16,House>我说了 我不知道
<26-16,House>I told you,I don't know.

506
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,300
<26-17,Nolan>好的 我们换个角度
<26-17,Nolan>Okay,um,let's approach it from a different angle.

507
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:58,060
<26-17,Nolan>你有没让任何人因为任何事 而生你的气?
<26-17,Nolan>Have you gotten any other people angry at you over anything?

508
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,270
<26-18,House>有 所以才叫做平常的一周
<26-18,House>Well,yeah.That's why I called it an ordinary week.

509
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,790
<26-19,Nolan>好的 说说看
<26-19,Nolan>Okay.Tell me about it.

510
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,890
<27-1,Jay>你会失去大脑一部分
<27-1,Jay>You'd be losing  a part of your brain.

511
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,810
<27-2,Sidney>这是我的大脑 为什么我没权签同意书?
<27-2,Sidney>It is my brain.Why is it not my right to consent?

512
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,830
<27-3,Jay>对不起 但...必要的话我会诉诸法律
<27-3,Jay>I'm sorry,but...  I'll take this to court if necessary.

513
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,900
<27-3,Jay>Sidney目前没能力为自己作决定
<27-3,Jay>All right,Sidney's in no position to make decisions about herself right now.

514
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,390
<27-3,Jay>她甚至不知自己是谁
<27-3,Jay>She doesn't even know who she is.

515
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,420
<27-4,Sidney>我看过同意书了  我明白它意思 我想做这手术
<27-4,Sidney>I read your consent form,and I understood it.I want the surgery.

516
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,740
<27-4,Sidney>她怎么不同意?
<27-4,Sidney>Why wouldn't she?

517
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,590
<27-5,Jay>当然她愿意冒险永远失去记忆
<27-5,Jay>Of course she's willing to risk losing her memories permanently.

518
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,880
<27-5,Jay>她不知那些记忆有多重要
<27-5,Jay>She has no idea how important those memories are.

519
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,900
<27-5,Jay>她知道这意味着什么吗?
<27-5,Jay>Does she even know what risk is?

520
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,620
<27-5,Jay>她根本毫无损失可言
<27-5,Jay>She's never lost anything.

521
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,270
<27-6,House>不做手术 她会失去一切
<27-6,House>Without the surgery,she'll lose everything.

522
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,600
<27-6,House>朊毒体感染会持续扩散 摧毁她大脑
<27-6,House>The prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain.

523
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,820
<27-7,Jay>一定还有其它方法
<27-7,Jay>Well,there has to be another way.

524
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,360
<27-7,Jay>求你了
<27-7,Jay>Please.

525
00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:00,300
<27-7,Jay>我代表我妻子说这番话 她不在这里 不能为自己辩护
<27-7,Jay>I'm speaking for my wife,the wife I lived with for four years who isn't here  and can't defend herself.

526
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,460
<27-7,Jay>House医生 你在听吗?
<27-7,Jay>Dr.House,are you listening?

527
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,740
<27-8,House>不用争论了 已经不重要了
<27-8,House>Well,you can stop arguing,'cause it doesn't matter anymore.

528
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,260
<27-8,House>看心率的变化
<27-8,House>Look at the variability in the heart rate.

529
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,400
<27-8,House>脑炎已经扩散到脑干
<27-8,House>The s.E. Has spread into the brain stem.

530
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,340
<27-9,Sidney>不管那是什么 你还是可以把它切掉
<27-9,Sidney>W-wherever it is,you--you can still cut it out.

531
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,490
<27-10,Taub>不 我们不能切掉脑干
<27-10,Taub>No. We can't cut the brain stem.

532
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,720
<27-11,House>病毒扩散得太快 手术已经没用了 我想这场争论你赢了
<27-11,House>This thing's moving too quickly.Surgery's no longer an option,which I guess means you've won.

533
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,360
<27-11,House>恭喜
<27-11,House>Congratulations.

534
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,050
<27-11,House>植入心脏起搏器 给她化疗
<27-11,House>Put in a pacer and start her on chemo and radiation.

535
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,590
<27-11,House>这救不了她 只能让她多活几周 看能不能记起她是谁
<27-11,House>It won't cure her,but it'll buy a couple weeks so she can find out who she is before she dies.

536
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,380
<28-1,Nolan>太残酷了
<28-1,Nolan>That was pretty rough.

537
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,580
<28-1,Nolan>你总这么通知病人的吗?
<28-1,Nolan>Do you always break the news  to your patients that way?

538
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,070
<28-1,Nolan>还是你为我剪辑的版本?
<28-1,Nolan>Or were you  short-handing it for me?

539
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,310
<28-2,House>丈夫很白痴
<28-2,House>Husband was being an idiot.

540
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,750
<28-3,Nolan>这是他自找的
<28-3,Nolan>Well,he was asking for it.

541
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,530
<28-3,Nolan>但惩罚他的同时也惩罚了妻子
<28-3,Nolan>But,um,to punish him you have to punish the wife too.

542
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,680
<28-3,Nolan>为什么他让你这么生气?
<28-3,Nolan>Why--why did he make you so angry,Hmm?

543
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,130
<28-3,Nolan>因为他不配合你?
<28-3,Nolan>Because he didn't want to cooperate with you?

544
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,660
<28-4,House>他宁愿冒妻子的生命危险来保住婚姻
<28-4,House>He'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage.

545

<39-6,Nolan>You didn't mention that.

658
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,420
<39-7,House>这事儿他们之前就谈过
<39-7,House>They talked about moving in together before.

659
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,490
<39-7,House>没啥劲爆的

<39-9,House>我留着很多年了... 想找个特殊场合送她
<39-9,House>I've had it for years... Always meant to give it to her for a special occasion.

<39-13,House>因为不属于我的女人和别人同居  而跑出去找打
<39-13,House>I'm not gonna go out and get hammered because a woman I'm not even with is moving in with someone.

<39-13,House>可我还是这么痛苦
<39-13,House>And instead,I'm just miserable.

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,260
<39-13,House>这到底管什么用?
<39-13,House>How is this working for me?

<39-14,Nolan>这需要时间
<39-14,Nolan>It takes time.

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,260
<39-15,House>利用人们的信仰
<39-15,House>You take advantage of people who want to believe.

<39-15,House>其实什么法力都没有
<39-15,House>But there's nothing in your bag of tricks.

684
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,590
<39-16,Nolan>House...
<39-16,Nolan>House...

685
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,760
<39-17,House>不管答案是什么 你都给不了
