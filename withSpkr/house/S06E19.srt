5
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,600
<1-4,Julia>什么事?

<1-24,Damien>Tom!
<1-24,Damien>Tom!

28
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,020
<2-1,Wilson>知道啥叫完美吗?
<2-1,Wilson>You know what would be perfect?

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,830
<2-3,Wilson>法式土司塔
<2-3,Wilson>French toast tower.

30
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,320
<2-4,Sam>你还在Mickey餐馆吃饭?
<2-4,Sam>You still go to Mickey's?

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
<2-4,Sam>你胆固醇飙多高了?
<2-4,Sam>What's your cholesterol?

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,320
<2-5,Wilson>我就这点小毛病 我留着好了
<2-5,Wilson>It's my one vice. I'm keeping it.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,160
<2-6,Sam>那我也舍命陪君子吧
<2-6,Sam>As much as I would love to clog my arteries,

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,900
<2-6,Sam>但我十点要做CT 还得赶回家换衣服
<2-6,Sam>I have a 10:00 ct and I still have to race home,get changed.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,910
<2-6,Sam>你大可留几件衣服在这
<2-6,Sam>Maybe you could keep some clothes here.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,580
<2-7,House>也许吧
<2-7,House>Maybe I could.

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,630
<2-7,House>他想偷穿你裙子
<2-7,House>He's just trying to get into your skirts.

38
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,710
<2-7,House>这可不是比喻
<2-7,House>And I don't mean metaphorically.

39
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,230
<2-8,Sam>反正他有双美腿
<2-8,Sam>Well,he's got the legs for it.

<2-10,Sam>再见 House
<2-10,Sam>Bye,House.

43
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,100
<2-11,House>过得开心

44
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,800
<2-11,House>"过得开心"? 真有礼貌
<2-11,House>"Have a nice day. " How civilized.

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,740
<2-12,House>我说了不会妨碍你俩
<2-12,House>I said I'd stay t of it.

46
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,760
<2-14,House>- 怎么了? - 没什么
<2-14,House>- What? - Nothing.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,060
<2-15,Wilson>- 肯定有什么 - 没
<2-15,Wilson>- Clearly something. - Nope.

48
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,740
<2-17,Wilson>House 以你的性格
<2-17,Wilson>House,on a list of your attributes,

49
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,330
<2-17,Wilson>从来不会吞吞吐吐
<2-17,Wilson>there's nothing that even rhymes with "coy.

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,520
<2-18,House>好吧 我在冰箱里有发现
<2-18,House>" Okay,I may have seen something in the fridge.

51
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,850
<2-18,House>比如说 你们关系的终结
<2-18,House>Like the end of your relationship.

52
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,240
<2-18,House>她把牛奶放冰箱门而不是架子上
<2-18,House>She put the milk in the door and not on the shelf.

53
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,970
<2-19,Wilson>这没啥大不了
<2-19,Wilson>It's not a big deal.

54
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,520
<2-20,House>你不喜欢这样 但你没出声
<2-20,House>You hate that she did that,but you didn't say anything.

55
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,250
<2-21,Wilson>你这是挑拨离间
<2-21,Wilson>You're trying to get us to fight.

56
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,700
<2-22,House>不 我这是帮你忙
<2-22,House>No,I'm trying to help.

57
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,400
<2-22,House>你有意见该直说
<2-22,House>If you got an issue,let her know.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,780
<2-23,Wilson>我就知道 你没那么容易收手
<2-23,Wilson>I should have known that you weren't done sabotaging this.

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,710
<2-24,House>行 你继续屈憋着
<2-24,House>Fine. Stew in your irritation.

60
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,530
<2-24,House>上次也是这种小事 堆积成怨恨和愤怒
<2-24,House>And sure,last time it bubbled over into resentment and rage,

61
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,360
<2-24,House>最终以一纸离婚书收场
<2-24,House>leading ultimately to a painful divorce

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,690
<2-24,House>你俩至今都没能走出阴霾
<2-24,House>that neither of you ever really recovered from,

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,640
<2-24,House>这下又有好戏看了
<2-24,House>but I'm sure this time it'll be great.

64
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,520
<3-1,Thirteen>这病例好玩 35岁女性 发烧并伴有腹部疼痛
<3-1,Thirteen>Interesting case. 35-year-old woman with fever and abdominal pain.

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
<3-1,Thirteen>急诊排除了所有常规性的可能
<3-1,Thirteen>E. R. ruled out all the usual suspects.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,190
<3-1,Thirteen>别说了 我快被你逗死了
<3-1,Thirteen>Stop before you interest me to death.

67
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,070
<3-2,Thirteen>她实行开放婚姻
<3-2,Thirteen>And she's in an open marriage.

68
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,500
<3-8,Thirteen>这不是好玩 是怪异
<3-8,Thirteen>That's not interesting. It's just weird.

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,560
<3-9,Taub>知道什么比这更怪吗? 人类一开始就遵循一夫一妻制
<3-9,Taub>Know what's weirder? That other humans are monogamous in the first place.

70
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,500
<4-1,House>其它物种都不止一个配偶 如果你想搬出天鹅反驳我
<4-1,House>No other species on the planet mates for life and if you're gonna bring up swans,

71
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,120
<4-2,Tom>它们和其它动物一样偷腥
<4-2,Tom>they cheat like everybody else.

72
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,950
<3-1,Thirteen>不过它们比兔子会搞公关
<3-1,Thirteen>They just have better pr than rabbits.

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,930
<3-2,Thirteen>动物还吃自己的幼崽 杀死对手
<3-2,Thirteen>Animals also eat their young and kill their rivals.

74
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,870
<3-3,Taub>多数人不这么干 这也怪?
<3-3,Taub>That make it weird that most of us don't?

75
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,370
<3-4,House>这话竟出自一个 四处拈花惹草的家伙之口?
<3-4,House>Says the guy whose opposable thumbs have been all over

76
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,210
<3-4,House>除了家花 你还藏着几朵野花?
<3-4,House>how many women who aren't his wife?

77
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,710
<3-4,House>行得通的开放婚姻跟独角兽一样
<3-4,House>A functional open marriage is like a Unicorn.

78
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,480
<3-5,Chase>是不存在的虚构生物
<3-5,Chase>It's a mythical creature that doesn't exist.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,740
<3-5,Chase>到头来总会有人不开心
<3-5,Chase>Someone always ends up unhappy.

80
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,210
<3-5,Chase>这会儿不开心的是病人 她正备受肠道阻塞的煎熬
<3-5,Chase>Our patient's unhappy because she's suffering from an intestinal blockage.

81
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,430
<3-6,House>无聊的诊断
<3-6,House>Boring.

82
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,370
<3-6,House>还得找个理由排除它
<3-6,House>Then we have to find a reason to rule it out.

83
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,200
<3-7,Chase>疱疹性结肠炎?
<3-7,Chase>What about herpes colitis?

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,460
<3-7,Chase>从某个性伴侣身上传染的疱疹
<3-7,Chase>She picks up the infection from one of her partners.

85
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,570
<3-8,Thirteen>- 在结肠安家落户 - 性病检查呈阴性
<3-8,Thirteen>- It takes root in her colon. - Std panel was clean.

86
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,950
<3-9,Taub>照我看 这对夫妻一开始就不开心
<3-9,Taub>Chances are,this couple was unhappy in the first place.

87
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,880
<3-9,Taub>他们想挽救从不存在的...
<3-9,Taub>This is their attempt to save something that never--

88
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,380
<3-9,Taub>继续
<3-9,Taub>go on.

89
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,170
<3-10,Foreman>疱疹若是六周内感染的 可能查不出
<3-10,Foreman>Herpes might not register if she was exposed in the last six weeks.

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,410
<3-11,House>但用钡灌肠能查出
<3-11,House>But it would show up on a barium enema.

91
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,140
<3-12,Chase>等等 你亲自做检查?
<3-12,Chase>Wait. You're gonna do it?

92
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,280
<3-12,Chase>我得看看病人是独角兽 还是匹水性杨花的母马
<3-12,Chase>Gotta see if our patient's a Unicorn or just a slutty horse.

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,720
<3-12,Chase>探究Taub何以乐于此道
<3-12,Chase>Think how much fun Taub could be having.

94
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,390
<4-1,House>钡会覆盖结肠内壁
<4-1,House>Barium coats the inner lining of your colon.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,270
<4-1,House>能拍出清晰的X光片
<4-1,House>Lets us get a good look at it on the X-ray.

96
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,790
<4-2,Tom>我可以找人去接Evelyn
<4-2,Tom>I can get somebody else to pick up Evelyn.

97
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,840
<4-2,Tom>我这会儿不能抛下你
<4-2,Tom>I feel like i'm abandoning you.

98
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,390
<4-3,Julia>我吃止痛片了
<4-3,Julia>I'm on painkillers.

99
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,380
<4-3,Julia>我可不希望你以后看我屁股时 总想起这画面
<4-3,Julia>I'd rather this not be what you think of every time you look at my butt.

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,860
<4-4,House>好了 翻个身
<4-4,House>Okay,roll onto your side.

101
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,370
<4-4,House>开始加料了
<4-4,House>It's fill 'er up time.

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,560
<4-4,House>Evelyn是他新对象?
<4-4,House>So is Evelyn his new squeeze?

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,050
<4-5,Julia>是我们的女儿
<4-5,Julia>She's our daughter.

104
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,720
<4-6,House>从小看加尔各答风情画 长大 一定很有趣 (讲述性的百老汇剧)
<4-6,House>Must be interesting growing up in a production of Oh! Calcutta!

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,230
<4-7,Julia>她才六岁
<4-7,Julia>She's six.

106
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,520
<4-7,Julia>她对性的认识 不比同龄人多
<4-7,Julia>She knows as much about our sex life as any other kid her age.

107
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,900
<4-8,House>你大可向她解释 你们因为她才没离婚
<4-8,House>You can explain that she's the reason the two of you stayed married.

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,500
<4-9,Julia>你才呆五分钟 便以为看透了我们
<4-9,Julia>You've been in the room five minutes. You got us all figured out.

109
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,030
<4-9,Julia>但你忽略了我们相爱的事实
<4-9,Julia>Of course,you left out the part where we love each other

110
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,810
<4-9,Julia>我们想白头偕老
<4-9,Julia>and we want to grow old together.

111
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,510
<4-10,House>但不想青春作伴
<4-10,House>But you just don't want to be young together.

112
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,270
<4-10,House>你想 无数夫妻和我们做着同样的事
<4-10,House>Look,when you think about it,tons of couples do what we do.

113
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,430
<4-10,House>区别在于 多数情况下 其中一方被蒙在鼓里
<4-10,House>It's just that with most of them,one spouse doesn't know about it.

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,600
<4-11,House>我们只是坦诚相告罢了
<4-11,House>We decided things work better when people tell each other the truth.

115
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,420
<4-11,House>灌满了
<4-11,House>Tank's full.

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,490
<4-11,House>我去找放射科的小精灵
<4-11,House>I'll page the radiology elves.

117
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,240
<5-1,Maya>我没说我讨厌这领带
<5-1,Maya>I'm not saying I hate it.

118
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,260
<5-1,Maya>只是和你眼睛颜色不搭
<5-1,Maya>Just doesn't go with your eyes.

119
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,450
<5-2,Taub>- 你讨厌它 - 有点
<5-2,Taub>- You hate it. - Little bit.

120
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,100
<5-4,Taub>还要对我外表进行残酷批判吗?
<5-4,Taub>Any more heartless critiques of my general appearance?

121
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,860
<5-5,Maya>不 说完了
<5-5,Maya>Nope. All done.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,630
<5-5,Maya>她真如看上去那么骚?
<5-5,Maya>So is she as bendy as she looks?

123
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,180
<5-6,Taub>我和Maya是普通朋友而已
<5-6,Taub>Maya and I are just friends.

124
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,080
<5-7,Thirteen>不 我和你才是普通朋友 没见你每周跟我喝三次咖啡
<5-7,Thirteen>No,you and I are friends and you don't have coffee with me three times a week.

125
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,700
<5-8,Taub>她很有趣
<5-8,Taub>She's an interesting person.

126
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,890
<5-8,Taub>在俄亥俄州长大 有三个兄弟
<5-8,Taub>She grew up in Ohio. She has three brothers.

127
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,750
<5-9,Thirteen>还真有趣啊 但上周那个 柬埔寨化验员告诉我们
<5-9,Thirteen>Fascinating. Last week,that Cambodian lab tech was telling us

128
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,560
<5-9,Thirteen>他如何在战场挣扎求存时 你打着呵欠去吃甜甜圈了
<5-9,Thirteen>how he survived the Killing Fields and you left to go get a donut.

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,280
<5-10,Taub>我们就调笑下 图个好玩
<5-10,Taub>So we flirt. It's fun.

130
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,520
<5-11,Thirteen>这很危险 那女人绝对会上你
<5-11,Thirteen>It's dangerous. That woman would totally do you.

131
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,220
<5-11,Thirteen>真的?
<5-11,Thirteen>You think?

132
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,600
<5-12,Thirteen>什么事也不会发生
<5-12,Thirteen>Nothing is gonna happen.

133
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,480
<5-12,Thirteen>我意思是如果你想减肥
<5-12,Thirteen>All I'm saying is if you want to be on a diet,

134
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,170
<5-12,Thirteen>就别在甜点车旁晃悠了
<5-12,Thirteen>you might want to stop hanging out by the dessert cart.

135
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,040
<5-12,Thirteen>X光没查出问题 不是疱疹性结肠炎 她肚子也不痛了
<5-12,Thirteen>X-ray was clean. She doesn't have herpes colitis or abdominal pain.

136
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,700
<6-1,Taub>做X光时就不痛了
<6-1,Taub>It stopped hurting during the X-ray,

137
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,210
<6-1,Taub>就是说本来是肠道阻塞 现在通了 她可以出院了
<6-1,Taub>which means it was just an intestinal blockage that passed. We should discharge her.

138
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,600
<6-2,House>当然了
<6-2,House>Absolutely.

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,780
<6-2,House>没必要找出潜在病因
<6-2,House>There's no need to find any underlying cause

140
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,270
<6-2,House>反正这事不可能再发生
<6-2,House>'cause these things never happen twice.

141
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,620
<6-2,House>查下她的消化系统
<6-2,House>Take her digestive system for a test drive.

142
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,360
<6-2,House>给她喝杯X线阻射奶昔
<6-2,House>Give her a radio-opaque milkshake.

143
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,740
<6-2,House>隔15分钟做一次X光
<6-2,House>X-ray every 15 minutes to see

144
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,340
<6-2,House>看是否有异常阻断
<6-2,House>if it makes any unscheduled stops on the way through.

145
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,650
<6-3,Thirteen>那我们得呆上一整晚
<6-3,Thirteen>We'll be here all night.

146
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,810
<6-4,House>不 是Taub要呆上一整晚
<6-4,House>No,Taub will be here all night.

147
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,080
<6-4,House>和独角兽谈谈 完了告诉我 你还不相信开放婚姻
<6-4,House>Talk to the Unicorn and then tell me you don't believe.

148
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,980
<6-4,House>我今天给一个孩子做腹部CT
<6-4,House>I did an abdominal ct on a kid today

149
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,050
<6-4,House>发现有个六英寸的团块 全是口香糖
<6-4,House>and found a six-inch bezoar made entirely of gum.

150
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,550
<7-1,Sam>什么人啊 给三岁孩子吃这么多...
<7-1,Sam>I mean,who gives a three-year-old an endless supply of g--

151
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,930
<7-2,Wilson>- 你怎么了? - 没事
<7-2,Wilson>- you okay? - Yeah.

152
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,770
<7-3,Sam>里面还有头发 纸头什么的
<7-3,Sam>I mean,there was hair in it and maybe a piece of paper.

153
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,030
<7-3,Sam>你结婚多久了?
<7-3,Sam>So... how long you been married?

154
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,230
<8-1,Taub>这就是开放婚姻的缺点之一
<8-1,Taub>One of the few drawbacks of having an open marriage.

155
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,700
<8-2,Julia>没人会和我聊比赛或天气
<8-2,Julia>Nobody ever asks me about current events or the weather.

156
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,390
<8-3,Taub>洋基队这赛季表现不错
<8-3,Taub>Yankees look good this season.

157
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,840
<8-3,Taub>七年了
<8-3,Taub>Seven years.

158
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,490
<8-4,Taub>那什么时候开始--?
<8-4,Taub>And,uh,how long have you-- you know?

159
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,180
<8-5,Julia>婚后三年 我们发现 传统婚姻不适合我们
<8-5,Julia>After three years,we realized that traditional marriage was making us both miserable.

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,350
<8-6,Taub>多数人会选择离婚
<8-6,Taub>Most people get divorced at that point.

161
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,780
<8-7,Julia>我们不想离婚 我们仍深爱彼此
<8-7,Julia>Yeah,we didn't want to get divorced. We still loved each other.

162
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,640
<8-7,Julia>只是我们发现 指望一个人...
<8-7,Julia>We just realized that

163
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,480
<8-7,Julia>能满足你所有欲望 是不切实际的
<8-7,Julia>expecting one person to fulfill all of your needs forever is unrealistic.

164
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,600
<8-8,Taub>坚持一夫一妻的夫妇也能过得幸福
<8-8,Taub>There are happy monogamous couples out there.

165
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,340
<8-9,Julia>对啊 总有那么一两对模范夫妇
<8-9,Julia>Sure. One or two have the perfect marriage.

166
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,100
<8-9,Julia>于是其他人也学着降低了要求
<8-9,Julia>Everybody else has figured out how to settle for less.

167
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,990
<8-9,Julia>我不想将就过 到头来怨恨我丈夫
<8-9,Julia>I don't want to settle and end up resenting my husband.

168
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,320
<8-9,Julia>他做不到的10% 我可以从其人身上弥补
<8-9,Julia>I'd rather g the 10% he doesn't give me somewhere else

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,340
<8-9,Julia>这样我就能感激他所做的90%
<8-9,Julia>so that i can really appreciate him for the 90% he does.

170
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,660
<8-9,Julia>有点不对劲
<8-9,Julia>I think something's wrong.

171
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,480
<8-11,Julia>- 是肚子吗? - 我心跳加快了
<8-11,Julia>- With your stomach? - My heart is racing.

172
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,300
<8-12,Taub>深呼吸
<8-12,Taub>Try and take deep breaths.

173
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,490
<8-12,Taub>我试着给你心跳减速
<8-12,Taub>I'm going to try to slow your heart down.

174
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,690
<8-13,Julia>是因为肠道阻塞?
<8-13,Julia>Is this because of the blockage?

175
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,850
<8-14,Taub>不好 没用
<8-14,Taub>No. It's not working.

176
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,320
<8-14,Taub>叫辆急救车来!
<8-14,Taub>Need a crash cart in here!

177
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,000
<9-1,Chase>我需要你半年内所有性伴侣的名单
<9-1,Chase>I need a list of all your sexual partners from the last six months.

178
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,660
<9-2,Tom>为什么?
<9-2,Tom>Why?

179
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,150
<9-3,Chase>你妻子的心律不齐
<9-3,Chase>Your wife had an arrhythmia.

180
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,150
<9-3,Chase>症状从肠道转移到了心脏
<9-3,Chase>The progression of symptoms from bowel to heart

181
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,290
<9-3,Chase>极有可能是感染了寄生虫
<9-3,Chase>makes a parasitic infection most likely.

182
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,240
<9-3,Chase>既然Julia没出过国...
<9-3,Chase>Since Julia hasn't been out of the country--

183
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,280
<9-4,Tom>我最近只去过内布拉斯加州出差
<9-4,Tom>the only place that I've been recently is a business trip to Nebraska.

184
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,640
<9-5,Chase>但你们可能从性伴侣身上传染了
<9-5,Chase>But either of you could have picked up a bug from one of your partners.

185
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,340
<9-6,Tom>情况有点...复杂
<9-6,Tom>It's kind of... complicated.

186
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,100
<9-7,Chase>你到底有几个床伴? 说个大概
<9-7,Chase>How many partners are we talking about? Ballpark.

187
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,790
<9-7,Chase>- 没有 - 没有?
<9-7,Chase>- None. - None?

188
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,890
<9-7,Chase>我们的性生活很和谐
<9-7,Chase>We have a great sex life.

189
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,180
<9-8,Chase>我不需要其他人
<9-8,Chase>I don't need anyone else.

190
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,300
<9-8,Chase>那为什么不告诉她 结束这场闹剧?
<9-8,Chase>So why not just tell her that and close this whole thing up?

191
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,090
<9-10,Chase>- 你结婚了吗? - 我...结过
<9-10,Chase>- You married? - I-- I was.

192
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,380
<9-11,Tom>那你有没试过陪老婆看言情片
<9-11,Tom>Did you ever agree to go see a chick flick with your wife

193
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,550
<9-11,Tom>或假装享受古典乐?
<9-11,Tom>or pretend to enjoy classical music?

194
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,190
<9-12,Chase>史特拉芬斯基又不会和我老婆 在市郊旅馆开房 (俄罗斯作曲家)
<9-12,Chase>Stravinsky never groped my wife in a Midtown hotel room.

195
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,110
<9-13,Tom>她需要这个
<9-13,Tom>She needs this.

196
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,240
<9-13,Tom>我不需要
<9-13,Tom>I don't.

197
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,060
<9-13,Tom>但我不想让她负疚
<9-13,Tom>But I don't want her to feel bad about that.

198
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,780
<9-13,Tom>他说谎
<9-13,Tom>He's lying.

199
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,180
<10-1,Chase>他有权出轨 何必隐瞒?
<10-1,Chase>Guy's got a license to drill. Why would he lie about not using it?

200
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,520
<10-2,House>我不是指这个
<10-2,House>That's not the lie.

201
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,290
<10-2,House>是他谎称为顾全妻子感受
<10-2,House>The lie is that he gives a crap about how his wife feels.

202
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,390
<10-2,House>如果双方都鬼混 这另当别论
<10-2,House>If they're both screwing around,that's one thing.

203
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,690
<10-2,House>既然女方有而男方没有
<10-2,House>But if she has a piece on the side and he doesn't,

204
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,330
<10-2,House>他肯接受的唯一可能就是
<10-2,House>the only way he'd be okay with that is

205
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,400
<10-2,House>他在其它方面背叛了她
<10-2,House>if he's betraying her in some other way that,

206
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,270
<10-2,House>这样他才能找到心理平衡
<10-2,House>in his mind,makes them even.

207
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,450
<10-2,House>我们的独角兽不是独角兽
<10-2,House>My Unicorn isn't a Unicorn.

208
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,920
<10-2,House>而是头顶马桶搋子的驴子
<10-2,House>It's a donkey with a plunger stuck to its face.

209
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,860
<10-3,Chase>没错 即便这家伙不出轨 也得找个见不得人的理由
<10-3,Chase>Right. Even the guy who's not cheating is doing it for underhanded reasons.

210
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,550
<10-4,Thirteen>不 不 他这不是挑刺
<10-4,Thirteen>No,no,no. He's not being cynical.

211
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,310
<10-4,Thirteen>他认为丈夫背地里在干什么 所以双方扯平了
<10-4,Thirteen>He's assuming the husband is doing something to even the score,

212
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,960
<10-4,Thirteen>就是说 他认为夫妻之道有公平可言
<10-4,Thirteen>which means he thinks there is a score,

213
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,180
<10-4,Thirteen>也就是说 天鹅偷腥只是幌子 House其实是一夫一妻拥护者
<10-4,Thirteen>which means,cheating swans aside,House believes in monogamy.

214
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,010
<10-4,Thirteen>看他多浪漫啊
<10-4,Thirteen>He's being romantic.

215
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,910
<10-5,House>我拥护的是"人性妒忌"论
<10-5,House>What I believe is that men are genetically engineered to be jealous.

216
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,790
<10-5,House>问题不是我怎么认为 而是他认为
<10-5,House>Doesn't matter if i think there's a score. I guarantee you he does.

217
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,700
<10-5,House>妻子的床伴有可疑吗?
<10-5,House>Any of the wife's partners pan out?

218
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,690
<10-6,Thirteen>过去半年内 除了Tom 她还和另外两人一起
<10-6,Thirteen>She's been with two people other than Tom in the last six months.

219
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,920
<10-6,Thirteen>他们都没离开过三州交界区 (指纽约 新泽西和康提涅格)
<10-6,Thirteen>Neither of them have been outside the tri-state area.

220
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,060
<10-7,House>那就是丈夫的问题了
<10-7,House>So we're back to the husband.

221
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,250
<10-8,Chase>- 你刚才还说... - 背着老婆搞小动作
<10-8,Chase>- You just said you believed-- - he's doing something behind her back.

222
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,330
<10-9,House>有什么比去内布拉斯加 出差更好的借口?
<10-9,House>What better cover than a business trip to Nebraska?

223
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,410
<10-9,House>说的真有这地方似的
<10-9,House>Like that's really a place.

224
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,110
<11-1,Chase>找出他出差的证明 然后回去开工
<11-1,Chase>Let's find his travel records and get back to work.

225
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,980
<11-2,Thirteen>看来你能接受这对夫妻的做法
<11-2,Thirteen>You seem pretty mellow about this couple's deal.

226
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,570
<11-2,Thirteen>我还以为你会第一个反对
<11-2,Thirteen>Thought you'd be first in line to shake a finger.

227
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,730
<11-3,Chase>至少他们能维持婚姻 但我不能
<11-3,Chase>They're still married. I'm not.

228
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,610
<11-3,Chase>反正我办不到这样
<11-3,Chase>Not that I could ever do it.

229
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,620
<11-3,Chase>我嫉妒House 尽管Cameron碰都没碰过他
<11-3,Chase>I was jealous of House and Cameron never touched him.

230
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,280
<11-4,Thirteen>你没算上精神出轨
<11-4,Thirteen>Not counting the emotional fondling.

231
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,040
<11-4,Thirteen>我妈临死前 我爸有了外遇
<11-4,Thirteen>When my mom was dying,my dad had an affair.

232
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,300
<11-5,Chase>他告诉你的?
<11-5,Chase>He told you this?

233
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,370
<11-6,Thirteen>我看到他们一起下车
<11-6,Thirteen>I'd seen them get out of his car.

234
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,860
<11-6,Thirteen>我妈去世后两年 他们结婚了
<11-6,Thirteen>Two years after mom died,they got married.

235
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,250
<11-7,Chase>你一定很难过吧
<11-7,Chase>That must have sucked.

236
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,230
<11-8,Thirteen>当时是的
<11-8,Thirteen>At the time,yeah.

237
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,640
<11-8,Thirteen>但回想起来...没什么不好的
<11-8,Thirteen>But looking back... It makes sense.

238
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,530
<11-8,Thirteen>我妈始终蒙在鼓里 他也可以有个人排遣孤寂
<11-8,Thirteen>My mom never knew about it and he needed someone to make him feel less alone.

239
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,960
<11-8,Thirteen>他不眠不休照顾了我妈两年半 直到她去世
<11-8,Thirteen>He took care of my mom day in and day out for 2 1/2 years before she died.

240
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,290
<11-8,Thirteen>他对她很好
<11-8,Thirteen>He was devoted to her.

241
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,750
<11-8,Thirteen>爱上别人不会改变这点
<11-8,Thirteen>Loving someone else didn't change that.

242
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,230
<11-9,Chase>那么说 如果其中一方快死了 另一方就可以同时爱两个人?
<11-9,Chase>So loving two people at once is fine as long as one of them is dying?

243
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,230
<11-10,Thirteen>不管谁在我生病时照顾我
<11-10,Thirteen>Whoever's taking care of me when I get sick,

244
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,030
<11-10,Thirteen>我也希望有人能照顾他
<11-10,Thirteen>I hope they've got someone else to take care of them.

245
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,170
<11-11,Chase>Tom说的是实话
<11-11,Chase>Tom was telling the truth.

246
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,000
<11-11,Chase>他真去了内布拉斯加
<11-11,Chase>He really did go to Nebraska.

247
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,100
<11-11,Chase>有机票和餐厅收据为证
<11-11,Chase>Plane ticket and restaurant seats.

248
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,990
<11-12,Thirteen>别纠结内布拉斯加了
<11-12,Thirteen>Forget Nebraska.

249
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,010
<11-12,Thirteen>寄生虫可能是商场买来的
<11-12,Thirteen>Maybe they just bought their parasites at the mall.

250
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,590
<12-1,Taub>咱该把家里丝瓜络扔了
<12-1,Taub>You know,we should really throw away that loofah.

251
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,110
<12-1,Taub>那些都是舶来品 可能未经消毒
<12-1,Taub>They're imported. Sometimes they're not sterilized.

252
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,260
<12-1,Taub>病人可能因为用它得了变形虫病
<12-1,Taub>We think our patient got amoebiasis from hers.

253
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,140
<12-2,Rachel>她不会有事吧?
<12-2,Rachel>Is she gonna be okay?

254
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,400
<12-3,Taub>我们正在治疗 应该没事的
<12-3,Taub>We're treating now. She should be fine.

255
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,580
<12-3,Taub>这病人有点特殊
<12-3,Taub>It's actually kind of bizarre.

256
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,380
<12-3,Taub>他们夫妇实行开放婚姻
<12-3,Taub>She and her husband have an open marriage.

257
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,800
<12-4,Rachel>他们和别人睡?
<12-4,Rachel>They sleep with other people?

258
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,390
<12-5,Taub>她是这么做的 她丈夫也没意见
<12-5,Taub>Well,she does. Her husband's totally fine with it.

259
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,850
<12-5,Taub>这太出格了 是吧?
<12-5,Taub>I mean,it's crazy,right?

260
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,680
<12-6,Rachel>你提这事是想...?
<12-6,Rachel>And you're bringing this up because?

261
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,400
<12-7,Taub>觉得有意思罢了
<12-7,Taub>I thought it was interesting.

262
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,330
<12-8,Rachel>比别的病例更有意思么
<12-8,Rachel>More interesting than your other cases,I guess.

263
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,420
<12-8,Rachel>你通常会聊同事 损House
<12-8,Rachel>I mean,you talk about your colleagues,you rant about House.

264
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,170
<12-8,Rachel>但很少提病人
<12-8,Rachel>You don't usually mention your patients.

265
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,440
<12-8,Rachel>你也想要开放婚姻?
<12-8,Rachel>Is open marriage something you want?

266
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,970
<13-1,Taub>不
<13-1,Taub>No.

267
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,510
<12-9,Taub>我是说...
<12-9,Taub>I mean...

268
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,770
<12-9,Taub>我知道你不会...
<12-9,Taub>I know you'd never...

269
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,960
<12-9,Taub>长久以来 你大费周章地 向我证明你没外遇
<12-9,Taub>All this time and energy you spent convincing me you weren't cheating...

270
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,540
<12-10,Taub>你的确有别的人
<12-10,Taub>And there's somebody else.

271
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,170
<12-10,Taub>- 我没-- - 加水吗 先生?
<12-10,Taub>- I'm not-- - some more water sir?

272
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,730
<12-10,Taub>好吧
<12-10,Taub>Okay.

273
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,370
<12-11,Taub>医院里有个女的
<12-11,Taub>There's a woman at work.

274
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,440
<12-11,Taub>人人都说她对我有意思 但我什么都没做过
<12-11,Taub>People say she's attracted to me,but nothing's happened.

275
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,360
<12-11,Taub>也不会去做 我没出轨
<12-11,Taub>Nothing's going to happen. I'm not having an affair.

276
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,900
<12-12,Rachel>但你想出轨
<12-12,Rachel>But you want to.

277
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,370
<12-13,Taub>不 亲爱的
<12-13,Taub>No,honey.

278
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,950
<12-13,Taub>我在向你坦白
<12-13,Taub>I'm trying to be honest.

279
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,270
<12-13,Taub>并非想重蹈覆辙
<12-13,Taub>I don't want to make the same mistakes.

280
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,770
<12-14,Rachel>那你老实说
<12-14,Rachel>Be honest then.

281
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,990
<12-14,Rachel>你对她有想法吗?
<12-14,Rachel>Are you attracted to her?

282
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,730
<12-14,Rachel>听我说...
<12-14,Rachel>Look...

283
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,050
<12-15,Taub>她很有魅力
<12-15,Taub>she's attractive.

284
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,420
<12-15,Taub>我承认被她吸引
<12-15,Taub>There's an attraction.

285
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,110
<12-15,Taub>你对其他男人就没这感觉吗?
<12-15,Taub>Aren't there men who make you feel that way?

286
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,440
<12-16,Rachel>当然有 但我从未想过付诸行动 因为--
<12-16,Rachel>Of course there are,but it never occurs to me to act on it because--

287
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,120
<12-16,Rachel>因为我是有夫之妇 我有了你
<12-16,Rachel>because I'm married... To you.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,330
<12-16,Rachel>我就知足了
<12-16,Rachel>And that's enough for me.

289
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,450
<12-16,Rachel>我不能满足你吗?
<12-16,Rachel>Aren't I enough for you?

290
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,110
<12-17,Taub>你当然可以
<12-17,Taub>Of course you are.

291
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,920
<12-17,Taub>病人的腿动不了了
<12-17,Taub>Our patient's lost all movement in her legs.

292
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,980
<12-18,Rachel>有其他医生在呢 Chris 我们还没聊完
<12-18,Rachel>There are other doctors,Chris. We're talking.

293
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,110
<12-18,Rachel>对不起
<12-18,Rachel>I'm sorry.

294
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,760
<12-19,Taub>病人瘫痪了
<12-19,Taub>The woman's paralyzed.

295
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,510
<12-19,Taub>我打车走
<12-19,Taub>I'll get a cab.

296
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,400
<13-1,Taub>化验结果显示 无脊髓受损迹象 无大脑损伤和出血
<13-1,Taub>Tests show no spinal cord injury,no cerebral lesions,no hemorrhage.

297
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,840
<13-2,Chase>粪便样本测试显示 不是丝瓜络搞的鬼
<13-2,Chase>Finally got a stool sample. The loofah's innocent.

298
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,380
<13-2,Chase>没发现阿米巴虫和其它寄生虫
<13-2,Chase>No sign of amoebas or any other parasites.

299
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,640
<13-3,Foreman>目前症状包括瘫痪 心率失常和间歇性腹痛
<13-3,Foreman>So paralysis,arrhythmia,and intermittent abdominal pain.

300
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,570
<13-4,House>而且 他刮胡子时割破脸了
<13-4,House>And he nicked himself shaving.

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,010
<13-4,House>抱歉 我是说Taub
<13-4,House>Sorry. That was Taub.

302
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,870
<13-4,House>但这症状好解释
<13-4,House>But it was easier to solve.

303
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,530
<13-4,House>他用了储物柜里的破剃须刀 就是说他昨晚睡这了
<13-4,House>Means he used the crappy razor in his locker,which means he slept here.

304
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,300
<13-5,Taub>还不是你害的
<13-5,Taub>Thanks to you.

305
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,910
<13-5,Taub>我跟Rachel提开放婚姻的事
<13-5,Taub>I brought up open marriage with Rachel.

306
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,850
<13-5,Taub>结果异常惨烈
<13-5,Taub>It was a disaster.

307
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,260
<13-6,House>说正经的 我们排除了 性和外地感染的可能
<13-6,House>On the medical front,we've knocked out sex and foreign travel.

308
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,100
<13-6,House>也许是电解质失衡
<13-6,House>Could be an electrolyte imbalance.

309
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,140
<13-7,Taub>我被你的馊主意害惨了 你却史无前例地不追根问底?
<13-7,Taub>So the only time you're not interested in my marriage is after you bw it up?

310
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,000
<13-8,Houses>拿AV女优当婚姻顾问 你蠢到一定境界了
<13-8,Houses>You're the moron who took marital advice from Tila Tequila.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
<13-9,Taub>你逼我这么做的
<13-9,Taub>You pushed me into this.

312
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,440
<13-10,House>我估摸这要么会拆散你俩 要么逼你们坦诚相对
<13-10,House>Figured it would either blow up your marriage or make it more honest.

313
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,020
<13-10,House>- 都对你有好处 - 性方面呢?
<13-10,House>Either way,you win. What about sex?

314
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,860
<13-10,House>回到病人 你们没意见吧?
<13-10,House>I'm talking about the patient. Is that cool with everybody?

315
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,190
<13-11,Foreman>性因素已经排除了
<13-11,Foreman>We've ruled out sex.

316
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,270
<13-12,Chase>我们排除了与她发生关系的人
<13-12,Chase>We ruled out sex with other people.

317
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,010
<13-12,Chase>Tom说每周和Julia亲热三到四次
<13-12,Chase>Tom said he and Julia have been doing it three or four times a week

318
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,920
<13-12,Chase>她在外面还有人
<13-12,Chase>and she's got boys on the side.

319
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,580
<13-13,Foreman>性欲过盛是肾上腺皮质癌的症状
<13-13,Foreman>Increased libido can be a symptom of adrenocortical carcinoma,

320
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,460
<13-13,Foreman>可以解释她其它症状
<13-13,Foreman>which also explains her other symptoms.

321
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,420
<13-13,Foreman>女人喜欢做爱就有病?
<13-13,Foreman>A woman who likes sex must be sick?

322
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,790
<13-14,House>虽说在座各位同仁都希望
<13-14,House>Just because everybody in this room wishes

323
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,930
<13-14,House>女人时刻饥渴着 奈何天不遂人愿
<13-14,House>that all women were horny all the time doesn't make it so.

324
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,700
<13-14,House>给她做肾上腺核磁共振
<13-14,House>Get an mri of her adrenal glands.

325
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,220
<14-1,Sam>体育版给我好吗?
<14-1,Sam>Okay if I take the sports page?

326
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,700
<14-2,Wilson>行
<14-2,Wilson>Sure.

327
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,130
<14-3,Wilson>用下杯垫行吗?
<14-3,Wilson>Would you mind using a coaster?

328
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,330
<14-4,Sam>噢 当然 抱歉
<14-4,Sam>Oh. Sure. Sorry.

329
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,870
<14-4,Sam>没事
<14-4,Sam>It's okay.

330
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,030
<14-5,Wilson>我还希望厕纸用完时 你能主动换一卷
<14-5,Wilson>Also,it'd be great if you'd replace the toilet paper when you finish a roll.

331
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,500
<14-5,Wilson>往洗碗机里堆碗碟时
<14-5,Wilson>And when you load the dishwasher,

332
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,930
<14-5,Wilson>大且平的碗不能放在底层
<14-5,Wilson>you can't put a big,flat bowl on the bottom.

333
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,390
<14-5,Wilson>否则水都在碗里转 其他碗碟洗不到
<14-5,Wilson>It traps the water so nothing on the top gets clean.

334
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,770
<14-5,Wilson>还有拜托别把香蕉皮扔卧室垃圾桶
<14-5,Wilson>And please don't throw banana peels in the bedroom trash.

335
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,340
<14-6,Sam>这都不是我干的
<14-6,Sam>I haven't done any of those things.

336
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,070
<14-7,Wilson>你可能不自觉--
<14-7,Wilson>You're probably not even aware of--

337
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,040
<14-8,Sam>我讨厌香蕉
<14-8,Sam>I hate bananas.

338
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,840
<14-8,Sam>天呐 是House干的
<14-8,Sam>Oh,my God. It was House.

339
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,640
<14-9,Sam>对不起 他一直在挑拨我们
<14-9,Sam>I'm sorry. He's been trying to get us to fight.

340
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
<14-9,Sam>他为什么做这些来挑拨?
<14-9,Sam>Why would he think that stuff would make us fight?

341
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,650
<14-9,Sam>因为牛奶
<14-9,Sam>Because of the milk.

342
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,940
<14-10,Wilson>你把牛奶放冰箱门上了
<14-10,Wilson>You put it in the door.

343
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,940
<14-10,Wilson>冰箱的主体是最凉的部分
<14-10,Wilson>The body of the refrigerator is the coldest part.

344
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,700
<14-10,Wilson>但门的温度不稳定 食品质量没法保证
<14-10,Wilson>The temperature in the door fluctuates,which decreases shelf life.

345
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,090
<14-10,Wilson>你啥时开始有强迫症了?
<14-10,Wilson>When did you get all ocd?

346
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,200
<14-11,Wilson>我只是想碗碟干净 牛奶新鲜 保障咱的健康
<14-11,Wilson>I just want clean dishes and unspoiled milk so we can all stay healthy.

347
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,630
<14-12,Sam>噢 原来是为健康着想
<14-12,Sam>Oh,it's about health.

348
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,840
<14-12,Sam>那杯垫呢? 用了会补充维生素B12?
<14-12,Sam>What about the coaster? Does that replenish my B-12 or something?

349
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
<14-13,Wilson>- 不谈这个了行吗? - 没问题
<14-13,Wilson>- Can we just drop it? - Sure.

350
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,290
<14-14,Sam>我们没离婚时 你就对这些耿耿于怀?
<14-14,Sam>You have this list of annoyances the entire time we were married?

351
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,160
<15-1,Paula>快点好起来 妈妈
<15-1,Paula>Get better,mommy.

352
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,280
<15-2,Julia>我爱你 小兔子
<15-2,Julia>I love you,rabbit.

353
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,370
<15-3,Tom>Julia 有人来看你
<15-3,Tom>Julia,you have a guest.

354
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,710
<15-4,Damien>现在不方便
<15-4,Damien>This isn't a good time.

355
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,330
<15-5,Julia>Hadley医生 娱乐室有电子游戏吗?
<15-5,Julia>Dr. Hadley,did you say there was a video game in the playroom?

356
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,500
<15-5,Julia>你教我打游戏吧
<15-5,Julia>Maybe you can teach me how to play one of them.

357
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,380
<15-6,Thirteen>放射科见
<15-6,Thirteen>See you in radiology.

358
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,640
<15-7,Tom>从我老婆病房滚出去
<15-7,Tom>Get out of my wife's room.

359
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
<15-7,Tom>你们的关系不能越界
<15-7,Tom>Your relationship with her stays out of our space.

360
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,990
<15-8,Damien>我很担心她
<15-8,Damien>I was worried about her.

361
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,050
<15-9,Julia>Tom说的对 你还是走吧
<15-9,Julia>Tom's right. You should go.

362
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,290
<15-10,Damien>我们上床可以 探病就不--
<15-10,Damien>So it's fine if we have sex,but if I drop by to see if you're okay--

363
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,230
<15-10,Damien>这是家庭场合
<15-10,Damien>this is our family.

364
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,960
<15-10,Damien>对不起
<15-10,Damien>Sorry.

365
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,630
<15-10,Damien>我做实习医生时 穿了两年缩水衬衫
<15-10,Damien>I spent two years of residency wearing shirts that were a size too small.

366
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,470
<16-1,Sam>告诉我一声别烘干有那么难吗?
<16-1,Sam>How hard is it to ask me not to put them in the dryer?

367
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,870
<16-1,Sam>我帮你洗衣服 因为你基本不在家
<16-1,Sam>And I only did your laundry because you were never home.

368
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,850
<16-2,Wilson>- 我又没让你洗 - 你当然没有
<16-2,Wilson>- I didn't ask you to. - Of course you didn't.

369
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,260
<16-3,Sam>但哪天没干净内裤穿了 你还不心烦气燥的
<16-3,Sam>You just got annoyed whenever you didn't have clean underwear.

370
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,500
<16-4,Wilson>我没说我生气啊
<16-4,Wilson>I never said I was annoyed.

371
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,200
<16-5,Sam>这就是问题了 你什么都不说
<16-5,Sam>That's the point. You didn't say anything.

372
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,790
<16-5,Sam>哟 你倒好意思怪我啥都不说
<16-5,Sam>So I'm getting a lecture on communication from someone

373
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,150
<16-5,Sam>当初说要离婚 你还是通过律师转达我的
<16-5,Sam>who had her lawyer inform me our marriage was over.

374
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,270
<16-5,Sam>开口提开放婚姻 你胆子忒大了
<16-5,Sam>Asking for an open marriage. You got stones.

375
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,190
<17-1,Taub>谈判变逼供 场面何惨烈
<17-1,Taub>Conversation sort of got away from me. It was a train wreck.

376
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,010
<17-2,Thirteen>我觉得你提出是好事
<17-2,Thirteen>I think it's good you brought it up.

377
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,900
<17-2,Thirteen>我读过一篇研究报告 说是具多重血管加压素受体的男性
<17-2,Thirteen>I read a study that found men who have multiple copies of a certain vasopressin receptor

378
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,350
<17-2,Thirteen>不忠几率比常人高一倍
<17-2,Thirteen>are twice as likely to be unfaithful.

379
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,480
<17-2,Thirteen>也许你也在此列
<17-2,Thirteen>Maybe you're just one of those guys.

380
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,760
<17-3,Taub>那么说 我出轨是天生的 好极了
<17-3,Taub>So my cheating is biologically predetermined? Fantastic.

381
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,170
<17-4,Thirteen>放大五倍 得看仔细她的骨髓
<17-4,Thirteen>Multiply times five. We need a better look at the medulla.

382
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,420
<17-4,Thirteen>还以为你会如释重负
<17-4,Thirteen>I thought you'd be relieved.

383
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,330
<17-4,Thirteen>这能洗脱你的罪名 都是基因的错
<17-4,Thirteen>This gets you off the hook. It's just genetics.

384
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,840
<17-4,Thirteen>我身高168 发际线不断后退
<17-4,Thirteen>I'm 5'6" and have a receding hairline.

385
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,240
<17-4,Thirteen>我恨基因 骨髓没问题
<17-4,Thirteen>I hate genetics. Medulla's clean.

386
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,090
<17-5,Taub>没见你穿增高鞋 也没植发
<17-5,Taub>I don't see you wearing lifts or hair plugs.

387
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,320
<17-5,Taub>因为我矮且秃并不伤害任何人
<17-5,Taub>That's because being short and bald doesn't hurt anybody.

388
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,890
<17-5,Taub>你死不承认的毛病也是基因作怪
<17-5,Taub>The only thing hurtful about your other genetic predisposition

389
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,560
<17-6,Taub>但这就会伤害人了
<17-6,Taub>is that you keep denying it.

390
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,330
<17-6,Taub>对你和Rachel都不好
<17-6,Taub>It's not good for you or Rachel.

391
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,980
<17-6,Taub>没发现异样 不是肾上腺癌
<17-6,Taub>There's nothing there. It's not adrenal cancer.

392
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,570
<17-6,Taub>也许你说的对
<17-6,Taub>And maybe you're right about me.

393
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,170
<17-6,Taub>但为了Rachel 我不会放弃的
<17-6,Taub>But I'm not gonna stop trying. Rachel's worth it.

394
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,150
<17-6,Taub>看那里
<17-6,Taub>Look up there.

395
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,830
<17-6,Taub>肺部 那是什么?
<17-6,Taub>The lung. What is that?

396
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,890
<18-1,Wilson>我当时在新奥尔良开会
<18-1,Wilson>You served me with divorce papers

397
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,050
<18-1,Wilson>你就这么把离婚协议书甩来
<18-1,Wilson>in the middle of a medical conference in New Orleans.

398
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,960
<18-1,Wilson>我一激动 扔瓶子砸了面古董镜
<18-1,Wilson>I threw a bottle into an antique mirror.

399
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,680
<18-2,Sam>你还会发泄情绪? 还真看不出来
<18-2,Sam>Oh,you exhibited an emotion? I wish I'd known you were capable.

400
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,080
<18-3,Wilson>我当时多爱你啊 还想跟你去巴尔的摩 记得吗?
<18-3,Wilson>I loved you. I thought I was gonna be following you to Baltimore,remember?

401
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,650
<18-3,Wilson>我找了房子 还预约了工作面试
<18-3,Wilson>I called about apartments. I set up interviews.

402
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,410
<18-3,Wilson>我们的婚姻都名存实亡了 你还毫无知觉?
<18-3,Wilson>How could you think that we still had a real marriage?

403
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,150
<18-3,Wilson>我们好几月没好好说过话
<18-3,Wilson>We hadn't had a conversation in months.

404
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,340
<18-2,Sam>因为我要打两份工养家
<18-2,Sam>Maybe because I was working two jobs to support us.

405
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,070
<18-2,Sam>不! 即使你在家 我也像对冰块讲话
<18-2,Sam>No! No! It's because when you were home,it was like talking to a block of ice.

406
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,740
<18-2,Sam>你明显在怨恨我
<18-2,Sam>You were obviously so pissed off at me.

407
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,860
<18-5,Wilson>我起早贪黑还不是为 你能做那份无薪实习
<18-5,Wilson>I was killing myself so that you could take that non-paying internship.

408
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
<18-4,Wilson>是你支持我做的
<18-4,Wilson>That you said that I should take.

409
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,170
<18-4,Wilson>我想鼓励你! 我讨厌唱白脸!
<18-4,Wilson>I was trying to be supportive! Why do I have to be the bad guy?

410
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,620
<18-3,Wilson>有话直说不叫唱白脸
<18-3,Wilson>Expressing yourself does not make you the bad guy.

411
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,090
<18-2,Sam>那好 那时的你是个自私的贱人
<18-2,Sam>Okay,then. You were being a selfish bitch.

412
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,970
<19-1,Thirteen>V/Q扫描证实 Julia肺部的黑点是血栓
<19-1,Thirteen>VQ scan confirmed the spot on Julia's lung was a clot.

413
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,560
<19-1,Thirteen>你说她丈夫会不会和充气娃娃做?
<19-1,Thirteen>Think there's a chance the husband's a plushie?

414
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,200
<19-2,Thirteen>我觉得血栓比这靠谱
<19-2,Thirteen>If he has a secret,I highly doubt it's more relevant than the clot.

415
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,620
<19-3,House>凝血障碍可以解释所有病症
<19-3,House>Clotting disorder would explain everything.

416
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,330
<19-3,House>问题是哪种障碍?
<19-3,House>Question is,which one?

417
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,930
<19-4,Cuddy>你从不看部门备忘录?
<19-4,Cuddy>Do you read any of your departmental memos?

418
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,460
<19-5,House>我只看标明"上班时间不宜浏览"的 (成人内容的讳称)
<19-5,House>Only the ones labeled,"n-s-f-w.

419
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,130
<19-5,House>会计部两天前就知会你 病人的保险事宜了
<19-5,House>" Accounting notified you two days ago about your patient's insurance.

420
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,390
<19-6,House>不好意思 不属于我浏览范围
<19-6,House>Sorry,that's "n-n-s-f-w.

421
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,580
<19-6,House>给你
<19-6,House>" Here.

422
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,450
<19-7,House>他没保险 别把他们整破产了
<19-7,House>He doesn't have any. Try not to bankrupt them.

423
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,750
<19-7,House>那些够他们破产的检查早做了
<19-7,House>Oh,I'm long past the number of procedures that'll bankrupt them.

424
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,440
<19-8,Thirteen>Julia有保险 入院表格上有保号
<19-8,Thirteen>Julia's got insurance. I saw the policy number on the form.

425
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,540
<19-9,Cuddy>但他们没交钱 保单失效了
<19-9,Cuddy>But the policy lapsed due to non-payment.

426
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,860
<19-9,Cuddy>我打了三通电话证实 你们早该发现的
<19-9,Cuddy>I already made three calls about this. You should have been aware of that.

427
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,640
<19-9,Cuddy>不可能 你们搞错了 我们有保险
<19-9,Cuddy>No,there's just a mistake. Of course we have health insurance.

428
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,650
<19-9,Cuddy>我们有阵子没交保费了
<19-9,Cuddy>We're actually a little behind on the premiums.

429
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,460
<19-9,Cuddy>但我会预支退休金来支付
<19-9,Cuddy>But I pulled money out of my retirementccount to cover it.

430
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,000
<19-9,Cuddy>他们说可以--
<19-9,Cuddy>They said that we'll be fine in--

431
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,280
<20-1,Julia>干嘛要预支退休金?
<20-1,Julia>Why the retirement account?

432
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,220
<20-2,Thirteen>我们先出去 你们单独聊--
<20-2,Thirteen>We'll just give you a few minutes to--

433
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,240
<20-3,House>把"们"去掉 她走我不走
<20-3,House>and by "we," she means "she.

434
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,390
<20-4,Tom>我把存款都用光了
<20-4,Tom>" I lost all of our savings.

435
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,210
<20-4,Tom>这听来像个秘密吧
<20-4,Tom>Sounds like a secret to me.

436
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,100
<20-5,Thirteen enters>我给她用了肝磷脂 阻止栓塞继续形成
<20-5,Thirteen enters>I started her on heparin to prevent further clots,

437
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,550
<20-5,Thirteen enters>但病因仍未知
<20-5,Thirteen enters>but we still don't know what's going on.

438
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,040
<20-5,Thirteen enters>我就知道这秘密和钱有关
<20-5,Thirteen enters>Of course the husband's secret was money.

439
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,160
<20-5,Thirteen enters>不是性 就是钱
<20-5,Thirteen enters>If it's not sex,it's always money.

440
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,290
<20-6,Thirteen>要么就是卖身换钱
<20-6,Thirteen>Unless it's sex for money.

441
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,030
<20-6,Thirteen>他到底怎么花光的?
<20-6,Thirteen>How did he lose it anyway?

442
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,010
<20-6,Thirteen>和病症无关 你不会感兴趣的
<20-6,Thirteen>It's not medically relevant. You're not gonna care.

443
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,300
<20-7,House>Wilson老教育我关心他人 说来听听
<20-7,House>Wilson's been teaching me how to care. Try me.

444
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,450
<20-8,Thirteen>他造风轮机出租给当地电力公司
<20-8,Thirteen>He builds wind turbines and leases them out to local power companies.

445
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,820
<20-9,House>你说的对 我不感冒
<20-9,House>You're right. I don't care.

446
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,160
<20-9,House>凝血障碍包括DIC 凝血因子突变 抗磷脂综合征
<20-9,House>Clotting disorder: Dic. Factor five leiden,antiphospholipid syndrome.

447
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,850
<20-10,Thirteen>维生素K缺乏症也符合
<20-10,Thirteen>Vitamin k deficiency also fits.

448
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,230
<20-10,Thirteen>造成血栓形成 且能解释腹痛
<20-10,Thirteen>Causes thrombophilia and is consistent with abdominal pain.

449
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,100
<20-11,Wilson>恭喜你 House Sam把我踹了
<20-11,Wilson>Congratulations,House. Sam ended it.

450
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,610
<20-11,Wilson>怎么了?
<20-11,Wilson>What happened?

451
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,570
<20-12,House>你验血去
<20-12,House>Go test our patient's blood.

452
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,130
<20-13,Thirteen>等五分钟也无妨
<20-13,Thirteen>But it can wait five minutes.

453
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,230
<20-14,House>把我们说的都测一遍
<20-14,House>For everything we discussed.

454
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,690
<20-14,House>很抱歉
<20-14,House>I'm sorry.

455
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,240
<20-14,House>好歹你史无前例地承担责任了
<20-14,House>Well,at least you're actually taking responsibility for once in your life.

456
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,560
<20-14,House>很抱歉她甩了你 但不是我的错
<20-14,House>Sorry that she left. It's not my fault.

457
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,820
<20-14,House>我本想置身事外 是你逼我出手的
<20-14,House>I didn't even want to get involved. You dragged it out of me.

458
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,790
<20-14,House>那洗碗机怎解释 还有香蕉?
<20-14,House>What about the dishwasher and the banana and the toi--

459
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,300
<20-15,Wilson>她才不是因为香蕉走人
<20-15,Wilson>she left because of the banana.

460
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,540
<20-15,Wilson>我只是想让你捍卫自己权益 说出你的要求
<20-15,Wilson>I just wanted you to stand up for yourself. Tell her what you want.

461
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,060
<20-15,Wilson>如果这使她再次离你而去
<20-15,Wilson>If doing that causes her to walk out for the second time,

462
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,360
<20-15,Wilson>你们的关系也长不了
<20-15,Wilson>well,your relationship wasn't gonna last anyway.

463
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,090
<20-15,Wilson>或者你可以别掺和
<20-15,Wilson>Or you could have stayed out of it.

464
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,320
<20-15,Wilson>我忍忍就过去了 虽偶尔有不爽
<20-15,Wilson>I could have kept my mouth shut,been annoyed sometimes,

465
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,940
<20-15,Wilson>但和她一起 我快乐得多
<20-15,Wilson>but I'd be happy,because I'd still be with her.

466
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,060
<20-15,Wilson>现在只能抱着冻牛奶过了
<20-15,Wilson>Now all I have is cold milk.

467
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,250
<20-16,House>既然你恢复了自由身 一起吃个饭?
<20-16,House>As long as you're free,you want to grab some dinner?

468
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,180
<21-1,Thirteen>Tom晚上回家了?
<21-1,Thirteen>Did Tom go home for the night?

469
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,070
<21-2,Julia>我让他回去了 我不想让他陪
<21-2,Julia>For starters. I told him to leave. I don't want him here.

470
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,660
<21-3,Thirteen>钱的确是个复杂的问题
<21-3,Thirteen>Money is a complicated subject.

471
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,330
<21-3,Thirteen>不是因为钱
<21-3,Thirteen>Yeah,it's not the money.

472
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,750
<21-4,Julia>钱固然万恶 但...
<21-4,Julia>I mean,the-- the money's bad,but...

473
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,390
<21-4,Julia>我们刚开始开放婚姻时
<21-4,Julia>When we first opened our marriage,

474
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,850
<21-4,Julia>我和一个男人好上了 他骗我说是单身
<21-4,Julia>I got involved with a guy who lied about being single.

475
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,560
<21-4,Julia>有一天 他老婆打电话来
<21-4,Julia>Then one day,his wife calls me.

476
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,270
<21-4,Julia>大哭大喊 情绪彻底失控
<21-4,Julia>She's crying and screaming and totally out of control.

477
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,120
<21-4,Julia>我当时觉得很有...
<21-4,Julia>And I felt...

478
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,900
<21-4,Julia>优越感
<21-4,Julia>superior.

479
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,870
<21-4,Julia>以为自己不必经历这种痛苦
<21-4,Julia>I thought I don't ever have to worry about feeling this way

480
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,550
<21-4,Julia>因为我和Tom对彼此足够坦诚
<21-4,Julia>because Tom and I are honest with each other.

481
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,730
<21-4,Julia>看来我也不能免俗
<21-4,Julia>Well,here I am.

482
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,410
<22-1,Taub>对不起 昨晚我没回家
<22-1,Taub>Sorry I didn't make it home last night.

483
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,860
<22-1,Taub>有很多化验要做
<22-1,Taub>I needed to run some tests.

484
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,650
<22-1,Taub>你知道 得知你出轨后
<22-1,Taub>You know what the worst part was?

485
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,560
<22-1,Taub>什么最让我难过吗?
<22-1,Taub>When y had your affair...

486
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,300
<22-1,Taub>不是你和别人上床
<22-1,Taub>Wasn't the sex.

487
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,490
<22-1,Taub>而是那些谎言
<22-1,Taub>It was the lies.

488
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,710
<22-2,Taub>我意识到 我的生活都是假象
<22-2,Taub>Realizing that the narrative of my life was totally wrong.

489
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,460
<22-2,Taub>手术到很晚是假的
<22-2,Taub>You weren't stuck in surgery.

490
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,420
<22-2,Taub>出差也是假的
<22-2,Taub>You weren't out of town.

491
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,320
<22-2,Taub>我不想再次被耍了
<22-2,Taub>I don't want to go through that again.

492
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,130
<22-2,Taub>- 我说过什么事都不会-- - 仅周四晚
<22-2,Taub>- I told you nothing's-- - Thursday nights.

493
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,590
<22-2,Taub>午夜前必须回家
<22-2,Taub>You have to be home by midnight.

494
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,340
<22-2,Taub>不许带她回来
<22-2,Taub>You don't bring her here.

495
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,890
<22-3,Taub>不要告诉我她的事
<22-3,Taub>You don't talk to her about me

496
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,340
<22-3,Taub>我不想和她有任何交集
<22-3,Taub>and I don't want to meet her ever in any context.

497
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,460
<22-3,Taub>你这是同意我和其他女人上床?
<22-3,Taub>Are you giving me permission to sleep with other women?

498
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,770
<12-12,Rachel>这不正合你意么?
<12-12,Rachel>It's what you want,isn't it?

499
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,310
<12-12,Rachel>我想要你
<12-12,Rachel>I want you.

500
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,530
<12-12,Rachel>你想要的不止我
<12-12,Rachel>You want more than me.

501
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,810
<12-12,Rachel>你要刺激
<12-12,Rachel>You want that thrill.

502
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,890
<8-3,Taub>但我爱你
<8-3,Taub>But I love you.

503
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,050
<8-4,Taub>我相信你真心爱我...
<8-4,Taub>And I really believe that you love me...

504
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,500
<8-5,Julia>我们也算生活美满
<8-5,Julia>And we have a good life together.

505
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,290
<8-6,Taub>到这份上了 我要么走人
<8-6,Taub>And at this point,either I walk away

506
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,290
<8-6,Taub>要么接受真正的你
<8-6,Taub>or I try to accept who you really are.

507
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,950
<8-6,Taub>明天星期四
<8-6,Taub>Tomorrow's Thursday.

508
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,110
<8-6,Taub>没错
<8-6,Taub>Yes,it is.

509
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,620
<23-1,Thirteen>检测全部呈阴性
<23-1,Thirteen>All our tests came back negative.

510
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,390
<23-1,Thirteen>不是凝血障碍
<23-1,Thirteen>It's not a clotting disorder.

511
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,230
<23-2,House>那咱们还想别的法子
<23-2,House>Which means we need to come up with a better idea.

512
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,840
<23-2,House>什么能让胃 心脏 神经同时受损?
<23-2,House>So what causes problems in the stomach,heart,nerves?

513
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,570
<23-3,House>偶滴天呐
<23-3,House>Oh,my God.

514
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,860
<23-4,Chase>你想到了?
<23-4,Chase>You know what it is?

515
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,160
<23-4,Chase>Taub老婆对开放婚姻开绿灯了
<23-4,Chase>Taub's wife gave the green light for an open marriage.

516
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,340
<23-4,Chase>他喷了古龙水 但没散发羞愧的恶臭
<23-4,Chase>He's wearing cologne,but not the stink of shame.

517
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,140
<23-5,Foreman>你有约了
<23-5,Foreman>You got a date.

518
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,140
<23-5,Foreman>我今晚要带着Rachel的祝福 去和Maya约会
<23-5,Foreman>I am going out with Maya tonight with Rachel's blessing.

519
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,840
<23-5,Foreman>该恭喜你?
<23-5,Foreman>Mazel Tov?

520
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,870
<23-5,Foreman>也许不是血液问题
<23-5,Foreman>Maybe the problem isn't her blood.

521
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,690
<23-6,Foreman>而是血管的问题
<23-6,Foreman>Maybe it's the vessels carrying the blood.

522
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,610
<23-6,Foreman>没有裂细胞或溶血症状
<23-6,Foreman>No sign of schistocytes or hemolysis.

523
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,580
<23-6,Foreman>你当真要睡了别人再回家陪老婆?
<23-6,Foreman>So you're actually going to sleep with another woman then go home to your wife?

524
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,740
<23-7,House>谢天谢地 可算有人说回正题了
<23-7,House>Thank God someone's keeping us focused on what's really important.

525
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,870
<23-8,Thirteen>反正Taub本来也打算这么干
<23-8,Thirteen>Taub was gonna do all of that anyway.

526
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,590
<23-8,Thirteen>肺动脉高压
<23-8,Thirteen>Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

527
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,010
<23-9,House>成像显示肺动脉直径正常
<23-9,House>Imaging showed normal diameter in her pulmonary artery.

528
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,690
<23-9,House>我是这么想的--
<23-9,House>Here's a thought--

529
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,990
<23-9,House>Taub老婆现在算是自由身了
<23-9,House>Taub's wife is now totally on the market.

530
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,630
<23-9,House>介意给我她电话不?
<23-9,House>Mind hitting me with her digits?

531
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,360
<23-10,Taub>她肯定不介意 但办正事要紧
<23-10,Taub>She would love that,but duty calls.

532
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,170
<24-1,Taub>- 怎么了? - 我的肚子
<24-1,Taub>- What's the matter? - My stomach.

533
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,040
<24-3,Chase>- 和先前一个痛法? - 对 但更厉害了
<24-3,Chase>- Same pain as before? - Yeah,but worse.

534
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,870
<24-5,Chase>拿台便携超声波来 检查她的胃
<24-5,Chase>Get the portable ultrasound in here. We need to get a look at her belly.

535
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,910
<24-5,Chase>救我啊!
<24-5,Chase>Help me!

536
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,100
<25-1,House>胃痛走了没多会 转悠一圈又归来
<25-1,House>Pain,pain went away,came back another day.

537
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,710
<25-1,House>问题是怎么回来的?
<25-1,House>Question is,what brought it back?

538
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,380
<25-2,Taub>体表检查和超声都查不出
<25-2,Taub>Physical exam was unrevealing. Ultrasound was clean.

539
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,990
<25-2,Taub>完事后你在女友家还是回家洗澡?
<25-2,Taub>So afterwards,are you gonna shower at your girlfriend's or at home?

540
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,380
<25-3,Taub>病人 腹痛
<25-3,Taub>Patient. Abdominal pain.

541
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,410
<25-4,House>没错 我们六点前得结束这话题
<25-4,House>Yeah,he's right. Let's get this wrapped up before 6:00.

542
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,950
<25-4,House>Taub午夜就要变回忠诚大南瓜了
<25-4,House>Taub turns back into a faithful Pumpkin at midnight.

543
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,080
<25-5,Thirteen>病人入院之前 和男宠在一起
<25-5,Thirteen>Patient was out with her boy toy before she came in.

544
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,350
<25-6,Chase>也许胃痛是性兴奋激发的
<25-6,Chase>Maybe the pain was triggered by sexual excitement.

545
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,730
<25-5,Thirteen>一个人躺在病床上想 家里破产的事--真够嗨的
<25-5,Thirteen>Because lying alone in a hospital bed contemplating bankruptcy-- hot.

546
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,040
<25-6,Chase>我意思是 性兴奋是 副交感神经系统(PNS)的一项机能
<25-6,Chase>My point was that arousal is a function of the parasympathetic nervous system.

547
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,080
<25-6,Chase>如果这是问题所在 那哭也能引发疼痛--
<25-6,Chase>If that's where the problem is, the pain could be triggered by crying,which seems--

548
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,220
<25-7,House>PNS还控制消化功能
<25-7,House>pns. Also controls digestion,

549
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,890
<25-7,House>没看她喊破喉咙也能消化 说明问题不在这
<25-7,House>which she's been doing without screaming her head off since she's been here.

550
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,810
<25-8,Taub>但假如关键不在疼痛开始时 而是结束时呢?
<25-8,Taub>What if what matters isn't when the pain started,but when it stopped?

551
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,270
<25-9,Foreman>那时她在做X光 你认为这能治好她?
<25-9,Foreman>It was during an X-ray. You think that cured her?

552
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,500
<25-10,Taub>不是 但House给她做了钡灌肠造影
<25-10,Taub>No,but House prepped her for the X-ray with a barium enema.

553
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,050
<25-11,Chase>那东西什么用也不管 除了--
<25-11,Chase>Well,that wouldn't treat anything except--

554
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,340
<25-11,Chase>去吧
<25-11,Chase>go.

555
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,210
<26-1,Chase>部分肠管出现套叠 所以你会痛
<26-1,Chase>You're in pain because part of your intestine folded in on itself.

556
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,590
<26-1,Chase>这叫肠套叠
<26-1,Chase>It's called an intussusception.

557
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,750
<26-2,Taub>阻断血液流动 肠坏死前必须手术
<26-2,Taub>It's cutting off blood flow. We need to fix it before your bowel gets necrotic and dies.

558
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,520
<26-3,Julia>做完就没事了?
<26-3,Julia>Once you do that,will I get better?

559
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,120
<26-4,Taub>成年人得这病 一般是胃癌征兆
<26-4,Taub>When this happens in adults,it's usually a sign of abdominal cancer.

560
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,360
<26-4,Taub>套叠复位后 还得找肿瘤
<26-4,Taub>We'll fix the overlap,and then search your intestine for tumors.

561
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,200
<26-4,Taub>加奶泡吗?
<26-4,Taub>Foam?

562
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,700
<26-4,Taub>我有不详预感
<26-4,Taub>I have a bad feeling about this.

563
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,670
<27-1,House>老朋友不能给你买台意式咖啡机?
<27-1,House>A friend can't spontaneously buy an overpriced italian espresso machine for another friend?

564
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,500
<27-2,Cuddy>你又干什么了?
<27-2,Cuddy>What did you do?

565
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,690
<27-3,House>啥也没干 神奇吧
<27-3,House>Nothing. That's the beauty.

566
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,180
<27-3,House>我诚心诚意为Wilson好
<27-3,House>I genuinely tried to help Wilson.

567
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,130
<27-3,House>撺掇他捍卫自身权利 这建议很合情合理吧
<27-3,House>I told him to stand up for himself,which you know is legitimate advice.

568
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,150
<27-3,House>接着他俩就掰了
<27-3,House>And his relationship blew up.

569
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,040
<27-3,House>- 他没事吧? - 会好的
<27-3,House>- Is he okay? - Ah,he'll be fine.

570
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,140
<27-4,Cuddy>重点是 我顿悟了
<27-4,Cuddy>Point is,I realized something.

571
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,110
<27-4,Cuddy>因果循环 善有善报啊
<27-4,Cuddy>I do nice things,nice things happen to me. Karma works.

572
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,860
<27-4,Cuddy>你就到这发善心来了?
<27-4,Cuddy>So you're paying it forward?

573
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:25,650
<27-5,House>要这能把Lucas克死 或你给我口交也值了
<27-5,House>If this should somehow lead to Lucas dying or oral sex,so be it.

574
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,860
<27-5,House>阿弥陀佛
<27-5,House>Namaste.

575
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,450
<28-1,Taub>我今晚该打领带不?
<28-1,Taub>Think I should wear a tie tonight?

576
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
<28-2,Chase>你还真一点不含糊
<28-2,Chase>This isn't weird at all.

577
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,110
<28-2,Chase>今晚Rachel在哪儿吃饭?
<28-2,Chase>I mean,where's Rachel eating tonight?

578
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,680
<28-3,Taub>在家
<28-3,Taub>Home.

579
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,280
<28-4,Chase>要是她也有约呢?
<28-4,Chase>What if she's going out too?

580
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,680
<28-4,Chase>她有这权利 对吧?
<28-4,Chase>She is allowed to,right?

581
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,520
<28-5,Taub>当然 这才公平
<28-5,Taub>Of course. It's only fair.

582
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,440
<28-5,Taub>但我觉得她不会这么做
<28-5,Taub>But I don't think she will.

583
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,800
<28-6,Operating Nurse>你老婆只在家吃晚饭?
<28-6,Operating Nurse>Your wife only eats dinner at home?

584
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,160
<28-7,Taub>如果她约会别人
<28-7,Taub>If she did go out,

585
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,130
<28-7,Taub>虽然不好受
<28-7,Taub>that would be tough,

586
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,020
<28-7,Taub>但我能担待
<28-7,Taub>but I think i can handle it.

587
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,530
<28-8,Chase>你真能办到才夸这海口
<28-8,Chase>Don't do it unless you're sure.

588
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,310
<28-9,Taub>我宁当醋坛子也不想背着她来
<28-9,Taub>I know I'd rather be jealous than a liar.

589
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,200
<28-9,Taub>有发现
<28-9,Taub>Got something here.

590
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,230
<28-9,Taub>Kelly 钳子和手术刀
<28-9,Taub>Kelly clamp and scalpel.

591
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,640
<29-1,Chase>活检发现非特异性炎症
<29-1,Chase>Biopsy showed non-specific inflammation,

592
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,210
<29-1,Chase>指向炎症性肠病 但解释不了心脏问题
<29-1,Chase>which suggests ibd,only it doesn't explain the cardiac problems.

593
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,270
<29-2,Taub>还有肾功能衰退
<29-2,Taub>Or her declining kidney function.

594
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,370
<29-2,Taub>手术时做了测试
<29-2,Taub>We ran panels during surgery.

595
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,550
<29-3,House>炎症性肠病靠谱
<29-3,House>Actually,ibd does make sense,

596
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,070
<29-3,House>这会引发强直性脊椎炎
<29-3,House>'cause it could trigger ankylosing spondylitis,

597
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,320
<29-3,House>能解释心脏和肾的问题
<29-3,House>which would explain the heart and the kidneys.

598
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,520
<29-3,House>给她用柳氮磺吡啶和 肿瘤坏死因子抑制剂
<29-3,House>Start her on sulfasalazine and tnf-inhibitors.

599
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,520
<29-3,House>Taub 在你奔赴俄摩拉城前 我见不着你了 (圣经罪恶之都)
<29-3,House>Oh,and Taub,I'm not gonna see you before you head off for gomorrah.

600
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,080
<29-3,House>给你个建议 如果你昏头了...
<29-3,House>Just remember,if you get disoriented...

601
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,250
<29-3,House>深呼吸 寻找地平线的方向
<29-3,House>Breathe through your nose and look for the horizon.

602
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,460
<31-12,Taub>我办不到
<31-12,Taub>I can't.

603
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,780
<31-13,Foreman>我本以为我可以
<31-13,Foreman>I really thought I could do this.

604
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,970
<31-14,Thirteen>逻辑上天衣无缝
<31-14,Thirteen>Logically,it makes perfect sense.

605
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,710
<31-14,Thirteen>但是...
<31-14,Thirteen>But...

606
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,550
<31-14,Thirteen>整个下午
<31-14,Thirteen>all afternoon,

607
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,340
<31-14,Thirteen>我都在想
<31-14,Thirteen>all I kept thinking about was

608
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,160
<31-14,Thirteen>你俩一起时的情形
<31-14,Thirteen>the two of you,together,

609
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,130
<31-14,Thirteen>你爱抚她
<31-14,Thirteen>and you touching her.

610
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,230
<30-1,Taub>什么都没发生
<30-1,Taub>Nothing's happened.

611
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,420
<30-1,Taub>没事了
<30-1,Taub>It's okay.

612
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,600
<30-1,Taub>对不起
<30-1,Taub>I'm sorry.

613
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,170
<30-2,Taub>我真的很想--
<30-2,Taub>'Cause I really wanted it--

614
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,770
<30-2,Taub>不
<30-2,Taub>no.

615
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,170
<30-2,Taub>我栽过一次了 除了你我谁也不要
<30-2,Taub>I've been an idiot,and I don't need anything else. I just need you.

616
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,020
<30-3,Rachel>真心话?
<30-3,Rachel>You mean that?

617
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,590
<30-4,Taub>是的
<30-4,Taub>I do.

618
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,950
<30-5,Rachel>- 我爱你 Rachel - 我也爱你
<30-5,Rachel>- I love you,Rachel. - I love you too.

619
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,700
<30-6,Taub>我们回家吧
<30-6,Taub>Let's go home.

620
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,210
<30-7,Rachel>你能走了吗?
<30-7,Rachel>Is that okay?

621
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,430
<30-8,Taub>还有别的医生
<30-8,Taub>There are other doctors.

622
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,510
<31-1,Foreman>治疗不起作用
<31-1,Foreman>The treatment's not working.

623
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,140
<31-1,Foreman>昨晚她左肾衰竭 另一个也快了
<31-1,Foreman>Her left kidney failed last night. The other one's right behind it.

624
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,250
<31-1,Foreman>不是强直性脊椎炎
<31-1,Foreman>It's not ankylosing spondylitis.

625
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,160
<31-2,Chase>肾活检显示 她得过IgA肾病
<31-2,Chase>Kidney biopsy showed she had iga nephropathy,

626
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,080
<31-2,Chase>可能是以下任一情况引起的
<31-2,Chase>which could be caused by or associated with any of these conditions.

627
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,300
<31-3,Taub>毫无头绪一下变千头万绪
<31-3,Taub>We've gone from too few ideas to too many,

628
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,430
<31-3,Taub>可病人时间不多了
<31-3,Taub>and our patient's running out of time.

629
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,680
<31-4,House>咋没看你容光焕发呢?
<31-4,House>Why the lack of afterglow?

630
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,600
<31-4,House>那妞没你想的么来劲?
<31-4,House>Physio girl not as freaky as you'd hoped?

631
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,760
<31-5,Taub>我和老婆回家了
<31-5,Taub>I went home with my wife.

632
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,500
<31-5,Taub>都到这份上了 你竟临阵退缩
<31-5,Taub>After all that,you chickened out.

633
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,960
<31-6,Taub>我不能这样伤害Rachel
<31-6,Taub>I can't hurt Rachel like that.

634
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,330
<31-6,Taub>镰状细胞性贫血能在血检中查出
<31-6,Taub>Sickle cell anemia would have shown on blood tests.

635
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,450
<31-6,Taub>无肠绒毛变平 排除腹腔问题
<31-6,Taub>No flattened intestinal villi rules out celiac.

636
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,920
<31-7,House>不是吧?
<31-7,House>Seriously?

637
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,940
<31-6,Taub>病人快死了 还揪着我性生活不放?
<31-6,Taub>Our patient's dying,and we can't move past my sex life?

638
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,230
<31-7,House>难不成拿你开涮15秒会耽误救人?
<31-7,House>Seriously,you'd think it'd kill her if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?

639
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,080
<31-5,Taub>时间到了
<31-5,Taub>Time's up.

640
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,000
<31-6,Taub>肝酶素正常 排除乙肝和肝硬化
<31-6,Taub>Normal liver enzymes rules out hep b and cirrhosis.

641
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,040
<31-8,Thirteen>奥尔波特综合症和 抗肾小球基底膜抗体都不可治愈
<31-8,Thirteen>Alport and anti-gbm antibody are both untreatable,

642
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,050
<31-8,Thirteen>她要得了咱就没辙了
<31-8,Thirteen>so if she has them we can't help her.

643
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,540
<31-9,Chase>也不是过敏性紫癜
<31-9,Chase>And it can't be henoch-schonlein purpura.

644
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,730
<31-9,Chase>没呼吸道感染和疹子
<31-9,Chase>No inciting respiratory infection and no rash.

645
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,410
<31-10,House>别用排除法了 说有可能的
<31-10,House>I don't care what it's not. I want to know what it could be.

646
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,210
<31-11,Thirteen>没排除的都有可能
<31-11,Thirteen>Well,everything left on the list.

647
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,540
<31-11,Thirteen>总有个先来后到吧
<31-11,Thirteen>The list was not created equal.

648
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,910
<31-13,Foreman>人还分三六九等呢
<31-13,Foreman>Neither was man,by the way.

649
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,920
<31-12,Taub>可能是血色沉着病
<31-12,Taub>Hemochromatosis is a possibility.

650
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,610
<31-12,Taub>铁过量沉积 引起全身的问题
<31-12,Taub>Excess iron builds up,causes problems throughout the body.

651
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,660
<31-13,Foreman>威尔综合征也会影响多个系统
<31-13,Foreman>Weil's syndrome also affects multiple organ systems,

652
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,070
<31-13,Foreman>而且急诊给的抗生素不管用
<31-13,Foreman>and it wouldn't have been treated by the antibiotic the E. R. gave her.

653
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,320
<31-14,Thirteen>结节病也说得通
<31-14,Thirteen>Sarcoidosis makes sense too.

654
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,530
<31-15,House>那好 按这三种病治
<31-15,House>Good. Treat for those three.

655
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,280
<32-1,Thirteen>我觉得你应该打给Tom
<32-1,Thirteen>I think you should call Tom.

656
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,770
<32-2,Julia>我快死了?
<32-2,Julia>Am I gonna die?

657
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,350
<32-3,Thirteen>不知道
<32-3,Thirteen>I don't know.

658
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,940
<32-4,Julia>如果他现在走进门
<32-4,Julia>If he walked in here right now,

659
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,880
<32-4,Julia>看见他 我脑子里只想到"骗子"
<32-4,Julia>I'd look in his face and all I would think is "liar.

660
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,270
<32-5,Thirteen>你不觉得这不公平吗?
<32-5,Thirteen>" Don't you think that's kind of unfair?

661
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,850
<32-5,Thirteen>你说最重要的是坦诚
<32-5,Thirteen>You say honesty's all-important,

662
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,780
<32-5,Thirteen>但你有没想过 有些事实会伤害人
<32-5,Thirteen>but you conveniently ignore the truth that some truths hurt people.

663
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,150
<32-5,Thirteen>Tom撒谎是为了保护你
<32-5,Thirteen>Tom lied to protect you.

664
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,380
<32-6,Julia>他是为自保
<32-6,Julia>He was covering his ass.

665
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,400
<32-7,Thirteen>我不是说钱的事
<32-7,Thirteen>I'm not talking about the money.

666
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,870
<32-7,Thirteen>Tom一年多没和别人上床了
<32-7,Thirteen>Tom hasn't slept with anyone else in over a year.

667
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,830
<32-8,Julia>他告诉你的?
<32-8,Julia>He told you that?

668
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,860
<32-8,Julia>这段婚姻只建立在假象上?
<32-8,Julia>So my entire marriage is a sham?

669
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,270
<32-8,Julia>不
<32-8,Julia>No.

670
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,740
<32-9,Thirteen>你丈夫只要你一个
<32-9,Thirteen>Your husband,who only wants you,

671
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,230
<32-9,Thirteen>骗你是为了你幸福
<32-9,Thirteen>lied so that you could be happy.

672
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,770
<32-9,Thirteen>在我看来 这种感情真实不过
<32-9,Thirteen>That seems pretty real to me.

673
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,430
<33-2,Sam>进来
<33-2,Sam>Yeah?

674
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,440
<33-3,Wilson>听着 对不起
<33-3,Wilson>Listen,I'm sorry.

675
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,250
<33-4,Wilson>我也是 我不该这样说--
<33-4,Wilson>Me too. I shouldn't have said--

676
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,880
<32-1,Thirteen>不 你没说错 我当时很自私
<32-1,Thirteen>no,you were right. I was selfish back then.

677
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,270
<32-2,Julia>我在试着改
<32-2,Julia>I'm trying to change.

678
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,320
<32-3,Thirteen>不知是因为House还是别的 但...
<32-3,Thirteen>And I don't know if it's House or what,but...

679
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,590
<33-3,Wilson>你也变了
<33-3,Wilson>you're different too.

680
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,590
<33-4,Wilson>我也在试着改变
<33-4,Wilson>I'm trying.

681
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,880
<33-5,Wilson>我以为自己一直在促和谐保稳定
<33-5,Wilson>I always thought that I was keeping the peace,

682
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,260
<33-5,Wilson>其实我心里恨你 想逼你离开
<33-5,Wilson>but I was just resenting you and giving you a reason to leave.

683
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,570
<33-6,Sam>我们要十年前吵这架就好了
<33-6,Sam>I wish we had this fight ten years ago.

684
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,750
<33-7,Wilson>这功劳别记House头上行么?
<33-7,Wilson>Is it okay if we don't give House the credit?

685
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,360
<33-8,Sam>我赞成
<33-8,Sam>Oh,I recommend it.

686
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,910
<34-1,Thirteen>三种都不是 肾脏仍在衰竭
<34-1,Thirteen>"O" for three. Her kidney function is still declining.

687
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,300
<34-1,Thirteen>得开始做透析了
<34-1,Thirteen>We're gonna need to start dialysis.

688
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,200
<34-2,House>老公回来了就好
<34-2,House>Glad the husband's back.

689
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,220
<34-2,House>小插曲错过几出 大结局不能不在
<34-2,House>After missing so many little deaths,he should be here for the big one.

690
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,400
<34-3,Taub>- 谁先来? - 结节性多动脉炎?
<34-3,Taub>Top six,anyone? Polyarteritis nodosa?

691
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,380
<34-4,House>那强的松应该起效
<34-4,House>We'd have seen some improvement on prednisone.

692
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,730
<34-4,House>老婆快死了 买花钱也可以省了
<34-4,House>Guy's wife's dying,and he stops to buy flowers.

693
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,730
<34-5,Thirteen>从他花园里采的 汞中毒符合
<34-5,Thirteen>They're from his garden. Mercury poisoning fits.

694
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,980
<34-6,House>紫丁香花
<34-6,House>Those are lilacs.

695
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,760
<34-6,House>我妈种过这花
<34-6,House>My mom used to grow lilacs.

696
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,880
<34-6,House>我爸让她铲了 因为太招蜜蜂
<34-6,House>My dad made her get rid of them,'cause there were too many bees.

697
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,380
<34-6,House>排除过敏性紫癜 因为没有呼吸道感染
<34-6,House>We ruled out hsp 'cause there was no inciting respiratory infection.

698
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,350
<34-6,House>但有些罕见病例 蜜蜂蛰了也会发病
<34-6,House>But in rare cases,it can also be triggered by a bee sting.

699
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,190
<34-7,Thirteen>我们排除它 还因为没起疹子
<34-7,Thirteen>We also ruled it out because there's no rash.

700
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,830
<34-8,House>也许是我们没发现
<34-8,House>Maybe we just didn't see it.

701
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,390
<34-9,House>最近被蜜蜂蛰没?
<34-9,House>Have you been stung by a bee recently?

702
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,970
<34-10,Julia>大概一个月前
<34-10,Julia>Uh,about a month ago.

703
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,640
<34-11,Tom>怎么回事?
<34-11,Tom>What's going on?

704
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,410
<34-11,Tom>我认为你老婆得了过敏性紫癜
<34-11,Tom>I think your wife has henoch-schonlein purpura.

705
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,250
<34-11,Tom>由系统性血管炎导致
<34-11,Tom>Systemic vasculitis can cause

706
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,710
<34-11,Tom>病变和炎症遍布全身
<34-11,Tom>lesions and inflammations throughout the body.

707
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,180
<35-1,Sam>相当难缠
<35-1,Sam>It's pretty awful,

708
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,830
<35-2,Wilson>难怪取个德国佬的名儿
<35-2,Wilson>which explains why it was named after a German.

709
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,030
<35-3,House>其实是俩德国佬
<35-3,House>Actually two germans.

710
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,290
<34-10,Julia>病变可反映在心脏
<34-10,Julia>Lesions can pop up in the heart,

711
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,590
<34-11,Tom>有时是肾脏 但最常见的是皮肤
<34-11,Tom>sometimes in the kidneys,but always on the skin.

712
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,410
<34-12,Julia>就是说 你肯定哪儿起了疹子
<34-12,Julia>Means you'd have a rash somewhere.

713
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,620
<34-13,House>- 我没起 - 你说了不算
<34-13,House>- I don't. - Not that you know of.

714
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,040
<34-13,House>我得检查你全身的窟窿
<34-13,House>Okay,I'm gonna have to check your holes.

715
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,480
<34-13,House>从嘴巴开始 要是没发现 我就得耍流氓了
<34-13,House>I'll start with the mouth. If there's nothing there,then things might have to get kinky.

716
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,580
<34-13,House>说"啊"
<34-13,House>Say aah.

717
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,200
<34-15,House>想耍还是没耍成
<34-15,House>I was kinda hoping for kinky.

718
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,890
<34-16,Tom>到底好还是不好?
<34-16,Tom>Is that good or bad?

719
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,510
<34-17,Thirteen>给她静脉注射高剂量的 免疫球蛋白和环磷酰胺
<34-17,Thirteen>We'll treat her with high-dose ivig and cyclophosphamide.

720
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,280
<34-17,Thirteen>就没事了
<34-17,Thirteen>You should be fine.

721
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,700
<34-18,Julia>我会好的
<34-18,Julia>I'm gonna be okay.

722
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,330
<34-18,Julia>我爱你
<34-18,Julia>I love you.

723
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,670
<34-19,House>真感人啊
<34-19,House>That is adorable.

724
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,870
<34-19,House>撇开你还想和其他人上床
<34-19,House>Other than you still wanting to have sex with other dudes,

725
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,540
<34-19,House>他继续败家不说
<34-19,House>and him bankrupting your family,

726
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,940
<34-19,House>你俩算大团圆了
<34-19,House>I think you kids are pretty much home free.

727
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,160
<35-2,Wilson>还有...
<35-2,Wilson>And...

728
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,600
<35-3,House>- 你俩和好了? - 没
<35-3,House>- You two made up? - No.

729
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,180
<35-4,House>稍后谢我也不晚
<35-4,House>You can thank me later.
