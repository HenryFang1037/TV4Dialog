00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,690
<2-1,Masters>你们觉得豪斯今天会来吗
<2-1,Masters>Think House is coming in today?

36
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,390
<2-2,Foreman>如果我们开始提供SPA服务  他或许会来
<2-2,Foreman>Maybe if we start offering SPA treatments.

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,870
<2-3,Masters>他都已经跳过一次酒店阳台了
<2-3,Masters>He already jumped off of a hotel balcony.

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,970
<2-5,House>我是说我的小轮车
<2-5,House>My scooter,

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,650
<2-5,House>可一旦说出来
<2-5,House>which, you know, said out loud,

45
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,960
<2-5,House>听着反而更不对劲了
<2-5,House>sounds even more inappropriate.

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,230
<2-6,Taub>你不是吧  竟然带她们来上班了

<2-8,House>让我猜猜  诊断结果是火烧的
<2-8,House>Let me guess-- diagnosis was fire.

<2-9,Masters>他说他被灼烧的皮肉闻着像甘草

<2-9,Masters>and the E.R. antiseptics

52
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,330
<2-9,Masters>闻起来像蓝莓松饼
<2-9,Masters>like blueberry muffins.

53

<2-10,House>酷

<2-10,House>你闻着像个赢家
<2-10,House>Smells like a winner.

58
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,630
<2-10,House>你和奇斯去他被发现的那个公园看看
<2-10,House>Okay, you and Chase go check out the park where they found him.

59
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,590
<2-10,House>你们两个给他用强的松
<2-10,House>You two load him up with prednisone,

<2-10,House>给他做个气味分辨测试
<2-10,House>give him an odor I.D. test.

<2-10,House>If he's still mistaking his body odors for candy,

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,580
<2-10,House>因为我在想"弗勒斯·布勒"
<2-10,House>Since I'm assuming "Ferris Bueller"

66
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,410
<2-10,House>并不是他的真名
<2-10,House>is not his real name.

67
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,630
<2-11,Masters>为什么
<2-11,Masters>Why?

68
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,950
<2-12,Masters>说真的  那是谁

78
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,110
<2-18,Masters>我觉得这不该两个人一起骑
<2-18,Masters>I don't think that two people are supposed--

79
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,060
<2-19,House>生活很艰难呀  小宝贝

<3-2,Danny>很疼
<3-2,Danny>It hurts.

82
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,840
<3-2,Danny>我现在就得出院了吗
<3-2,Danny>Do I have to check out now?

83
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,020
<3-3,Masters>等我们先弄清你的嗅觉为何会失常再说
<3-3,Masters>Not until we figure out why your sense of smell is off.

84
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,320
<3-3,Masters>你最先觉察到这点是在什么时候
<3-3,Masters>When was the first time you noticed it?

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,480
<3-4,Danny>大概是几个月之前
<3-4,Danny>Maybe a couple months ago.

86
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,370
<3-5,Foreman>我们还需要知道你的真实姓名
<3-5,Foreman>We also need you to tell us your real name,

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,430
<3-5,Foreman>以便于我们回顾你的既往病史
<3-5,Foreman>so we can review your medical records.

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,130
<3-6,Danny>不是我主动要求来这里的好吗
<3-6,Danny>I didn't ask to come here, okay?

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
<3-6,Danny>这一切我一分钱也不会付
<3-6,Danny>I'm not paying for any of this.

90
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,260
<3-7,Foreman>别担心
<3-7,Foreman>Don't worry.

91
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,670
<3-7,Foreman>我想没有收帐公司
<3-7,Foreman>I don't think the collection agency

92
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,000
<3-7,Foreman>会在公园办公吧
<3-7,Foreman>has an office in the park.

93
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,950
<3-8,Danny>我没有病史
<3-8,Danny>I don't have a medical history.

94
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,360
<3-8,Danny>我一直很健康
<3-8,Danny>I've always been healthy.

95
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,880
<3-9,Foreman>那这些疤痕和烧痕是怎么回事
<3-9,Foreman>What about those scars and burn marks?

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,130
<3-9,Foreman>身体往前探点
<3-9,Foreman>Lean forward.

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,990
<3-10,Danny>是我爸
<3-10,Danny>My dad...

98
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,280
<3-10,Danny>我小时候我们处得不太好
<3-10,Danny>We didn't exactly get along when I was a kid.

99
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,050
<3-11,Masters>你住过几次院
<3-11,Masters>How many times were you hospitalized?

100
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,760
<3-12,Danny>从来没有
<3-12,Danny>Never.

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,650
<3-12,Danny>他很在行
<3-12,Danny>He was good at it.

102
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,750
<3-12,Danny>总能确保他干的坏事
<3-12,Danny>Made sure he never did anything

103
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,350
<3-12,Danny>用一件运动衫就能盖住
<3-12,Danny>that couldn't be covered up by a sweatshirt.

104
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,650
<3-13,Masters>抱歉
<3-13,Masters>I'm sorry.

105
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,270
<3-14,Danny>别  没必要
<3-14,Danny>No, don't be.

106
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,870
<3-14,Danny>我一点不难过  过去就过去了
<3-14,Danny>I'm not. The past is the past.

107
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,890
<3-14,Danny>所以我不愿意谈及这些
<3-14,Danny>That's why I don't like talking about it.

108
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,070
<4-1,Cuddy>你不能在这里骑这玩意
<4-1,Cuddy>You can't ride that thing in here.

109
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,710
<4-2,House>说到玩意[事情]
<4-2,House>Speaking of things,

110

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,130
<4-5,Cuddy>或许我熟悉
<4-5,Cuddy>Or perhaps I am.

119

<4-5,Cuddy>法案只适用于轮椅和助动小轮车
<4-5,Cuddy>They apply to wheelchairs and powered scooters only,

120
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,020
<4-5,Cuddy>而不是玩具

121
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,470
<4-6,House>你可知道这个玩具价值几何
<4-6,House>Have you any idea how much this toy cost?

122
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,840
<4-7,Cuddy>我管不着
<4-7,Cuddy>I don't care.

123
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,630
<4-8,House>出于某种原因  本周我的腿疼得很厉害
<4-8,House>For some reason, my leg's been hurting a lot this week.

124
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,410
<4-9,Cuddy>出于某种原因  我还是管不着
<4-9,Cuddy>For some reason, I still don't care.

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,200
<4-10,House>好吧  我会把车退掉
<4-10,House>Fine. I'll return it.

126
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,380
<4-11,House>我是不是只能从这里步行推它出去了
<4-11,House>Do I have to walk it out of here?

127
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,990
<4-11,House>算了
<4-11,House>Stop.

128
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,970
<4-12,Cuddy>为了你的腿我就破例一次
<4-12,Cuddy>I'll make an exception for your leg.

129
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,280
<4-12,Cuddy>但下次  请先让我知道
<4-12,Cuddy>But next time, check with me first.

<5-2,House>我听到一个奇怪的声音
<5-2,House>I hear a strange voice.

132
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,330
<5-3,Dominika>是个看起来很柔弱的人
<5-3,Dominika>A very soft-looking man.

133
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,980
<5-3,Dominika>一定是威尔森吧
<5-3,Dominika>Must be the Wilson.

134
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,230
<5-4,House>我知道我们说过彼此间不留秘密
<5-4,House>I know we said no secrets,

135
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,250
<5-4,House>但这个人还是让我自己处理吧  宝贝
<5-4,House>but I think I need to take this alone, honey bunny.

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,470
<5-6,Wilson>你是想利用卡迪
<5-6,Wilson>You're trying to screw with Cuddy.

139
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,830
<5-7,House>是啊  这就是那狗血的"你甩了我
<5-7,House>Yeah, it's the classic "You dumped me,

140
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,280
<5-7,House>所以我就在一周后结婚"的桥段
<5-7,House>so I'm gonna get married a week later" ruse.

141
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,660
<5-7,House>因为这样就不单单是她很傻
<5-7,House>'Cause not only is she that stupid,

142
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,470
<5-7,House>而且很显然我也很傻
<5-7,House>but apparently I'm that stupid.

143
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,830
<5-8,Wilson>然后呢  你就公开的嘲笑婚姻
<5-8,Wilson>Then what, you're openly mocking marriage--

144
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,390
<5-8,Wilson>来证明婚姻毫无意义
<5-8,Wilson>trying to prove it means nothing?

145
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,470
<5-8,Wilson>确实没有意义
<5-8,Wilson>It doesn't.

146
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,290
<5-9,House>但却是你在N年前就已亲身验证了
<5-9,House>But you proved that yourself years ago.

147
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,540
<5-10,Wilson>我很想继续陪你猜谜
<5-10,Wilson>I'd love to keep guessing,

148
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,520
<5-10,Wilson>但还有一群肿瘤病人等着我呢
<5-10,Wilson>but I've got people with tumors waiting.

149
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,470
<5-10,Wilson>为什么你想让我们认为你要结婚了
<5-10,Wilson>Why do you want us to think that you're getting married?

150
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,600
<5-11,House>只剩下唯一的理论  我确实要结婚
<5-11,House>Only one theory left-- I am.

151
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,760
<5-11,House>多米尼卡需要绿卡
<5-11,House>Dominika needs a green card.

152
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,920
<5-12,Wilson>所以你只是随便挑个陌生人帮一把
<5-12,Wilson>So you're just doing some random stranger a favor?

153
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,790
<5-12,Wilson>这是违法的  人们会因此锒铛入狱
<5-12,Wilson>It's illegal. People go to jail for that--

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
<5-12,Wilson>还得支付高额罚金
<5-12,Wilson>Pay huge fines.

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,630
<5-13,House>你没见过我怎么行医的吗
<5-13,House>Have you seen me practice medicine?

156
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,470
<5-13,House>你知道雇名全陪女佣
<5-13,House>You know how much it costs to have a live-in maid,

157
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,060
<5-13,House>私人助理  厨师  按摩师和妓女要多钱吗
<5-13,House>personal assistant, cook, massage therapist, whore?

158
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,590
<5-13,House>我知道
<5-13,House>I do.

159
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,810
<5-13,House>她愿意一周免费为我工作四天
<5-13,House>She's willing to work four days a week for free.

160
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,850
<5-13,House>这能给我省下三万三千刀
<5-13,House>It's gonna save me about $33,000.

161
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,740
<5-14,House>我要做的就只是说那愚蠢的三个字
<5-14,House>All I have to do is say two stupid words--

162
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,180
<5-14,House>"我愿意"
<5-14,House>"I do."

163
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,070
<5-15,Wilson>如果她不这么看呢
<5-15,Wilson>And if she doesn't see it this way?

164
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,800
<5-16,House>我们订好了婚前协议  互不干涉
<5-16,House>Iron-clad prenup--we go our separate ways.

165
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,470
<5-16,House>你那震惊的表情按我理解就是在说
<5-16,House>Your stunned look, I take it, is your way of saying,

166
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,960
<5-16,House>"这主意实在是高  豪斯"
<5-16,House>"Brilliant idea, House."

167
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,940
<6-1,Masters>你看上去不一样了
<6-1,Masters>Wow. You look different.

168
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,290
<6-2,Foreman>强的松经这段时间已经起作用了
<6-2,Foreman>The prednisone has had time to work,

169
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,580
<6-2,Foreman>现在需要你配合我们做个嗅觉测试
<6-2,Foreman>so we need to give you the odor I.D. test now.

170
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,790
<6-3,Danny>没问题
<6-3,Danny>Sure.

171
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,650
<6-4,Masters>告诉我们你闻到了什么
<6-4,Masters>We need you to tell us what you smell.

172
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,390
<6-5,Danny>某些变质的东西
<6-5,Danny>Something spoiled...

173
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,400
<6-5,Danny>是腐肉吗
<6-5,Danny>maybe rotting meat?

174
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,720
<6-6,Foreman>是婴儿爽身粉
<6-6,Foreman>It's baby powder.

175
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,950
<6-7,Danny>我还挺喜欢这个的
<6-7,Danny>I kind of like that one.

176
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,870
<6-7,Danny>是薄荷吗
<6-7,Danny>Peppermint?

177
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,480
<6-8,Foreman>是极其难闻的体臭
<6-8,Foreman>It's extremely bad body odor.

178
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,200
<6-9,Danny>不得不承认
<6-9,Danny>Well, you got to admit,

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,900
<6-9,Danny>闻不到体臭对我来说是件好事
<6-9,Danny>that one's kind of a good deal for me.

180
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,390
<6-10,Danny>我的背包
<6-10,Danny>My backpack.

181
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,460
<6-10,Danny>你们在哪里找到的
<6-10,Danny>Oh, where'd you find it?

182
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,980
<6-11,Chase>公园  就在一堆不知道啥东西的旁边
<6-11,Chase>In the park, right next to a big pile of questions.

183
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,410
<6-12,Taub>你在注射什么毒品
<6-12,Taub>What kind of drugs you shooting up?

184

<6-13,Danny>维生素

185
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,160
<6-13,Danny>我想增加自身的免疫力
<6-13,Danny>I've been trying to boost my immune system.

186
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,020
<6-13,Danny>好吧  如果你们不信就给我做检测
<6-13,Danny>All right, test me if you don't believe me.

187
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,350
<6-14,Taub>弗勒斯告诉你真名了吗
<6-14,Taub>Ferris tell you his real name yet?

188
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,300
<6-15,Masters>皮特·约翰逊
<6-15,Masters>Peter Johnson.

189
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,110
<6-16,Taub>丹尼·詹宁斯.
<6-16,Taub>Danny Jennings.

190
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,510
<6-17,Danny>那是我买的二手书
<6-17,Danny>I bought those books used.

191
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,830
<6-18,Taub>都是从同一个人那买的吗
<6-18,Taub>All from the same guy?

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,380
<6-19,Danny>不好意思  我想我还是现在就出院好了
<6-19,Danny>I'm sorry, you know, I think I should check out now.

193
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
<6-19,Danny>我该
<6-19,Danny>And I should--ow!

194
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,310
<6-20,Masters>怎么了
<6-20,Masters>What's wrong?

195
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,270
<6-21,Danny>我的胃
<6-21,Danny>Oh, my stomach.

196
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,400
<6-22,Foreman>胃肠道出血
<6-22,Foreman>Gastrointestinal bleeding.

197
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,170
<7-1,Masters>有人对这有意见吗
<7-1,Masters>Is anyone else disturbed by this?

198
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,700
<7-1,Masters>怎么了
<7-1,Masters>What?

199
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,140
<7-2,Foreman>她主动要求的
<7-2,Foreman>She offered.

200
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,520
<7-3,Masters>也许丹尼在真名这事上骗了我们
<7-3,Masters>Danny may have lied about his name,

201
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,750
<7-3,Masters>但对那些小瓶里的东西  他说的是实话
<7-3,Masters>but he was telling the truth about the vials.

202
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,380
<7-3,Masters>检测确认了那些是维生素A和B12
<7-3,Masters>Tests confirm they were vitamin "A" and B12.

203
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,610
<7-4,House>他还喜欢维生素H[指海洛因]
<7-4,House>He also enjoys vitamin "H".

204
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,490
<7-4,House>那小子是个瘾君子
<7-4,House>The kid's a junkie.

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,570
<7-5,Taub>毒理检测显示他没有使用毒品
<7-5,Taub>Tox screens were negative for drug use.

206
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,590
<7-6,House>他的头发不是  我拿去测试了
<7-6,House>His hair wasn't. I had it tested...

207
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,850
<7-6,House>因为不像圣诞老人和复活节兔子
<7-6,House>'cause unlike Santa and the Easter Bunny,

208
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,290
<7-6,House>无家可归  精神正常  二十出头
<7-6,House>homeless, non-mentally ill 20-somethings

209
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,820
<7-6,House>却不吸毒的生物是不存在的
<7-6,House>without drug problems don't exist.

210
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,950
<7-6,House>过去五个月内的某段时期他曾大量吸毒
<7-6,House>He was a heavy user sometime in the last five months.

211
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,060
<7-7,Foreman>真是太爽了
<7-7,Foreman>That was incredible.

212
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,710
<7-7,Foreman>-谢谢  -不  谢谢你
<7-7,Foreman>- Thank you. - No, thank you.

213
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,430
<7-8,Dominika>我喜欢脚又大又厚又性感的男人
<7-8,Dominika>I like a man with the big, strong, sexy feet.

214
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,340
<7-9,House>他还真把修手指甲理解成修脚趾甲了
<7-9,House>He really puts the "Mani" in the "Pedi."

215
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
<7-10,Foreman>如果他吸食过海洛因
<7-10,Foreman>If he has a history of snorting heroin,

216
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,030
<7-10,Foreman>可能导致自身嗅觉障碍
<7-10,Foreman>he could have caused the dysosmia himself.

217
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,370
<7-11,Masters>但我们还是得解释消化道出血的问题
<7-11,Masters>But we still need to explain the bleeding in his G.I. tract.

218
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,070
<7-12,Chase>注射维生素可能导致出血
<7-12,Chase>Vitamin injections could have caused that--

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,720
<7-12,Chase>维生素A过量中毒综合症
<7-12,Chase>Hypervitaminosis "A" syndrome.

220
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,640
<7-13,Masters>就是说不同症状间没有联系
<7-13,Masters>So his symptoms aren't connected.

221
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,340
<7-14,Taub>豪斯  你觉得这可能吗
<7-14,Taub>House, you buying this?

222
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,950
<7-15,House>一般情况下不可能
<7-15,House>Not usually.

223
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,220
<7-15,House>但这人长期睡在一摊狗屎上
<7-15,House>But this guy's been sleeping on a bed of dog poop.

224
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,290
<7-15,House>就算他的每个症状
<7-15,House>I wouldn't be surprised if he's got

225
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,470
<7-15,House>都有不同的病因我也不会奇怪
<7-15,House>six different symptoms for six different reasons.

226
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,900
<7-16,Masters>流血可能是由消化道梗阻引起的
<7-16,Masters>The bleed could be caused by a G.I. obstruction.

227
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,370
<7-17,House>维生素过量说的通  且便于治疗
<7-17,House>Vitamin O.D. makes sense, and it's easier to treat.

228
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,440
<7-17,House>给他补充维生素E和锌
<7-17,House>Give him tocopherol and zinc supplements

229
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,600
<7-17,House>中和多余的维生素A  如果我们是对的...
<7-17,House>for the excess vitamin "A". If we're right...

230
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,240
<7-17,House>他明天又可以流浪街头了
<7-17,House>he could go homeless tomorrow.

231
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,390
<7-18,Masters>如果我们错了
<7-18,Masters>And if we're wrong,

232
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,230
<7-18,Masters>他的肠道问题会更加严重
<7-18,Masters>his intestines could get further distressed,

233
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,340
<7-18,Masters>因为我们忽略了消化道梗阻的问题
<7-18,Masters>while we ignore the G.I. obstruction.

234
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,720
<7-19,House>你看当女人不用为了留在美国而伺候男人时
<7-19,House>See what happens when women don't have to serve men

235
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,190
<7-19,House>都会发生什么
<7-19,House>to stay in the country?

236
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,220
<7-19,House>她们就会自命不凡
<7-19,House>They get all uppity.

237
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,120
<7-19,House>这也是我们发明绿卡的原因
<7-19,House>This is why we invented green cards.

238
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,670
<7-19,House>给他的腹部拍个X光片
<7-19,House>Go X-Ray the guy's abdomen,

239
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,360
<7-19,House>如果这能让你心理平衡的话
<7-19,House>if it'll make you feel all equal.

240
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,510
<7-19,House>想请你帮个忙
<7-19,House>I need a favor.

241
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,260
<8-1,House>我想提前几天把我未婚妻的名字
<8-1,House>I want to add my fiancee's name

242
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,630
<8-1,House>加到我的医疗保险上
<8-1,House>to my health insurance a few days early.

243
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,950
<8-1,House>她想在大喜之日前镶个牙
<8-1,House>She wants to get a tooth capped before the big day.

244
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,840
<8-2,Cuddy>-我不会签的  -我同意
<8-2,Cuddy>- I'm not signing this. - I agree.

245
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,670
<8-3,House>我觉得她现在这样就很美了
<8-3,House>I think she looks beautiful the way she is.

246
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,490
<8-3,House>不  等等
<8-3,House>Oh, no, wait.

247
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,320
<8-3,House>你不签是出于道德原因吗
<8-3,House>You're not signing that for moral reasons?

248
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,020
<8-4,House>你是想当真爱的独裁者吗
<8-4,House>You're declaring yourself the sole arbiter of true love?

249
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,630
<8-4,House>因为你曾多年掩护陶博的妻子
<8-4,House>'Cause you covered Taub's wife for years.

250
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,050
<8-5,Cuddy>你这是欺诈
<8-5,Cuddy>It's fraud.

251
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,940
<8-6,House>她想让我贿赂你
<8-6,House>She wanted me to bribe you,

252
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,900
<8-7,House>就像在他们的国家那样
<8-7,House>like they do back in the old country.

253
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,240
<8-7,House>告诉她我说过什么
<8-7,House>Tell her what I said.

254
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,780
<8-8,Dominika>这是美国
<8-8,Dominika>This is America--

255
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,490
<8-8,Dominika>勇敢者的自由家园
<8-8,Dominika>the land of the home and the free of the braves.

256
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,910
<8-9,House>没错  每次听她这么说
<8-9,House>Yeah, I just get teary-eyed

257
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,960
<8-9,House>我都热泪盈眶
<8-9,House>every time I hear her say that.

258
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,420
<8-9,House>她给你带了份礼物
<8-9,House>She brought you a gift.

259
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,530
<8-10,Dominika>杏仁蛋糕  我亲手做的
<8-10,Dominika>Almond kulich-- I make with own hands.

260
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,910
<8-10,Dominika>很美味的
<8-10,Dominika>I-it's delicious.

261
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,110
<8-11,House>杏仁蛋糕  你怎么忍心拒绝呢
<8-11,House>Almond kulich--how can you say no to that?

262
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,680
<8-12,Cuddy>你知道如果我签了
<8-12,Cuddy>You realize if I do sign this

263
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,350
<8-12,Cuddy>而你们没有合法结婚
<8-12,Cuddy>and you don't get legally married,

264
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,500
<8-12,Cuddy>你会失去我们提供的所有保险
<8-12,Cuddy>you'll lose your insurance with our carrier?

265
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,210
<8-13,House>了解
<8-13,House>Yes.

266
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,420
<8-13,House>好吧
<8-13,House>Fine.

267
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,630
<8-14,Cuddy>你的生活你做主
<8-14,Cuddy>It's your life.

268
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
<8-14,Cuddy>我祝福你们
<8-14,Cuddy>I wish you both the best with it.

269
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,280
<8-15,Dominika>谢谢
<8-15,Dominika>Thank you.

271
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,240
<8-16,House>向北前进  黛丝犸克小姐
<8-16,House>North, Miss Teschmacher!

272
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,050
<9-1,Masters>你的血检没问题
<9-1,Masters>Your blood test was clean,

273
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,870
<9-1,Masters>但头发显示你曾吸过海洛因
<9-1,Masters>but your hair showed heroin use.

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,180
<9-2,Danny>我已经有三个月没再碰了
<9-2,Danny>I've been clean over three months now.

275
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,670
<9-3,Chase>你怎么戒的
<9-3,Chase>How'd you kick it?

276
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,700
<9-4,Danny>我先死过一次
<9-4,Danny>I had to die first.

277
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,350
<9-4,Danny>十一月时我服药过量
<9-4,Danny>I O.D.'d back in November,

278
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,610
<9-4,Danny>他们说临床来讲我死亡了几分钟
<9-4,Danny>and they said I was clinically dead for several minutes.

279
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
<9-4,Danny>感觉像是上帝给了我第二次机会
<9-4,Danny>It was like God gave me a second chance

280
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,280
<9-4,Danny>来做些正确的事
<9-4,Danny>to do things right this time.

281
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,100
<9-5,Chase>你是说是上帝治好你的吗
<9-5,Chase>You're saying God cured you?

282
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,970
<9-6,Danny>不  是州戒毒所治好了我
<9-6,Danny>No. State Rehab cured me.

283
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,560
<9-6,Danny>而我本应该死去  但我没有
<9-6,Danny>But I should be dead, but I'm not.

284
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,730
<9-6,Danny>这一定有什么特殊的意义
<9-6,Danny>It has to mean something.

285
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,600
<9-6,Danny>我会在这里一定是有原因的  对吧
<9-6,Danny>I mean, I-I must be here for a reason, right?

286
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,770
<9-7,Masters>那你知道是什么原因了吗
<9-7,Masters>Did you figure out the reason?

287
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,770
<9-8,Danny>我希望有朝一日能成为一名医生
<9-8,Danny>My goal is to become a doctor one day.

288
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,330
<9-8,Danny>我很聪明的
<9-8,Danny>I am smart.

289
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,090
<9-8,Danny>我高中毕业时得到了医科大学预科的奖学金
<9-8,Danny>I mean, I got a scholarship for premed out of high school.

290
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,460
<9-9,Masters>奇斯
<9-9,Masters>Chase...

291
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,350
<9-9,Masters>你看
<9-9,Masters>Look.

292
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,160
<10-1,Masters>我们发现他的结肠壁上散布着十三个肿块
<10-1,Masters>We found 13 masses spread across the wall of his colon,

293
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,000
<10-1,Masters>直径在两到八毫米之间
<10-1,Masters>ranging from two to eight millimeters.

294
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,020
<10-2,Taub>不可能是肿瘤  边缘太过光滑分明
<10-2,Taub>It can't be tumors. Edges are too sharp and defined.

295
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,250
<10-3,Chase>我以为那可能是寄生虫
<10-3,Chase>I thought it might be parasites,

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,790
<10-3,Chase>但在X光照射下  没有发现任何活动
<10-3,Chase>but we didn't see any movement between x-ray exposures.

297
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,610
<10-4,Foreman>在他的粪便样本中也没有发现幼虫或虫卵
<10-4,Foreman>And no larvae or eggs were observed in any of his stool samples.

298
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,920
<10-5,House>就一名住公园的流浪瘾君子来说
<10-5,House>Which is kind of surprising

299
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,350
<10-5,House>这倒是桩新鲜事
<10-5,House>for a homeless junkie living in a park.

300
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,460
<10-6,Chase>是前瘾君子
<10-6,Chase>Ex-junkie--

301
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,670
<10-6,Chase>他声称已有三个月没吸了
<10-6,Chase>claims he's been clean for over three months.

302
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,650
<10-7,Masters>而且他也打算结束流浪生活
<10-7,Masters>And he's not planning on staying homeless.

303
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,080
<10-7,Masters>他正努力保护自身健康
<10-7,Masters>He's trying to protect his health,

304
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,630
<10-7,Masters>所以才会补充维生素
<10-7,Masters>which is why he's been taking vitamin supplements.

305
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,320
<10-7,Masters>他想当医生
<10-7,Masters>He wants to be a doctor.

306
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,120
<10-8,Taub>他不过是了说些你爱听的
<10-8,Taub>He's just telling you what you want to hear.

307
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,910
<10-9,House>一旦上瘾  终生成瘾
<10-9,House>Once an addict, always an addict.

308
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,670
<10-9,House>你能
<10-9,House>Can you...

309
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,900
<10-10,Masters>不当着我的面这么做吗
<10-10,Masters>please not do that in front of me?

310
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,550
<10-11,House>估计很难
<10-11,House>Doubt it.

311
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,140
<10-11,House>你就是我嗑药的主要原因
<10-11,House>You're the main reason I'm on the stuff.

312
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,770
<10-11,House>我们现在所看到的也许是
<10-11,House>We could be looking at fungal masses

313
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,470
<10-11,House>附着在他结肠壁上的真菌肿块
<10-11,House>hanging off the walls of his colon.

314
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,460
<10-11,House>今晚先给他用两性霉素B
<10-11,House>Start him on amphotericin "B" Tonight,

315
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,160
<10-11,House>明天早上  给他做个结肠镜检查
<10-11,House>And in the morning, run a scope up where the sun don't shine,

316
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,010
<10-11,House>看能不能找到块菌
<10-11,House>see if you can find any truffles.

317
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,420
<11-1,Taub>我觉得我们应该捍卫原则  抵制这场婚礼
<11-1,Taub>I think we should boycott this wedding on principle.

318
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,670
<11-2,Foreman>我估计必须得去
<11-2,Foreman>I kind of have to go.

319
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,890
<11-2,Foreman>他的未婚妻都给我脚底按摩了
<11-2,Foreman>His fiancee did give me a foot massage.

320
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,820
<11-2,Foreman>而且他也邀请我去参加他的婚宴了
<11-2,Foreman>And he invited me to be in his wedding party.

321
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,830
<11-3,Taub>那奇斯呢  他邀请他了吗
<11-3,Taub>W-what about Chase? He ask him?

322
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,510
<11-4,Foreman>-对  他也去  -活见鬼
<11-4,Foreman>- Yep. He's in it. - What the hell?

323
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,030
<11-6,Foreman>你刚还说你不会去的
<11-6,Foreman>You just said you weren't even going.

324
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,090
<11-7,Taub>那我还是会伤心的啊
<11-7,Taub>I still have feelings.

325
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,170
<11-8,Foreman>那是什么
<11-8,Foreman>What's that?

326
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,260
<11-8,Foreman>绝对不是真菌
<11-8,Foreman>That's definitely not a fungus.

327
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,670
<12-1,Foreman>你会出血  是因为在你的消化道里
<12-1,Foreman>You were bleeding because you had 13 pieces of bone

328
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,120
<12-1,Foreman>有十三片碎骨
<12-1,Foreman>in your digestive tract.

329
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,070
<12-2,Masters>我们认为你有异食癖  由体内化合物失调
<12-2,Masters>We think you have pica, a craving for nonfood items

330
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,100
<12-2,Masters>导致对非食物的渴望
<12-2,Masters>that's caused by a chemical imbalance--

331
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,990
<12-3,Danny>我并不渴望它们  算是
<12-3,Danny>I didn't crave them. I kind of...

332
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,850
<12-3,Danny>志愿吞食它们的
<12-3,Danny>volunteered to eat them.

333
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,720
<12-4,Masters>什么  为什么
<12-4,Masters>W-what? Why?

334
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,290
<12-5,Danny>有家很棒的意大利餐厅
<12-5,Danny>There's this great Italian restaurant

335
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,480
<12-5,Danny>我经常光顾
<12-5,Danny>I like to frequent.

336
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,500
<12-5,Danny>我说的"餐厅"
<12-5,Danny>And by "Restaurant",

337
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,100
<12-5,Danny>是指餐厅后面的垃圾箱
<12-5,Danny>I mean their dumpster out back.

338
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,250
<12-5,Danny>那里的厨师算是我的朋友
<12-5,Danny>The cook is kind of a friend of mine.

339
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,260
<12-5,Danny>他向我挑战  让我尝试各类东西
<12-5,Danny>He challenges me to eat stuff.

340
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,490
<12-5,Danny>有时是生鱿鱼
<12-5,Danny>Sometimes it's raw squid,

341
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,750
<12-5,Danny>不然就只有鸡骨头了
<12-5,Danny>or, you know, I have to chew on a chicken bone.

342
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,150
<12-5,Danny>可一旦我照做了  他就会用真正的食物招待我
<12-5,Danny>But if I do it, then he hooks me up with real food,

343
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,840
<12-6,Masters>-而不只是些垃圾  -多"好"的朋友啊
<12-6,Masters>- not just the garbage. - Great friend.

344
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,590
<12-7,Foreman>这些碎片本可能会
<12-7,Foreman>These fragments could have

345
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,760
<12-7,Foreman>刺穿你的结肠从而导致死亡
<12-7,Foreman>perforated your colon and killed you.

346
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,680
<12-8,Masters>你必须答应我们你不会再这么做了
<12-8,Masters>You have to promise us you'll stop.

347
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,020
<12-9,Danny>我觉得我的眼睛不太对劲
<12-9,Danny>I think there's something wrong with my eyes.

348
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,970
<12-10,Foreman>怎么了
<12-10,Foreman>What is it?

349
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,560
<12-11,Danny>就像是我正从井底看着你们
<12-11,Danny>Uh, it's like I'm looking at you from the bottom of a well.

350
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,890
<13-1,Masters>如果我们给嗅觉障碍加上管状视野
<13-1,Masters>If we add tunnel vision to the dysosmia,

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
<13-1,Masters>就可以排除碎骨引起腹腔出血的可能
<13-1,Masters>we can subtract the bone-induced abdominal bleeding.

352
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,840
<13-2,Taub>我认为嗅觉障碍是海洛因引起的
<13-2,Taub>I thought the dysosmia was from heroin.

353
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,150
<13-3,Masters>他说他从不用鼻吸的方式  只用静脉注射
<13-3,Masters>He said he never snorted. He just shot up.

354
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,110
<13-3,Masters>所以那不会影响他的嗅觉
<13-3,Masters>So that wouldn't have affected his sense of smell.

355
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,220
<13-4,Taub>我们为什么要相信那个躺着的骗子呢
<13-4,Taub>And we believe the lying liar why?

356
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
<13-4,Taub>豪斯
<13-4,Taub>House...

357
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,460
<13-5,Foreman>你在听我们说话吗
<13-5,Foreman>Are you even listening to us?

358
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,240
<13-6,House>当你们肯定都有何症状并给出意见
<13-6,House>I'll start when you decide what the symptoms are

359
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,080
<13-6,House>我会听的
<13-6,House>and give me some theories.

360
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,020
<13-7,Taub>结合考虑嗅觉障碍和管状视野
<13-7,Taub>If we combine the dysosmia with the tunnel vision,

361
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,470
<13-7,Taub>符合西方马型脑炎的症状
<13-7,Taub>the symptoms fit for western equine encephalitis.

362
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,270
<13-8,House>但病人不符合  他没有发烧
<13-8,House>But the patient doesn't-- no fever.

363
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,140
<13-9,Taub>干嘛呢
<13-9,Taub>What the hell?

364
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,420
<13-10,House>负面强化
<13-10,House>Negative reinforcement.

365
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,040
<13-11,Chase>会不会是福斯特.肯尼迪综合征
<13-11,Chase>What about Foster Kennedy syndrome?

366
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,810
<13-11,Chase>他可能有脑膜瘤或者浆细胞瘤
<13-11,Chase>He could have a meningioma or plasmacytoma.

367
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,640
<13-11,Chase>最先压迫他的嗅神经
<13-11,Chase>Started by pressing on his olfactory nerves,

368
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,770
<13-11,Chase>影响他的嗅觉
<13-11,Chase>it affects his sense of smell,

369
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,290
<13-11,Chase>现在进一步发展  压迫到他的视神经了
<13-11,Chase>and now it's growing and pressing on his optic nerve.

370
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,060
<13-12,House>很好  给他做脑部核磁共振  找到肿瘤
<13-12,House>Good. MRI his head, find it.

371
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,680
<13-14,House>迅速影响了我们的社区
<13-14,House>...have an immediate impact on our community.

372
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,280
<13-15,Cuddy>我们可以延长时间
<13-15,Cuddy>We could extend the hours--

373
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,220
<13-15,Cuddy>-有什么问题吗  -没有
<13-15,Cuddy>- Something wrong? - No.

374
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,970
<13-16,Cuddy>我在想或许先参观下我们的门诊部
<13-16,Cuddy>I just think maybe it would be a better idea to have a tour

375
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,930
<13-16,Cuddy>会是个好主意
<13-16,Cuddy>of the clinic first.

376
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,530
<13-16,Cuddy>请走这边
<13-16,Cuddy>It's right this way.

377
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,150
<13-17,Cuddy>我们有几位患病儿童
<13-17,Cuddy>We have several patients that are children,

378
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,050
<13-17,Cuddy>我们认为
<13-17,Cuddy>and we find that it's important

379
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,340
<13-17,Cuddy>提供他们玩耍的机会
<13-17,Cuddy>to give them the opportunity to play

380
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,090
<13-17,Cuddy>好让医院显得不那么恐怖十分重要
<13-17,Cuddy>to make the hospital a less intimidating place.

381
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,840
<14-1,Danny>我爸爸以前常把我锁在衣橱里
<14-1,Danny>M-my dad used to lock me in a closet,

382
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,370
<14-1,Danny>这  我现在感觉快不能呼吸了
<14-1,Danny>and it--and it feels like I can't breathe.

383
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,270
<14-2,Taub>我们需要你保持不动
<14-2,Taub>We need you to stay still.

384
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,230
<14-3,Chase>让他喘口气
<14-3,Chase>Give him a break.

385
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,400
<14-4,Taub>你希望他乱动吗
<14-4,Taub>You want him squirming around?

386
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,230
<14-4,Taub>那样我们得再做一次
<14-4,Taub>We'll have to do it twice.

387
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,670
<14-5,Chase>我希望你能对他多点尊重
<14-5,Chase>I want you to show him a little respect.

388
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,010
<14-6,Taub>你真觉得这小子可以步入正轨吗
<14-6,Taub>You really think this kid can turn his life around?

389
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,460
<14-7,Chase>他相信上帝给了他第二次机会
<14-7,Chase>He believes God gave him a second chance.

390
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,940
<14-7,Chase>这种信仰很有力量
<14-7,Chase>That kind of belief can be powerful.

391
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,920
<14-8,Taub>马斯特斯倒没让我惊讶
<14-8,Taub>Masters doesn't surprise me.

392
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,590
<14-8,Taub>他耍了医学院学生
<14-8,Taub>He plays the fellow med student

393
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,890
<14-8,Taub>梦想成为医生的把戏  把她给绕进去了
<14-8,Taub>who dreams of being a doctor and reels her in.

394
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,130
<14-8,Taub>可你竟然相信他与上帝深深牵绊的鬼话吗
<14-8,Taub>But you falling for his deep connection with God?

395
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,490
<14-9,Chase>他心怀希望
<14-9,Chase>He has hope.

396
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
<14-9,Chase>在听说他遭遇的这一切后
<14-9,Chase>After all he's been through,

397
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,550
<14-9,Chase>让我想要支持他
<14-9,Chase>it kind of makes me root for him.

398
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,070
<14-10,Taub>我们甚至不知道他是谁
<14-10,Taub>We don't even know who he is,

399
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,310
<14-10,Taub>除了知道他骗我们他是别人
<14-10,Taub>except that he lies about who he is.

400
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,860
<14-10,Taub>说不定他那个嗜虐的父亲都是编出来的
<14-10,Taub>The bit about his abusive father is probably all made up.

401
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,790
<14-11,Chase>那伤疤也是弄假的吗
<14-11,Chase>And he faked the scars?

402
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,630
<14-12,Taub>他是个混混  可能卷入多起打架事件
<14-12,Taub>He's a punk. Probably got into a lot of fights.

403
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,670
<14-12,Taub>而他却利用那个父亲的故事博得你的同情
<14-12,Taub>And he sucked you in using the dad story.

404
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,110
<14-13,Danny>我觉得不太舒服
<14-13,Danny>I don't think I'm feeling very well.

405
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,030
<14-13,Danny>我觉得我要
<14-13,Danny>I think I'm--

406
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,520
<14-14,Taub>他吐了
<14-14,Taub>He's vomiting.

407
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,570
<14-15,Chase>都这样了  我该让他继续保持不动吗
<14-15,Chase>Should I ask him to stay still while he does that?

408
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,140
<15-1,Taub>他的顶叶皮层有两个黑点
<15-1,Taub>He has two dark spots in the parietal cortex.

409
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,500
<15-1,Taub>不是肿瘤
<15-1,Taub>They're not tumors--

410
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,340
<15-1,Taub>可能是什么损伤或是天生的缺陷
<15-1,Taub>maybe some kind of, uh, injury or inborn defect.

411
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,920
<15-2,Masters>很明显他曾因为吸毒过量
<15-2,Masters>Apparently he was clinically dead

412
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,860
<15-2,Masters>而临床死亡过数秒
<15-2,Masters>for several seconds when he O.D.'d.

413
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,600
<15-2,Masters>黑点可能是由于缺氧
<15-2,Masters>The dark spots could be brain damage

414
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,370
<15-2,Masters>造成的脑损伤
<15-2,Masters>from oxygen starvation.

415
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,920
<15-3,House>但并不是
<15-3,House>Except it's not.

416
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,190
<15-3,House>我曾经见过精神分裂症患者
<15-3,House>I've seen MRI imagery like that

417
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,120
<15-3,House>有这样的核磁共振表现
<15-3,House>in schizophrenics.

418
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
<15-3,House>三比二
<15-3,House>Three serving two.

419
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,480
<15-4,Masters>但是精神分裂症不能解释
<15-4,Masters>But schizophrenia doesn't explain

420
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,960
<15-4,Masters>他的血压暴涨
<15-4,Masters>why his blood pressure skyrocketed,

421
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,740
<15-4,Masters>以及在核磁共振室的呕吐
<15-4,Masters>and he threw up in the MRI.

422
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,270
<15-5,Chase>恐惧发作了  他有幽闭恐惧症
<15-5,Chase>Panic attack. He's claustrophobic.

423
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,300
<15-5,Chase>把他弄出来以后就没事了
<15-5,Chase>He was fine once we let him out.

424
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,730
<15-6,Foreman>嗅觉障碍和管状视野可能是幻觉
<15-6,Foreman>The dysosmia and tunnel vision could be hallucinations.

425
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,850
<15-7,Taub>除了  已经考虑到这点
<15-7,Taub>Except, as was already covered,

426
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,000
<15-7,Taub>之前在急诊室就排除了他患精神病的可能
<15-7,Taub>he was screened for mental illness down in the E.R.

427
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,830
<15-8,Dominika>劈头盖头
<15-8,Dominika>In your head!

428
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,910
<15-9,House>是"脸"
<15-9,House>It's "Face."

429
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,850
<15-10,Dominika>劈脸盖脸
<15-10,Dominika>On your face!

430
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,570
<15-11,House>很接近了
<15-11,House>Close enough.

431
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,800
<15-11,House>急诊室的医生漏掉了
<15-11,House>The E.R. docs missed it,

432
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,830
<15-11,House>因为那时他还没显现出主要的病症
<15-11,House>because he didn't present with major symptoms yet.

433
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,350
<15-11,House>我们正目睹它的萌芽阶段
<15-11,House>We're seeing it in its infancy.

434
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,760
<15-12,Masters>所以我们治疗他  然后呢
<15-12,Masters>So we treat him, and then what?

435
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,370
<15-12,Masters>他成了又一名无家可归的精神分裂症患者
<15-12,Masters>He becomes just another schizophrenic homeless man

436
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,370
<15-12,Masters>流浪街头  我们必须帮助他
<15-12,Masters>wandering the streets-- we have to help him.

437
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,870
<15-13,House>我也想啊  但我的名册上还有四百万疯子
<15-13,House>I'd love to, but I got four million other crazy people

438
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,630
<15-13,House>排在他前面等着我呢
<15-13,House>ahead of him on my to-do list,

439
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,750
<15-13,House>是真疯哦
<15-13,House>along with milk.

440
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,200
<16-1,Wilson>你俩用了几个月的时间想找到一个
<16-1,Wilson>You two spent months trying to figure out a way to date

441
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,460
<16-1,Wilson>不影响彼此工作关系的交往方式
<16-1,Wilson>and not have it affect your working relationship.

442
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,900
<16-1,Wilson>现在你得因为分手做同样的事
<16-1,Wilson>Now you need to do the same thing for not dating.

443
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,590
<16-2,House>我不需要
<16-2,House>No, I don't.

444
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,690
<16-3,Wilson>我是认真的
<16-3,Wilson>This is serious.

445
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,420
<16-3,Wilson>你知道她
<16-3,Wilson>Did you know that she's--

446
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,890
<16-4,House>她因甩了我快被内疚和自责淹没了
<16-4,House>She's dying of guilt and feels horrible for dumping me.

447
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,660
<16-4,House>这很好
<16-4,House>It's great.

448
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,100
<16-4,House>不是说她甩了我好
<16-4,House>I mean, not the dumping part,

449
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,900
<16-4,House>而是说我现在可以为所欲为了
<16-4,House>but the part where she'll now let me do whatever I want.

450
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,440
<16-5,Wilson>所以你只是想惩罚她
<16-5,Wilson>So you're just trying to punish her?

451
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,240
<16-5,Wilson>她感觉对不起你
<16-5,Wilson>She feels bad,

452
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,970
<16-5,Wilson>而你唯一的目标就是利用这一点吗
<16-5,Wilson>and your only goal is to take advantage?

453
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,050
<16-6,House>不对
<16-6,House>That's not true.

454
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,070
<16-6,House>我还有很多目标
<16-6,House>I got plenty of goals.

455
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,360
<16-6,House>其中一个就是
<16-6,House>One of them is

456
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
<16-6,House>在那里挂一台六十英寸的平板电视
<16-6,House>a 60-inch flat screen right there.

457
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,140
<16-7,Wilson>你是多面人  豪斯
<16-7,Wilson>You're a lot of things, House,

458
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,240
<16-7,Wilson>但你从来不是个虐待狂
<16-7,Wilson>but you've never been a sadist.

459
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,090
<16-7,Wilson>你这是在殴打一个
<16-7,Wilson>You're pummeling an opponent

460
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,010
<16-7,Wilson>不会反击的对手
<16-7,Wilson>who isn't fighting back.

461
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,730
<17-1,Masters>我已经给他上第二剂氯氮平了
<17-1,Masters>I already gave him a second dose of clozapine.

462
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,440
<17-2,Taub>-你不用再  -我赌
<17-2,Taub>- You don't need-- - I'll bet

463
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,430
<17-2,Taub>五十块他最喜欢的运动是曲棍球
<17-2,Taub>you 50 bucks his favorite sport is hockey.

464
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,470
<17-3,Masters>你怎么可能知道
<17-3,Masters>How could you possibly know that?

465
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,660
<17-4,Taub>直觉而已
<17-4,Taub>Just a hunch.

466
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,890
<17-5,Taub>你感觉如何
<17-5,Taub>How you feeling?

467
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,270
<17-6,Danny>我胳膊有点疼
<17-6,Danny>My arm kind of hurts.

468
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,480
<17-7,Taub>我会跟护士说增加你的止痛药剂量
<17-7,Taub>I'll talk to the nurse about upping your pain meds.

469
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,250
<17-8,Danny>曲棍球诶
<17-8,Danny>Hockey, eh?

470
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,440
<17-9,Taub>我侄子给我买的
<17-9,Taub>Oh, my nephew bought it for me--

471
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,460
<17-9,Taub>他知道我是个铁杆粉丝
<17-9,Taub>knows I'm a huge fan.

472
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,870
<17-10,Danny>我讨厌曲棍球
<17-10,Danny>I hate hockey.

473
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,460
<17-11,Masters>如果是精神分裂症  你将需要长期护理
<17-11,Masters>If this is schizophrenia, you're gonna need regular care.

474
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,340
<17-11,Masters>我找到几家
<17-11,Masters>I found some shelters

475
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,140
<17-11,Masters>有全职医护人员的疗养院  而且也有
<17-11,Masters>that have full-time medical staff and also--

476
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,380
<17-12,Danny>我胳膊很疼
<17-12,Danny>Oh, my arm really hurts!

477
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,670
<17-13,Masters>让我们看一下
<17-13,Masters>Let's have a look.

478
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,400
<17-14,Danny>感觉像着火了似的
<17-14,Danny>It feels like it's on fire!

479
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,490
<17-15,Taub>我们得揭开绷带看一下
<17-15,Taub>We need to take a look under the bandages.

480
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,970
<17-16,Danny>不不不  不是那只  是这只
<17-16,Danny>Ow! No, no, no. Not that one, this one!

481
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,290
<18-1,House>我的心肝们  快上车来
<18-1,House>Ahoy there, me hearties! Permission to come aboard.

482
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,190
<18-1,House>昨晚丹尼说他胳膊感觉像着火了似的
<18-1,House>Danny said his left arm felt like it was on fire last night.

483
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,200
<19-1,Masters>我们认为是精神分裂的幻觉  但
<19-1,Masters>We assumed it was a schizophrenic delusion, but--

484
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,540
<19-2,House>那不是幻觉  他在用氯氮平
<19-2,House>It's not. He's on clozapine.

485
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,080
<19-2,House>情况应该好转  而非更糟
<19-2,House>He'd be getting better, not worse.

486
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,270
<19-3,Chase>可能是区域疼痛综合征
<19-3,Chase>Sounds like regional pain syndrome.

487
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,480
<19-3,Chase>肯定是种遗传性疾病
<19-3,Chase>Has to be a genetic disorder.

488
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,730
<19-4,Foreman>你能慢点么  你会害我们被抓的
<19-4,Foreman>Would you slow down! You're gonna get us arrested.

489
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,450
<19-5,Taub>我不担心被抓
<19-5,Taub>I wouldn't worry about it.

490
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,000
<19-5,Taub>我们很可能会先挂
<19-5,Taub>We'll probably die first.

491
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,410
<19-6,House>别逼我脱鞋哦[进监狱时要脱鞋]
<19-6,House>Don't make me take my shoe off!

492
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,740
<19-7,Foreman>我们得测试他的DNA
<19-7,Foreman>We need to run his DNA.

493
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,880
<19-7,Foreman>他可能有早发性帕金森病
<19-7,Foreman>He could have early onset of Parkinson's.

494
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,390
<19-8,House>也可能是皮质基底节变性综合征
<19-8,House>Or cortical-based ganglionic degeneration

495
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,100
<19-8,House>或是亨廷顿氏病
<19-8,House>or huntington's

496
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,870
<19-8,House>或者几十种遗传性疾病中的任何一种
<19-8,House>or any one of a dozen other genetic diseases.

497
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,830
<19-9,Masters>如果你放我们出去
<19-9,Masters>Hey, if you let us out,

498
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,390
<19-9,Masters>我们就可以开始检查了
<19-9,Masters>we can start testing.

499
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,380
<19-10,House>如果全部检查一遍得花上几周时间
<19-10,House>If we're gonna test for them all, it'll take weeks.

500
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,190
<19-10,House>我才不要为了治这小子取消我的蜜月
<19-10,House>I'm not canceling my honeymoon to treat this kid.

501
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,140
<19-11,Taub>假结婚还要度真蜜月啊
<19-11,Taub>It's a fake marriage, but a real honeymoon?

502
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,180
<19-12,House>差不多吧
<19-12,House>Most are.

503
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,260
<19-13,Foreman>丹尼也有可能
<19-13,Foreman>Danny could also die

504
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,880
<19-13,Foreman>死在我们检查完所有的可能性之前
<19-13,Foreman>before we get through testing for all the possibilities.

505
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,080
<19-14,House>所以我们要走捷径
<19-14,House>So we cheat.

506
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,050
<19-14,House>既然是遗传病
<19-14,House>Since it's genetic,

507
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,860
<19-14,House>那他爹地或妈咪肯定也有
<19-14,House>daddy or mommy's got it too.

508
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,230
<19-14,House>他们不是病着就是死了
<19-14,House>They're either sick or dead.

509
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,470
<19-15,Masters>他不知道他母亲在哪里
<19-15,Masters>He doesn't know where his mother is,

510
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,890
<19-15,Masters>也不愿告诉我们他父亲在哪里
<19-15,Masters>and he won't tell us where his father is.

511
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,920
<19-16,House>他是个无家可归的前瘾君子
<19-16,House>He's a homeless ex-junkie.

512
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,920
<19-16,House>你是在告诉我你们四个天才都搞不定他一个吗
<19-16,House>Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him?

513
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,140
<19-16,House>绿灯
<19-16,House>Green light!

514
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,950
<20-1,House>卡迪给我弄的
<20-1,House>Cuddy got it for me.

515
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,320
<20-1,House>现在我正在起草一份
<20-1,House>And now I'm drafting a request

516
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,200
<20-1,House>关于由一台意式咖啡机与一把按摩椅
<20-1,House>for a study into the effects of caffeine

517
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,670
<20-1,House>引发的咖啡因效应之学术研究的申请
<20-1,House>involving an italian espresso machine and a massage chair,

518
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,290
<20-1,House>所以有话快说
<20-1,House>so make it quick.

519
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,100
<20-2,Taub>我找到丹尼的父亲了
<20-2,Taub>I found Danny's father.

520
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,700
<20-3,House>不错
<20-3,House>Well done.

521
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,540
<20-4,Taub>那孩子说他去年十一月
<20-4,Taub>The kid said he was in

522
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,080
<20-4,Taub>在一个政府资助的戒毒所戒毒
<20-4,Taub>a state-sponsored rehab last November.

523
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,070
<20-4,Taub>那段时间只有一个丹尼·詹宁斯
<20-4,Taub>There's only one Danny Jennings

524
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,720
<20-4,Taub>在那里接受治疗
<20-4,Taub>that was in treatment at the time,

525
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,160
<20-4,Taub>而且他在首要亲属栏里
<20-4,Taub>and he listed his father's address

526
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,010
<20-4,Taub>填了他父亲的地址
<20-4,Taub>as his primary next of kin.

527
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,580
<20-5,House>那句"不错"是想夸你挺快就说完了
<20-5,House>The "Well done" was for making it quick.

528
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,660
<20-5,House>现在我要收回那句话了
<20-5,House>Now I'm gonna have to take that back.

529
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,080
<20-6,Taub>他家离医院大概有三十分钟车程
<20-6,Taub>He lives about 30 minutes from the hospital.

530
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,040
<20-7,House>使你继续留在这里废话
<20-7,House>And the reason you're continuing to talk

531
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,350
<20-7,House>而不是开车去他家的原因是
<20-7,House>instead of driving there?

532
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,100
<20-8,Taub>奇斯和马斯特斯已经在路上了
<20-8,Taub>Chase and Masters are already on their way.

533
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,580
<20-8,Taub>你为什么没邀请我参加你的婚礼
<20-8,Taub>Why didn't you ask me to be part of your wedding?

534
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,730
<20-9,House>你因一个恶搞的婚礼被恶搞地鄙视
<20-9,House>You are genuinely upset at being mockingly snubbed

535
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,250
<20-9,House>而由衷得不安吗
<20-9,House>by a mock wedding?

536
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,710
<20-10,Taub>是因为我比他们在组里的时间短吗
<20-10,Taub>Is it because I haven't been here as long as them?

537
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,750
<20-10,Taub>还是因为你真的很不喜欢我
<20-10,Taub>Or is it that you really don't like me?

538
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,260
<20-10,Taub>还是你纯粹在耍
<20-10,Taub>Or are-- are you just s-screwing--

539
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,130
<20-11,Taub>我那个
<20-11,Taub>I'll...

540
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,730
<20-11,Taub>我等她弄完再回来吧
<20-11,Taub>I'll come back when she's finished.

541
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,160
<20-11,Taub>她弄完啦
<20-11,Taub>She is.

542
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,130
<20-12,House>我的天啊
<20-12,House>Oh, my God!

543
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,570
<20-12,House>你以为她在干什么
<20-12,House>W-what did you think she was doing?

544
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,530
<20-12,House>她只是在接有线电视
<20-12,House>She's just installing the cable.

545
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,490
<20-12,House>我可没打比方
<20-12,House>That's not a euphemism!

546
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,430
<20-13,Dominika>我很同情这小矮个
<20-13,Dominika>Oh, I feel sorry for the little one.

547
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,380
<20-13,Dominika>有什么我们能做的吗
<20-13,Dominika>Isn't there something we can do?

548
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,220
<20-13,Dominika>有何贵干
<20-13,Dominika>Can I help you?

549
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,430
<21-1,Chase>我们得和你谈谈你儿子丹尼的事
<21-1,Chase>We need to talk to you about your son Danny.

550
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,660
<22-1,Danny>丹尼  你们是谁
<22-1,Danny>Danny? Who are you?

551
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,550
<21-2,Masters>-我们是他的医生  -我们来了解一下
<21-2,Masters>- We're his doctors. - We need to know if you,

552
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,770
<21-3,Chase>你或他母亲
<21-3,Chase>or perhaps his mother,

553
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,480
<21-3,Chase>是否有任何家族遗传病史
<21-3,Chase>have any family history of genetic disease.

554
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,600
<21-3,Chase>怎么了  这有关系吗
<21-3,Chase>Why? What difference would it make?

555
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,270
<21-4,Masters>或许你不关心你儿子  但是
<21-4,Masters>You may not care about your son, but--

556
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,280
<21-4,Masters>丹尼戒毒期间
<21-4,Masters>Is that what Danny told you

557
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,000
<21-5,Chase>是这么和你们说的吗  说我们不爱他
<21-5,Chase>when he was in rehab-- we didn't love him?

558
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,060
<21-5,Chase>我们不是为这个来的
<21-5,Chase>Um, not why we came here.

559
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,500
<21-5,Chase>我们只是想知道
<21-5,Chase>We just want to know

560
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,860
<21-5,Chase>你家是否有确诊的遗传病史
<21-5,Chase>if there's any diagnosed genetic disease in your family.

561
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,960
<21-6,Masters>我们正在医治你儿子
<21-6,Masters>We're trying to make your son better.

562
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,710
<21-6,Masters>医治
<21-6,Masters>Better?

563
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,820
<21-6,Masters>他死于过量吸毒
<21-6,Masters>He died of a drug overdose.

564
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,970
<21-6,Masters>三个月前举行了葬礼
<21-6,Masters>We buried him three months ago.

565
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
<22-1,Danny>你是谁
<22-1,Danny>Who are you?

566
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,200
<22-3,Danny>你在干什么
<22-3,Danny>Shh. What are you doing?

567
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,260
<22-4,House>诊断
<22-4,House>A test.

568
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,540
<22-1,Danny>你到底是谁啊
<22-1,Danny>Who are you?

569
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,990
<22-5,Danny>重要的是  你是谁
<22-5,Danny>The important question is, who are you?

570
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,710
<22-6,House>丹尼·詹宁斯已经死了
<22-6,House>Danny Jennings is dead,

571
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,450
<22-6,House>就是说丹尼·詹宁斯没脉搏了
<22-6,House>which means that Danny Jennings has no pulse.

572
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,290
<22-6,House>然而  你
<22-6,House>You, on the other hand...

573
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,080
<22-6,House>尚有脉搏
<22-6,House>do.

574
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,910
<22-6,House>所以  你不是丹尼·詹宁斯
<22-6,House>Ergo, you are not Danny Jennings.

575
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,490
<22-6,House>要不就是我误诊了
<22-6,House>Or I did the test wrong.

576
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
<22-6,House>不如你就直截了当
<22-6,House>So why don't you cut the crap

577
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,120
<22-7,Danny>告诉我你的真名吧
<22-7,Danny>and tell me your real name.

578
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,880
<22-7,Danny>不
<22-7,Danny>No.

579
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,920
<22-8,House>掩饰身份
<22-8,House>Hiding your identity--

580
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,950
<22-8,House>那你不是罪犯就是超级英雄
<22-8,House>Well, either you're a criminal or a superhero.

581
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,470
<22-9,Danny>我不是罪犯
<22-9,Danny>I'm not a criminal.

582
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,930
<22-9,Danny>太帅了
<22-9,Danny>Awesome.

583
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,950
<22-10,House>我内裤是什么颜色的
<22-10,House>What color is my underwear?

584
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,210
<22-11,Danny>我是不会告诉你我的名字的
<22-11,Danny>I'm not telling you my name.

585
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,540
<22-12,House>好吧
<22-12,House>No problem.

586
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,790
<22-12,House>我只需要你父亲的名字
<22-12,House>I just need your father's name.

587
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,620
<22-13,Danny>省省吧
<22-13,Danny>Forget it.

588
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,530
<22-14,House>介意告诉我为什么吗
<22-14,House>Care to tell me why?

589
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,040
<22-15,Danny>他在找我
<22-15,Danny>He's looking for me.

590
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,450
<22-15,Danny>他大概
<22-15,Danny>He supposedly...

591
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,030
<22-15,Danny>已经戒了毒  戒了酒
<22-15,Danny>cleaned up and got sober.

592
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,650
<22-15,Danny>现在
<22-15,Danny>And now he--

593
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,970
<22-15,Danny>他想重新做回我父亲
<22-15,Danny>he wants to be a part of my life again.

594
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,070
<22-15,Danny>但我接受不了
<22-15,Danny>And I can't let that happen.

595
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,500
<22-16,House>现在你翅膀硬了
<22-16,House>You're a big boy now.

596
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,640
<22-16,House>还觉得他能伤害你吗
<22-16,House>You still think he can hurt you?

597
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,700
<22-17,Danny>你不懂
<22-17,Danny>You don't get it.

598
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,490
<22-17,Danny>如果我再见到他
<22-17,Danny>If I ever see my dad again...

599
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,180
<22-17,Danny>我一定会杀了他
<22-17,Danny>I'll kill him.

600
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,830
<22-18,Danny>我这是怎么了
<22-18,Danny>What's happening to me?

601
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,710
<22-19,House>算你走运
<22-19,House>Well, luckily for you,

602
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,970
<22-19,House>用不着你老爸就能把那弄明白了
<22-19,House>we don't need daddy to figure that one out.

603
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,530
<22-20,Masters>问出真名了吗
<22-20,Masters>Did you find out his real name?

604
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,620
<22-21,House>小脑共济失调
<22-21,House>Cerebellar Ataxia.

605
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,760
<22-22,Masters>好奇怪的名字
<22-22,Masters>That's a weird name.

606
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,630
<22-23,House>眼前的杯子  他抓空两次
<22-23,House>The guy whiffed twice trying to pick up a cup

607
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,300
<22-23,House>都没摸到
<22-23,House>right in front of him.

608
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,220
<22-23,House>加上其它症状
<22-23,House>That plus everything else...

609
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,510
<22-24,House>由此我们可以排除一些遗传病
<22-24,House>Means that we have whittled our list of genetic diseases...

610
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,110
<22-24,House>只剩一种
<22-24,House>All the way down to one--

611
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,250
<22-24,House>早发性帕金森病
<22-24,House>Early-onset Parkinson's.

612
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,310
<22-25,Masters>经历诸多不幸
<22-25,Masters>After everything he's been through,

613
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,670
<22-25,Masters>现在我们还得告诉他
<22-25,Masters>now we have to tell him,

614
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,150
<22-25,Masters>"嘿  你得了不治之症
<22-25,Masters>"Hey, you have an incurable disease

615
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,170
<22-25,Masters>只会日渐恶化"
<22-25,Masters>that gets progressively worse."

616
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,970
<22-26,House>你可以骗他  我是无所谓
<22-26,House>You could lie. I'm fine with that.

617
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,220
<22-26,House>给他用左旋多巴  同时做DNA测试确认
<22-26,House>But you'll probably both feel better

619
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,140
<22-26,House>那样可能你俩都会好过些
<22-26,House>if you give him levodopa and confirm with DNA tests.

620
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,480
<23-1,Wilson>他太过分了
<23-1,Wilson>He's gone too far.

621
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,210
<23-1,Wilson>他那辆巨轮卡车占了
<23-1,Wilson>He's taking up six handicapped spaces

622
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,430
<23-1,Wilson>-六个残障停车位  -就四个
<23-1,Wilson>- with a monster truck. - It's only four,

623
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,000
<23-2,Cuddy>结完婚他肯定就不要了
<23-2,Cuddy>and he's gonna get rid of it after the wedding.

624
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,470
<23-3,Wilson>还有小教堂  他把小教堂
<23-3,Wilson>And the chapel-- he's turned the chapel

625
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,290
<23-3,Wilson>变成了他的私人宴客厅
<23-3,Wilson>into his own personal catering hall.

626
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,680
<23-4,Cuddy>谁在乎
<23-4,Cuddy>Who cares?

627
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,600
<23-4,Cuddy>除了有一门卫在那里酒后打盹
<23-4,Cuddy>Other than a janitor sleeping off a bender,

628
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,840
<23-4,Cuddy>他是两周后第一个使用那地方的人
<23-4,Cuddy>he's the first person to use it in two weeks.

629
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,420
<23-5,Wilson>面对赤裸裸的侵略
<23-5,Wilson>Appeasement is never the answer

630
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,170
<23-5,Wilson>姑息养奸绝不是解决之道
<23-5,Wilson>in the face of naked aggression.

631
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,220
<23-5,Wilson>不多久他的坦克就会
<23-5,Wilson>It won't be long before his tanks

632
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,620
<23-5,Wilson>开进你的香榭里舍大道[变本加厉]
<23-5,Wilson>are rolling down your champs-elysees.

633
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,290
<23-6,Cuddy>我知道豪斯在做什么
<23-6,Cuddy>I know what House is doing.

634
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
<23-6,Cuddy>说起来  你有什么好在意的
<23-6,Cuddy>You, on the other hand-- why do you care?

635
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,370
<23-6,Cuddy>他又没伤到谁
<23-6,Cuddy>He isn't hurting anyone.

636
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
<23-7,Wilson>你是第一个
<23-7,Wilson>You're the first boss he's ever had

637
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,850
<23-7,Wilson>能降住他的上司
<23-7,Wilson>who could handle him.

638
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,530
<23-7,Wilson>在你之前   他要么被炒鱿鱼
<23-7,Wilson>Before you, he was either fired

639
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,010
<23-7,Wilson>要么被无尽的医疗事故诉讼缠身
<23-7,Wilson>or buried under a mountain of malpractice suits.

640
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,160
<23-7,Wilson>他需要有人管着他
<23-7,Wilson>He needs someone to say no.

641
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,700
<23-7,Wilson>他需要能让他
<23-7,Wilson>He needs someone he'll listen to

642
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,220
<23-7,Wilson>服管的人
<23-7,Wilson>when they say no.

643
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,480
<23-7,Wilson>如果你真关心豪斯
<23-7,Wilson>If you really care about House,

644
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,260
<23-7,Wilson>别再为他感到抱歉
<23-7,Wilson>you'll stop feeling sorry for him

645
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,110
<23-7,Wilson>踏出这扇门  该怎么收拾他
<23-7,Wilson>and get out there and start kicking him

646
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,070
<23-7,Wilson>就怎么收拾他
<23-7,Wilson>where he needs kicking.

647
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,870
<24-1,Cuddy>我改变主意了
<24-1,Cuddy>I changed my mind.

648
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,700
<24-2,House>怎么  你想用鱼肉换鸡肉吗
<24-2,House>What, you want the fish instead of the chicken?

649
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,500
<24-3,Cuddy>这房间是给病人家属用的
<24-3,Cuddy>This room is for patients' families,

650
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,420
<24-3,Cuddy>不是给想要欺诈政府的医生用的
<24-3,Cuddy>not for doctors trying to defraud the government.

651
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,250
<24-4,House>这么说来
<24-4,House>Oh, so...

652
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,050
<24-4,House>你决定遵从道德准则
<24-4,House>You've decided to take a moral stand.

653
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,230
<24-4,House>对
<24-4,House>Yeah.

654
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,120
<24-5,Cuddy>小教堂对某些人来说个可是神圣的地方
<24-5,Cuddy>The chapel still has sanctity for some people.

655
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,340
<24-6,House>说的对
<24-6,House>You're right.

656
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,810
<24-6,House>说来上周我看到那叫"布鲁"的门卫
<24-6,House>In that case I saw Blue the janitor

657
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,570
<24-6,House>在长凳上睡得不省人事
<24-6,House>passed out in one of the pews last week.

658
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,800
<24-7,Cuddy>是露  如果当时我在场也会赶他出去
<24-7,Cuddy>It's "Lou" and I would have thrown him out too.

659
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,890
<24-8,House>那我们要去哪里呢
<24-8,House>Well, where are we gonna go?

660
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,070
<24-8,House>我们说话这会儿承办酒席的正在楼下打点一切
<24-8,House>We got caterers staging everything downstairs as we speak.

661
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,660
<24-8,House>花艺陈列  餐具摆设
<24-8,House>We've got floral arrangements, place settings...

662
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,330
<24-8,House>还有其它结婚事宜
<24-8,House>other wedding-y stuff.

663
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,050
<24-9,Cuddy>那不是我的问题
<24-9,Cuddy>That's not my problem.

664
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,870
<24-10,House>我请帖都发了
<24-10,House>I sent out the invitations.

665
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,410
<24-10,House>客人正陆续赶来
<24-10,House>People are coming here.

666
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,570
<24-11,Cuddy>同样不是我的问题
<24-11,Cuddy>That's also not my problem.

667
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,080
<24-11,Cuddy>我还要收回电视
<24-11,Cuddy>And I want the TV back.

668
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,330
<25-1,Danny>直接让我死得了
<25-1,Danny>You should just let me die.

669
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,990
<25-1,Danny>没有我世界更美好
<25-1,Danny>The world's better off without me.

670
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,930
<25-2,Masters>很正常
<25-2,Masters>It's normal.

671
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,370
<25-2,Masters>听到坏消息人们都会沮丧
<25-2,Masters>People feel depressed when they get bad news...

672
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,470
<25-2,Masters>毕竟是坏消息
<25-2,Masters>Because it's bad news...

673
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,560
<25-2,Masters>很明显
<25-2,Masters>Obviously.

674
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,630
<25-3,Danny>我并不是偶然吸毒过量
<25-3,Danny>I didn't O.D. by accident.

675
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,430
<25-3,Danny>我是想自杀
<25-3,Danny>I was trying to kill myself.

676
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,370
<25-4,Masters>为什么
<25-4,Masters>Why?

677
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,470
<25-5,Danny>因为我做过很多
<25-5,Danny>'cause I've done things...

678
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,300
<25-5,Danny>可怕的事
<25-5,Danny>horrible things.

679
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,580
<25-5,Danny>我伤害过很多人
<25-5,Danny>I've hurt people.

680
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,390
<25-5,Danny>发现自己没死的时候
<25-5,Danny>And when I didn't die,

681
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,880
<25-5,Danny>我还以为
<25-5,Danny>I thought...

682
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,680
<25-5,Danny>我还以为上帝原谅了我
<25-5,Danny>I thought God forgave me.

683
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,740
<25-5,Danny>可他是要让我活着受苦
<25-5,Danny>But he just wanted me to suffer.

684
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,180
<25-5,Danny>我罪有应得
<25-5,Danny>And I deserve it.

685
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,740
<25-5,Danny>不
<25-5,Danny>No.

686
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,970
<25-6,Masters>你这不是罪有应得
<25-6,Masters>You don't deserve it.

687
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,510
<25-8,Danny>我
<25-8,Danny>I...

688
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,740
<25-7,Danny>我在大学里交过一个女朋友
<25-7,Danny>I had a girlfriend in college...

689
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,470
<25-7,Danny>我差点杀了她
<25-7,Danny>And I almost killed her.

690
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,370
<25-7,Danny>我失控了
<25-7,Danny>I just snapped.

691
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,240
<25-7,Danny>开始殴打她
<25-7,Danny>And I started hitting her.

692
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,120
<25-7,Danny>如果不是她室友碰巧回来
<25-7,Danny>And if her roommate hadn't come home...

693
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,490
<25-7,Danny>我有罪
<25-7,Danny>I'm evil.

694
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,810
<25-7,Danny>我跟我爸一样
<25-7,Danny>I am just like my dad.

695
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,020
<25-7,Danny>我们都是怪物  我该死
<25-7,Danny>We're both monsters. I deserve to die.

696
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,820
<25-8,Danny>我不能  不能
<25-8,Danny>I can't... I can't...

697
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,350
<25-8,Danny>我头晕
<25-8,Danny>I feel dizzy.

698
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,070
<25-9,Masters>这里需要急救车
<25-9,Masters>I need a crash cart in here!

699
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,920
<26-1,Masters>他心脏膨大  正在衰竭
<26-1,Masters>His heart is dilated and failing.

700
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,960
<26-2,Chase>照目前发展态势  他很快会需要心脏移植
<26-2,Chase>And at the rate it's happening, he'll need a new one soon.

701
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,960
<26-2,Chase>想让他上移植者名单门都没有
<26-2,Chase>And there's no way we'll get him on the transplant list.

702
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,480
<26-3,House>我们遗漏了什么
<26-3,House>What are we missing?

703
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,260
<26-4,Taub>什么都漏了  我们对这孩子一无所知
<26-4,Taub>Everything. We know nothing about this kid.

704
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,830
<26-5,Chase>只知道他入院以来病情不断恶化
<26-5,Chase>Except that he's gotten worse since we admitted him.

705
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,750
<26-6,House>为什么
<26-6,House>Why?

706
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,520
<26-7,Taub>大部分病人都是这样的
<26-7,Taub>Most of our patients tend to do that,

707
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,230
<26-7,Taub>除非被我们治愈
<26-7,Taub>unless we cure them.

708
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,790
<26-8,House>没错  但为什么如此之快
<26-8,House>Yeah, but why so fast?

709
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,360
<26-8,House>他嗅觉异常已经几个月了
<26-8,House>He had dysosmia for a couple months,

710
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,400
<26-8,House>从来没进医院治过
<26-8,House>never even came here to get it treated.

711
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,100
<26-8,House>不过是因为偶然烧伤入院
<26-8,House>He's just a random burn victim.

712
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,250
<26-8,House>我们一接诊
<26-8,House>We get him,

713
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,470
<26-8,House>就接二连三爆发管状视野
<26-8,House>boom, he's got tunnel vision,

714
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,450
<26-8,House>末梢多发性神经病变  小脑性共济失调
<26-8,House>peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia,

715
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,420
<26-8,House>现在又添了心肌病
<26-8,House>and now cardiomyopathy.

716
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,600
<26-8,House>医院到底有什么不一样呢
<26-8,House>What's different here than, say, living

717
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,780
<26-8,House>与肮脏的州立公园相比
<26-8,House>in a filthy state park?

718
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,240
<26-9,Foreman>你认为是洁净让他生病的
<26-9,Foreman>You think cleanliness is making him sick?

719
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,040
<26-10,Chase>过敏反应
<26-10,Chase>Allergic reaction?

720
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,940
<26-10,Chase>我们给他用了维科丁和氯氮平
<26-10,Chase>We treated him with vicodin, clozapine,

721
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,570
<26-10,Chase>静脉注射了一袋左旋多巴
<26-10,Chase>and one I.V. bag of levodopa.

722
