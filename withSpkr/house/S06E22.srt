<2-4,Cuddy>先生  我们得送你去手术室
<2-4,Cuddy>Sir, we have to get you to the O.R.

31
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,150
<2-9,Cuddy>或许是因为他的鞋子太紧
<2-9,Cuddy>Maybe his shoes were too tight.

32
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,190
<2-10,House>和鞋子无关  皮肤上有烟斑
<2-10,House>It's not the shoes. Skin shows smoker's facies.

49
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,880
<3-8,Jay>我睡着了  害死了所有那些人
<3-8,Jay>I fell asleep. Killed all those people.

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,080
<3-9,House>除了你良心受责备的痛
<3-9,House>Something other than your conscience.

51
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,440
<3-9,House>你口袋里是药片吗
<3-9,House>Is that a pill in your pocket,

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,090
<3-9,House>还是你碰巧长了个
<3-9,House>Or are you just happy to have

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,320
<3-9,House>袖珍药片状的鸡鸡
<3-9,House>a tiny pill-shaped penis?

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,190
<3-10,House>咖啡因片
<3-10,House>Caffeine pills.

55
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,160
<3-10,House>吃这些你还睡着了吗
<3-10,House>You fell asleep taking these?

56
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,100
<3-11,Jay>我还喝了两杯咖啡
<3-11,Jay>I drank two cups of coffee too.

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,340
<3-12,House>你平常就这样吗
<3-12,House>Is that normal for you?

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,380
<3-13,Jay>不  我讨厌咖啡

<3-13,Jay>我晚上没睡就出车了
<3-13,Jay>I'm working on no sleep.

60
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,010
<3-13,Jay>我女儿感冒了
<3-13,Jay>My daughter has the flu.

61

<3-14,House>那么多咖啡因对于一个不喝咖啡的人来说
<3-14,House>This much caffeine for a coffee virgin.

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,320
<3-14,House>他不可能睡着  他晕过去了
<3-14,House>There's no way he fell asleep. He passed out.

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,280
<3-14,House>因此是神经性失调
<3-14,House>Which means a neurological disorder

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,180
<3-14,House>导致了事故  而非疲劳

65
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,480
<3-14,House>嘿

<3-15,Cuddy>他们说他几乎没受伤  他可以等的
<3-15,Cuddy>They said he was barely hurt--he can wait.

<3-16,House>偷辆救护车  通知小组成员
<3-16,House>Steal an ambulance. And call the team.

<3-16,House>告诉他们我们有病例了
<3-16,House>Tell 'em we got a case.

<3-17,Cuddy>豪斯  不行  我需要你在这里
<3-17,Cuddy>House. No! I need you here.

71
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,160
<3-18,House>而他需要我在那里  他叫唤得比你厉害
<3-18,House>And he needs me there. And he moans louder than you do.

72
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,930
<3-19,Cuddy>那栋房子下压着一百多个人呢
<3-19,Cuddy>There were over 100 people in that building.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,730
<3-19,Cuddy>目前才找到七十六个
<3-19,Cuddy>Only 76 have been accounted for.

74
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,710
<3-19,Cuddy>福曼和你的组员可以暂时处理吊车操作员
<3-19,Cuddy>Foreman and your team can handle the crane operator for now.

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,830
<4-1,Wilson>那里有意思吗
<4-1,Wilson>Having fun down there?

76
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,840
<4-2,House>非常
<4-2,House>lots!

77
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,560
<4-2,House>每次卡迪俯身检查病人
<4-2,House>Every time cuddy leans over a patient,

78
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,350
<4-2,House>就是个看她春光乍泄的好机会
<4-2,House>it's another opportunity for a down blouse nip slip.

79
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,650
<4-2,House>她和卢卡斯怎么了
<4-2,House>What's going on between her and lucas?

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,120
<4-3,Wilson>除了他们要同居吗
<4-3,Wilson>Besides them moving in together?

81
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,270
<4-3,Wilson>对你而言还不够吗
<4-3,Wilson>That's not enough for you?

82
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,380
<4-4,House>我早些时候把祝贺乔迁的礼物给她了
<4-4,House>I gave her the housewarming gift earlier.

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,890
<4-4,House>她愣了一下
<4-4,House>And she paused for a split second,

84
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,700
<4-4,House>像是在隐瞒什么
<4-4,House>Like she was hiding something.

85
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,410
<4-5,Wilson>可能是她不喜欢
<4-5,Wilson>It's probably her moral revulsion

86
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,770
<4-5,Wilson>乔迁贺礼这套吧
<4-5,Wilson>at housewarming gifts.

87
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,790
<4-6,House>又或许她不想收下为了祝贺
<4-6,House>Or maybe she didn't want to accept a gift

88
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,470
<4-6,House>她不想做的事的贺礼
<4-6,House>for something she wasn't gonna do.

89
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,260
<4-7,Wilson>你真觉着他们不会同居吗
<4-7,Wilson>You actually think they're not moving in together?

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,980
<4-8,Wilson>什么声音  你没事吧
<4-8,Wilson>What was that? You okay?

91
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,870
<4-9,House>没事  自动售货机塌了
<4-9,House>Yep. Vending machine collapsed.

92
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,730
<4-10,House>你的前妻还是她的房产经纪人吗
<4-10,House>She still using your ex-wife as a realtor?

93
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,650
<4-11,Wilson>据我所知还是
<4-11,Wilson>As far as I know.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,230
<4-12,House>那么  就再深入点  行吗
<4-12,House>Well, know a little farther, will you?

95
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,310
<4-12,House>多挖点内幕
<4-12,House>Look into it.

96

<4-13,House>嘿

<5-3,House>我听到了  下面肯定有空隙
<5-3,House>I heard something--there's gotta be a void down there.

<5-4,Captain McCreaney>这下面有无数个空隙呢
<5-4,Captain McCreaney>There's a million voids down there.

104
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,510
<5-4,Captain McCreaney>那是个停车场
<5-4,Captain McCreaney>It was the parking garage.

105
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,550
<5-4,Captain McCreaney>但是仪器没有探测到任何动静
<5-4,Captain McCreaney>But equipment hasn't picked up any movement.

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
<5-5,House>下面有被压扁的车
<5-5,House>There's smashed cars down there.

108
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,780

<8-3,House>我无意干涉

213
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,620
<8-6,House>那你为什么怪怪的
<8-6,House>So why the weirdness?

214
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,020
<8-6,House>帮个忙好吗
<8-6,House>Can you help?

215
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,800
<8-7,Cuddy>我翻开书时
<8-7,Cuddy>When I opened it,

216
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,080
<8-7,Cuddy>我想的不是乔迁贺礼
<8-7,Cuddy>I didn't think it was a housewarming gift.

217
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,960
<8-7,Cuddy>而是订婚礼物
<8-7,Cuddy>I thought it was an engagement present.

218
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,830
<8-7,Cuddy>我们昨晚订婚的
<8-7,Cuddy>It just happened last night.

219
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,210
<8-8,House>怪不得你在我面前遮遮掩掩
<8-8,House>No wonder you wanna hide this from me...

220
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,640
<8-8,House>怕伤害我这棵娇弱的花朵
<8-8,House>Since I'm such a delicate flower.

221
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,130
<8-9,Cuddy>我不知该怎么说
<8-9,Cuddy>I didn't know what to say.

222
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,080
<8-9,Cuddy>而且正好这里的事要我操心
<8-9,Cuddy>And I've been slightly distracted.

223
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,430
<8-10,House>还算说得通
<8-10,House>That might make sense,

224
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,820
<8-10,House>只是你没戴戒指
<8-10,House>'cept you're not wearing the ring.

225
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,960
<8-10,House>所以呢  你还是在遮掩
<8-10,House>So...you are hiding it,

226
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,600
<8-10,House>因此我必须要问...
<8-10,House>which begs the question...

227
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,150
<8-11,Cuddy>豪斯  戒指在我办公室抽屉里
<8-11,Cuddy>House...it's in my office drawer

228
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,350
<8-11,Cuddy>我知道要到这来所以摘了
<8-11,Cuddy>because I knew I was coming here.

229
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,990
<8-11,Cuddy>没什么怪的
<8-11,Cuddy>It's not weird.

230
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,800
<8-11,Cuddy>没什么隐情
<8-11,Cuddy>There's no mystery.

231
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,610
<8-11,Cuddy>只是我要结婚了
<8-11,Cuddy>I'm just getting married.

232
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,770
<8-11,Cuddy>抱歉打扰一下
<8-11,Cuddy>Excuse me.

233
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,940
<9-1,Jay>还有多长时间
<9-1,Jay>How much longer?

234
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,590
<9-2,Taub>不到一分钟
<9-2,Taub>Uh, less than a minute.

235
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,050
<9-2,Taub>你疼吗
<9-2,Taub>Are you in any pain?

236
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,140
<9-3,Jay>现在不疼  只是有点幽闭空间恐惧
<9-3,Jay>Nothing now. Just a little claustrophobic.

237
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,860
<9-3,Jay>难道你们不去救治那些
<9-3,Jay>Shouldn't you be taking care of those other people,

238
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,210
<9-3,Jay>因我受伤的人吗
<9-3,Jay>the ones that I hurt?

239
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,400
<9-4,Chase>检查完毕  各项正常
<9-4,Chase>Everything checks out okay.

240
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,980
<9-5,Jay>我流鼻血了
<9-5,Jay>My nose is bleeding.

241
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,060
<9-6,Chase>应该的  因为你受了外伤
<9-6,Chase>It's expected, given the trauma you've sustained.

242
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,570
<9-7,Taub>这就不应该了
<9-7,Taub>That's not expected.

243
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,050
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>发生倒塌后  是这条主梁
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>The way things fell, this support beam

244
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,870
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>撑起这一大堆碎石
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>is now holding up a giant pile of rubble.

245
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,780
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>我们不能保证搬走它  下面的人不会砸伤
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>We can't lift it without jeopardizing everyone down here.

246
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,890
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>所以是时候讨论截肢了
<10-1,Captain McCreaney>So it's time to discuss amputation.

247
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,410
<10-2,Hanna>不
<10-2,Hanna>No.

248
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,730
<10-3,Cuddy>请听我说
<10-3,Cuddy>Please listen to me.

249
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,250
<10-3,Cuddy>我们已经在这下面待了近两小时
<10-3,Cuddy>We've been down here almost two hours.

250
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,440
<10-3,Cuddy>他们清理乱石的这段时间...
<10-3,Cuddy>By the time they clear away the rubble--

251
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,730
<10-4,House>我们不截她的肢
<10-4,House>We are not cutting off her leg.

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,960
<10-4,House>你不必为了能让他工作轻松些
<10-4,House>You don't have to rush through this

253
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,460
<10-4,House>而仓促截肢
<10-4,House>to make his job easier.

254
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,400
<10-5,Captain McCreaney>你开玩笑的吧
<10-5,Captain McCreaney>You kidding me?

255
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,280
<10-6,Cuddy>腿一直被压着  会有挤压综合症的危险
<10-6,Cuddy>We leave the leg pinned, we're risking crush syndrome.

256
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,180
<10-7,Hanna>那是什么
<10-7,Hanna>What's that?

257
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,480
<10-8,Cuddy>你腿部血液循环不足
<10-8,Cuddy>Your leg isn't getting enough circulation.

258
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,780
<10-8,Cuddy>被压时间越长  肌肉坏死越多
<10-8,Cuddy>The longer it's pinned the more the muscle dies.

259
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,330
<10-9,Hanna>那是什么意思  我会瘸吗
<10-9,Hanna>So what does that mean, like a limp?

260
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,580
<10-10,Cuddy>坏死肌肉会释放毒素
<10-10,Cuddy>Dying muscles release poisons.

261
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,390
<10-10,Cuddy>我们松开你的腿后
<10-10,Cuddy>We free your leg,

262
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,040
<10-10,Cuddy>毒素会随血液回流进入身体系统
<10-10,Cuddy>the poisons rush back into your system.

263
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,310
<10-10,Cuddy>会让你心跳停止
<10-10,Cuddy>It could stop your heart.

264
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,680
<10-11,House>芝士汉堡也有这个隐患
<10-11,House>So could cheeseburgers.

265
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,450
<10-11,House>还是让你的懒弟兄们动手搬碎石吧
<10-11,House>Let's get your lazy friends to start moving that pile.

266
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,590
<10-11,House>起码两小时后才会出现挤压综合症
<10-11,House>She's got two more hours before crush syndrome

267
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,070
<10-11,House>她还有时间
<10-11,House>could possibly set in.

268
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,450
<10-12,Captain McCreaney>我们是徒手挖的
<10-12,Captain McCreaney>We're digging up there by hand.

269
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,430
<10-12,Captain McCreaney>我不能保证两小时内
<10-12,Captain McCreaney>I can't guarantee I can get 10 tons of debris

270
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,560
<10-12,Captain McCreaney>能搬走十吨碎石
<10-12,Captain McCreaney>pulled off in two hours.

271
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,970
<10-13,Hanna>你得试试
<10-13,Hanna>Well, you need to try.

272
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,290
<10-13,Hanna>那是我的腿
<10-13,Hanna>It's my leg.

273
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,790
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>现在不光要担心挤压综合症
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>It's not just crush syndrome you gotta worry about, okay?

274
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,200
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>还有煤气泄漏的危险  会着火的
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>There's gas leaks. There's fire.

275
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,780
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>无论我们把这里支撑的多稳固
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>We can never rule out secondary collapses,

276
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,340
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>也不能排除二次倒塌的可能性
<10-14,Captain McCreaney>no matter how much we shore this thing up.

277
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,820
<10-15,House>你以为在一大片肮脏的碎石堆里
<10-15,House>You think chopping off someone's limb

278
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,810
<10-15,House>给人截肢就很安全吗
<10-15,House>inside a pile of dirty rocks is safe?

279
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,840
<10-15,House>败血症  脂肪栓塞  大出血
<10-15,House>Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.

280
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,390
<10-16,Captain McCreaney>这些危险和二次倒塌发生的危险
<10-16,Captain McCreaney>Those risks are nothing compared to the risk

281
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,000
<10-16,Captain McCreaney>不可同日而语
<10-16,Captain McCreaney>of this thing coming down again.

282
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,280
<10-17,Cuddy>长官  他是个混蛋
<10-17,Cuddy>Captain, he's a jerk.

283
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,860
<10-17,Cuddy>但是病人希望这样
<10-17,Cuddy>But it's what the patient wants.

284
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,400
<10-17,Cuddy>能请你们再
<10-17,Cuddy>Can we please just

285
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,960
<10-17,Cuddy>坚持个把小时吗
<10-17,Cuddy>give it a couple more hours?

286
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,610
<10-18,Captain McCreaney>好吧
<10-18,Captain McCreaney>Yeah.

287
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,150
<10-19,Cuddy>我去上面给伤员鉴伤分类
<10-19,Cuddy>I gotta get up to triage.

288
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,960
<10-20,Hanna>谢谢你  医生
<10-20,Hanna>Thank you, doctor.

289
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,120
<10-20,Hanna>豪斯
<10-20,Hanna>House.

290
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,930
<10-21,House>不用谢我
<10-21,House>You don't need to thank me.

291
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,770
<10-21,House>我只是讲讲道理罢了
<10-21,House>Just makes sense.

292
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,960
<10-22,Hanna>请保证你不会让他们给我截肢
<10-22,Hanna>Just promise me you won't let them cut off my leg.

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,140
<10-23,House>我保证
<10-23,House>I promise.

294
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,210
<10-23,House>这样你感觉好点了吗
<10-23,House>Does that make you feel better?

295
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,140
<10-24,Hanna>不知怎么的  真的好多了
<10-24,Hanna>For some reason, it does.

296
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,700
<10-25,Hanna>你的电话能用了
<10-25,Hanna>Your phone is working down here.

297
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,270
<10-26,House>换了服务商  累积免话费更久
<10-26,House>Switched carriers. Better rollover minutes.

298
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,180
<10-26,House>说话
<10-26,House>Talk.

299
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,690
<10-27,Foreman>磁共振成像显示没问题  但是
<10-27,Foreman>MRI was clean, but afterwards,

300
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,880
<10-27,Foreman>他的眼和鼻开始流血
<10-27,Foreman>He started bleeding out of his eyes and nose.

301
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,150
<10-28,House>所以确实他在昏倒前就得了病
<10-28,House>So there was something wrong before the collapse.

302
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,890
<10-29,Taub>除非只是创伤引起的凝血功能不全
<10-29,Taub>Unless it's just conjunctive coagulopathy from the trauma.

303
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,690
<10-30,House>是  是  是  你认为他之前没病
<10-30,House>Yeah, yeah, yeah--you don't think he was sick before.

304
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,510
<10-30,House>我们懂了  但你错了
<10-30,House>We get it! You're wrong.

305
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,910
<10-31,Chase>是大脑感染吗
<10-31,Chase>Brain infection?

306
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,250
<10-32,Thirteen>对不起  我迟到了
<10-32,Thirteen>Sorry I'm late.

307
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,880
<10-33,House>-你去哪了  -做理疗
<10-33,House>- Where were you? - Physical therapy.

308
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,290
<10-34,Thirteen>我电话落在柜子里了
<10-34,Thirteen>I left my phone in my locker.

309
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,440
<10-35,Chase>感染引起了神经症状
<10-35,Chase>The infection causes neurological symptoms,

310
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,600
<10-35,Chase>遍及全身  弥散性血管内凝血造成出血
<10-35,Chase>goes systemic, and D.I.C. causes the bleed.

311
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,530
<10-36,House>不错的理论
<10-36,House>Good theory.

312
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,360
<10-36,House>可惜他没发烧
<10-36,House>Except for the part that there's no fever.

313
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,910
<10-36,House>给他做x光静脉造影
<10-36,House>Get an x-ray venogram.

314
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,210
<10-36,House>看看能不能找出你存在的理由
<10-36,House>See if you can find a reason for your existence.

315
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,130
<10-36,House>顺便看看有没有静脉窦血栓
<10-36,House>Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.

316
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,730
<10-37,Foreman>有的话做磁共振时就该看出来
<10-37,Foreman>Would have seen it on the mri.

317
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,950
<10-38,House>可能是你们忙得没找着吧
<10-38,House>Not if you were too busy not looking for it.

318
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,140
<10-39,Thirteen>我们应该先用x光看看有无脸部骨折
<10-39,Thirteen>We should x-ray for a facial fracture first.

319
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,710
<10-39,Thirteen>很可能是简单的外伤造成的
<10-39,Thirteen>This could all be simple trauma.

320
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,120
<10-40,House>照我说的做
<10-40,House>Just do what I tell you.

321
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,040
<10-40,House>十分钟后回来
<10-40,House>Be back in ten minutes.

322
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,600
<10-41,Hanna>你要走吗
<10-41,Hanna>You're leaving?

323
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,570
<10-42,House>这里有很多人都能救你
<10-42,House>There's a dozen people here who can save you.

324
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,040
<10-42,House>而显然我是唯一能救那家伙的人
<10-42,House>I'm apparently the only one who can save this other guy.

325
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,890
<10-43,Hanna>等等
<10-43,Hanna>W-wait!

326
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,400
<10-43,Hanna>别走
<10-43,Hanna>Don't go.

327
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,100
<11-1,Cuddy>汉娜快崩溃了
<11-1,Cuddy>Hanna's freaking out.

328
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,050
<11-1,Cuddy>她恐慌症发作
<11-1,Cuddy>She's having a panic attack.

329
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,930
<11-1,Cuddy>不能呼吸  要拔掉所有输液管
<11-1,Cuddy>She can't breathe. She's gonna rip out all her IVs.

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,300
<11-2,House>那让她安静下来
<11-2,House>So calm her down.

331
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,980
<11-3,Cuddy>她想让你在身边
<11-3,Cuddy>She wants you.

332
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
<11-4,House>受宠若惊啊  给她输氧气
<11-4,House>I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.

333
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,330
<11-5,Cuddy>他们不会把氧气送下去的
<11-5,Cuddy>They won't let O2 down there.

334
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,780
<11-5,Cuddy>怕爆炸
<11-5,Cuddy>Fear of explosion.

335
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,540
<11-5,Cuddy>你得回去
<11-5,Cuddy>You have to go back.

336
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,630
<11-5,Cuddy>她需要你  豪斯
<11-5,Cuddy>She needs you, house.

337
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,070
<11-6,Hanna>你回来只是因为我快要崩溃了
<11-6,Hanna>You only came back because I freaked out.

338
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,350
<11-6,Hanna>对吗
<11-6,Hanna>Right?

339
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,460
<11-7,House>不是的
<11-7,House>Oh, no.

340
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,260
<11-7,House>我只是发觉...
<11-7,House>I just realized how...

341
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,380
<11-7,House>外面的世界是那么混乱而恐怖
<11-7,House>big and scary the world is

342
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,970
<11-7,House>而这个小地方又是多么的惬意而安全
<11-7,House>and how cozy and safe this little place is.

343
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,040
<11-7,House>谢谢你
<11-7,House>Thank you.

344
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,490
<11-8,Hanna>抱歉我真的需要你
<11-8,Hanna>I'm sorry I needed you.

345
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,030
<11-9,House>给你  打个电话给你老公
<11-9,House>Here. Call your husband.

346
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,550
<11-10,Hanna>是查理吗
<11-10,Hanna>Charlie?

347
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,160
<11-10,Hanna>我现在在...
<11-10,Hanna>I'm here in...

348
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,440
<11-10,Hanna>他们打电话给你了吗
<11-10,Hanna>They called you?

349
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,620
<11-10,Hanna>他们正在救我
<11-10,Hanna>They're helping me.

350
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
<11-10,Hanna>你要来吗
<11-10,Hanna>Are you coming?

351
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,930
<11-10,Hanna>我不知道为什么会发生这样的事
<11-10,Hanna>I don't know how this could happen.

352
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,610
<11-10,Hanna>今天是你的生日  对不起
<11-10,Hanna>It's your birthday. I'm so sorry.

353
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,540
<11-11,House>看吧  这就是为什么我骗你手机不好用
<11-11,House>See? This is why I lied about the phone.

354
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
<11-11,House>你的血压正在升高
<11-11,House>Your bp is spiking,

355
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,600
<11-11,House>这会使你腿部的伤口出血速度加快
<11-11,House>So you're bleeding faster from your leg wound.

356
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,060
<11-11,House>我救治的时间变短
<11-11,House>I'm gonna have less time to save it.

357
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,980
<11-11,House>挂电话吧
<11-11,House>Hang up.

358
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,140
<11-12,Hanna>好了  好了  我必须挂掉了
<11-12,Hanna>Okay. Okay, they're telling me I have to go.

359
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,390
<11-13,House>我太蠢了  不该让你打电话的
<11-13,House>That was stupid of me.

360
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,850
<11-14,Hanna>你是好人
<11-14,Hanna>It was nice.

361
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,300
<11-15,House>我可看不出好人是对蠢人的辩驳
<11-15,House>I don't see that as a contradiction.

362
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,830
<11-16,Hanna>他已经在来的路上了
<11-16,Hanna>He was already on his way.

363
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,480
<11-16,Hanna>他本来在巴尔的摩
<11-16,Hanna>He was in Baltimore,

364
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,120
<11-16,Hanna>后来他们都从新闻获知了这里的事故
<11-16,Hanna>and they all saw it on the news.

365
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,900
<11-16,Hanna>有多少人受伤了
<11-16,Hanna>How many people were hurt?

366
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,850
<11-17,House>我才说了不能让你的血压上升
<11-17,House>What did I tell you about not raising your blood pressure?

367
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,350
<11-18,Hanna>我能问问你的腿怎么了吗
<11-18,Hanna>Can I ask what's wrong with your leg?

368
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,760
<11-19,House>吊车倒在上面了
<11-19,House>Crane fell on it.

369
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,470
<11-19,House>无巧不成书
<11-19,House>Small world.

370
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,210
<11-20,Hanna>你可以只说不想回答
<11-20,Hanna>You could have just said no.

371
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,230
<11-21,House>下一次与人交流时  我会记得的
<11-21,House>I'll remember that for my next human contact.

372
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,250
<11-22,Hanna>和我一起祈祷好吗
<11-22,Hanna>Would you pray with me?

373
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,960
<11-22,Hanna>不
<11-22,Hanna>No.

374
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,900
<11-23,House>我不习惯于鼓励
<11-23,House>I'm not in the habit of encouraging

375
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,420
<11-23,House>我的病人搞迷信
<11-23,House>my patients' superstitions.

376
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,100
<11-24,Hanna>这叫什么习惯
<11-24,Hanna>How is that a habit?

377
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,210
<11-24,Hanna>你还想再被困在倒塌的大楼下吗
<11-24,Hanna>You plan on getting trapped under a building again?

378
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,720
<11-25,House>我不崇拜上帝
<11-25,House>I don't believe in god.

379
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,520
<11-26,Hanna>我也不
<11-26,Hanna>I don't either.

380
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
<11-26,Hanna>求你了
<11-26,Hanna>Please?

381
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,990
<11-27,Hanna>我总觉得...
<11-27,Hanna>I always thought...

382
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,890
<11-27,Hanna>如果我好好做人
<11-27,Hanna>if I did the right thing,

383
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
<11-27,Hanna>与人为善
<11-27,Hanna>if I treated people right,

384
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,200
<11-27,Hanna>我就能有好报
<11-27,Hanna>then good things would happen to me.

385
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,210
<11-27,Hanna>你觉得对吗
<11-27,Hanna>You think that's how it works?

386
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,040
<11-28,House>我原来不觉得
<11-28,House>I didn't use to.

387
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,470
<11-28,House>最近我试了试...
<11-28,House>Then recently I tried...

455
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,020
<14-8,House>因为他哪里都疼
<14-8,House>That's 'cause everything's sore.

<14-8,House>他刚刚做了一个十五层高的燕式跳水

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,410
<14-9,Taub>我们也得考虑其他感染
<14-9,Taub>We also have to consider other infections.

459
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,850
<14-10,House>所以你在建议我们做个腰椎穿刺
<14-10,House>So you're suggesting we do an LP?

460
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,190
<14-11,Taub>我想是的

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,270
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>坍塌的缘故
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>Because of the collapse,

464
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,710
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>让我们不能再试用气袋抬横梁的办法了
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>we can't try the airbag again

465
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,980
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>除非把上面的所有东西清除干净
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>until we get everything off the top.

466
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,730
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>那至少要五六个小时
<14-13,Captain McCreaney>Be five, six hours at least.

467
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,060
<14-14,Cuddy>那必须截肢了
<14-14,Cuddy>Then we have to amputate.

468
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,510
<14-15,House>不行
<14-15,House>No.

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,090
<14-16,Cuddy>已经四个小时了
<14-16,Cuddy>It's been four hours already.

470
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,730
<14-16,Cuddy>本来就希望渺小  现在  更加是妄想
<14-16,Cuddy>It used to be a long shot. Now it's...crazy.

471
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,480
<14-17,House>挤压综合症基本上就是钾元素堆积
<14-17,House>Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium.

472
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,320
<14-17,House>若我们把钾去除
<14-17,House>If we remove potassium--

473
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,850
<14-18,Cuddy>不是已经给她输过碳酸氢钠了吗
<14-18,Cuddy>We're already treating with sodium bicarbonate.

474
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,590
<14-19,House>但没加注葡萄糖和胰岛素
<14-19,House>But not with glucose and insulin.

475
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,890
<14-19,House>急救包里有葡萄糖
<14-19,House>We have glucose in the kit.

476
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,770
<14-19,House>这里肯定有糖尿病患者
<14-19,House>There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.

477
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,970
<14-20,Cuddy>你想在这种非医疗环境下
<14-20,Cuddy>You wanna dose the insulin

478
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,220
<14-20,Cuddy>给她用胰岛素
<14-20,Cuddy>here in a non-hospital setting?

479
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,530
<14-20,Cuddy>简直是疯了  不值得
<14-20,Cuddy>That is insane! It's not worth it.

480
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,380
<14-20,Cuddy>是吗  我发现这里
<14-20,Cuddy>Really? 'cause I think

481
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,960
<14-21,House>只有我才知道一条腿是多么重要
<14-21,House>I'm the only one here who knows what a leg is worth.

482
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,640
<14-21,House>幸好  你不是负责人  他才是
<14-21,House>And fortunately, you're not the one in charge--he is.

483
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,340
<14-21,House>他清楚  若汉娜到时候告他没有
<14-21,House>And he knows that I'd testify against him

484
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,680
<14-21,House>尝试所有办法就截掉了她的腿
<14-21,House>if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg

485
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,020
<14-21,House>我会做出对他不利的证明
<14-21,House>without exhausting every option.

486
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,460
<14-22,Cuddy>让我们单独谈一下
<14-22,Cuddy>Give us a minute?

487
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,240
<14-23,Cuddy>我知道你在生气
<14-23,Cuddy>I know you're angry,

488
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,270
<14-23,Cuddy>但请你不要为了报复我
<14-23,Cuddy>But please don't put her life at risk

489
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,740
<14-23,Cuddy>而拿她的生命开玩笑
<14-23,Cuddy>just to get back at me.

490
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,980
<14-24,House>是吗
<14-24,House>Really?

491
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,890
<14-24,House>原来一切都围绕着你
<14-24,House>So this is all about you now.

492
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,370
<14-25,Cuddy>一听说我订婚的事后
<14-25,Cuddy>You took her side against me

493
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,070
<14-25,Cuddy>你就和她站一边  跟我作对
<14-25,Cuddy>right after you heard about my engagement.

494
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,690
<14-26,House>是啊  肯定是这个原因了
<14-26,House>Yeah. That must be it.

495
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,250
<14-26,House>你又不是个可怜的自恋狂
<14-26,House>It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.

496
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,530
<14-26,House>我不爱你
<14-26,House>I don't love you.

497
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,320
<14-27,Cuddy>请你  接受现实
<14-27,Cuddy>So just...accept it

498
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,620
<14-27,Cuddy>继续自己的生活
<14-27,Cuddy>and move on with your life

499
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,170
<14-27,Cuddy>别再让其他人痛苦了
<14-27,Cuddy>instead of making everyone miserable.

500
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,800
<14-28,House>太精彩了
<14-28,House>That's great.

501
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,950
<14-28,House>一个和幼稚男恋爱的中年单身母亲
<14-28,House>A life lesson from a middle-aged single mom

502
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,320
<14-28,House>给我讲人生哲学
<14-28,House>who's dating a man-child.

503
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,630
<14-29,Cuddy>去你的
<14-29,Cuddy>Screw you.

504
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,930
<14-29,Cuddy>我厌倦了替你找借口
<14-29,Cuddy>I'm sick of making excuses for you.

505
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,310
<14-29,Cuddy>厌倦了别人得捧着你  顺着你
<14-29,Cuddy>I'm sick of other people having to tiptoe around you

506
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,690
<14-29,Cuddy>为了让你好好活着
<14-29,Cuddy>and make their own lives worse

507
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,380
<14-29,Cuddy>而把自己的生活搞得一团糟
<14-29,Cuddy>while they try to keep you from collapsing.

508
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,260
<14-29,Cuddy>我说完了
<14-29,Cuddy>I'm done.

509
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,790
<14-30,House>精彩极了
<14-30,House>Fantastic.

510
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,310
<14-30,House>离我的病人远点
<14-30,House>Just stay away from my patient.

511
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,220
<14-31,Cuddy>你到底想怎么样  豪斯
<14-31,Cuddy>What are you clinging to, House?

512
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,070
<14-31,Cuddy>为了保全腿而不顾她的生命安危吗
<14-31,Cuddy>You're gonna risk her life just to save her leg?

513
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,350
<14-31,Cuddy>就像你当年的选择很明智  是不是
<14-31,Cuddy>Really worked out well for you, didn't it?

514
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,980
<14-31,Cuddy>说真的  你的人生都得到了些什么
<14-31,Cuddy>What do you have in your life, honestly?

515
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,700
<14-31,Cuddy>跟我说说
<14-31,Cuddy>Tell me.

516
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,200
<14-31,Cuddy>我在向前进
<14-31,Cuddy>I'm moving on.

517
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,250
<14-31,Cuddy>威尔森也在向前进
<14-31,Cuddy>Wilson is moving on.

518
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,450
<14-31,Cuddy>而你  你一无所有  豪斯
<14-31,Cuddy>And you...you've got nothing, House.

519
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,430
<14-31,Cuddy>一无所有
<14-31,Cuddy>Nothing.

520
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,480
<14-31,Cuddy>我现在要下去
<14-31,Cuddy>I'm going down there,

521
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,320
<14-31,Cuddy>劝服她截掉腿
<14-31,Cuddy>and I'm gonna convince her to let me cut her leg off.

522
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,860
<14-31,Cuddy>若你还有点良知的话  就别再插手
<14-31,Cuddy>If you have any decency left, you'll just stay out of it.

523
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,190
<14-31,Cuddy>不
<14-31,Cuddy>No.

524
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,750
<15-1,Hanna>豪斯医生允诺过的
<15-1,Hanna>Dr. House promised.

525
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,600
<15-2,Cuddy>若有其它办法的话
<15-2,Cuddy>If there was any other way...

526
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,780
<15-3,Hanna>现在不疼了  我能等
<15-3,Hanna>It doesn't hurt right now. I can wait.

527
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,690
<15-1,Hanna>豪斯医生
<15-1,Hanna>Dr. House.

528
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,920
<15-4,Hanna>你告诉她
<15-4,Hanna>Tell her.

529
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,910
<15-4,Hanna>汉娜
<15-4,Hanna>Hanna...

530
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,660
<15-5,House>我们不得不截掉你的腿
<15-5,House>We have to amputate your leg.

531
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,860
<15-5,House>不
<15-5,House>No.

532
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,370
<15-6,Hanna>你说了  还有时间的
<15-6,Hanna>You said... that there was time.

533
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,050
<15-7,House>之前是有  但现在已经到时候了
<15-7,House>There was. And it's run out.

534
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,110
<15-8,Hanna>不
<15-8,Hanna>No.

535
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,090
<15-9,House>你问我是怎么伤了腿的
<15-9,House>You asked me how I'd hurt my leg.

536
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,080
<15-9,House>那里面有个血块  肌肉在坏死
<15-9,House>I had a blood clot, and the muscle was dying.

537
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,590
<15-9,House>所有的医生都劝我截肢
<15-9,House>And I had all these doctors telling me I should amputate,

538
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,130
<15-9,House>我拒绝了  他们就做了个
<15-9,House>and I said no, and they did this...

539
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,410
<15-9,House>风险很大的手术
<15-9,House>very risky operation.

540
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,650
<15-9,House>我差点死了
<15-9,House>I almost died.

541
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,430
<15-10,Hanna>但你保住了腿
<15-10,Hanna>But you saved your leg.

542
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,710
<15-11,House>我希望当初没有
<15-11,House>I wish I hadn't.

543
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,530
<15-12,House>他们切除了拳头大的一块肌肉
<15-12,House>They cut out a chunk of muscle about the size of my fist,

544
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,040
<15-12,House>留给我这么个残缺
<15-12,House>and they left me with this mutilated,

545
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,220
<15-12,House>没用的东西
<15-12,House>useless thing.

546
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,210
<15-12,House>我要忍受疼痛  每天都是
<15-12,House>I'm in pain...every day.

547
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,820
<15-12,House>这改变了我
<15-12,House>It changed me.

548
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,240
<15-12,House>让我成为了一个更无情的人
<15-12,House>Made me a harder person,

549
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,710
<15-12,House>一个更糟糕的人
<15-12,House>a worse person.

550
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,990
<15-12,House>结果现在
<15-12,House>And now...

551
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,210
<15-12,House>我孤身一人
<15-12,House>now I'm alone.

552
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,420
<15-12,House>你不会想要像我一样的
<15-12,House>You don't want to be like me.

553
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,860
<15-12,House>你有个爱你的丈夫
<15-12,House>You got a husband who loves you.

554
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,840
<15-12,House>你有朋友  还可以生儿育女
<15-12,House>You have friends. You can start a family.

555
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,520
<15-12,House>你有自己的生活
<15-12,House>You have a life.

556
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,610
<15-12,House>而这个  只是条腿而已
<15-12,House>And this... this is just a leg.

557
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,130
<15-13,Hanna>好吧
<15-13,Hanna>Okay.

558
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,150
<15-14,House>我来吧
<15-14,House>I got it.

559
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,310
<16-1,House>我不能用麻药让你昏迷
<16-1,House>I can't put you out.

560
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,880
<16-1,House>那会严重抑制你的呼吸
<16-1,House>It could depress your respiration too much.

561
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,110
<16-1,House>这个能稍微减轻疼痛
<16-1,House>This should take away some of the pain.

562
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,250
<16-2,Hanna>会很快吗
<16-2,Hanna>Will it be quick?

563
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,030
<16-3,House>我要用手术刀切开表皮
<16-3,House>I'll use a scalpel to slice through the skin,

564
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,450
<16-3,House>肌肉  还有脂肪
<16-3,House>muscle, and fat.

565
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,300
<16-3,House>这一步应该很快
<16-3,House>That should go pretty fast.

566
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,800
<16-3,House>到达骨头的时候
<16-3,House>Then I'll switch over to the electric saw

567
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,200
<16-3,House>再用电锯
<16-3,House>when I get to the bone.

568
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
<16-3,House>有两根骨头  大概有扫帚把那么粗
<16-3,House>It's two bones... about as thick as a broomstick.

569
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,190
<16-3,House>锯断才能停下
<16-3,House>Takes about as long to get through.

570
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,040
<16-3,House>我会尽量贴紧水泥块切
<16-3,House>I'm gonna cut as close to the concrete as I can,

571
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,590
<16-3,House>尽可能多的保住腿
<16-3,House>save as much of your limb as possible.

572
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,600
<16-3,House>回到医院再做整形手术
<16-3,House>Then the orthopedic surgeons back at the hospital

573
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,480
<16-3,House>进行清理  给你装个假肢
<16-3,House>will clean you up, have you fitted for a prosthetic.

574
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,660
<16-3,House>你马上就能围着我转圈圈了
<16-3,House>You'll be running circles around me in no time.

575
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,430
<16-4,Hanna>会有多疼
<16-4,Hanna>How bad will it hurt?

576
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,010
<16-5,House>是你从未经历过的剧痛
<16-5,House>Like nothing you've ever felt before.

577
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,160
<16-5,House>汉娜
<16-5,House>Hanna.

578
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,860
<17-1,Charlie>哦  宝贝
<17-1,Charlie>Oh...baby.

579
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,670
<17-2,Hanna>我很抱歉
<17-2,Hanna>I'm so sorry.

580
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,210
<17-4,Hanna>-别再说了  -你那么爱我的腿
<17-4,Hanna>- Shut up.  - You always loved my legs.

581
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,260
<17-5,Charlie>我不在乎你的腿
<17-5,Charlie>I don't care about your legs.

582
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,240
<17-5,Charlie>宝贝  我爱你
<17-5,Charlie>Baby, I love you.

583
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,880
<17-6,Hanna>我爱的是你
<17-6,Hanna>I love you.

584
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,150
<17-6,Hanna>我爱你
<17-6,Hanna>I love you.

585
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,890
<17-7,House>怎么了
<17-7,House>What?

586
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,200
<17-8,Foreman>他昏迷了
<17-8,Foreman>He's fallen into a coma.

587
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,450
<17-8,Foreman>脊髓液正常  但是
<17-8,Foreman>LP was clean, but...

588
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,590
<17-9,House>各项生命体征多少
<17-9,House>What are his vitals?

589
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,340
<17-10,Taub>让一下警官
<17-10,Taub>Excuse me, officer.

590
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,480
<17-11,House>什么警官
<17-11,House>What do you mean, officer?

591
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,000
<17-11,House>条子什么时候去的
<17-11,House>How long has there been a cop there?

592
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,600
<17-12,Thirteen>记不清了  大约十分钟前吧
<17-12,Thirteen>I don't know. Ten minutes.

593
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,680
<17-12,Thirteen>他再接受询问的时候昏迷的
<17-12,Thirteen>He was being questioned when he fell into the coma.

594
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,440
<17-13,House>在他出现其他症状前
<17-13,House>Was anything else making him nervous

595
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,980
<17-13,House>还有别的事情让他紧张焦虑吗
<17-13,House>or worried before his other symptoms?

596
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,410
<17-14,Taub>内出血和发烧之前
<17-14,Taub>He was claustrophobic right

597
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,020
<17-14,Taub>他出现幽闭恐怖症症状
<17-14,Taub>before the bleed and before the fever.

598
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,630
<17-14,Taub>我们告诉他他可能是睡着了
<17-14,Taub>We told him that he probably did fall asleep.

599
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,660
<17-15,House>血压升高了吗
<17-15,House>Was his BP spiking?

600
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,610
<17-16,Foreman>是  但不是他第一个症状出现的原因
<17-16,Foreman>But that didn't cause his first symptom.

601
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,490
<17-17,House>就是  都是咖啡因惹的祸
<17-17,House>Yeah, it did. All the caffeine.

602
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,190
<17-17,House>我们原以为他的问题在他的厕所那
<17-17,House>We thought the problem was in his toilet--

603
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,770
<17-17,House>当然  我的意思是  他的头
<17-17,House>By that, of course, I mean his head.

604
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,440
<17-17,House>这让我们关注错了焦点
<17-17,House>Which distracted us from the fact

605
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,660
<17-17,House>其实就是他的下水道堵住了
<17-17,House>that it could have been just a clog in his sewer pipe,

606
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,270
<17-17,House>下水道就是指他的脊髓
<17-17,House>and by that, of course, I mean his spinal cord.

607
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,410
<17-17,House>还有一堆理所当然的事情  你们懂的
<17-17,House>And blah, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea.

608
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,020
<17-18,Chase>一个蛛网状囊肿长在他的下部脊椎上
<17-18,Chase>An arachnoid cyst on his lower spine.

609
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,490
<17-18,Chase>所以我们没发现
<17-18,Chase>That's why we missed it.

610
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,830
<17-18,Chase>他足足坐了十个小时
<17-18,Chase>He's been sitting ten hours a day.

611
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,560
<17-18,Chase>使得他的脊髓液压飙升
<17-18,Chase>Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.

612
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,080
<17-19,House>给他做个CT
<17-19,House>Run a CT--

613
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,190
<17-20,EMT>高压72  低压42  汉娜
<17-20,EMT>BP's 72 over 42. Hanna?

614
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,540
<17-22,EMT>-汉娜  -我喘不上气来
<17-22,EMT>- Hanna?  - I can't breathe.

615
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,580
<17-23,Hanna>我喘不上气来
<17-23,Hanna>I can't breathe.

616
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,610
<17-24,House>双肺呼吸顺畅  不是气胸
<17-24,House>Breath sounds bilaterally. It's not another pneumothorax.

617
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,520
<17-24,House>颈静脉没有突起  没有填塞
<17-24,House>Neck veins flat. There's no tamponade.

618
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,130
<17-24,House>该死的  我等的太久了
<17-24,House>Damn it. I waited too long.

619
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,940
<17-24,House>汉娜  你的肺部有血块
<17-24,House>Hanna, you've got a clot in your lung.

620
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,480
<17-24,House>我来处理好
<17-24,House>I'm gonna fix this.

621
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,280
<17-24,House>注射溶栓剂
<17-24,House>IV streptokinase.

622
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,840
<17-25,Charlie>发生了什么  这是怎么一回事
<17-25,Charlie>What's happening. What's going on?

623
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,380
<17-26,House>除非我们打碎血块  负责她没法呼入氧气
<17-26,House>Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot.

624
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,740
<17-26,House>这是血液稀释剂
<17-26,House>This is a blood thinner.

625
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,100
<17-27,Charlie>她不会有事吧
<17-27,Charlie>Is she gonna be all right?

626
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,600
<17-28,House>这会让她出血量增加
<17-28,House>It's gonna make her bleed more.

627
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,180
<17-28,House>那个我们再处理
<17-28,House>We'll take care of that next.

628
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,310
<17-29,House>不管用
<17-29,House>It's not busting the clot.

629
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,420
<17-30,EMT>可能在她的心脏里
<17-30,EMT>Maybe it's her heart.

630
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,130
<17-31,Charlie>怎么了
<17-31,Charlie>What?

631
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,080
<17-32,House>不是血块
<17-32,House>It's not a clot.

632
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,080
<17-32,House>是脂肪栓
<17-32,House>It's a fat embolism.

633
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,430
<17-32,House>截肢导致的
<17-32,House>From the amputation.

634
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,620
<17-33,Charlie>那我们该怎么办
<17-33,Charlie>Okay. So--so what can we do?

635
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,630
<17-33,Charlie>想想办法
<17-33,Charlie>Come on.

636
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,190
<17-33,Charlie>做点什么  求你了  做点什么
<17-33,Charlie>Do something. Please, please, do something.

637
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,140
<17-33,Charlie>想想办法啊  伙计们 求你们了
<17-33,Charlie>Come on, guys, do something. Come on.

638
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,950
<17-33,Charlie>求你们了  做点什么
<17-33,Charlie>Come on. Please, come on, do something!

639
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,050
<17-33,Charlie>想想办法救救她啊
<17-33,Charlie>Come on, do something! Do something!

640
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,700
<18-1,Foreman>没什么办法能预防脂肪栓形成
<18-1,Foreman>There's no way to prevent a fat embolism.

641
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,080
<18-1,Foreman>就算截肢是在手术室里做的
<18-1,Foreman>Even if you'd done this in an O.R.,

642
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,700
<18-1,Foreman>也救不了她
<18-1,Foreman>Couldn't have saved her.

643
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,730
<18-2,Foreman>别太自责
<18-2,Foreman>You can't blame yourself for her death.

644
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,710
<18-2,Foreman>这不是你的错
<18-2,Foreman>This wasn't your fault.

645
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,210
<18-3,House>这才是问题的关键
<18-3,House>That's the point!

646
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,090
<18-3,House>我能做的都做对了  但她还是死了
<18-3,House>I did everything right. She died anyway.

647
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,810
<18-3,House>你怎么会认为
<18-3,House>Why the hell do you think

648
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,740
<18-3,House>这能让我好受点
<18-3,House>that would make me feel any better?

649
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,430
<18-4,Foreman>你不能单独留在这
<18-4,Foreman>You shouldn't be alone right now.

650
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,780
<18-4,Foreman>你在流血
<18-4,Foreman>You're bleeding.

651
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,960
<18-5,House>作为我的手下  我命令你
<18-5,House>I'm gonna give you a task as an employee.

652
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,010
<18-5,House>闪 开
<18-5,House>Get out of my way.

653
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,350
<19-1,Taub>那是什么
<19-1,Taub>What's that?

654
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,470
<19-2,Thirteen>我准备请假
<19-2,Thirteen>I'm asking for some time off.

655
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,780
<19-3,Taub>出什么事了
<19-3,Taub>What's wrong?

656
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,890
<19-4,Taub>你还好吗
<19-4,Taub>Are you okay?

657
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,280
<19-5,Thirteen>显然不好
<19-5,Thirteen>Obviously not.

658
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,180
<19-5,Thirteen>你打算三步并作两步冲上来
<19-5,Thirteen>You going to leap across the room

659
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,250
<20-1,House>夺走我的药
<20-1,House>and grab them out of my hand?

660
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,980
<20-1,House>不
<20-1,House>No.

661
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,120
<20-2,Cuddy>你想回到过去嗑药的日子这是你的选择
<20-2,Cuddy>It's your choice if you want to go back on drugs.

662
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,140
<20-2,Cuddy>好吧
<20-2,Cuddy>Okay.

663
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,920
<20-3,House>想让你知道
<20-3,House>Just so you know,

664
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,700
<20-3,House>我正努力与堕落作斗争
<20-3,House>I'm finding it hard to see the downside.

665
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,240
<20-4,Cuddy>你的肩膀需要重新包扎一下
<20-4,Cuddy>You need to re-bandage your shoulder.

666
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,270
<20-5,House>这就是你来的原因  福曼让你来的
<20-5,House>Is that why you're here? Foreman sent you?

667
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
<20-6,Cuddy>不是
<20-6,Cuddy>No.

668
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,350
<20-7,House>你是来冲我大喊大叫的
<20-7,House>You here to yell at me again?

669
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,660
<20-8,Cuddy>不是
<20-8,Cuddy>No.

670
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,920
<20-9,House>那我就不知道原因了
<20-9,House>Well, I'm running out of ideas.

671
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,360
<20-10,Cuddy>卢卡斯
<20-10,Cuddy>Lucas...

672
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,930
<20-11,House>又是他
<20-11,House>Oh, great.

673
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,280
<20-11,House>你又觉得不自在了
<20-11,House>You're feeling uncomfortable again?

674
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,110
<20-11,House>难道是刚从
<20-11,House>Probably means you just got back

675
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,790
<20-11,House>拉斯维加斯闪婚回来
<20-11,House>from some quickie wedding in Vegas

676
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,580
<20-11,House>还是你已经怀孕了
<20-11,House>or you're already pregnant.

677
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,540
<20-12,Cuddy>我俩分手了
<20-12,Cuddy>I ended it.

678
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,920
<20-13,House>什么
<20-13,House>What?

679
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,400
<20-14,Cuddy>我很迷茫  豪斯
<20-14,Cuddy>I'm stuck, House.

680
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,950
<20-14,Cuddy>我总是想抬头向前看
<20-14,Cuddy>I keep wanting to move forward.

681
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,930
<20-14,Cuddy>想抛掉过去  但是我做不到
<20-14,Cuddy>I keep wanting to move on, and I can't.

682
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,570
<20-14,Cuddy>我的新房  未婚夫
<20-14,Cuddy>I mean, my new house, with my new fiance,

683
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,920
<20-14,Cuddy>我想到这一切的时候脑中只有你
<20-14,Cuddy>and all I can think about is you.

684
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,360
<20-14,Cuddy>我只是想知道
<20-14,Cuddy>I just need to know

685
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,790
<20-14,Cuddy>你我到底有没有可能
<20-14,Cuddy>If you and I can work.

686
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,110
<20-15,House>你认为我自救有望
<20-15,House>You think I can fix myself?

687
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,420
<20-16,Cuddy>我不知道
<20-16,Cuddy>I don't know.

688
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,590
<20-17,House>我是这个世界上最失败的人
<20-17,House>'cause I'm the most screwed-up person in the world.

689
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,290
<20-17,House>我知道
<20-17,House>I know.

690
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,680
<20-18,Cuddy>但是我爱你
<20-18,Cuddy>I love you.

691
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,340
<20-18,Cuddy>我多希望我不爱你
<20-18,Cuddy>I wish I didn't.

692
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,920
<20-18,Cuddy>但我却情不自已
<20-18,Cuddy>But I can't help it.

693
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,190
<20-19,House>这不是幻觉吧
<20-19,House>How do I know I'm not hallucinating?

694
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,900
<20-20,Cuddy>你吃药了吗
<20-20,Cuddy>Did you take the vicodin?

695
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,120
<20-21,House>没有
<20-21,House>No.

696
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,580
<20-22,Cuddy>那就是真的
<20-22,Cuddy>Then I think we're okay.
