144

<8-2,House>你的MRI显示脑桥损伤
<8-2,House>Your mri showed aabclesion in the central pons.

148
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,680
<8-6,House>不是外伤造成的
<8-6,House>Which means no way head trauma did this.

149
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,570
<8-6,House>是肿瘤造成了瘤外综合征
<8-6,House>It's cancer,causing aabcparaneoplastic syndrome.

150
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,780
<8-6,House>然而你的主治医师认为abc这弥散分布的密度影是感染
<8-6,House>Unfortunately,your current doctor thinksabcits diffuse nature means an infection.

151
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,570
<8-6,House>坏消息是他使用的抗病毒药会杀了你

154
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,630
<8-8,House>接着白痴医生会发现abc他的名字并不是巧合
<8-8,House>then dr. Idiot will realizeabcthat his name is not a coincidence

155
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,500
<8-8,House>- 然后就会让我为所欲为了abc- 谢谢
<8-8,House>- and he'll let me do whatever I want.abc- Thank you.

156
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,710
<8-10,House>但讽刺的是...
<8-10,House>See,the irony here is...

157

<8-10,House>我觉得你很迷人

160
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,170
<8-11,Lee>我明白了 这人有点神经
<8-11,Lee>I get it,you're a little nuts,aren't you?

<8-12,House>Your wife and me.

163
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,170
<8-12,House>但老实说 做个MRI比abc握住你的手四小时都管用
<8-12,House>Although frankly,the mri was a lot moreabcuseful than four hours of hand-holding.

<25-5,Lee>I wish I could make all of this better.

442
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,750
<25-6,Kutner>看来他做了几次临时工 当清洁工
<25-6,Kutner>Looks like he temped aabcfew times. As a janitor.

443
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,800
<25-6,Kutner>在10号公路旁的一家工厂里
<25-6,Kutner>Factory out on route 10.

444

<26-1,Taub>工厂工头说 他们生产充电电池
<26-1,Taub>Factory foreman says they makeabcrechargeable batteries.

00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,390
<26-1,Taub>大部分供手机使用
<26-1,Taub>Mostly for cell phones.

446
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,910
<26-2,Kutner>从自己开店到替人打扫abc简直天壤之别
<26-2,Kutner>Big step down from running yourabcown business,to sweeping up.

447
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,440
<26-3,Lee>我只是尽力而为
<26-3,Lee>Doing what I had to do.

448
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,760
<26-4,Kutner>金属锉末
<26-4,Kutner>Metal filings.

449
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,440
<26-4,Kutner>从颜色判断 我想是镉
<26-4,Kutner>Judging by the color,I'd say cadmium.

450
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,580
<26-5,Taub>扫帚把锉末扬起来 被他吸入了肺部
<26-5,Taub>Which he'd aerosolize with theabcbroom,then right into his lungs.

451
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,410
<26-5,Taub>重金属中毒-- 解释了一切
<26-5,Taub>Heavy metalabcpoisoning--explains everything.

452
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,350
<26-5,Taub>螯合治疗可以清除你血液里的金属
<26-5,Taub>The chelation will scrubabcthe heavy metals out of your blood.

453
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,120
<27-1,Taub>如果我们找对了病因abc一天左右就会看到变化
<27-1,Taub>If we are right about the cause,we shouldabcsee some movement in about a day or so.

454
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,100
<27-2,Lee>不能快一点吗?
<27-2,Lee>Can't put this thing on turbo?

455
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,660
<27-2,Lee>我开始有点焦躁了
<27-2,Lee>I'm gettinga little anxious in here.

<27-5,Taub>Man,when you moved that cursor...

463
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,150
<27-6,Foreman>我给初恋女友买了根项链 是银制的
<27-6,Foreman>Bought my first girlfriend aabcnecklace. It was silver.

464

<27-6,Foreman>It cost 180 bucks--hadabcto save for six months.

465
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,540
<27-6,Foreman>她不喜欢
<27-6,Foreman>She hated it.

466
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,080
<27-7,Lee>真的吗?
<27-7,Lee>Really,seriously?

467
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,530
<27-7,Lee>听你讲这故事 让人不耐烦呢
<27-7,Lee>Did you tell this story toabcsomeone who could walk away?

468
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,710
<27-8,Foreman>从此我再也没给女友买过首饰
<27-8,Foreman>Never bought another girlfriendabcjewelry again.

469
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,780
<27-9,Lee>- 直至Hadley医生abc- 你在和她约会?
<27-9,Lee>- Until dr. Hadley.abc- You're dating her?

470
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,900
<27-9,Lee>你每个故事都应该这么开头
<27-9,Lee>You might want to start allabcyour stories with that.

471
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,730
<27-10,Foreman>结果还是一样...她根本没有戴
<27-10,Foreman>Same thing... she didn't even wear it.

472
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,230
<27-11,Lee>你说那根钻石链子? 她前些天戴上了
<27-11,Lee>The diamond thing,she wasabcwearing it the other day.

473
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,770
<27-12,Foreman>如果她不喜欢...她的确不喜欢
<27-12,Foreman>If she doesn't likeabcit,she doesn't like it.

474
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,310
<27-12,Foreman>显然 我选首饰的眼光很烂abc但她至少得老实告诉我
<27-12,Foreman>Apparently,I suckat picking outabcjewelry,but least have the guts to tell me.

475
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,380
<27-13,Lee>好了 话题又变得沉闷了
<27-13,Lee>Okay,getting boring again.

476
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,540
<27-13,Lee>要多久才知道治疗有没有效?
<27-13,Lee>How long until we know ifabcthis treatment is working?

477
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,340
<28-1,Molly>你骗了我
<28-1,Molly>You lied to me.

478
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,260
<28-2,Lee>我没有外遇
<28-2,Lee>I wasn't having an affair.

479
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,600
<28-3,Molly>我们需要钱没错 谁在乎这个?
<28-3,Molly>So we needed money. Who cares?

480
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,170
<28-4,Lee>上一次生意不好时abc你每天都会偏头痛
<28-4,Lee>Last time business was slow,youabcgot migraines every day.

481
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,300
<28-5,Molly>你为什么这样对我?
<28-5,Molly>Why would you do that to me?

<28-6,Lee>靠 有谁能...替我把abc"对不起"打到这台白痴电脑上
<28-6,Lee>Damn it,somebody... put "I'mabcsorry"on this stupid computer.

484
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,630
<28-6,Lee>我的眼睛痛死了
<28-6,Lee>My eye is killing me.

<29-3,Taub>我建议把病人的脑子接上电脑abc让他可以与人交流的点子如何?
<29-3,Taub>How about we hook the guy's brainabcinto a computer,so he can communicate?

488
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,230
<29-4,House>这是个好点子
<29-4,House>That's a great idea.

489
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,600
<29-4,House>对于那个发明了读心术电脑的家伙来说
<29-4,House>For the guy who inventedabcthe computer that can read minds.

490
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,540
<29-4,House>你的点子只是运用他的点子
<29-4,House>Your idea was to use his idea.

491
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,340
<29-5,Taub>但你没想到 别人也没想到
<29-5,Taub>You didn't come up with it.abcNo one else came up with it.

492
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,270
<29-5,Taub>如果不是我重建交流渠道abc我们就无法发现--
<29-5,Taub>If I didn'tre-establishabccommunication,we never would've found--

493
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,530
<29-6,House>有意思的是abc为什么你现在才来争取?
<29-6,House>What's interesting isabcwhy you're here now.

494
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,560
<29-6,House>而不是我给你下最后通牒时
<29-6,House>Not when I gave you the ultimatum.

495
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,450
<29-6,House>是不是病人说了什么?
<29-6,House>Was it something the patient said?

496
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:06,460
<29-7,Taub>我意识到 这里发生的一切...abc使我感到恐惧
<29-7,Taub>I realized that what weabcdo here... terrifies me.

497
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,090
<29-7,Taub>而且...
<29-7,Taub>And...

498
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,910
<29-7,Taub>克服这种恐惧abc我才能做个有用的人
<29-7,Taub>overcoming that is theabconly way I can matter.

00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,520
<29-8,House>Kutner想到是镉
<29-8,House>Kutner came up with the cadmium.

501
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,870
<29-8,House>也许你压根儿不重要
<29-8,House>Maybe you don't matter.

502
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,250
<30-1,Thirteen>我替你合上眼睛 好让你睡会儿
<30-1,Thirteen>I'm going to close yourabceyes so you can get some sleep.

504
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,240
<30-2,Lee>希望我的眼睛也会感觉好些
<30-2,Lee>Hope that includes my eye feeling better.

505
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,980
<30-3,Thirteen>把角膜染色荧光素钠递给我
<30-3,Thirteen>Hand me the flourescein stain.

506
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,180
<30-4,Lee>这是什么意思?
<30-4,Lee>What's that mean?

507
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,530
<30-5,Thirteen>上皮有点开裂
<30-5,Thirteen>Epithelium looks torn.

508
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,340
<30-5,Thirteen>这药水会有点刺
<30-5,Thirteen>These drops sting.

509
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,260
<30-7,Thirteen>我替你合上左眼保护它
<30-7,Thirteen>I'm going to close your leftabceye to keep it protected.

510
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,780
<30-7,Thirteen>我替你眨几下眼 让染色剂分布均匀
<30-7,Thirteen>I'm going to blink your eye aabcfew times to distribute the dye.

00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,330
<30-7,Thirteen>溃疡性角膜炎
<30-7,Thirteen>Ulcerative keratitis.

512
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,640
<30-8,Foreman>就是说不是镉中毒
<30-8,Foreman>Means it's not cadmium poisoning.

513
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,380
<30-9,Lee>就是说你们不知道出了什么问题abc又一次
<30-9,Lee>Which means you don'tabcknow what's wrong. Again.

514
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,350
<31-1,Cameron>你上次换衣服是什么时候?
<31-1,Cameron>When's the last time youabcchanged that dressing?

515
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,300
<31-1,Cameron>从这股味道判断 你从来没换过
<31-1,Cameron>Judging by the smellabcof it,I'd say never.

516
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,410
<31-2,House>他有闭锁综合症 肾脏快炸裂了
<31-2,House>He's locked-in,his kidneys blew a fuse,

517
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,970
<31-2,House>现在眼睛还渗出脓来
<31-2,House>and now his eye is oozing puss.

518
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,790
<31-3,Cameron>我猜你和你的小组abc已经探讨过这些问题了
<31-3,Cameron>I assume you went over allabcof that with your team.

519
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,970
<31-3,Cameron>看来他们没提出什么好点子abc否则你不会在这喃喃自语
<31-3,Cameron>I also assume they didn't have any brilliantabcideas,or you wouldn't still be muttering to yourself.

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,100
<31-3,Cameron>这会很痛
<31-3,Cameron>This is going to hurt.

521
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,570
<31-4,House>他开始流失髓磷脂abc感染最为符合 可能是水痘--
<31-4,House>The way he's losing his myelin makes anabcinfection most likely.Could be varicella--

522
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,500
<31-5,Cameron>石子碎片出来了 我得把它们刮掉
<31-5,Cameron>Road debris has come to the surface.abcI'm going to have to scrub it out.

523
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,140
<31-6,House>但一开始无环岛苷就会把它治好了
<31-6,House>But the initialabcacyclovir would've treated that.

524
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,270
<31-6,House>那只能考虑自体免疫疾病了
<31-6,House>Which pushes me towardsabcan autoimmune disease.

525
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,560
<31-6,House>比如说 贝切特氏综合征
<31-6,House>Like behcet'S.

526
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,980
<31-7,Cameron>这下会更痛 先吃两颗abc还有两颗留着待会吃
<31-7,Cameron>Here... this is going to hurtabceven more. Take two now,two later.

527
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,120
<31-8,House>喔
<31-8,House>Oops.

528
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,330
<31-8,House>当然 如果水痘抗药性强abc那在米德尔顿做的治疗也起不了作用
<31-8,House>Of course,if the varicella was resistant,itabcwouldn't matter what they did up in middletown.

529
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,350
<31-9,Cameron>做个脊髓穿刺
<31-9,Cameron>Do an lp.

530
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,810
<31-10,House>看来你在急诊室呆得太久了
<31-10,House>You've been in the er too long.

531
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,790
<31-10,House>只要病人有头部创伤 白血球升高abc也能让你得出头部创伤的结论
<31-10,House>When the patient had head trauma,white bloodabccells only indicate that he had head trauma.

532
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,240
<31-11,Cameron>或者你可以利用脊髓穿刺abc发现更有用的结果
<31-11,Cameron>Or you could use theabclp for something useful.

533
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,540
<31-11,Cameron>如果发现多中性粒细胞 就是水痘abc淋巴细胞 就是贝切特氏综合征
<31-11,Cameron>If you find polys,it'sabcvaricella. Lymphs,behcet'S.

534
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,020
<31-12,House>我为什么开除你来着?
<31-12,House>Why did I fire you again?

00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,800
<31-13,Cameron>你没有 我辞职了
<31-13,Cameron>You didn't. I quit.

536
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,910
<32-1,Wilson>你也不是去探望Foreman的哥哥
<32-1,Wilson>You weren't visiting foreman'sabcbrother,either.

537
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,470

<32-3,Wilson>你没有接触过在Fishkill的任何人
<32-3,Wilson>You've never had anyabccontact with anyone at fishkill.

541
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,290
<32-3,Wilson>我再问一次...
<32-3,Wilson>So,I ask again...

<32-4,House>你知道比我做的事abc更有趣的是什么吗?
<32-4,House>You know what's more interestingabcthan what I was doing?

544
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,120
<32-4,House>是你为什么要纠结我在干什么
<32-4,House>The reason you are soabcobsessed with what I was doing.

<32-5,Wilson>- 不要转移话题 Houseabc- 转移话题的是你
<32-5,Wilson>- Stop deflecting,house.abc- Says the deflector.

<32-6,House>The reason I was up there...

547
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,130
<32-6,House>正是你害怕我去的原因
<32-6,House>is the reason you'reabcscared I was up there.

548

<32-7,Wilson>你怎么知道?
<32-7,Wilson>How did you know?

551

<32-8,House>你唯一的秘密便是某个使你难为情的女孩
<32-8,House>Your only secrets are theabcgis you find embarrassing.

<32-10,House>之前照顾你弟弟的是谁?
<32-10,House>Who was the last person whoabctook care of your brother?

557
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,490
<32-11,Wilson>你认为这是恋母情结?
<32-11,Wilson>You think this is oedipal?

558
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,870
<32-12,House>实际上 我在想的是自淫
<32-12,House>Actually,I was thinking masturbatory.

559
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,390
<32-12,House>我猜你妈妈是最先照顾他的人
<32-12,House>I guess your mom took care of him first.

560
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,040

<32-12,House>So,the safe course isabcto gouge your eyes out.

<33-3,Foreman>You're going to feel some extremeabcpressure in your back.

<34-1,Lee>你不知道我得了什么病
<34-1,Lee>You don't know what's wrong with me

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,020
<34-2,House>看起来不是这样的
<34-2,House>It doesn't seem that way.

572
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,890
<34-3,Lee>那么说我死了?

<35-8,Lee>挠一挠这只脚 真的真的很痒
<35-8,Lee>scratch this foot--wow,thatabcreally,really itches.

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,680
<35-11,House>他在试着说话
<35-11,House>He's trying to talk.

588
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,340
<35-11,House>有事困挠你吗?
<35-11,House>Is something bothering you?

589
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,370
<35-12,Foreman>要是你觉得胸口紧的话abc这是意料之中的
<35-12,Foreman>If there's still tightness inabcyour chest,it's expected.

590
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,630
<35-13,Kutner>是眼睛吗?
<35-13,Kutner>Is it your eye?

591
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,530
<35-14,Foreman>他为什么要说三次"不"?abc你只问了一个问题
<35-14,Foreman>Why is he saying "no"three times?abcYou only asked one question.

592
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,430
<35-15,Kutner>也许他不是在说"不" 他是在说"向下"
<35-15,Kutner>Maybe he's not saying "no,"abcmaybe he's saying "down."

593
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,810
<35-15,Kutner>你是不是在说疼痛在更低的位置?abc多低? 是腿吗?
<35-15,Kutner>Are you saying that the painabcis lower? How low,your leg?

594
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,340
<35-15,Kutner>脚?
<35-15,Kutner>Your foot?

595
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,290
<35-16,House>左脚?
<35-16,House>Left foot?

596
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,950
<35-16,House>检查一下他的 让我想想...abc他的右脚
<35-16,House>Check his--let me seeabcnow-- yeah,his right foot.

597
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,610
<35-17,Foreman>没有瘀痕 没有皮疹 没有割伤
<35-17,Foreman>No bruises,no rashes,no cuts.

598
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,020
<35-18,House>那么应该不会痛才对
<35-18,House>Then there should beno pain.

599
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,770
<35-18,House>有没有麻刺感?
<35-18,House>Is there a tingling sensation?

600
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,950
<35-18,House>是不是觉得痒?
<35-18,House>Is it itching?

601
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,940
<36-1,House>感到脚痒意味着肝功能衰竭
<36-1,House>Itchy foot means liver failure.

602
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,930
<36-2,Taub>肝脏没有问题 他体内的生化酶abc从我们接收他开始就是正常的
<36-2,Taub>The liver's fine. His enzymes haveabcbeen normal since we admitted him.

603
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,250
<36-3,House>我说的是"衰竭了" 而不是"正在衰竭"abc正如你一样
<36-3,House>I didn't say "failing,"Iabcsaid "failure." Just like you.

604
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,420
<36-3,House>肝脏就像是水上巡航舰
<36-3,House>Liver's like a cruiseabcship taking on water.

605
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,370
<36-3,House>当它开始下沉时 它发出求救信号
<36-3,House>As it starts to sink,itabcsends out an S.O.S.,

606
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,190
<36-3,House>只不过不同于电波 肝脏用的是酶
<36-3,House>Only instead of radioabcwaves,it uses enzymes.

607
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,710
<36-3,House>血液中含酶量越大 肝脏的情况越糟糕
<36-3,House>The more enzymes in theabcblood,the worse the liver is.

608
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,380
<36-3,House>当船沉没了之后 就没有求救信号了
<36-3,House>And once the ship hasabcsunk,there's no more S.O.S.

609
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,390
<36-3,House>你以为肝脏是好的 但实际上早就无可救药了
<36-3,House>You think the liver's fine,but it'sabcalready at the bottom of the sea.

610
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:00,640
<36-4,Thirteen>那么就是说衰竭的肝脏释放出毒素abc毒素损坏了神经 导致了闭锁综合症
<36-4,Thirteen>So dying liver released toxins,damagedabcthe nerves,led to locked-in syndrome.

611
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,290
<36-5,House>现在我们只需要知道是什么导致了肝衰竭
<36-5,House>Now we just need to knowabcwhat's causing the liver failure.

612
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,010
<36-6,Foreman>肝脏 加上眼睛 还有肾脏abc很可能是硬化性胆管炎
<36-6,Foreman>Liver,plus eye,plus kidney--abcmost likely sclerosing cholangitis.

613
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,830
<36-7,House>天哪 如果是Taub说出来的话abc就会是圆满的结局了
<36-7,House>Oh,god,if only taub had said that,itabcwould've been a happy ending.

614
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,200
<36-7,House>去做个活体切片确认
<36-7,House>Do a biopsy to confirm.

615
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,040
<37-1,Taub>我现在要麻醉待会做切片的部位
<37-1,Taub>I'm going to numb up the area whereabcwe'll go in for the punch biopsy.

616
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,940
<37-2,Kutner>新手镯去哪了?
<37-2,Kutner>Where's the new bracelet?

617
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,880
<37-3,Foreman>她戴手镯了?
<37-3,Foreman>She was wearing the bracelet?

618
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,650
<37-4,Thirteen>你之前没注意到我戴着吗?
<37-4,Thirteen>You didn't notice that I was wearing it?

619
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,640
<37-5,Foreman>因为你没戴
<37-5,Foreman>Because you weren't.

620
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,070
<37-6,Thirteen>他注意到了 但是你没有?
<37-6,Thirteen>He noticed,and you didn't?

621
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,980
<37-7,Foreman>如果你不喜欢 没关系 这不是什么大问题
<37-7,Foreman>If you don't like it,it'sabcfine,it's not a big deal.

622
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,590
<37-8,Thirteen>我喜欢 这才是重点
<37-8,Thirteen>I like it,that's the point.

623
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,580
<37-8,Thirteen>我宁愿把它放在家中的珠宝盒里abc也比在这儿被尿湿的好
<37-8,Thirteen>I'd rather have itat home in theabcjewelry box than getting peed on at work.

624
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,390
<37-9,Kutner>你那只手臂上沾到过病人的尿样?
<37-9,Kutner>You got the patient's urine on that arm?

625
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,970
<37-10,Thirteen>我插导尿管的时候 有什么问题吗?
<37-10,Thirteen>When I was putting in the catheter. Why?

626
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,950
<37-11,Kutner>你起皮疹了
<37-11,Kutner>You've got a rash.

627
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,940
<37-12,Foreman>- 手镯是真的abc- 这我想到了
<37-12,Foreman>- The bracelet's real.abc- I figured.

628
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,530
<37-13,Kutner>那么如果皮疹不只是皮疹呢?
<37-13,Kutner>So what if the rash isn't just a rash?

629
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,160
<37-13,Kutner>如果这是一种感染呢?
<37-13,Kutner>What if it's an infection?

630
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:58,170
<37-13,Kutner>如果那地下室里有耗子的话abc肝衰竭可能是由于钩端螺旋体病引起的
<37-13,Kutner>If there were rats in that basement,then theabcliver failure could be caused by leptospirosis.

631
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,610
<37-13,Kutner>钩端螺旋体病通过尿液传播abc耗子传给他 他传给你
<37-13,Kutner>It transfers through urine.abcRat pee to him,his pee to you.

632
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,320
<37-13,Kutner>感染需要一个进入点
<37-13,Kutner>The infection would need an entry point.

633
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,150
<37-13,Kutner>检查一下有没有新的抓伤或者割伤
<37-13,Kutner>Look for any recent scratches,cuts.

634
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,260
<37-14,Taub>看 在他指甲旁边
<37-14,Taub>Look. Next to his fingernail.

635
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:22,640
<37-15,Kutner>感染损坏了你的肝脏abc释放的毒素引起了闭锁综合症
<37-15,Kutner>The infection destroyed your liver,which releasedabctoxins that caused the locked-in syndrome.

636
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,500
<37-15,Kutner>你差点因为被纸割伤而死掉
<37-15,Kutner>You were dying of a paper cut.

637
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,070
<37-16,Lee>但愿你这次是对的
<37-16,Lee>I hope you're right this time.

638
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,480
<38-1,Kutner>我们在你哥们Dave的地下室里找到了老鼠
<38-1,Kutner>We found rats in yourabcbuddy dave's basement.

639
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
<38-1,Kutner>测试证明了是钩端螺旋体病
<38-1,Kutner>Tested positive for leptospirosis.

640
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,710
<38-1,Kutner>这意味着现在的治疗是正确的
<38-1,Kutner>That means we're on the right treatment.

641
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,410
<38-1,Kutner>那么... 试着动动你的手指
<38-1,Kutner>So... try moving a finger.

642
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,340
<38-1,Kutner>你的大脑需要再次习惯工作abc再努力试一试
<38-1,Kutner>Your brain needs to get used toabcdoing its job again. Try harder.

643
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,680
<38-1,Kutner>我知道你已经放弃了希望
<38-1,Kutner>I'm sure you've lost hope.

644
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,710
<38-1,Kutner>我们曾告诉过你好多次说知道是什么病了abc但这次真的找对了
<38-1,Kutner>I know we've told you several times that weabcknew what this was,but this time we're right.

645
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:02,320
<38-1,Kutner>集中精神 为我试着去动动手指
<38-1,Kutner>Concentrate. Move one finger for me.
