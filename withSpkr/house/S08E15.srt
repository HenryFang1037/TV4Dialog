10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,110
<1-6,Hayes>我知道有别的事惹你不高兴了
<1-6,Hayes>I think something else is making you upset.

<1-6,Hayes>你知道我马上要走了
<1-6,Hayes>You know I'm leaving soon,

<1-6,Hayes>and it's okay to be upset about that,

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,910
<1-6,Hayes>但你还记得周六晚上咱们一起看

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,400
<1-7,Evan>你说你和布兰特叔叔就像那对兄弟
<1-7,Evan>That you and uncle Brant are like the reaper brothers.

<1-7,Evan>对

<1-8,Hayes>布兰特叔叔已经在场上
<1-8,Hayes>And uncle Brant has been in the ring

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,350

<1-8,Hayes>现在是时候让爸爸上场了

<1-8,Hayes>但我不在时
<1-8,Hayes>But while I'm away,

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,570
<1-8,Hayes>我要你在你叔叔身边帮他
<1-8,Hayes>I need you in your uncle's corner,

23
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,330
<1-8,Hayes>确保他保护你和你妈妈的安全

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,360
<1-11,Hayes>布兰特  出了什么事
<1-11,Hayes>Brant, what happened?

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,040
<1-13,Hayes>到底出了什么事
<1-13,Hayes>What's going on?

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,330
<1-14,MP>陆军一等兵麦克林被指控犯有叛国罪
<1-14,MP>PFC Macklin has been charged with treason.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,930
<1-15,Hayes>这肯定是个误会
<1-15,Hayes>Oh, so there's got to be some mistake.

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,870
<1-16,Brant>抱歉
<1-16,Brant>I'm sorry.

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,270
<2-1,Adams>陆军方面显然认为  他们是在

59
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,770
<2-1,Adams>清理一个反叛分子窝点
<2-1,Adams>an insurgent hideout.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,730
<2-1,Adams>自从这段录像在周六被泄露后
<2-1,Adams>After this was leaked on Saturday,

61
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,230
<2-1,Adams>美联社就开始调查

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,530
<2-4,House>别  别这么安排
<2-4,House>No. Don't do that.

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,680
<2-4,House>每次有当兵的来餐厅
<2-4,House>Every time there's people in uniform in the cafeteria,

68

<2-5,Foreman>确保证件都别在显眼的地方
<2-5,Foreman>Make sure your IDs are clearly visible.

70
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,720
<2-5,Foreman>我会向餐饮部传达意见
<2-5,Foreman>I'll speak with the cafeteria staff about showing

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,870
<2-5,Foreman>让他们尽量一视同仁
<2-5,Foreman>more disrespect.

<2-5,Foreman>病人20岁  男性  全身性强直阵挛发作

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,200
<2-5,Foreman>军医检查了是否有结构性病变
<2-5,Foreman>Army docs scanned for structural abnormalities.

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,660
<2-5,Foreman>脑电图正常  所以...
<2-5,Foreman>EEG was normal. So was--

75
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,910
<2-6,House>你还需要我签字吗
<2-6,House>Do you need me to sign for this?

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,290
<2-7,Foreman>如果你们有什么需要  告诉我一声
<2-7,Foreman>Let me know if you need anything,

77

78
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,890
<2-8,Chase>斑疹伤寒

79
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,370
<2-9,House>病人是光头
<2-9,House>Patient has no hair.

80
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,950
<2-9,House>也就是说没有虱子
<2-9,House>Probably means no lice.

81
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,210
<2-10,Adams>利什曼病
<2-10,Adams>Leishmaniasis.

82
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,140
<2-11,Park>他没有发热
<2-11,Park>No fever.

83
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,970
<2-11,Park>他们为什么不在
<2-11,Park>Why couldn't they take care of him

84
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,240
<2-11,Park>军队医院治疗他
<2-11,Park>at a military hospital?

85
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,430
<2-12,House>我想他们就是想找你的麻烦
<2-12,House>I think because they wanted to annoy you.

86
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,590
<2-12,House>还有没有良心发现的反对者了
<2-12,House>Any other conscientious objectors?

87
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,070
<2-13,Park>只有我看不惯吗
<2-13,Park>So I'm the only one

88
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,400
<2-13,Park>他的职责是
<2-13,Park>who has a problem when someone

89
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,850
<2-13,Park>保卫我们的国家  却泄露...
<2-13,Park>whose duty's to protect our country blowing--

90
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,890
<2-14,House>泄露告密是十分崇高的
<2-14,House>Blowing the whistle is honorable

91
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,160
<2-14,House>正因为那并不是他的义务
<2-14,House>precisely because it's not dutiful.

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,050
<2-14,House>抱歉  你说到泄露
<2-14,House>Sorry, you said blowing.

93
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,740
<2-14,House>也许你是想说别的事
<2-14,House>Maybe you were going somewhere else with that.

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,900
<2-15,Park>他是个懦夫
<2-15,Park>He's a coward.

95
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,390
<2-16,Adams>他可是冒了失去自由的风险
<2-16,Adams>He risked his freedom.

96
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,030
<2-17,Park>他匿名从一个安全的网页
<2-17,Park>He anonymously downloaded a computer file

97
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,930
<2-17,Park>下载了一个文件然后上传到
<2-17,Park>from a secure page and uploaded it

98
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,200
<2-17,Park>一个不安全的网站
<2-17,Park>to an unsecure page.

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,070
<2-17,Park>又不是突袭奥马哈海滩
<2-17,Park>Not exactly storming Omaha beach.

100
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,820
<2-17,Park>奥马哈海滩是诺曼底登陆中
<2-17,Park>四个主要登陆地点之一的代号

101
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,310
<2-17,Park>脑电图正常  说明他装病
<2-17,Park>The EEG was normal because he was faking it

102
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,990
<2-17,Park>这样就不用进监狱了
<2-17,Park>to avoid going to prison.

103
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,430
<2-18,House>那咱们就用不给药治疗他
<2-18,House>Let's treat him with not medicine.

104
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,630
<2-19,Adams>还给我
<2-19,Adams>Give those back.

105
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,710
<2-20,House>为什么  有28粒呢
<2-20,House>Why? You got 28.

106
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,730
<2-20,House>分享一下没关系
<2-20,House>You can share.

107
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,740
<3-1,Adams>豪斯有点问题
<3-1,Adams>Something's going on with House.

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,790
<3-1,Adams>他有点心不在焉
<3-1,Adams>He just seemed off.

109
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
<3-1,Adams>都没注意到我离开房间时
<3-1,Adams>Didn't even notice that I walked out

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,800
<3-1,Adams>把这个带出来了
<3-1,Adams>of the room with this.

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,480
<3-2,Chase>你想知道他是否心不在焉  趁其不注意
<3-2,Chase>You began to suspect he was off when he didn't notice

112
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,630
<3-2,Chase>偷走了杯子  你就怀疑他确实心不在焉
<3-2,Chase>the mug you stole to see if he was off?

113
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,140
<3-2,Chase>他还没注意什么你不想让我们发现的事
<3-2,Chase>What else didn't he notice that you don't want us to notice?

114
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,390
<3-3,Park>你昨天就穿的这身衣服
<3-3,Park>Those are the same clothes you wore yesterday.

115
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,360
<3-4,Taub>当豪斯拿走你的避孕药时
<3-4,Taub>And you got very defensive

116
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,760
<3-4,Taub>你十分生气
<3-4,Taub>when house took your birth control.

117
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,740
<3-5,Chase>他是谁啊  或者更美好  "她"是谁
<3-5,Chase>Who was he? Or better yet...she?

118
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,690
<3-6,Adams>是需要我解释避孕药的生理学原理吗
<3-6,Adams>Do I need to explain the physiology behind birth control?

119
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,280
<3-6,Adams>一个没有注意力缺陷的人开始精力涣散
<3-6,Adams>Attention deficit in a man who has no attention deficits

120
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,930
<3-6,Adams>一定是因为某种因素引起的
<3-6,Adams>has to be symptomatic of something.

121
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,600
<3-7,Taub>你说得对  我认为要不就是一个大脑瘤
<3-7,Taub>You're right. I'm thinking either massive brain tumor,

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,510
<3-7,Taub>要不就是他喜欢的肥皂剧被砍了他很伤心
<3-7,Taub>or his soap got canceled and he's distracted.

123
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,900
<3-8,Adams>可能是膳食引起的  植烷酸贮积症
<3-8,Adams>Could be dietary, Refsum.

124
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,400
<3-9,Park>或者他不过是认为
<3-9,Park>Or maybe he thinks you just have

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,530
<3-9,Park>这种大众化的白色衬衣  你有不止一件
<3-9,Park>more than one nondescript white blouse.

126
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,040
<3-10,Adams>或者是血清素综合征
<3-10,Adams>Or serotonin syndrome.

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,990
<3-10,Adams>我不是说他肯定有病
<3-10,Adams>I'm not saying he's definitely sick.

128
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,730
<3-10,Adams>我只是想说咱们应该查一查
<3-10,Adams>I'm just saying we should look into it.

129
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,080
<3-11,Chase>不用
<3-11,Chase>No, we shouldn't.

130
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,040
<3-11,Chase>如果你认为豪斯得病了
<3-11,Chase>If you believe House is sick,

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,320
<3-11,Chase>只可能是因为他想让你有这样的想法
<3-11,Chase>it's only because that's what he wants you to believe.

132
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,340
<3-12,Park>走吧
<3-12,Park>Let's go.

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,950
<4-1,Adams>我们认为长途飞行可导致你的下肢
<4-1,Adams>We think the long flight home allowed clots

134
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,290
<4-1,Adams>形成血栓
<4-1,Adams>to form in your leg.

135
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,300
<4-2,Adams>把这药吃了
<4-2,Adams>Take this pill.

136
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,820
<4-2,Adams>如果过几分钟你的腿有麻木感
<4-2,Adams>If you feel any numbness in your leg after a few minutes,

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,670
<4-2,Adams>那我们的诊断就对了  你也可以舒服一阵了
<4-2,Adams>it means we're right and you should get comfortable,

138
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,250
<4-2,Adams>因为你还得在这待一段时间
<4-2,Adams>because you're gonna be here for a while.

139
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,570
<4-3,Park>既然要等
<4-3,Park>While we wait,

140
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,470
<4-3,Park>你能告诉我你为什么这么做吗
<4-3,Park>can you tell me why?

141
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,270
<4-4,Brant>因为那么做是正确的
<4-4,Brant>It was the right thing to do.

142
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,570
<4-5,Park>有报道称有反叛分子在利用你的视频
<4-5,Park>There are reports that insurgents are using your video

143
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,260
<4-5,Park>召集更多的成员
<4-5,Park>to recruit new members.

144
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,880
<4-6,Brant>让有投票权的大众知道
<4-6,Brant>Making the voting public aware

145
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,170
<4-6,Brant>战场上到底发生了些什么事
<4-6,Brant>of what's really happening on the ground

146
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,900
<4-6,Brant>能让我们的战友更快地回家
<4-6,Brant>will help bring our troops home faster.

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,350
<4-6,Brant>我哥哥叹气是因为他不同意
<4-6,Brant>My brother's grunt means he disagrees.

148
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,880
<4-7,Hayes>我认为你很天真
<4-7,Hayes>I think you're being naive.

149
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,180
<4-7,Hayes>我知道你起过誓
<4-7,Hayes>And I know you took an oath.

150
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,430
<4-7,Hayes>如果你想改变政策  那就要从政
<4-7,Hayes>If you want to influence policy, run for office.

151
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,310
<4-8,Brant>爸爸教过我们  揭示真相是光荣之事
<4-8,Brant>Dad raised us to believe that exposing the truth is honorable.

152
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,360
<4-8,Brant>海耶斯喜欢循规蹈矩
<4-8,Brant>Hayes likes to follow the rules.

153
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,220
<4-9,Hayes>对  因为那才是爸爸教导的光荣行为
<4-9,Hayes>Yeah, because that's what dad taught us was honorable.

154
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,730
<4-9,Hayes>爸爸死时你才十岁
<4-9,Hayes>You were ten when he died.

155
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,040
<4-9,Hayes>你不可能知道...
<4-9,Hayes>You couldn't possibly have any idea--

156
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,300
<4-10,Brant>如果爸爸一直盲目从命
<4-10,Brant>If dad always believe in blindly following the rules,

157
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,910
<4-10,Brant>怎么解释他在托拉博拉之战中的表现
<4-10,Brant>how do you explain Tora Bora?

159
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,240
<4-10,Brant>我爸爸负责指挥一个特种部队作战单元
<4-10,Brant>My dad was commanding a special forces unit.

160
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,760
<4-10,Brant>他与下属失去了联系
<4-10,Brant>He lost communication with his men.

161
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,020
<4-10,Brant>他们被认定已经死亡
<4-10,Brant>They were assumed dead.

162
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,590
<4-10,Brant>他接到命令要放弃他们
<4-10,Brant>He was ordered to abandon them

163
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,360
<4-10,Brant>继续执行首要任务
<4-10,Brant>and focus on the primary mission.

164
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,070
<4-10,Brant>他抗命不遵
<4-10,Brant>He disobeyed that order,

165
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,690
<4-10,Brant>找到了下属  发现他们还活着  抗争着
<4-10,Brant>went and found his men still alive and fighting.

166
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,270
<4-10,Brant>他救了他们的命
<4-10,Brant>He saved their lives.

167
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,750
<4-11,Adams>他是战死的吗
<4-11,Adams>Did he die in service?

168
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,160
<4-11,Adams>如果是因为遗传病  可以帮助我们诊断
<4-11,Adams>If it was something genetic, it could help us.

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,380
<4-12,Hayes>我爸爸的死因和这没关系
<4-12,Hayes>It won't help.

170
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,870
<4-12,Hayes>他是车祸死的
<4-12,Hayes>It was a one-car accident.

171
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,540
<4-13,Brant>那是军方的官话
<4-13,Brant>That's the army's official story.

172
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,540
<4-13,Brant>我哥哥一直天真地以为...
<4-13,Brant>My brother's naive on this and...

173
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,120
<4-13,Brant>我的腿没有知觉了
<4-13,Brant>I can't feel my leg.

174
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,950
<4-14,Adams>我去拿出院表
<4-14,Adams>I'll get the discharge papers.

175
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,330
<4-15,Brant>我有血栓
<4-15,Brant>I have a blood clot.

176
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,730
<4-15,Brant>不  你没有
<4-15,Brant>No, you don't.

177
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,870
<4-16,Park>我们给你用的是安慰剂
<4-16,Park>We gave you a placebo

178
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,710
<4-16,Park>来看看你是否会装出另外一种症状
<4-16,Park>to see if you'd fake another symptom

179
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,630
<4-16,Park>来延缓入狱时间
<4-16,Park>to delay going to prison.

180
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,470
<4-17,Hayes>等等  他不会装病
<4-17,Hayes>Wait a second. He's not faking.

181
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,950
<4-18,Park>因为你们的爸爸没有教他装病吗
<4-18,Park>Because that's not the way your dad raised him?

182
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,230
<4-19,Hayes>对
<4-19,Hayes>Yes.

183
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,200
<4-20,Brant>我肚子也疼
<4-20,Brant>My stomach hurts too.

184
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,900
<4-20,Brant>到底怎么回事
<4-20,Brant>What's going on?

185
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,570
<4-21,Adams>他不是装的
<4-21,Adams>He's not faking.

186
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,380
<5-1,Chase>就因为他腹部真有挫伤
<5-1,Chase>Just because he's got abdominal bruising

187
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,110
<5-1,Chase>也不意味着他没有在装麻木感
<5-1,Chase>doesn't mean he wasn't faking the numbness.

188
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,100
<5-2,Adams>他没有就叛国罪的指控进行狡辩
<5-2,Adams>He's not contesting the treason charges.

189
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,670
<5-2,Adams>如果他的荣誉感那么强
<5-2,Adams>If his code of honor is that strong,

190
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,610
<5-2,Adams>他是不会装病的
<5-2,Adams>he's not gonna bother faking symptoms.

191
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,930
<5-3,House>认罪可不光荣
<5-3,House>Pleading guilty is not honorable.

192
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,250
<5-3,House>只是犯傻
<5-3,House>It's just stupid.

193
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,280
<5-4,Adams>远端食管破裂可致
<5-4,Adams>A distal esophageal rupture can lead to

194
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,810
<5-4,Adams>他大腿部的骨筋膜室综合征
<5-4,Adams>compartment syndrome in his thigh,

195
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,350
<5-4,Adams>解释了他的两种症状
<5-4,Adams>explains both symptoms.

196
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,570
<5-5,Taub>无吞咽疼痛
<5-5,Taub>No pain when he swallows.

197
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,730
<5-6,House>什么是荣誉
<5-6,House>What is honor?

198
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,120
<5-6,House>为国赴死吗
<5-6,House>Dying for your country?

199
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,290
<5-6,House>成绩全优吗
<5-6,House>Getting straight As?

200
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,530
<5-6,House>掐死自己的女儿
<5-6,House>Killing your daughter

201
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,490
<5-6,House>因为她竟敢被强奸
<5-6,House>because she had the audacity to get raped?

202
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,920
<5-7,Taub>腹主动脉瘤破裂
<5-7,Taub>Ruptured triple-a.

203
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,570
<5-8,Park>解释不了抽蓄
<5-8,Park>Doesn't explain the seizures.

204
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,230
<5-9,Chase>胰腺炎
<5-9,Chase>Pancreatitis.

205
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,730
<5-9,Chase>胆石阻塞胰管
<5-9,Chase>Gallstones obstructing his pancreatic duct.

206
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,670
<5-10,House>人们将荣誉定义为
<5-10,House>People define honor

207
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,450
<5-10,House>能让自己有荣誉感的事
<5-10,House>As whatever makes them feel honorable.

208
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
<5-10,House>这种逻辑圈得不出任何结论
<5-10,House>It's a circle going nowhere.

209
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,950
<5-10,House>不过圆圈本来就是这样
<5-10,House>which I guess is what circles do.

210
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,280
<5-11,Taub>做个B超  了解有无胆系梗阻
<5-11,Taub>We'll ultrasound his belly and look for the obstruction.

211
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,490
<5-12,Adams>这张单子需要你的签名
<5-12,Adams>I need your signature on this order.

212
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,640
<5-12,Adams>军方要求福曼保证
<5-12,Adams>The army's leaning on Foreman to make sure

213
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,790
<5-12,Adams>一切都照章办事
<5-12,Adams>this is done by the book.

214
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,470
<5-13,House>上次给他治疗时没要签单子
<5-13,House>Didn't need an order for his last treatment.

215
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,730
<5-14,Adams>上次的治疗不算治疗
<5-14,Adams>This last treatment wasn't a treatment.

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,010
<5-15,House>-你伪造一下  -我会的
<5-15,House>- Forge it. - I will.

217
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,040
<5-16,Adams>从现在开始
<5-16,Adams>From now on.

218
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,280
<5-16,Adams>但我需要有原始签名才能伪造
<5-16,Adams>But I need the original so I know what to forge.

219
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,450
<6-1,Gloria>他开始头晕的时候我们在喝咖啡
<6-1,Gloria>We were having coffee when the dizziness started.

220
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,670
<6-2,Wilson>商务会谈吗
<6-2,Wilson>Business meeting?

221
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,580
<6-3,Mel>约会
<6-3,Mel>Date.

222
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,720
<6-3,Mel>第一次

223
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,910
<6-3,Mel>我们在一元商店里认识的
<6-3,Mel>We met at the 98 Cents Store.

224
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,920
<6-4,Gloria>当时我们同时要拿同一块奶酪
<6-4,Gloria>We were reaching for the same tube of cheese.

225
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,180
<6-6,Adams>很抱歉
<6-6,Adams>I'm sorry.

226
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,110
<6-7,Wilson>怎么了
<6-7,Wilson>Yeah.

227
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,350
<6-8,Adams>我要跟你谈谈
<6-8,Adams>I need to talk to you.

228
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,590
<6-9,Wilson>快好了
<6-9,Wilson>Just about done.

229
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,620
<6-10,Wilson>好消息是  从她节俭的消费习惯
<6-10,Wilson>Good news, based on her thrifty shopping habits

230
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,910
<6-10,Wilson>以及选择人造奶制品来看
<6-10,Wilson>and taste for artificial dairy,

231
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,660
<6-10,Wilson>她和你约会明显不是为了钱
<6-10,Wilson>she's clearly not a gold digger.

232
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
<6-10,Wilson>坏消息是
<6-10,Wilson>Bad news:

233
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,730
<6-10,Wilson>根据他的抠鼻强迫症来看  他是
<6-10,Wilson>Based on his rhinotillexomania, he is.

234
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,700
<6-10,Wilson>也就是对抠鼻子上瘾
<6-10,Wilson>Compulsive addiction to nose-picking.

235
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,780
<6-10,Wilson>左鼻孔内有一处损伤
<6-10,Wilson>A small cut on the inside of the left nostril

236
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,900
<6-10,Wilson>导致海绵窦感染
<6-10,Wilson>led to an infection in the cavernous sinus.

237
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,360
<6-11,Gloria>很高兴认识你  梅尔
<6-11,Gloria>It was very nice meeting you, Mel.

238
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,840
<6-12,Mel>不是这样的
<6-12,Mel>It's not true.

239
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,310
<6-12,Mel>格洛瑞娅  等等
<6-12,Mel>Gloria, wait,

240
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,740
<6-12,Mel>我会改的
<6-12,Mel>I can change.

241
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,580
<6-13,Adams>这是我的工作合同
<6-13,Adams>My PPTH contract.

242
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,600
<6-13,Adams>豪斯在六个月前签的
<6-13,Adams>House signed it six months ago.

243
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,280
<6-13,Adams>这是今天签的
<6-13,Adams>He signed this today.

244
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,000
<6-14,Adams>他的手抖
<6-14,Adams>His hands are unsteady.

245
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,090
<6-14,Adams>考虑到他滥用维柯丁
<6-14,Adams>Given his vicodin abuse,

246
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,770
<6-14,Adams>我认为他患有肝性脑病
<6-14,Adams>I think he has hepatic encephalopathy.

247
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,760
<6-14,Adams>他健忘  心不在焉
<6-14,Adams>He's been forgetful, inattentive.

248
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,160
<6-15,Wilson>多米尼卡在尝试新式克尼什馅饼
<6-15,Wilson>Dominika's been trying out new knish recipes.

249
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,430
<6-15,Wilson>其中一个他吃了不太舒服
<6-15,Wilson>One of them didn't agree with him.

250
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,240
<6-15,Wilson>睡眠不足可能导致
<6-15,Wilson>A little sleep deprivation could account

251
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
<6-15,Wilson>健忘和心不在焉
<6-15,Wilson>for his forgetfulness and inattention.

252
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,830
<6-15,Wilson>他摄入太多咖啡因  可能导致手部颤抖
<6-15,Wilson>He loads up on caffeine. That explains a jittery hand.

253
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,680
<6-15,Wilson>有可能
<6-15,Wilson>Maybe.

254
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,390
<6-16,Adams>但如果我是对的  他的肝功能正在衰退
<6-16,Adams>But if I'm right, his liver's in decline.

255
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,970
<6-16,Adams>这是可以治愈的  但如果他不接受治疗
<6-16,Adams>It's curable, but if he doesn't get treatment,

256
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,430
<6-16,Adams>可能会致命
<6-16,Adams>It could actually be fatal.

257
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,650
<6-17,Wilson>这种事我见多了
<6-17,Wilson>This happens all the time.

258
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,720
<6-17,Wilson>为豪斯工作的一个副作用就是
<6-17,Wilson>One of the symptoms of working for House--

259
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,010
<6-17,Wilson>你会变得十分多疑
<6-17,Wilson>you start seeing zebras everywhere.

260
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,420
<6-17,Wilson>他什么事都没
<6-17,Wilson>There's nothing wrong with him.

261
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,020
<7-1,Wilson>豪斯
<7-1,Wilson>House.

262
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,770
<7-2,House>嘘  有病人呢
<7-2,House>Shh. I'm with a patient.

263
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,120
<7-3,House>睡眠研究
<7-3,House>Sleep study.

264
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,200
<7-4,Wilson>你给他下药了
<7-4,Wilson>You drugged him?

265
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,960
<7-5,House>我又没说他是自愿的
<7-5,House>I didn't say the study was voluntary.

266
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,760
<7-6,Wilson>我认为你病了
<7-6,Wilson>I think you're sick.

267
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,910
<7-7,House>因为我在诊所里睡觉吗  我一直如此
<7-7,House>What, 'cause I'm sleeping in the clinic like I always do?

268
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,530
<7-8,Wilson>反应慢
<7-8,Wilson>Slow reaction time.

269
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,330
<7-9,House>因为我刚在诊所里睡醒
<7-9,House>Because I just woke up from sleeping in the clinic

270
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,330
<7-7,House>我一直如此
<7-7,House>like I always do.

271
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,870
<7-10,Wilson>你健忘
<7-10,Wilson>You're forgetful.

272
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,590
<7-11,House>抱歉  你刚才说什么
<7-11,House>Sorry. What did you say?

273
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,070
<7-12,Wilson>你忘了我们约好一起吃午饭
<7-12,Wilson>You forgot that we were supposed to have lunch.

274
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,200
<7-13,House>我没忘
<7-13,House>I didn't forget.

275
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,480
<7-13,House>我只是在诊所里睡觉
<7-13,House>I was sleeping in the clinic--

276
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,150
<7-14,Wilson>我要给你做检查
<7-14,Wilson>I'd like to run some tests.

277
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,070
<7-15,House>为什么
<7-15,House>For what?

278
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,500
<7-15,House>你怎么了
<7-15,House>Where's this coming from?

279
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,460
<7-15,House>肝性脑病
<7-15,House>Hepatic encephalopathy.

280
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,930
<7-16,Wilson>我看着你年复一年滥用维柯丁伤身
<7-16,Wilson>I've watched you destroy your body with vicodin for years.

281
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,980
<7-16,Wilson>你的肝能撑这么久真是奇迹
<7-16,Wilson>I'm surprised your liver's lasted this long.

282
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,210
<7-16,Wilson>我会亲自给你做检查
<7-16,Wilson>I'll do the examination myself.

283
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,070
<7-17,House>虽然让你捣鼓我的小叮当挺有意思
<7-17,House>While having you juggle my jewels sounds interesting,

284
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,840
<7-17,House>但是炮友什么的都是浮云
<7-17,House>There's no such thing as friends with benefits.

285
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,860
<7-17,House>最后总是会尴尬的
<7-17,House>It always gets weird.

286
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,020
<8-1,Chase>你外面的朋友们看上去很谨慎
<8-1,Chase>Your friends out there are getting a little handsy.

287
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,980
<8-2,Brant>收到了太多的死亡威胁
<8-2,Brant>Get enough death threats,

288
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,120
<8-2,Brant>他们现在终于把这当一回事了
<8-2,Brant>eventually they start taking them seriously.

289
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,130
<8-3,Hayes>一个护航队在库纳尔省外遭袭击
<8-3,Hayes>A convoy was hit outside of Kunar Province.

290
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,730
<8-3,Hayes>八名美军士兵因此死亡
<8-3,Hayes>Eight american soldiers were killed.

291
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,310
<8-4,Brant>军方发言人称
<8-4,Brant>Army spokesperson's claiming that

292
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,360
<8-4,Brant>这是起报复行动  针对被我曝光的事件
<8-4,Brant>it's revenge for the attack that I made public.

293
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,970
<8-4,Brant>他们最好把责任都推卸给我
<8-4,Brant>Better me take the blame than them.

294
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,160
<8-5,Park>你不认为这是你的过错吗
<8-5,Park>You don't think you're to blame at all?

295
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,570
<8-6,Brant>你这么认为
<8-6,Brant>And you do.

296
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,080
<8-6,Brant>和所有人一样
<8-6,Brant>Like everyone else.

297
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,610
<8-6,Brant>这种袭击至少需要三天时间准备
<8-6,Brant>A strike like that would take more than three days to plan.

298
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,710
<8-7,Hayes>那么下一次可能是你的过错了
<8-7,Hayes>So the next one might be your fault?

299
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,860
<8-8,Chase>侧面没什么问题
<8-8,Chase>Lateral view looks good.

300
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,430
<8-8,Chase>如果你那么讨厌军方
<8-8,Chase>If you have such a negative opinion of the army,

301
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,590
<8-8,Chase>为什么要入伍
<8-8,Chase>why did you enlist?

302
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,370
<8-9,Brant>我想知道父亲死亡的真相
<8-9,Brant>I needed to find out what really happened to my dad.

303
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,530
<8-9,Brant>他的服役记录中有两页是伪造的
<8-9,Brant>There were two redacted pages in his service record.

304
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,420
<8-9,Brant>进入情报科是提高我安全权限的
<8-9,Brant>Going into intelligence was the quickest way

305
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,070
<8-9,Brant>最快方法
<8-9,Brant>to up my security clearance.

306
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,650
<8-10,Chase>那你为什么要把视频曝光
<8-10,Chase>Then why would you leak that video?

307
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,300
<8-11,Brant>我工作的一部分是和当地人喝茶聊天
<8-11,Brant>Part of my job was to grab a cup of tea with the locals.

308
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,980
<8-11,Brant>这种面谈是为了让他们更信任我们
<8-11,Brant>The face time is supposed to make them more likely

309
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,020
<8-11,Brant>从而得到更敏感的信息
<8-11,Brant>to trust us with sensitive information,

310
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,180
<8-11,Brant>但他们成了我的朋友
<8-11,Brant>But they became my friends.

311
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,710
<8-11,Brant>如果发生另一起袭击
<8-11,Brant>If there was another attack,

312
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,090
<8-11,Brant>造成平民伤亡
<8-11,Brant>civilian casualties,

313
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,340
<8-11,Brant>而我什么都没做的话
<8-11,Brant>and I had done nothing...

314
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,800
<8-12,Park>你的脾脏增大了
<8-12,Park>Your spleen, it's enlarged.

315
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,370
<8-12,Park>我们要做活检  检查是否...
<8-12,Park>We should do a biopsy and look for any--

316
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,720
<8-13,Chase>他开始尿血
<8-13,Chase>He's got urinary bleeding.

317
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,720
<8-14,Park>不只是尿血
<8-14,Park>Not just urinary.

318
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,550
<8-15,Chase>打电话给血库
<8-15,Chase>Call the blood bank.

319
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,690
<8-16,Hayes>他怎么了
<8-16,Hayes>What's happening to him?

320
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,820
<8-17,Chase>他的脾脏不再释放血小板
<8-17,Chase>His spleen must be sequestering platelets.

321
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,460
<8-18,Park>他出血太快
<8-18,Park>He's bleeding too fast to wait

322
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,570
<8-18,Park>等不到输血小板
<8-18,Park>for a platelet infusion.

323
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,590
<8-19,Chase>需要挤压脾脏
<8-19,Chase>We need to squeeze his spleen

324
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,840
<8-19,Chase>来释放他自身的血小板
<8-19,Chase>to release the ones he's got.

325
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,640
<8-19,Chase>通知手术室  我们马上过去
<8-19,Chase>Tell the O.R. We're on our way.

326
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,670
<9-1,Taub>血压在下降
<9-1,Taub>Pressure's dropping.

327
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,410
<9-2,Chase>快好了
<9-2,Chase>Almost there.

328
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,660
<9-3,Taub>血压70/40
<9-3,Taub>Bp's 70 over 40,

329
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,100
<9-3,Taub>他血容量不足
<9-3,Taub>and he's hypovolemic.

330
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,930
<9-4,Adams>血压回升了
<9-4,Adams>Pressure's rising.

331
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,560
<9-5,Taub>开始凝血了
<9-5,Taub>And he's starting to clot.

332
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,380
<9-6,Chase>好消息是我们止住出血了
<9-6,Chase>Good news is we can control the bleeding.

333
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,850
<9-6,Chase>坏消息是
<9-6,Chase>Bad news is...

334
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,010
<9-6,Chase>出血不是主要问题
<9-6,Chase>bleeding's not the problem.

335
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,380
<9-6,Chase>除非脾脏表面本身就凹凸不平
<9-6,Chase>Unless spleens are supposed to be lumpy.

336
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,210
<10-1,Adams>血是止住了  但CT显示
<10-1,Adams>He's clotting, but CT confirms

337
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,200
<10-1,Adams>他有脾结节
<10-1,Adams>splenic nodules.

338
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
<10-1,Adams>陶博医生有个有趣的想法
<10-1,Adams>Dr. Taub has an interesting theory.

339
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,600
<10-2,Taub>不  我没有
<10-2,Taub>No, I don't.

340
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,270
<10-3,House>你不行吗
<10-3,House>You're forfeiting?

341
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,260
<10-3,House>因为如果你不能边玩边工作的话
<10-3,House>'cause if you can't play the game and work...

342
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,620
<10-4,Taub>髓外血细胞生成
<10-4,Taub>Extramedullary hematopoiesis.

343
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,910
<10-5,Park>无贫血史
<10-5,Park>No history of anemia.

344
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,090
<10-6,House>她说得对  你是个白痴  再来
<10-6,House>She's right. You're an idiot. Try again.

345
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,220
<10-7,Taub>在我们那里  这是作弊
<10-7,Taub>Where I come from, this is called cheating.

346
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,120
<10-8,House>你从哪里来  菊花镇吗
<10-8,House>Where's that? Stickford-upon-anus?

347
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,750
<10-9,Taub>结核病
<10-9,Taub>TB.

348
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,070
<10-10,Chase>结核菌素试验阴性
<10-10,Chase>PPD's negative.

349
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,890
<10-10,Chase>可能是布鲁...
<10-10,Chase>Could be Bru--

350
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,420
<10-11,House>别打断陶博医生
<10-11,House>Don't interrupt Dr. Taub.

<10-12,Taub>布鲁杆菌病
<10-12,Taub>Brucellosis.

352
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,270
<10-12,Taub>你刚杀了一家四口
<10-12,Taub>You just took out a family of four.

353
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,290
<10-13,House>他们明显是武装分子
<10-13,House>They were clearly armed insurgents,

354
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,850
<10-13,House>如果有人反对或有异议  他就是叛国分子
<10-13,House>and anyone who claims or proves otherwise is a traitor.

355
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,060
<10-13,House>没红疹及背痛
<10-13,House>No rash or back pain.

356
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,470
<10-14,Adams>病人是个告密者  你替他辩护
<10-14,Adams>You defend the patient for being a whistleblower,

357
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,180
<10-14,Adams>然后攻击他是个有荣誉感的告密者
<10-14,Adams>then attack him for being an honorable whistleblower.

358
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,330
<10-14,Adams>现在你又维护他
<10-14,Adams>Now you defend him for being

359
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,340
<10-14,Adams>因为他是个恶意的有荣誉感的告密者
<10-14,Adams>a maligned, honorable whistleblower?

360
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,410
<10-15,House>形容词真有用
<10-15,House>Adjectives matter.

361
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,590
<10-15,House>讨厌护士  大爱调皮的护士
<10-15,House>Hate nurses, love naughty nurses.

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,040
<10-15,House>陶博  再来

<10-16,Taub>- I've pitched like five-- - It's your turn.

364
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,910
<10-18,Taub>淋巴瘤
<10-18,Taub>Lymphoma.

365
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,990
<10-19,Adams>如果是癌症引起的抽蓄
<10-19,Adams>If cancer caused his seizures,

366
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,280
<10-19,Adams>头颅CT应可见到颅内肿物
<10-19,Adams>we would have seen cerebral masses on his head CT.

367
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,950
<10-21,House>-好的  -陶博  再来一个
<10-21,House>- Yes! - Taub, pitch again.

<10-22,Taub>脾脏结节为肉芽肿
<10-22,Taub>The nodules in his spleen were granulomas.

<10-22,Taub>他得了伯克氏肉样瘤
<10-22,Taub>He's got Sarcoidosis!

371
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,450
<10-23,House>有反对意见吗
<10-23,House>Someone tell him he's wrong.

372
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,540
<10-24,Chase>抱歉  豪斯
<10-24,Chase>Sorry, House.

373
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,670
<10-24,Chase>肉样瘤能解释癫痫发作
<10-24,Chase>Sarcoid does explain the seizures.

374
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,840
<10-25,Park>以及出现的瘀青
<10-25,Park>And the bruises.

375
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,620
<10-26,Taub>认输吧  豪斯
<10-26,Taub>Say bye-bye, House.

376
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
<10-27,Taub>好耶

377
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,110

<10-28,House>Treat with steroids.

380
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
<10-28,House>然后立马给我回来
<10-28,House>Then come right back here,

381
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,020
<10-28,House>不把你们累个半死不活
<10-28,House>'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've made orphans

382
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,870
<10-28,House>我是不会善罢甘休的
<10-28,House>of all your virtual children.

383
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,390
<11-1,Adams>豪斯从来没有输过
<11-1,Adams>House never loses.

384
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,550
<11-2,Taub>你没开玩笑吧
<11-2,Taub>Seriously?

385
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,260
<11-2,Taub>他被我打败也算是种病症吗
<11-2,Taub>Me beating House is medically significant?

386
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,510
<11-3,Park>有可能
<11-3,Park>It could be.

387
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,720
<11-3,Park>细微运动控制能力的减退
<11-3,Park>Reduced fine motor control.

388
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,420
<11-3,Park>加上他注意力不集中以及肝病性扑动
<11-3,Park>Add that to inattention and liver flap.

389
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,550
<11-3,Park>这确实是种病症
<11-3,Park>It does make sense.

390
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,900
<11-4,Adams>我们得告诉福曼
<11-4,Adams>We have to talk to Foreman.

391
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,480
<11-4,Adams>没必要告诉他
<11-4,Adams>No, we don't.

392
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,040
<11-5,Taub>首先
<11-5,Taub>First of all,

393
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,760
<11-5,Taub>我有能力赢他
<11-5,Taub>because I can beat him in that game.

394
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,190
<11-5,Taub>其次  就算你是对的
<11-5,Taub>And, second, even if you are right,

395
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,710
<11-5,Taub>也没有证据表明
<11-5,Taub>there's no reason to believe

396
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,490
<11-5,Taub>豪斯的判断能力受到了影响
<11-5,Taub>that House's medical judgment is impaired.

397
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,080
<11-6,Adams>这么说我们只能等到他误诊死病人
<11-6,Adams>So we should wait until he kills someone

398
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
<11-6,Adams>才能确诊吗
<11-6,Adams>for confirmation?

399
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,470
<11-7,Chase>你真的认为这是个巧合吗
<11-7,Chase>You really think it's a coincidence

400
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,760
<11-7,Chase>治疗一名告密者的同时
<11-7,Chase>that we're treating a whistleblower

401
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,330
<11-7,Chase>我们却合计着要告豪斯的密
<11-7,Chase>and now talking about blowing the whistle on House?

402
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,960
<11-7,Chase>你说得没错
<11-7,Chase>You're right.

403
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,630
<11-7,Chase>反应迟钝  笔迹潦草
<11-7,Chase>Playing dumb, messy signature,

404
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,990
<11-7,Chase>游戏失败
<11-7,Chase>losing a video game...

405
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,190
<11-7,Chase>这一切太难作假了
<11-7,Chase>It's way too complicated to fake.

406
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,170
<12-1,Brant>不  我不要打针
<12-1,Brant>No. I won't take it.

407
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,750
<12-2,Taub>不打这针
<12-2,Taub>Without this injection,

408
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,360
<12-2,Taub>你很可能会因心律不齐而丧命
<12-2,Taub>you could have a fatal arrhythmia.

409
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,330
<12-3,Brant>去告诉马修森少校
<12-3,Brant>Tell Major Mathewson

410
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,220
<12-3,Brant>在他们给我安排电视访谈之前
<12-3,Brant>that I'm not taking any more treatment

411
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,520
<12-3,Brant>我不再接受任何治疗
<12-3,Brant>until they give me a live television interview.

412
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,320
<12-4,Hayes>你真的认为他们会答应吗
<12-4,Hayes>You can't really think they'll agree to that.

413
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,880
<12-5,Brant>我得让人们知道
<12-5,Brant>People need to know

414
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,030
<12-5,Brant>袭击不是由那盘录像带引起的
<12-5,Brant>the tape's not the reason for that attack.

415
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,170
<12-5,Brant>我得告诉他们我这么做的目的
<12-5,Brant>They need to know why I did this.

416
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,030
<12-6,Taub>那些把你看作是叛徒的人
<12-6,Taub>The people who think you're a traitor

417
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,370
<12-6,Taub>仍会当你是叛徒
<12-6,Taub>will still think you're a traitor,

418
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,050
<12-6,Taub>那些将你视为英雄的人
<12-6,Taub>And the people who think you're a hero

419
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,730
<12-6,Taub>仍将视你为英雄
<12-6,Taub>will still think you're a hero.

420
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,690
<12-7,Brant>传达真相意义重大
<12-7,Brant>The truth makes a difference.

421
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,450
<12-8,Hayes>如果老爸还健在  他会哀求你别这么干的
<12-8,Hayes>If dad were here, he'd be begging for you not to do this.

422
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,030
<12-9,Brant>如果他健在  他会为我自豪的
<12-9,Brant>If dad were here, he'd be proud of me.

424
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,050
<13-1,Taub>如果这病人死了
<13-1,Taub>The conspiracy theorists are gonna go nuts

425
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,070
<13-1,Taub>阴谋论者会借题发挥的
<13-1,Taub>if the patient dies.

426
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,940
<13-2,Foreman>我和他这么说了  但是他告诉我
<13-2,Foreman>I told him that, and he told me

427
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,560
<13-2,Foreman>就算这样  负面影响
<13-2,Foreman>that option is still less damaging

428
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,530
<13-2,Foreman>仍然会比给他做访谈来得小
<13-2,Foreman>than giving the kid a national platform.

429
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,550
<13-3,Hayes>我们现在怎么办呢
<13-3,Hayes>So what do we do now?

430
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,820
<13-4,Taub>你去和你兄弟解释
<13-4,Taub>You explain to your brother

431
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,190
<13-4,Taub>他这招玩得过火了
<13-4,Taub>that he overplayed his hand.

432
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,830
<13-5,Hayes>这还是于事无补啊
<13-5,Hayes>That won't make any difference.

433
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,680
<13-5,Hayes>那个傻瓜坚信自己做得没错
<13-5,Hayes>The idiot thinks he's doing the right thing.

434
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,020
<13-6,Chase>如果我们让法庭相信他拒绝治疗
<13-6,Chase>What if we convinced a court that his refusal

435
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,440
<13-6,Chase>是源于潜在的精神障碍呢
<13-6,Chase>is part of an underlying psychiatric disorder?

436
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,940
<13-6,Chase>他们指派一个监护人  就是我们说了算了
<13-6,Chase>They assign a conservator. We do what we want.

437
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,140
<13-7,Foreman>你这是诈骗  妙啊
<13-7,Foreman>Fraud. Great.

438
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,400
<13-8,Chase>自恋型人格障碍
<13-8,Chase>Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

439
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,660
<13-8,Chase>泄露录像以及拒绝治疗
<13-8,Chase>Both the leaking of the tape and the refusal of treatment

440
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,580
<13-8,Chase>都说明他对行为的后果毫不在意
<13-8,Chase>indicate that he has no fear of consequences.

441
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,110
<13-9,Foreman>这么说你不准备欺骗法庭了
<13-9,Foreman>So instead of defrauding the court,

442
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,300
<13-9,Foreman>而是要浪费他们的时间
<13-9,Foreman>you'll waste their time?

443
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,570
<13-9,Foreman>没有一个法官会把人格障碍
<13-9,Foreman>No way a judge classifies a personality disorder

444
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,670
<13-9,Foreman>当作是精神疾病处理的
<13-9,Foreman>as a mental illness.

445
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,650
<13-10,Taub>如果这一说法被一个军功显赫
<13-10,Taub>If a decorated military officer, who happened

446
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,960
<13-10,Taub>同时又身为病人哥哥的军官证实  法庭可能会相信
<13-10,Taub>to be the patient's brother, corroborates, they might.

447
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,960
<13-11,Hayes>这么说你要我签字
<13-11,Hayes>So you want me to sign a piece of paper

448
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,870
<13-11,Hayes>证明我弟弟是疯子
<13-11,Hayes>that says my brother is crazy

449
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,360
<13-11,Hayes>就因为他坚持了自己的信念
<13-11,Hayes>for doing what he thinks is right?

450
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,050
<13-12,Taub>我想你救他的命
<13-12,Taub>I want you to save his life.

451
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,820
<13-12,Taub>他随时有心律不齐的危险
<13-12,Taub>His heart could go at any time.

452
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,880
<13-13,Hayes>他是个傻瓜
<13-13,Hayes>He's a fool.

453
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,490
<13-13,Hayes>但不是疯子
<13-13,Hayes>But he's not crazy.

454
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,940
<14-1,Chase>病人出于荣誉感
<14-1,Chase>The patient was refusing treatment

455
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,410
<14-1,Chase>拒绝治疗  而他哥哥
<14-1,Chase>because of honor, and his brother

456
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,200
<14-1,Chase>出于荣誉感
<14-1,Chase>Is refusing to be his conservator

457
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,150
<14-1,Chase>拒绝当他的监护人
<14-1,Chase>because of honor.

458
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,990
<14-2,House>很好
<14-2,House>Oh, good.

459
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,670
<14-2,House>陶博把病人治好了
<14-2,House>Taub's cured the patient.

460
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,420
<14-3,Taub>我上厕所去了
<14-3,Taub>I had to go to the bathroom.

461
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,870
<14-4,House>厕所在那个方向  你是从那边走过来的
<14-4,House>Bathroom's that way. You just ran in from that way.

462
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,390
<14-5,Taub>那个厕所坏了两天了
<14-5,Taub>That one's been out of order for two days.

463
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,710
<14-5,Taub>我不得不去三楼上
<14-5,Taub>I had to go up to the third floor.

464
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
<14-6,Taub>我没骗你
<14-6,Taub>I'm not lying.

465
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,680
<14-6,Taub>是真的坏了
<14-6,Taub>It's out of order.

466
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,290
<14-7,House>我相信你  我去修好它
<14-7,House>I believe you. I'm gonna fix it.

467
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,460
<14-8,Chase>我们可以在他不知不觉中给他治疗
<14-8,Chase>We could treat if he doesn't know he's being treated.

468
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,760
<14-8,Chase>用药物进行海绵擦浴
<14-8,Chase>Lace his sponge bath.

469
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,040
<14-9,Park>擦浴见效太慢
<14-9,Park>It would take too long to reach his bloodstream.

470
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,720
<14-10,Adams>在他房间里喷雾化类固醇呢
<14-10,Adams>What if we aerosolize steroids and blast the room?

471
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,010
<14-11,House>这个么...
<14-11,House>Speaking of which...

472
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,950
<14-12,House>很难控制泼尼松的浓度
<14-12,House>It'd be too hard to get the prednisone concentrations right.

473
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,850
<14-12,House>如果不给出些气势逼人的理由
<14-12,House>No one fixes anything

474
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,460
<14-12,House>是不会有人来修马桶的
<14-12,House>unless they have a compelling reason.

475
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,310
<14-13,House>我们要想医治他的话
<14-13,House>If we're gonna treat,

476
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,790
<14-13,House>得给他个比采访
<14-13,House>we have to give him a compelling reason,

477
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,790
<14-13,House>更感兴趣的理由
<14-13,House>something that he wants more than an interview.

478
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,750
<14-13,House>屎炮攻击
<14-13,House>Fire in the hole!

479
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,140
<15-1,Chase>这是马修森少校签署的命令
<15-1,Chase>A signed order from Major Mathewson.

480
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,740
<15-1,Chase>他们同意将你父亲的档案
<15-1,Chase>They've agreed to declassify the redacted pages

481
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,440
<15-1,Chase>进行解密了
<15-1,Chase>from your father's service record.

482
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,390
<15-1,Chase>两天后  你就能得到答案了
<15-1,Chase>In two days, you'll have all your answers.

483
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,700
<15-2,Taub>但是你只有接受治疗
<15-2,Taub>But the only way you'll live long enough to get the truth

484
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,340
<15-2,Taub>才活得到那个时候
<15-2,Taub>is by accepting treatment.

485
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,260
<15-3,Brant>我不相信军队最终会解密
<15-3,Brant>I don't trust the army to follow through on this.

486
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,440
<15-4,Hayes>但是你可以相信我
<15-4,Hayes>But you trust me.

487
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,370
<15-4,Hayes>我会保证那些文件送达这里
<15-4,Hayes>I'll make sure those pages get here.

488
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,500
<15-5,Brant>好的
<15-5,Brant>Okay.

489
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,650
<15-5,Brant>现在自私自利也算是荣耀吗
<15-5,Brant>Selfishness is apparently honorable now.

490
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,800
<16-1,Chase>他当初想要做出改变
<16-1,Chase>He wanted to create change.

491
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,080
<16-1,Chase>但现在只是满足自己的好奇心
<16-1,Chase>Instead, he's just satisfying his own curiosity.

492
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,160
<16-2,Taub>他要知道真相了  这是他最大的心愿
<16-2,Taub>He's getting the truth. Most he could hope for.

493
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,460
<16-2,Taub>我去上个大号
<16-2,Taub>I need to take a dump.

494
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,470
<16-2,Taub>确切的说  是去拿豪斯的大号
<16-2,Taub>Specifically, House's dump.

495
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,640
<16-2,Taub>这是你一手策划的吗
<16-2,Taub>You set this up?

496
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,420
<17-1,Adams>我只需要晚到这么一两分钟
<17-1,Adams>All it took was showing up two minutes late

497
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,230
<17-2,Taub>再花两块钱买个牌子
<17-2,Taub>and a $2 sign.

498
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,720
<17-2,Taub>胆汁沉着物不规则
<17-2,Taub>Bile deposits are irregular.

499
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,100
<17-2,Taub>豪斯的肝脏在衰竭
<17-2,Taub>House's liver is failing.

500
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,140
<17-3,Chase>认知缺损会渐进性恶化
<17-3,Chase>Cognitive impairment will get progressively worse.

501
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,240
<17-3,Chase>怎么了
<17-3,Chase>What's going on?

502
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,510
<18-1,Taub>我的脚
<18-1,Taub>My foot.

503
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,590
<18-2,Brant>疼死我了
<18-2,Brant>It's killing me.

504
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,870
<18-3,Adams>它完全发绀了
<18-3,Adams>It's completely cyanotic.

505
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,940
<18-3,Adams>这不是伯克氏肉样瘤
<18-3,Adams>This isn't Sarcoidosis.

506
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,200
<19-1,House>胆固醇栓塞
<19-1,House>Cholesterol Embolization.

507
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,680
<19-2,Park>我们前面和你说的  你到底承认不承认
<19-2,Park>Are you gonna even acknowledge what we just told you?

508
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,230
<19-3,House>你们偷了我的大便
<19-3,House>That you pilfered my poo-poo?

509
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,780
<19-3,House>我想如果我们大家假装这事儿没发生过
<19-3,House>Yeah, I was thinking it would be less awkward

510
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,270
<19-3,House>也许就不会这么尴尬了
<19-3,House>for all of us if we could just pretend that never happened.

511
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,640
<19-4,Adams>这不是栓塞
<19-4,Adams>It's not an embolization.

512
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,570
<19-4,Adams>动脉内无固定物
<19-4,Adams>No instrumentation inside the arteries.

513
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,840
<19-5,House>谢谢你言归正传
<19-5,House>Thank you for getting us back.

514
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,900
<19-6,Adams>如果现在开始对你进行治疗的话
<19-6,Adams>And if we start you on treatment now,

515
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,840
<19-6,Adams>让你戒断维柯丁
<19-6,Adams>Get you off vicodin.

516
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,390
<19-7,House>"谢谢你"的反义词是什么啊
<19-7,House>What's the opposite of "Thank you"?

517
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,360
<19-7,House>我记得是和你妈有关的三字短语
<19-7,House>I'm pretty sure it ends in "You".

518
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,590
<19-7,House>我的身体我了解  我很好
<19-7,House>I know my body. I'm fine.

519
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,710
<19-7,House>高铁血红蛋白血症
<19-7,House>Methemoglobinemia.

520
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,700
<19-8,Chase>军队里检查过葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症
<19-8,Chase>Army tests for G6PD Deficiency.

521
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,280
<19-9,Chase>如果你没有病
<19-9,Chase>If you're not sick,

522
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,270
<19-9,Chase>就是说这个精度高达99.5%的检测
<19-9,Chase>then our test, accurate 99.5% of the time,

523
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,800
<19-9,Chase>分别三次出现假阳性
<19-9,Chase>yielded a false positive three separate times.

524
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,660
<19-9,Chase>这个可能仅为八百万分之一
<19-9,Chase>The odds of that are 1 in 8 million.

525
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,730
<19-10,House>你们的检测没有错  是诊断出错了
<19-10,House>The test is accurate. The diagnosis isn't.

526
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,800
<19-10,House>显然  样本受到了其他食物的污染
<19-10,House>Sample was obviously contaminated with other foods

527
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,320
<19-10,House>与我的肝脏酶互相影响
<19-10,House>interacting with my liver enzymes.

528
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,180
<19-10,House>我们能谈谈病人了吗
<19-10,House>Now could we talk about the sick patient?

529
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,350
<19-11,Park>他的血凝块溶解了
<19-11,Park>His clot dissolved.

530
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,090
<19-11,Park>这能够导致血管痉挛
<19-11,Park>That could have caused the vasospasm.

531
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,620
<19-11,Park>弥漫性血管内凝血可以由伯-苏综合征引起
<19-11,Park>D.I.C. could have been caused by bernard soulier syndrome.

532
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,330
<19-11,Park>你病了
<19-11,Park>And you're sick,

533
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,090
<19-11,Park>你得想想办法啊
<19-11,Park>and you have to do something about it.

534
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,700
<19-12,Adams>如果我们有个病例
<19-12,Adams>If we had a patient file with the same symptoms

535
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,690
<19-12,Adams>表现出和你相同的症状
<19-12,Adams>you're exhibiting...

536
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,520
<19-13,House>还有我没表现出来的症状
<19-13,House>And the symptoms I'm not exhibiting?

537
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,770
<19-13,House>黄疸 腹水 肝病性口臭
<19-13,House>Jaundice, ascites, fetor hepaticus.

538
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,760
<19-14,Taub>我们无法得知你是否口臭
<19-14,Taub>We can't tell if your breath stinks

539
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,120
<19-14,Taub>因为你一直像嗑药似的吃薄荷糖
<19-14,Taub>because you've been popping mints like they're vicodin.

540
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,700
<19-15,Chase>你仍然被诊断为肝性脑病
<19-15,Chase>You'd still diagnose hepatic encephalopathy.

541
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,300
<19-15,Chase>因为你培养出的四个医生
<19-15,Chase>I know that because four doctors you trained

542
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,640
<19-15,Chase>一致认为你得的是这个病
<19-15,Chase>have unanimously diagnosed you with hepatic encephalopathy.

543
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,710
<19-16,House>朴克说得没错
<19-16,House>Park's right.

544
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,310
<19-16,House>给病人用肝素治疗
<19-16,House>Treat the patient with heparin.

545
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,840
<20-1,Adams>如果我们四人一起去和福曼说
<20-1,Adams>We'll have a stronger argument

546
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,980
<20-1,Adams>比较容易说动他
<20-1,Adams>if we go to foreman as a united front.

547
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,620
<20-2,Chase>我们各有争论才有说头
<20-2,Chase>We'll have a stronger argument if we have an argument.

548
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,390
<20-2,Chase>就算豪斯病了  那也是他的事  跟福曼无关
<20-2,Chase>If House is sick, it's his business, not Foreman's.

549
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,180
<20-3,Taub>福曼的工作就是确保他手下的医生
<20-3,Taub>Foreman's business is to make sure his doctors

550
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,970
<20-3,Taub>能正常行医  不危及病人的生命
<20-3,Taub>are able to do their jobs, that lives aren't put at risk.

551
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,010
<20-4,Chase>告诉福曼才会殃及病人
<20-4,Chase>Telling Foreman will put lives at risk.

552
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,730
<20-4,Chase>那样做  豪斯要么接受治疗
<20-4,Chase>We tell Foreman, House either agrees to treatment

553
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,790
<20-4,Chase>要么被停职  都意味着他不能行医
<20-4,Chase>or get suspended, which means House gets suspended.

554
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,730
<20-4,Chase>考虑到他有所保留
<20-4,Chase>And considering House at 90%

555
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,760
<20-4,Chase>都要好过这家医院任何使劲全力的医生
<20-4,Chase>is better than any other doctor at this hospital at 100%,

556
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,030
<20-4,Chase>少了他  病人将会得到较低水平的医疗照顾
<20-4,Chase>that meansur patients get a lower standard of care.

557
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,570
<20-5,Park>豪斯是有所保留  或是状态欠佳
<20-5,Park>House could be at 90%, he could be at 60%,

558
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,550
<20-5,Park>我们拿捏不准
<20-5,Park>we don't know.

559
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,040
<20-6,Chase>那在确定之前
<20-6,Chase>And until we do, there's no reason

560
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,850
<20-6,Chase>我们就按兵不动
<20-6,Chase>to do anything more than what we've done.

561
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,170
<21-1,House>视物模糊
<21-1,House>Blurry vision...

562
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,530
<21-1,House>头痛  有点恶心  还有头晕
<21-1,House>headache, a bit of nausea, and dizziness.

563
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,820
<21-1,House>我完全被难住了
<21-1,House>I am completely baffled.

564
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,970
<21-2,College Kid>我喝了八瓶啤酒而已
<21-2,College Kid>I only had eight beers.

565
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,530
<21-2,College Kid>二年级啤酒乒乓球赛就在下周
<21-2,College Kid>Sophomore class pong tournament's in a week.

566
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,970
<21-2,College Kid>我在练酒量
<21-2,College Kid>I'm working on my tolerance.

567
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,590
<21-3,House>单脚跳  唱《爱卡莉》主题曲
<21-3,House>Hop on one foot and sing the iCarly Theme Song.

569
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,940
<21-3,House>别一副你不知道的表情
<21-3,House>Like you don't know it.

570
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,010
<21-4,House>*我心确定  你会看到*
<21-4,House>*I know, you see*

571
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,790
<21-5,House>*世界将为我改变*
<21-5,House>*Somehow the world will change for me*

572
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,400
<21-6,Wilson>*精彩纷呈*
<21-6,Wilson>*And be so wonderful*

573
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,380
<21-7,House>*活在当下  呼吸空气*
<21-7,House>*Live life, breathe air*

574
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,860
<21-4,House>真是的  伙计  你没看到我在会诊吗
<21-4,House>Damn it, man. Can't you see I'm doctoring?

575
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,360
<21-4,House>*我们会到达那世外桃源*
<21-4,House>*We're gonna get there and be so wonderful*

576
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,480
<21-5,House>如果想和我聊天
<21-5,House>If you want to talk to me,

577
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,290
<21-5,House>你可以在一小时后给我买个三明治
<21-5,House>you can buy me a sandwich in an hour.

578
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,780
<21-6,Wilson>我也可以杵在这里等你会诊结束
<21-6,Wilson>Or I could just hover here until you're done.

579
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,190
<21-6,Wilson>*这些*
<21-6,Wilson>*These--*

580
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,320
<21-7,House>够了
<21-7,House>Heard enough.

581
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,290
<21-7,House>一直想不起来"呼吸空气"这句
<21-7,House>Just never could figure out the "Breathe air" part.

582
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,050
<21-7,House>明年  拿威士忌练
<21-7,House>Next year, stick to whiskey.

583
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,860
<21-7,House>至少别再喝一周陈的新啤酒了
<21-7,House>Or at least stay away from week-old green beers.

584
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,940
<21-7,House>威士忌少有添加你不耐的
<21-7,House>A lot less likely to contain tartrazine-laced green food dyes

585
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,560
<21-7,House>酒石黄绿色食品染料
<21-7,House>for which you apparently have an intolerance.

586
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,130
<21-7,House>而且一旦开尿
<21-7,House>Once you break the seal,

587
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,280
<21-7,House>48小时内就能排出体外
<21-7,House>it'll be out of your system in 48 hours.

588
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,850
<21-8,House>我有的选吗
<21-8,House>What are my choices here?

589
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,670
<21-8,House>我跟你说我没事吧
<21-8,House>If I tell you I'm fine,

590
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,800
<21-8,House>你不会信我
<21-8,House>you won't believe me.

591
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,510
<21-9,Wilson>我安排了肝功能测试
<21-9,Wilson>I've scheduled a liver function test.

592
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,380
<21-10,House>我无视你吧  你就直接无视我的无视
<21-10,House>If I ignore you, then you'll just ignore my ignoring.

593
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,200
<21-10,House>老实说  挺没礼貌的
<21-10,House>Which is rude, frankly.

594
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,120
<21-11,Wilson>根据测试结果
<21-11,Wilson>Depending on the results,

595
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,080
<21-11,Wilson>我们再制定治疗计划
<21-11,Wilson>we'll customize a treatment plan.

596
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,300
<21-12,House>要是我跟你说我觉得自己病了需要你的帮助
<21-12,House>If I tell you I think I'm sick and I need your help

597
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,050
<21-12,House>需要找个时间聊一聊
<21-12,House>and we need to set up a time to talk about it,

598
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,490
<21-12,House>你会以为我在撒谎
<21-12,House>you'll just assume I'm lying.

599
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,900
<21-12,House>依旧无礼  还很伤人
<21-12,House>Again, rude. Also hurtful.

600
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,510
<21-13,Wilson>你能找到别人身上最细微的差错
<21-13,Wilson>Why is it that you can find the smallest thing wrong

601
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,070
<21-13,Wilson>可换作是你自己  怎么就
<21-13,Wilson>with anyone else, but when it comes to you...

602
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,860
<21-14,House>我是真的没有选择的余地  你说呢
<21-14,House>I really don't have a choice here, do I?

603
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,610
<21-15,Wilson>确实
<21-15,Wilson>No, you don't.

604
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,770
<21-16,House>我在名单上  他没有
<21-16,House>I'm on the list. But he's not.

605
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,320
<21-17,Wilson>躲得了初一  躲不过十五
<21-17,Wilson>You can't ignore me forever.

606
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,140
<21-18,House>如果你说得对  那也用不了那么久
<21-18,House>Well, if you're right, that's not gonna be all that long.

607
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,010
<21-19,House>慢慢来
<21-19,House>Do it slow.

608
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,960
<21-20,Brant>你是谁
<21-20,Brant>Who are you?

609
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,530
<21-21,House>允许进入这间病房的
<21-21,House>Well, considering the only people allowed

610
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,070
<21-21,House>只有你的医生和家人
<21-21,House>in this room are your doctors and your family...

611
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,300
<21-21,House>我是你失散多年的表兄拉尔夫
<21-21,House>I'm your long-lost cousin Ralph.

612
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,030
<21-21,House>很高兴终于见到你了
<21-21,House>So glad to finally meet you.

613
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,790
<21-22,Brant>你要给我做检查吗
<21-22,Brant>Are you gonna check on me?

614
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,940
<21-23,House>至少要两小时
<21-23,House>It's gonna be at least two hours

615
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,770
<21-23,House>我们才能知道肝素是否起作用
<21-23,House>until we can tell if the heparin's working.

616
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,540
<21-24,Brant>那你来这里干什么
<21-24,Brant>Then what are you doing here?

617
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,800
<21-25,House>我父亲教导我
<21-25,House>You know, my father taught me that it's dishonorable

618
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,940
<21-25,House>不以烦扰他人阅读为荣
<21-25,House>to interrupt someone when they're reading.

619
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,620
<21-26,Brant>荣誉不是戏话
<21-26,Brant>Honor's not a punch line.

620
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,830
<21-26,Brant>出去
<21-26,Brant>Get out of my room.

621
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,320
<21-27,House>你那样做值得吗
<21-27,House>So was it worth it?

622
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,970
<21-27,House>最好的结果  你余生都将在莱文沃思的监狱里度过
<21-27,House>Best case, you spend the rest of your life in Leavenworth.

623
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,480
<21-27,House>最糟的结果  你就一直待在这里了
<21-27,House>Worst case, you spend the rest of your life here.

624
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,350
<21-28,Brant>为34名死者伸张正义比军队对我的处理更重要
<21-28,Brant>Justice for 34 deaths outweighs anything the army can do to me.

625
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,520
<21-29,House>他们得到公正了吗
<21-29,House>They got justice?

626
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,910
<21-29,House>他们知道吗
<21-29,House>Do they know that?

627
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,790
<21-29,House>如果只有十名死者呢
<21-29,House>What if only ten people had died?

628
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,960
<21-29,House>或者四名
<21-29,House>Four?

629
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,690
<21-30,Brant>只要有一名平民遇害
<21-30,Brant>Even one civilian death...

630
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,390
<21-31,House>如果他们只是受伤致残了呢
<21-31,House>What if they just maimed a few guys?

631
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,790
<21-31,House>还值得吗
<21-31,House>Would that have been worth it?

632
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,490
<21-32,Brant>我的工作是记录录像内容
<21-32,Brant>My job was to log that tape,

633
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,850
<21-32,Brant>把所有细节录入官方
<21-32,Brant>get all the details in the official record.

634
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,920
<21-32,Brant>看第十遍之后
<21-32,Brant>After the tenth time of watching it,

635
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,640
<21-32,Brant>我停止说服自己
<21-32,Brant>I stopped trying to convince myself

636
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,300
<21-32,Brant>可能是铲子被误认为了枪
<21-32,Brant>that the shovel could have been mistaken for a gun.

637
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,500
<21-32,Brant>我只看得到受害者的脸
<21-32,Brant>'cause all I could see were the victims' faces.

638
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,280
<21-32,Brant>我试图阅读那孩子的嘴唇
<21-32,Brant>All I was doing was trying to read that kid's lips

639
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,230
<21-32,Brant>以辨别他最后说的话
<21-32,Brant>to make out his last words.

640
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,690
<21-32,Brant>我睡不着
<21-32,Brant>I couldn't sleep.

641
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,740
<21-32,Brant>吃不下
<21-32,Brant>Couldn't eat.

642
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,610
<21-32,Brant>你以为我喜欢光着头吗
<21-32,Brant>Think I like the cue ball look?

643
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,900
<21-33,House>我的黑发三天变灰发
<21-33,House>My hair turned gray in three days.

644
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,580
<21-32,Brant>我的身体在告诉我  我必须尽我所能
<21-32,Brant>My body was telling me I had to do whatever I could

645
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,030
<21-32,Brant>确保此类事件
<21-32,Brant>to make sure that something like this

646
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,890
<21-32,Brant>不再发生
<21-32,Brant>never happened again.

647
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,810
<21-33,House>你三天黑发变灰发
<21-33,House>Your hair turned gray in three days.

648
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,610
<22-1,House>头发褪色表明是自身免疫性疾病
<22-1,House>Loss of hair color indicates an autoimmune condition,

649
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,430
<22-1,House>可能是毒性弥漫性甲状腺肿
<22-1,House>likely Grave's disease.

650
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:49,260
<22-1,House>甲状腺机能亢进会导致血液高凝状态
<22-1,House>Hyperthyroidism leads to a hypercoagulable state,

651
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,230
<22-1,House>从而导致血栓
<22-1,House>which causes thrombosis.

652
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,920
<22-1,House>给他用抗甲状腺药
<22-1,House>Start him on antithyroids.

653
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,740
<22-2,Adams>你驳回我们当前的诊断
<22-2,Adams>You want to reject our current diagnosis

654
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,410
<22-2,Adams>就因为他有几根灰头发
<22-2,Adams>because he had a few gray hairs,

655
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,240
<22-2,Adams>绝望恐慌  剃了光头
<22-2,Adams>panicked, and shaved his head?

656
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,650
<22-3,House>我否定我们当前的诊断
<22-3,House>I want to reject our current diagnosis

657
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,020
<22-3,House>是因为我觉得我们弄错了
<22-3,House>because I think we're wrong.

658
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,660
<22-3,House>不对症确诊
<22-3,House>And treating for wrong diagnoses

659
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,790
<22-3,House>会引起死亡这类副作用
<22-3,House>can result in side effects like death.

660
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,600
<22-4,Taub>就算他头发全变灰了
<22-4,Taub>Even if he did full go gray,

661
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,690
<22-4,Taub>这更像是应激状态
<22-4,Taub>stress seems way more likely than Grave's.

662
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,200
<22-5,House>我还没读到过任何文献
<22-5,House>I haven't read any journal articles

663
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,320
<22-5,House>是证明老兵头发褪色的几率更高的
<22-5,House>proving that veterans have a higher incidence of depigmentation.

664
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,900
<22-5,House>当然这也有可能是肝性脑病导致的
<22-5,House>Of course, that could be the hepatic encephalopathy talking.

665
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,540
<22-6,Chase>我们针对伯-苏综合征的治疗还没时间
<22-6,Chase>Our treatment for Bernard Soulier hasn't had time--

666
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,770
<22-7,House>所以你们都打算忽略新症状吗
<22-7,House>So you all just want to ignore the new symptom?

667
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,560
<22-8,Adams>那不是格雷夫斯病  因为头发变灰根本不是症状
<22-8,Adams>It's not Grave's because it's not a symptom at all.

668
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,540
<22-8,Adams>你想用的抗甲状腺药会降低他的血压
<22-8,Adams>And the antithyroids you want could reduce his blood pressure

669
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,040
<22-8,Adams>和他呼吸的能力
<22-8,Adams>and his ability to breathe.

670
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,550
<22-8,Adams>从而引起死亡  这类的副作用
<22-8,Adams>Which can result in side effects, like death.

671
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,790
<22-9,House>小杯汽水
<22-9,House>Small soda.

672
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,430
<22-9,House>就是毒性弥漫性甲状腺肿
<22-9,House>Grave's it is.

673
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,440
<22-9,House>给他用抗甲状腺药
<22-9,House>Start him on antithyroids.

674
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,380
<22-10,Park>我知道我们向来和豪斯意见不符
<22-10,Park>I know we disagree with House all the time,

675
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,770
<22-10,Park>但以前我会说  好吧  他是个天才
<22-10,Park>but, before I could say, "Okay, he's a genius."

676
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,750
<22-10,Park>现在  可能他只是很聪明而已
<22-10,Park>Now...maybe he's just really smart.

677
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,510
<22-11,Chase>我们不给他用抗甲状腺药
<22-11,Chase>We're not gonna give him the antithyroids.

678
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,370
<22-11,Chase>一切都好吗
<22-11,Chase>Everything okay?

679
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,770
<23-1,Chase>感觉好些吗
<23-1,Chase>Any better?

680
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,320
<23-2,Brant>还不错
<23-2,Brant>Pretty good.

681
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,200
<23-3,Hayes>他问我要了条毯子
<23-3,Hayes>He did just ask me for a blanket.

682
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,540
<23-4,Adams>你冷吗
<23-4,Adams>You're cold?

683
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,430
<23-5,Brant>有一点
<23-5,Brant>A little.

684
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,220
<23-6,Chase>多久了
<23-6,Chase>For how long?

685
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,270
<23-7,Brant>没什么的
<23-7,Brant>It's really nothing.

686
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,960
<23-7,Brant>可能一两个小时吧
<23-7,Brant>Maybe an hour or two.

687
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,870
<23-8,Adams>他有40摄氏度
<23-8,Adams>He's at 104.

688
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,590
<23-9,Chase>不是伯-苏综合征
<23-9,Chase>It's not Bernard Soulier.

689
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,570
<24-1,House>大胆  你们从推测我病了
<24-1,House>Bold move. You've gone from speculating

690
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,870
<24-1,House>进步到行动时当我死了
<24-1,House>that I'm sick to acting like I'm dead.

691
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,280
<24-2,Taub>我们的行为出于不相信你的判断
<24-2,Taub>We acted like we don't trust your judgment,

692
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,490
<24-2,Taub>因为我们不相信你的判断
<24-2,Taub>because we don't trust your judgment.

693
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,630
<24-3,House>不如先别相信你们自己的判断
<24-3,House>Why don't you start by not trusting your own?

694
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,210
<24-4,Adams>我们做了更多的血检
<24-4,Adams>We did more blood work.

695
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,650
<24-4,Adams>也不是毒性弥漫性甲状腺肿
<24-4,Adams>It's not Grave's either.

696
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,800
<24-5,Foreman>能跟你说几句吗
<24-5,Foreman>Talk to you for a minute?

697
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,080
<24-6,House>你想跟我说的也可以跟他们说
<24-6,House>Anything you have to say to me you can say to them.

698
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,350
<24-6,House>这样才公平  因为他们跟我说的
<24-6,House>It's only fair, 'cause anything they say to me,

699
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,550
<24-6,House>也跟你说了
<24-6,House>they also say to you.

700
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,120
<24-6,House>抖抖口袋  谁是家贼
<24-6,House>Jiggle your pockets. Who's got the silver coins?

701
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,980
<24-7,Foreman>在你收到健康证明书前
<24-7,Foreman>Until you receive a Clean Bill Of Health,

702
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,210
<24-7,Foreman>由我主持治疗
<24-7,Foreman>I'll be authorizing all treatment orders.

703
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,900
<24-8,House>我想说这是一个极其愚蠢的错误决定
<24-8,House>Well, I would say that that was an incredibly stupid mistake,

704
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
<24-8,House>但显然我得先向福曼
<24-8,House>but apparently I'd have to clear that opinion

705
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,370
<24-8,House>报备这个观点才行
<24-8,House>through Foreman first.

706
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,240
<24-9,Adams>白细胞计数高
<24-9,Adams>White count is high.

707
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,110
<24-9,Adams>所以他入院时我们排除的感染
<24-9,Adams>So all the infections we ruled out

708
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,110
<24-9,Adams>重新列入考虑范围
<24-9,Adams>when he came in are back on the table.

709
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,210
<24-10,Park>军团病
<24-10,Park>Legionnaire's.

710
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,240
<24-11,Chase>没有肺炎  不太可能
<24-11,Chase>Unlikely without pneumonia.

711
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,140
<24-11,Chase>陶博
<24-11,Chase>Taub.

712
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,900
<24-12,House>个人生活的忠诚问题
<24-12,House>Loyalty issues in his personal life.

713
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,560
<24-12,House>能够解释你在职业生涯中的告密行为
<24-12,House>Makes sense that they'd cross over into his professional one.

714
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
<24-13,Foreman>我希望在政治迫害前
<24-13,Foreman>I was hoping we can get a diagnosis

715
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,700
<24-13,Foreman>得出诊断结果
<24-13,Foreman>before the witch hunt.

716
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,480
<24-14,House>病人的感染
<24-14,House>The patient's infection

717
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,340
<24-14,House>怎么比得上我被放冷箭
<24-14,House>is an inherently less interesting puzzle

718
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,430
<24-14,House>来得有意思呢
<24-14,House>than the stab wound to my back.

719
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,760
<24-15,Taub>行吧  是我告诉福曼的
<24-15,Taub>Fine. I told Foreman.

720
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,140
<24-15,Taub>可以继续了吗
<24-15,Taub>Can we move on now?

721
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,260
<24-15,Taub>会不会是登革热
<24-15,Taub>What about dengue?

722
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,040
<24-16,Foreman>病人并未经历剧烈疼痛
<24-16,Foreman>Patient isn't in enough pain.

723
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,820
<24-16,Foreman>不对
<24-16,Foreman>No.

724
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,430
<24-17,House>我指的不是登革热  我不清楚
<24-17,House>I don't mean about dengue. I have no idea.

725
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,210
<24-17,House>陶博站出来承认不过是想让我们
<24-17,House>Taub's only confessing because he wants us

726
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,820
<24-17,House>继续关注病人
<24-17,House>to focus on the patient.

727
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,320
<24-18,Adams>是我告诉的福曼
<24-18,Adams>I told Foreman.

728
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,590
<24-19,Chase>是我
<24-19,Chase>I did.

729
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,850
<24-20,House>下一个出来自首的被解雇了
<24-20,House>The next person to confess is fired.

730
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,330
<24-20,House>或者是斯巴达克斯
<24-20,House>Or Spartacus.

731
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,670
<24-21,Foreman>我声明  不会解雇任何人
<24-21,Foreman>For clarification, no one's getting fired.

732
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,270
<24-21,Foreman>还谁有想法
<24-21,Foreman>Who else has a pitch?

733
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,610
<24-22,House>现在只剩下朴克了
<24-22,House>And then...there's Park.

734
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,660
<24-22,House>只有一个人没自首
<24-22,House>The only one who didn't confess.

735
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,570
<24-22,House>因为胆怯不敢搬出父母家
<24-22,House>The same cowardice that makes someone unable

736
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,200
<24-22,House>单独住的人
<24-22,House>to move out of mommy and daddy's home

737
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,370
<24-22,House>也很可能是个告密者
<24-22,House>might also make someone a tattletale.

738
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,190
<24-23,Park>你威胁说要解雇下一个自首的
<24-23,Park>You threatened to fire the next person who...

739
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,430
<24-24,House>是疟疾
<24-24,House>And it's malaria.

740
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,540
<24-25,Adams>不  不是
<24-25,Adams>No, it's not.

741
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,460
<24-25,Adams>军方有针对疟疾的医疗计划
<24-25,Adams>The army issues anti-malaria medication.

742
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,760
<24-26,House>那是十年前了
<24-26,House>And has done for ten years.

743
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,830
<24-26,House>十年间阿富汗蚊和冈比亚按蚊
<24-26,House>That's the equivalent of 5,000 generations

744
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,850
<24-26,House>已经繁衍了五千代
<24-26,House>of the Afghan mosquito, anopheles gambiae.

745
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,030
<24-26,House>足以产生抗性了
<24-26,House>That's plenty long enough to develop a resistance.

746
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,660
<24-26,House>疟蚊在希腊语里正是"无能"的意思
<24-26,House>Anopheles, by the way, is Greek for "Useless."

747
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,970
<24-27,Foreman>不排除腹腔感染  用抗疟疾药治疗
<24-27,Foreman>Cover for intra-abdominal sepsis and treat with antimalarials.

748
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,530
<24-28,House>我说你来插手很愚蠢也是对的吧
<24-28,House>And was I also right that it was a stupid idea?

749
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,750
<25-1,Taub>我们认为你患了疟疾
<25-1,Taub>We believe you have malaria.

750
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,880
<25-1,Taub>这些药
<25-1,Taub>These pills...

751
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,310
<25-2,Brant>我不想服用药物
<25-2,Brant>I don't want any medication.

752
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,360
<25-2,Brant>我爸爸的档案该到了
<25-2,Brant>My dad's file should have been here.

753
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,560
<25-3,Hayes>布兰特  我跟你说过  我有去问
<25-3,Hayes>Brant, I told you, I looked into it.

754
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,990
<25-3,Hayes>不过是耽搁了
<25-3,Hayes>There's just a delay.

755
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,690
<25-4,Brant>我相信这是军方的说法
<25-4,Brant>I believe that's what the army's saying.

756
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,780
<25-4,Brant>但我不相信他们说的是真的
<25-4,Brant>I don't believe it's true.

757
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,420
<25-4,Brant>如果他们不打算守约
<25-4,Brant>If they're not going to keep their end of the bargain,

758
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,620
<25-4,Brant>我也不
<25-4,Brant>neither am I.

759
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,930
<25-4,Brant>我们白白被搜了那么多遍身
<25-4,Brant>So we got groped for nothing.

760
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,210
<26-1,Park>要是他自己不打算活下去...
<26-1,Park>If he doesn't want to stay alive...

761
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,000
<26-2,Hayes>等等
<26-2,Hayes>Hold on.

762
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,150
<26-2,Hayes>现在做他的监护人还来得及吗
<26-2,Hayes>Is it too late to become his conservator?

763
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,430
<26-2,Hayes>我知道自己之前说过什么
<26-2,Hayes>I know what I said before.

764
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,510
<26-2,Hayes>我现在不在乎了
<26-2,Hayes>Right now I don't care.

765
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,870
<26-3,Taub>当然不晚
<26-3,Taub>Of course not.

766
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,740
<26-3,Taub>我们这就去准备文书
<26-3,Taub>We'll get the paperwork drawn up.

767
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,340
<26-3,Taub>他改主意了
<26-3,Taub>He changed his mind?

768
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,850
<27-1,Adams>为什么
<27-1,Adams>Why?

769
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,160
<27-2,Taub>他弟弟就要死了
<27-2,Taub>His brother's dying.

770
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,660
<27-2,Taub>他还需要更充分的理由吗
<27-2,Taub>He needs a more substantial reason?

771
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,230
<27-3,Adams>我们上一次要他做监护人
<27-3,Adams>His brother was dying the last time

772
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,890
<27-3,Adams>他弟弟也在生死边缘
<27-3,Adams>we asked him to be the conservator.

773
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
<27-3,Adams>所以他不去催促军方要档案
<27-3,Adams>So instead of pushing the issue with the army

774
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,620
<27-3,Adams>反而放弃了自己坚持的原则
<27-3,Adams>to get the file, he just decided to give up on his code?

775
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,280
<27-4,Taub>显然如此
<27-4,Taub>Apparently.

776
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,250
<27-4,Taub>哪里签字
<27-4,Taub>So where do I sign?

777
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,630
<28-1,Hayes>不需要签字
<28-1,Hayes>We don't need you to.

778
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,650
<28-2,Taub>军方昨天已经把档案给你了
<28-2,Taub>The army gave the file to you yesterday.

779
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,550
<28-2,Taub>马修森少校给我们又发了一份
<28-2,Taub>Major Mathewson had another copy sent over to us.

780
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,430
<28-3,Hayes>其实我不想这份档案公布是有原因的
<28-3,Hayes>You know, there's a reason I didn't want that file released.

781
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,860
<28-4,Taub>我知道  我读过了
<28-4,Taub>I know. I read it.

782
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,200
<28-4,Taub>我现在要去给病人治病了
<28-4,Taub>I'm gonna treat my patient now.

783
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,300
<28-5,Brant>我是对的
<28-5,Brant>I was right.

784
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,670
<28-5,Brant>是不是
<28-5,Brant>Wasn't I?

785
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,990
<28-6,Brant>他是怎么死的
<28-6,Brant>How did he die?

786
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,810
<28-6,Brant>他们隐藏了什么
<28-6,Brant>What did they cover up?

787
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,040
<28-7,Hayes>他们没有隐藏真相
<28-7,Hayes>They didn't cover up anything.

788
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,860
<28-7,Hayes>是我
<28-7,Hayes>I did.

789
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,000
<28-7,Hayes>老爸会丧生车祸是因为他醉酒
<28-7,Hayes>Dad died in that car accident because he was drunk.

790
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,720
<28-7,Hayes>还撞死一名行人
<28-7,Hayes>Killed a pedestrian too.

791
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,880
<28-8,Brant>你说什么...  什么
<28-8,Brant>What are you-- what--

792
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,100
<28-9,Hayes>他酗酒  布兰特  很严重
<28-9,Hayes>He drank, Brant, a lot.

793
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,660
<28-9,Hayes>你当时太小不知道
<28-9,Hayes>You were too young to see it.

794
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,480
<28-9,Hayes>所以我就托老爸的战友
<28-9,Hayes>I, uh, I had some of dad's buddies...

795
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,960
<28-9,Hayes>帮忙把他的档案保密
<28-9,Hayes>take care of his files.

796
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,750
<28-9,Hayes>那是我唯一一次违反纪律
<28-9,Hayes>It was the only time I ever broke the rules.

797
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,910
<28-9,Hayes>对不起
<28-9,Hayes>I'm sorry.

798
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,960
<28-10,Taub>我可以开始治疗了吗
<28-10,Taub>Can I begin treatment?

799
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,980
<29-1,Taub>发热依然不退
<29-1,Taub>Fever hasn't broken.

800
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,410
<29-1,Taub>白细胞计数未减
<29-1,Taub>White count is still up.

801
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,410
<29-1,Taub>肾功能正在下降
<29-1,Taub>Renal function is declining.

802
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,280
<29-2,Foreman>他有疟疾的所有症状
<29-2,Foreman>So he has all the signs of malaria,

803
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,480
<29-2,Foreman>抗疟疾药却无效
<29-2,Foreman>except the antimalarials aren't curing him.

804
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,390
<29-3,Adams>淋病
<29-3,Adams>Gonorrhea?

805
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,220
<29-3,Adams>如果发展到心脏...
<29-3,Adams>If it got into his heart...

806
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,410
<29-4,Chase>我们做了超声  他的瓣膜都是好的
<29-4,Chase>We did an echo. His valves look good.

807
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,320
<29-4,Chase>会不会
<29-4,Chase>What about...

808
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,320
<29-4,Chase>你这混蛋
<29-4,Chase>You bastard.

809
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,530
<29-4,Chase>你都是装的
<29-4,Chase>You were faking.

810
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,020
<29-4,Chase>昨天豪斯用饮料杯偷糖果
<29-4,Chase>Yesterday, House stole candy by putting it into a cup.

811
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,890
<29-4,Chase>杯子太小装不下
<29-4,Chase>The cup was too small, so his solution

812
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,360
<29-4,Chase>他就拿出去些
<29-4,Chase>was to remove some of the candy.

813
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,920
<29-4,Chase>但更合理的方法显然是换个大杯
<29-4,Chase>But the obviously logical thing was to just get a bigger cup,

814
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,910
<29-4,Chase>他今天换了  因为他不再装病
<29-4,Chase>which he did today, because he's no longer faking.

815
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,670
<29-5,Taub>那不可能是装出来的  我们化验了你的...
<29-5,Taub>He couldn't have faked it. We tested your...

816
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,850
<29-6,House>我服了圣约翰草
<29-6,House>I took St. John's wort to alter the way

817
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,050
<29-6,House>以改变肝脏代谢乙酰氨基酚的方式
<29-6,House>my liver metabolized acetaminophen.

818
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,830
<29-6,House>又加了一些N-乙酰半胱氨酸完善效果
<29-6,House>Then some n-acetylcysteine just to finish it off.

819
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,020
<29-7,Foreman>你害得他们来折磨我
<29-7,Foreman>You tortured them to torture me

820
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
<29-7,Foreman>就为了看看哪个人可信
<29-7,Foreman>just to see who you could trust?

821
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,590
<29-8,House>我是为了挽救生命
<29-8,House>I did it to save lives.

822
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,920
<29-8,House>天哪  说得更合理些就完美了
<29-8,House>God, I wish I could rationalize that one.

823
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,850
<29-9,Park>现在你又要奇迹般地推理出
<29-9,Park>And now you're going to brilliantly deduce

824
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,280
<29-9,Park>我们哪一个是告密者了
<29-9,Park>which one of us is the rat?

825
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,380
<29-10,House>你怎知我不是已经猜到了
<29-10,House>What makes you think I haven't already?

826
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,140
<29-11,House>此事再议
<29-11,House>To be continued.

827
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,690
<29-11,House>我要去奇解疑症了
<29-11,House>I need to brilliantly cure a patient.

828
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,040
<29-11,House>通常来说  没头发就没虱子
<29-11,House>No hair usually means no lice.

829
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,050
<30-1,House>我们没想到的是  你没毛发其他生物有
<30-1,House>What we didn't account for was that it wasn't your hair.

830
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,520
<30-1,House>你的阿富汗邻居与你分享的可不只是茶
<30-1,House>Tea was not the only thing that your Afghani neighbors shared with you.

831
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,170
<30-1,House>我想他们慷慨待客
<30-1,House>I'm sure they were generous enough

832
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,630
<30-1,House>一定请你在家里坐了
<30-1,House>to let you sit on their furniture,

833
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,850
<30-1,House>家具被老鼠身上的虱子污染
<30-1,House>which was infested with rat lice.

834
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,260
<30-1,House>你得的是斑疹伤寒
<30-1,House>You have typhus.

835
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,950
<30-1,House>伤寒引起脉管炎以及你的所有症状
<30-1,House>Caused the vasculitis and explains all your other symptoms.

836
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,670
<30-1,House>不过最有趣的是
<30-1,House>But here's where it gets interesting.

837
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,670
<30-1,House>你的律师可以辩称
<30-1,House>One of those symptoms, a lawyer might argue,

838
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,500
<30-1,House>泄露录像也是病症之一
<30-1,House>was leaking the tape.

839
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,880
<30-1,House>斑疹伤寒可能引发精神问题
<30-1,House>There are psychiatric issues associated with typhus.

840
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,100
<30-1,House>如果你改变主意
<30-1,House>If you change your mind,

841
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,450
<30-1,House>辩称无罪
<30-1,House>plead not guilty,

842
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,780
<30-1,House>还是有机会的
<30-1,House>you've got a case.

843
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,000
<30-2,Brant>那等于一手毁掉我之前坚持的事情
<30-2,Brant>I'd be undermining everything I've been trying to do.

844
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,030
<30-3,Hayes>你认为正确的事情你已经做了
<30-3,Hayes>You did what you thought you had to do.

845
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,300
<30-3,Hayes>坐牢什么都不能证明
<30-3,Hayes>Going to jail proves nothing.

846
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,550
<30-4,Brant>可以证明我仍然有荣誉
<30-4,Brant>It proves I still have my honor.

847
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,450
<30-5,House>你这样做不是为了荣誉
<30-5,House>You're not doing this for honor.

848
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,680
<30-5,House>而是为了取悦你父亲
<30-5,House>You're doing this to please your father.

849
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,530
<30-5,House>悲剧在于你费尽心机要取悦的人
<30-5,House>And the pathetic thing is that the man

850
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,920
<30-5,House>他从未存在过
<30-5,House>you're trying to please never existed.

851
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,990
<30-5,House>叛徒
<30-5,House>Traitor.

852
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,120
<31-1,House>你躲了我两天
<31-1,House>You've been avoiding me for two days.

853
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,030
<31-1,House>因为被我阻截之后
<31-1,House>'cause, when I stranded you behind the barricades,

854
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,190
<31-1,House>你直接跑去找了福曼
<31-1,House>you went straight to Forman.

855
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,230
<31-2,Wilson>我躲你是因为你是个混蛋
<31-2,Wilson>I've been avoiding you because you're an ass.

856
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,940
<31-3,House>我这辈子一直这样混  甩你都甩不掉
<31-3,House>I've been an ass my whole life. I can't get rid of you.

857
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,140
<31-4,Wilson>现在甩得掉了
<31-4,Wilson>You can get rid of me now.

858
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,740
<31-4,Wilson>转身拐着出去就好
<31-4,Wilson>Just turn and limp away.

859
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,960
<31-5,House>你义正词严的牢骚有股诚实的恶臭
<31-5,House>Your whiny righteousness has the stench of sincerity.

860
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,170
<31-5,House>好吧  我只好去惩罚所有组员
<31-5,House>Fine. I have to punish my whole team

861
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,000
<31-7,House>好让犯事的站出来
<31-7,House>So that one of them will step forward.

862
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,670
<31-6,Wilson>有道理
<31-6,Wilson>Makes sense.

863
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:09,930
<31-6,Wilson>该死
<31-6,Wilson>Damn.

864
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,620
<31-7,House>现在我只好去惩罚所有组员
<31-7,House>Now I'm gonna have to punish my whole team

865
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,180
<31-7,House>好让犯事的站出来
<31-7,House>so that one of them will step forward.

866
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,460
<31-8,Wilson>你刚刚说过了
<31-8,Wilson>You just said that.

867
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,160
<31-9,House>对  可这一次我是当真的
<31-9,House>Yeah, but I meant it this time.

868
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,530
<31-9,House>上一次只是为了试你
<31-9,House>First time I was just testing you.

869
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,360
<31-9,House>你要么会真的承认
<31-9,House>Either you were gonna genuinely confess

870
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,860
<31-9,House>要么假装承认
<31-9,House>or falsely confess

871
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,950
<31-9,House>又或者...
<31-9,House>or actually...

872
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
<32-1,House>他叫奇小斯
<32-1,House>His name's li'l Chase.

873
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,100
<32-1,House>他是老鼠
<32-1,House>He's a rat.

874
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,540
<32-1,House>你是家贼
<32-1,House>You're a rat.

875
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,370
<32-1,House>懂了吗
<32-1,House>Get it?

876
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,870
<32-1,House>陶博承认告密是为了保护病人
<32-1,House>Taub confessed to telling Forman to protect the patient.

877
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,480
<32-1,House>亚当斯自首是为了保护陶博
<32-1,House>Adams confessed to protect Taub.

878
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,440
<32-1,House>而你的自首完全是跟风
<32-1,House>But your confession was just piling on.

879
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,090
<32-1,House>你的行为缺乏合理的解释
<32-1,House>There's no rational reason for you to have done it.

880
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,460
<32-2,Chase>而我的惩罚会是...  没有惩罚
<32-2,Chase>And my punishment will be nothing.

881
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,980
<32-2,Chase>你想要我告诉福曼
<32-2,Chase>You wanted me to tell Forman.

882
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,310
<32-2,Chase>你唯一在意的
<32-2,Chase>Your ability to solve puzzles

883
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,170
<32-2,Chase>就是自己参透谜题的能力
<32-2,Chase>Is the only thing that matters to you.

884
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,660
<32-2,Chase>而你也足够明智
<32-2,Chase>And you're smart enough to know

885
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,540
<32-2,Chase>知道一旦有一天你失控了
<32-2,Chase>even you'll lose your edge at some point,

886
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,590
<32-2,Chase>必须保证有人可以接任
<32-2,Chase>you want to make sure someone's there when you do.

887
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,230
<32-3,House>如果你说得对
<32-3,House>If that were true,

888
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,530
<32-3,House>为什么奇小斯的小兄弟们
<32-3,House>Why are li'l Chase's li'l cousins

889
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,910
<32-3,House>正在你家地板上撒欢呢
<32-3,House>scurrying through your apartment's floorboards right now?
