<1-7,Rick>可是没人会把我们从危机中解救出来
<1-7,Rick>But nobody's gonna bail us out.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,500
<1-7,Rick>到处都是免费下载  厕所里卖DVD碟

<5-1,House>四个候选人  三个空缺
<5-1,House>Four candidates, three slots on the team.

121
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,600
<5-1,House>我得看看你是不是还有能力诊断
<5-1,House>Need to know if you've still got your diagnostic chops.

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
<5-2,Taub>我每天六点离开办公室
<5-2,Taub>I leave this office by 6 every day

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
<5-2,Taub>我又开始过周末
<5-2,Taub>I have my weekends again,

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
<5-2,Taub>重新了解我的妻子
<5-2,Taub>I recognize my wife again.

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
<5-3,House>明白了  真没劲
<5-3,House>Yeah, I agree. Does sound pretty dull.

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
<5-3,House>难怪你想为我工作
<5-3,House>No wonder you want to work for me.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,300
<5-3,House>毒理检查正常
<5-3,House>Tox screen was clean,

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
<5-3,House>排除了病毒性脑炎
<5-3,House>We ruled out viral encephalitis.

129
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,300
<5-3,House>你回来的唯一障碍是你妻子
<5-3,House>The only obstacle to you coming back is your wife.

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,500
<5-3,House>她从来没有让你这么为难过
<5-3,House>Which has never been that much of an obstacle to you.

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
<5-4,Taub>也许你是对的
<5-4,Taub>Maybe you're right.

132
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,700
<5-4,Taub>眼睛和肌肉的唯一联系是大脑
<5-4,Taub>The only link between eye and muscle is the brain.

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
<5-4,Taub>肿瘤  癫痫
<5-4,Taub>Tumor, seizure...

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,500
<5-4,Taub>陶博觉得是大脑的问题
<5-4,Taub>Taub seems to think the link has to be the brain,

135
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
<5-4,Taub>可是眼睛和肌肉取决于病人大脑
<5-4,Taub>But eye and muscle are governed by different parts

136
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,000
<6-1,House>的不同部位
<6-1,House>of the patient's second-favorite organ.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
<6-1,House>这就是说
<6-1,House>Which means it's...

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,200
<6-2,Thirteen>泰国很不错  谢谢关心
<6-2,Thirteen>Thailand was wonderful. Thanks for asking.

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,700
<6-3,House>当然  也可能是多病灶
<6-3,House>Of course. Yes. It has to be multifocal.

140
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
<6-4,Thirteen>我两小时后
<6-4,Thirteen>I have an interview

141
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,500
<6-4,Thirteen>跟社区健康诊所有个面试
<6-4,Thirteen>With a community health clinic in two hours.

142
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,800
<6-5,House>备用计划不错
<6-5,House>Back-up plan's fine.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
<6-5,House>陶博全垒打获胜
<6-5,House>Taub's swinging for the fences.

144
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,100
<6-5,House>我建议你别分心
<6-5,House>I suggest you don't divide your attention.

145
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,000
<6-6,Thirteen>说的对
<6-6,Thirteen>Good point.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
<6-6,Thirteen>那我不会分心
<6-6,Thirteen>I won't divide my attention, then.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,700
<7-1,House>陶博觉得是大脑的问题
<7-1,House>Taub thinks it's a brain issue,

148
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,500
<7-1,House>13号觉得是多病灶
<7-1,House>Thirteen thinks it's multifocal.

149
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
<7-2,Foreman>而且他们都不想在这工作
<7-2,Foreman>And neither of them wants to work here.

150
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,400
<7-3,House>别听他们说瞎说
<7-3,House>Don't take their word for it.

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,900
<7-3,House>陶博的问题是他老婆  13号的问题是你
<7-3,House>Taub's problem is his wife, thirteen's problem is you.

152
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,400
<7-3,House>奇斯和卡梅隆的问题是那个死了的非洲独裁者
<7-3,House>Chase and Cameron's problem is the dead African dictator.

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,700
<7-3,House>没有一个人是工作有问题
<7-3,House>None of them has a problem with the work.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
<7-4,Foreman>脑血管炎能很好的解释
<7-4,Foreman>Cerebral vasculitis would explain

155
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,100
<7-4,Foreman>眼睛和胳膊的临床症状
<7-4,Foreman>Both the eye and arm findings.

156
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,500
<7-5,House>用类固醇  做大脑血管造影确认
<7-5,House>Steroids to treat, brain angiogram to confirm,

157
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
<7-5,House>顺便再做肌电图和神经活组织检查
<7-5,House>Emg and nerve biopsy while you're at it.

158
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,900
<7-5,House>我要吃午饭
<7-5,House>I'll be at lunch.

159
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,900
<8-1,House>我要聘四个人
<8-1,House>I'd hire all four,

160
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,000
<8-1,House>可是五个人的小组太笨重了
<8-1,House>But a five-person team seems unwieldy.

161
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
<8-1,House>你打算拒绝谁
<8-1,House>Who would you turn down?

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
<8-1,House>跟他要一样的
<8-1,House>I'll have whatever he's buying.

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,200
<8-2,Wilson>两个芝士汉堡包  两个大份薯条
<8-2,Wilson>Two cheeseburgers and two large fries.

164
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
<8-2,Wilson>世界上有那么多人
<8-2,Wilson>There are a thousand people in the world

165
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
<8-2,Wilson>想为你工作
<8-2,Wilson>Who want to be on your staff,

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,100
<8-2,Wilson>可是你盯着四个不想做的
<8-2,Wilson>But you're going after the four who don't.

167
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
<8-3,House>他们不愿意是因为他们的生活
<8-3,House>They don't because their lives

168
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,100
<8-3,House>那么无关紧要而且烦人地复杂
<8-3,House>are irrelevantly and annoyingly complicated,

169
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,600
<8-3,House>让他们困惑
<8-3,House>Which makes them confused,

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
<8-3,House>让他们做出不妥的决定
<8-3,House>Which makes them make poor decisions.

171
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
<8-4,Wilson>你的生活很简单吗
<8-4,Wilson>And your life is simple?

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
<8-4,Wilson>你竭尽全力去医学会议
<8-4,Wilson>You went all the way up to the medical conference

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
<8-4,Wilson>为了奉承卡迪
<8-4,Wilson>To cozy up to cuddy.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
<8-4,Wilson>而她却在跟这世界上
<8-4,Wilson>Instead she's dating one of two people in the world

175
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,800
<8-4,Wilson>你仅有的两个朋友之一约会
<8-4,Wilson>you think of as a friend.

176
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
<8-4,Wilson>不可能你不受伤
<8-4,Wilson>There's no way that's not devastating.

177
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,500
<8-5,House>我还是有点魅力的
<8-5,House>So I had an attraction of sorts.

178
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
<8-6,Wilson>在你想象的约会里
<8-6,Wilson>Yeah, the sort in which your imaginary tryst

179
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
<8-6,Wilson>把你送去精神病院
<8-6,Wilson>Landed you in a mental hospital.

180
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,800
<8-7,House>我得到了帮助
<8-7,House>And I got help.

181
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
<8-7,House>她有了卢卡斯  还给我买了姜汁汽水
<8-7,House>And she got lucas, who bought me a ginger ale.

182
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
<8-7,House>这挺好的
<8-7,House>It's all fine.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
<8-7,House>在我的部门里却不可能实现
<8-7,House>Which won't be true of my department

184
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,600
<8-7,House>除非想出来我不打算雇谁
<8-7,House>Unless I can figure out which doctor I'm not hiring.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
<8-8,Wilson>我想让你自己回来工作
<8-8,Wilson>I suppose throwing yourself into your work

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
<8-8,Wilson>不是最糟的事
<8-8,Wilson>isn't the worst thing you could do.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
<8-9,House>最糟的是什么
<8-9,House>What is the worst thing I could do?

188
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
<9-1,Foreman>豪斯觉得是心血管炎
<9-1,Foreman>House thinks it's cerebral vasculitis.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
<9-1,Foreman>如果你能帮我做脑部血管造影
<9-1,Foreman>If you could just do the brain angio

190
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,700
<9-1,Foreman>我就可以完成血液检测了
<9-1,Foreman>While I finish up the blood work--

191
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
<9-2,Chase>我们不干了
<9-2,Chase>We're out the door.

192
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
<9-3,Foreman>他让我自己做所有的测试和治疗
<9-3,Foreman>He's got me running every test and treatment by myself.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
<9-4,Cameron>这就是你为什么也会被踢掉
<9-4,Cameron>Which is why you should be out the door too.

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,100
<9-4,Cameron>就算是豪斯  这也是无理取闹
<9-4,Cameron>This is completely unreasonable, even for house.

195
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
<9-5,Foreman>这是你欠我的
<9-5,Foreman>You owe me this.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,800
<10-1,Chase>谢谢你
<10-1,Chase>Thank you.

197
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,600
<10-2,Cameron>你真的相信这是脑血管炎吗
<10-2,Cameron>You really believe this is cerebral vasculitis?

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
<10-3,Chase>可能是
<10-3,Chase>Could be.

199
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,000
<10-4,Cameron>豪斯打算往他的脑子里放根导管
<10-4,Cameron>House wants to thread a catheter through his brain,

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
<10-4,Cameron>这可能导致血管痉挛
<10-4,Cameron>Which could cause a vasospasm,

201
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,100
<10-4,Cameron>用类固醇
<10-4,Cameron>Give steroids,

202
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,600
<10-4,Cameron>这可能导致全身感染
<10-4,Cameron>Which could spread infection all over the place,

203
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
<10-4,Cameron>因为有这个可能
<10-4,Cameron>Because it could be.

204
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
<10-5,Chase>像豪斯的作风
<10-5,Chase>Sounds like house.

205
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,500
<10-6,Cameron>也有可能是维生素D缺乏症
<10-6,Cameron>It could also be a severe vitamin d deficiency.

206
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,000
<10-6,Cameron>他的饮食受到限制而且长期在室内工作
<10-6,Cameron>He's a restrictived diet and works long hours indoors,

207
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
<10-6,Cameron>因此低血钙  抽搐  恐光
<10-6,Cameron>Became hypocalcemic, got tetany and photophobia.

208
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,100
<10-7,Chase>你是说我不该做血管造影吗
<10-7,Chase>Are you saying I shouldn't do the angio?

209
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,700
<10-8,Cameron>这是豪斯的命令  福曼也这样要求
<10-8,Cameron>House ordered it, Foreman wants it,

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,700
<10-8,Cameron>我们当然得做
<10-8,Cameron>Of course we should do it.

211
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,300
<10-8,Cameron>我只是想说明我们离开是对的
<10-8,Cameron>I'm just saying we're right to leave.

212
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,200
<10-8,Cameron>是吗
<10-8,Cameron>You sure?

213
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,200
<10-9,Chase>因为现在我基本上对你唯命是从
<10-9,Chase>Because right now I'll basically do anything you ask me.

214
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,000
<10-10,Cameron>我才没兴趣揭你的伤疤让你内疚
<10-10,Cameron>I'm not interested in guilting you.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,900
<10-10,Cameron>我们得开始新的生活
<10-10,Cameron>We're moving on.

216
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,000
<10-11,Chase>等我把病人带到光疗套房
<10-11,Chase>Right after I take the patient to the phototherapy suite,

217
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,200
<10-11,Chase>照紫外线
<10-11,Chase>Blast him in ultraviolet light,

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
<10-11,Chase>然后再注射点他极度缺乏的维生素D
<10-11,Chase>And I.V. vitamins for his severe vitamin d deficiency.

219
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,300
<11-1,Chase>你们在一起工作吗
<11-1,Chase>So do you guys actually work together?

220
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
<11-2,Hank>起初是
<11-2,Hank>We did at first,

221
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,800
<11-2,Hank>但现在我们分开拍摄
<11-2,Hank>But now we like to keep our films produced separate.

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,300
<11-3,Chase>那你会看她工作吗
<11-3,Chase>So do you, uh, watch her work?

223
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
<11-4,Hank>我们都有自己的事情要忙
<11-4,Hank>We're both busy with our own stuff.

224
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,700
<11-4,Hank>随便你们怎么想吧
<11-4,Hank>Think what you want,

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,300
<11-4,Hank>我们对自己的工作很自豪
<11-4,Hank>But we're proud of what we do.

226
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,800
<11-5,Cameron>把性和感情分开
<11-5,Cameron>Divorcing sex from all emotional content?

227
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,300
<11-6,Lexa>感情是情绪上的  性是生理的
<11-6,Lexa>Emotion is emotional. Sex is mechanical.

228
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,600
<11-6,Lexa>它们之间不需要有交集
<11-6,Lexa>There doesn't really need to be any overlap.

229
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,000
<11-7,Cameron>当然了  对你们来说的话
<11-7,Cameron>Certainly not in your world.

230
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
<11-8,Hank>通过把性从一些根深蒂固的传统思想中
<11-8,Hank>We've helped a lot of couples

231
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
<11-8,Hank>脱离出来  我们帮助了很多夫妻
<11-8,Hank>By taking sex out of some deep, dark dungeon.

232
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
<11-8,Hank>做任何你想做的事
<11-8,Hank>Do what you want

233
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,400
<11-8,Hank>而且没有道德报应
<11-8,Hank>Without some big, moral comeuppance.

234
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,700
<11-9,Chase>你以为你可以逃避后果  但事实上不能
<11-9,Chase>You think you can escape the consequences, but you can't.

235
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,000
<11-9,Chase>你没有建立自己的原则或道德准则
<11-9,Chase>You don't get to make your own rules or morals.

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,900
<11-10,Lexa>你只负责治疗他
<11-10,Lexa>Well, you're here to treat him,

237
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,200
<11-10,Lexa>不需要指点我们的  汉克
<11-10,Lexa>Not lecture us about our--Hank.

238
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
<11-10,Lexa>你还好吗
<11-10,Lexa>Are you all right?

239
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
<11-11,Chase>-你没事儿吧  -只是流鼻血而已
<11-11,Chase>- Are you okay?  - Just a nosebleed.

240
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
<11-12,Cameron>看他腿上
<11-12,Cameron>Inside his leg?

241
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,500
<11-12,Cameron>点状出血
<11-12,Cameron>Petechial hemorrhages.

242
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,100
<11-13,Chase>我们错了  福曼也是
<11-13,Chase>We were wrong. So was Foreman.

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,700
<12-1,Cameron>病人的血不凝结
<12-1,Cameron>Patient's blood won't clot.

244
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
<12-1,Cameron>我们又回到原点了
<12-1,Cameron>We're back to square one.

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
<12-2,House>你又回到我的办公室了
<12-2,House>And you're back in my office.

246
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,100
<12-2,House>毕竟是很难得到的工作  不舍得放弃
<12-2,House>So much for playing hard to get.

247
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,500
<12-3,Chase>我们只是来帮福曼的
<12-3,Chase>We're just here to help Foreman.

248
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,900
<12-4,Cameron>那不是
<12-4,Cameron>Is that--

249
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,300
<12-5,House>他并非没有才
<12-5,House>He's not without talent.

250
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,300
<12-6,Foreman>紫外线使他的毛细血管更脆弱
<12-6,Foreman>UV rays made the patient's capillaries more fragile,

251
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,000
<12-6,Foreman>从而加速了血管内凝血
<12-6,Foreman>Hastening the onset of D.I.C.

252
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,000
<12-6,Foreman>听起来像败血症
<12-6,Foreman>Sounds like sepsis--

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
<12-7,House>不是  没有休克症状
<12-7,House>But isn't. No sign of shock.

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,300
<12-8,Chase>-血压没降低  -能把那个关掉吗
<12-8,Chase>- No drop in blood pressure. - Can we turn that off?

255
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,200
<12-9,House>是啊  因为卡梅隆认为看黄片不道德
<12-9,House>Right, 'cause Cameron thinks pornography is evil.

256
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,800
<12-10,Chase>我不介意他做了什么 也不在乎你在看什么
<12-10,Chase>I don't care what he does. I don't care what you watch.

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
<12-10,Chase>只是他假装这是一种我们都该渴望的
<12-10,Chase>I just think it's annoying that he pretends

258
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,800
<12-10,Chase>美好生活  这一点让我很厌烦
<12-10,Chase>It's some beautiful life we should all be aspiring to.

259
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,500
<12-11,Chase>回到菌血症上来
<12-11,Chase>Let's shift points to bacteremia.

260
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,300
<12-12,Cameron>没有发热
<12-12,Cameron>No fever.

261
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,300
<12-12,Cameron>也无法解释痉挛性肌肉收缩
<12-12,Cameron>Plus it wouldn't explain his spasmodic muscle contractions.

262
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,500
<12-13,House>这点阻碍就让你们退缩啦
<12-13,House>The ball and chain smacked you down.

263
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,100
<12-14,Cameron>但大面积的点状皮疹
<12-14,Cameron>But widespread petechial rash,

264
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,400
<12-14,Cameron>关联到神经系统
<12-14,Cameron>Nervous system involvement.

265
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,300
<12-14,Cameron>像是某种血液感染
<12-14,Cameron>It's some kind of blood infection.

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,100
<12-14,Cameron>脑膜炎球菌血症
<12-14,Cameron>Meningococcemia.

267
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,000
<12-15,House>给他注射肝素缓解血管内凝血
<12-15,House>Start the patient on heparin for the D.I.C.

268
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,800
<12-15,House>打广谱抗生素来治疗脑膜炎球菌血症
<12-15,House>Broad-spectrum antibiotics for the meningococcemia.

269
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,200
<12-15,House>卡梅隆医生
<12-15,House>Dr. Cameron.

270
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,500
<12-15,House>奇斯又轻松自在  和你步调一致了
<12-15,House>Chase is relaxed, at ease, in lockstep with you again.

271
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,500
<12-15,House>我猜他终于告诉你他杀死了小阿迪伊明
<12-15,House>I guess he finally told you that he iced Idi Amin jr.

272
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,600
<12-15,House>那是否也意味着他可以打破
<12-15,House>Does that mean he can break

273
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
<12-15,House>另外九条戒律呢[十戒]
<12-15,House>The other nine commandments too?

274
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,200
<12-15,House>忽视上帝的存在的话  当然了
<12-15,House>Taking the lord's name in vain, sure,

275
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,500
<12-15,House>垂涎邻居的妻子
<12-15,House>But coveting thy neighbor's wife?

276
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,800
<12-15,House>她性感吗
<12-15,House>Is she hot?

277
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
<12-16,Cameron>我已经原谅他了
<12-16,Cameron>I've forgiven him.

278
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,100
<12-17,House>不是因为谋杀  不该你原谅
<12-17,House>Not for murder. Not you.

279
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
<12-17,House>不管迪巴拉有多邪恶
<12-17,House>Doesn't matter how evil Dibala was.

280
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,800
<12-17,House>但每一次良心的问候
<12-17,House>By every conscience-hugging,

281
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
<12-17,House>德雷莎修女的慈爱在你身体里交织时
<12-17,House>Mother teresa-loving bone in your body,

282
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,300
<12-17,House>你应该离开他  而不是和他在一起
<12-17,House>You should be leaving him, not living with him.

283
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
<12-18,Cameron>我以为你会认为我们的离开只是个诡计
<12-18,Cameron>I thought your position was our leaving is a ruse.

284
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,500
<12-19,House>我们不是要讨论我的观点
<12-19,House>We're not talking about my position,

285
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,000
<12-19,House>我们在讨论你的  不合情理的做法
<12-19,House>We're talking about yours, which doesn't add up.

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
<12-19,House>这才真是不合情理
<12-19,House>Here's what doesn't add up.

287
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
<12-20,Cameron>如果你真想为你的团队增加人员的话
<12-20,Cameron>If you were serious about staffing your team

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
<12-20,Cameron>你会很确切的知道你需要的是哪三个人
<12-20,Cameron>You would know exactly which three fellows you wanted.

289
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
<12-20,Cameron>你之前就已经想好了这件事
<12-20,Cameron>You plowed ahead with this case

290
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
<12-20,Cameron>尽管你还没有请到新人
<12-20,Cameron>Even though you hadn't hired new fellows

291
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
<12-20,Cameron>因为你知道福曼会找奇斯和我帮忙
<12-20,Cameron>Because you knew Foreman would ask Chase and me to help,

292
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,500
<12-20,Cameron>也让你有更多时间来破坏我们的婚姻
<12-20,Cameron>Giving you more time to blow up our marriage.

293
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
<12-20,Cameron>我可没想那样
<12-20,Cameron>I don't want that.

294
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
<12-21,House>但如果不提前计划好的话就实在太蠢了
<12-21,House>But we'd be foolish not to plan ahead.

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,200
<12-21,House>首先  我炒了奇斯是两年前你离开的主要原因
<12-21,House>A--my firing Chase was the only reason you left two years ago,

296
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,300
<12-21,House>其次  当他杀过人的恐惧感侵袭你时
<12-21,House>B--when the full horror of his homicide hits you,

297
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,500
<12-21,House>你们的婚姻就完蛋了
<12-21,House>Your marriage will blow up.

298
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,200
<12-21,House>最后
<12-21,House>And z...

299
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,000
<12-21,House>阻止你在这里工作的唯一障碍消失了
<12-21,House>The only obstacle to your working here will be gone.

300
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,100
<12-21,House>或者我省略了一些话
<12-21,House>Or maybe I skipped a couple of letters.

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,200
<13-1,Chase>脑膜炎球菌血症具有传染性
<13-1,Chase>Meningococcemia's spread person-to-person.

302
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
<13-1,Chase>所以你应该考虑一下
<13-1,Chase>Something you ought to think about

303
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
<13-1,Chase>下次出演的时间
<13-1,Chase>Next time you show up for work.

304
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,800
<13-2,Hank>没关系了  你妻子不在这里
<13-2,Hank>It's okay. Your wife's not here.

305
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
<13-3,Chase>我在告诉你
<13-3,Chase>I'm just telling you what--

306
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,300
<13-4,Hank>当她在时你得装成正人君子  我明白
<13-4,Hank>You have to lecture me when she's around, I get it.

307
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
<13-4,Hank>但从你所问的问题中我可以看出来
<13-4,Hank>But I can tell from all the questions you ask

308
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
<13-4,Hank>其实你和我很像  只是不愿承认罢了
<13-4,Hank>That you're more like me than you admit.

309
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
<13-5,Chase>我是男人
<13-5,Chase>I'm a guy.

310
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
<13-5,Chase>我偶尔会乱来  但我爱我的妻子
<13-5,Chase>I look around every once in a while, but I love my wife.

311
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,900
<13-5,Chase>她是我唯一一个很亲密的人
<13-5,Chase>I love the fact that she's the only one that I'm intimate with.

312
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,800
<13-6,Hank>难道你就一点都不想
<13-6,Hank>And no part of you wants to just

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,700
<13-6,Hank>从别人强加于你的这些规则里面摆脱出来吗
<13-6,Hank>Toss this rule book everyone's forced on you?

314
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,600
<13-7,Chase>你就不想过有真实诺言的生活吗
<13-7,Chase>No part of you wants a life of actual commitment?

315
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
<13-8,Hank>我和我妻子的这种关系很完美吗  不
<13-8,Hank>Is my relationship perfect? No.

316
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,100
<13-8,Hank>当我妻子刚做了九个小时的爱之后
<13-8,Hank>Am I ever horny when my wife has

317
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,600
<13-8,Hank>我还会性激动吗
<13-8,Hank>just had sex for nine hours?

318
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,500
<13-8,Hank>会
<13-8,Hank>Yes.

319
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
<13-8,Hank>在所有重要事情上
<13-8,Hank>But we are committed to each other,

320
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,200
<13-8,Hank>我们对对方都很忠诚
<13-8,Hank>In every way that matters.

321
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
<13-9,Chase>换句话说  除了你不忠诚的时候
<13-9,Chase>In other words you're committed,

322
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,100
<13-9,Chase>你都是忠诚的
<13-9,Chase>Except when you're not committed.

323
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,100
<13-9,Chase>若你有良知的话  那套理论就不管用了
<13-9,Chase>Doesn't work so well if you have a conscience.

324
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,700
<13-9,Chase>良知
<13-9,Chase>Conscience.

325
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,700
<13-10,Hank>你指当没有合理的理由照人们所期望的
<13-10,Hank>You mean that thing that kicks in when there's no logical reason

326
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,100
<13-10,Hank>方式去做的时候  拿来安慰自己东西吗
<13-10,Hank>to behave the way people want you to?

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,800
<13-10,Hank>怎么回事
<13-10,Hank>What?

328
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
<13-11,Chase>你发烧了
<13-11,Chase>You have a fever.

329
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,500
<13-11,Chase>也就是说抗生素不管用
<13-11,Chase>Means the antibiotics aren't working.

330
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,300
<14-1,Taub>高山先生
<14-1,Taub>Mr. Takayama.

331
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,700
<14-1,Taub>在
<14-1,Taub>Yes.

332
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,900
<14-2,House>上次那个人对我眼睛的治疗让我很满意
<14-2,House>I'm really happy with what the last guy did with my eyes.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,300
<14-2,House>但为什么广谱抗生素
<14-2,House>But why would broad-spectrum antibiotics

334
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,400
<14-2,House>对脑膜炎不起作用呢
<14-2,House>Fail to work on meningococcemia?

335
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
<14-3,Taub>请原谅  我还有真实的病人
<14-3,Taub>If you'll excuse me, I've got a real patient.

336
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
<14-3,Taub>希特勒先生
<14-3,Taub>Mister... Hitler.

337
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,300
<14-3,Taub>别闹了
<14-3,Taub>Really.

338
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,300
<14-4,House>在接待员忙着和她男朋友调情的时候
<14-4,House>Had to do something to amuse myself while your receptionist

339
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,700
<14-4,House>我得自娱自乐一下
<14-4,House>Fought with her boyfriend.

340
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,400
<14-5,Taub>下一个是谁
<14-5,Taub>Who's next?

341
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,700
<14-6,House>是这个需要吃二十年的玉米片
<14-6,House>A guy who needs two decades' worth of corn chips

342
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,500
<14-6,House>来减掉身上的肥肉的人
<14-6,House>Hoovered out of his neck,

343
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
<14-6,House>还是一个不能接受日光
<14-6,House>Or a guy who can't stand daylight,

344
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,700
<14-6,House>血液也不凝结的患者
<14-6,House>And whose blood won't clot.

345
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,500
<14-6,House>你来选择治疗谁
<14-6,House>You do the triage.

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
<14-6,House>这个混蛋是谁
<14-6,House>Who's the jerk?

347
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,000
<14-7,Taub>一个绝无可能重新雇用我得人
<14-7,Taub>Someone with zero chance of hiring me back.

348
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,900
<14-7,Taub>我告诉过你了
<14-7,Taub>I told you.

349
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,100
<14-7,Taub>我对我的家庭和工作都很满意
<14-7,Taub>I'm content at home and at work.

350
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
<14-8,House>但你不满足于就此满足
<14-8,House>But you're not content with content.

351
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,600
<14-8,House>所以你才陷入股票欺诈
<14-8,House>That's why you got sucked into those stock scams,

352
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
<14-8,House>欺骗你深爱的妻子
<14-8,House>Why you cheated on the wife you love.

353
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,000
<14-9,Taub>在打桥牌的时候
<14-9,Taub>At bridge.

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
<14-9,Taub>我妻子和我经常打桥牌
<14-9,Taub>My wife and I play a lot of bridge.

355
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,300
<14-10,House>为什么上次我来的时候你会诊断病例
<14-10,House>Why you worked on a case last time I was here.

356
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,400
<14-11,Taub>我告诉你了一个方法
<14-11,Taub>I gave you a theory.

357
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
<14-11,Taub>就像我帮餐馆里的人把堵在
<14-11,Taub>Just like I'd help a guy who needs

358
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,700
<14-11,Taub>喉咙里的异物弄出来一样
<14-11,Taub>A heimlich in a restaurant.

359
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
<14-11,Taub>然后我就让你走了
<14-11,Taub>And then I shut the door behind you.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
<14-12,House>但恐怕你得击败其他三个医生才能给他治疗
<14-12,House>But you'd knock over three other doctors to give it to him.

361
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,300
<14-12,House>比喻的说法是  你对海姆利克有瘾
<14-12,House>Metaphorically speaking, you're a heimlich addict.

362
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
<14-13,Taub>而你是个瘾君子
<14-13,Taub>And you're an addiction addict.

363
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,500
<14-13,Taub>现在你唯一的毒品来源是你的老团队
<14-13,Taub>Right now your drug of choice is your old team,

364
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
<14-13,Taub>像其他瘾君子一样  你试图借此解决
<14-13,Taub>And like any addict you're trying to solve

365
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
<14-13,Taub>一些其他问题  但却不管用
<14-13,Taub>Some other problem and it's not gonna work.

366
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
<14-13,Taub>很抱歉  我有
<14-13,Taub>If you'll excuse me, I have a--

367
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
<14-14,House>你有繁忙的工作日程如鼻部手术
<14-14,House>You have a tight schedule of nose jobs

368
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,500
<14-14,House>整腹手术
<14-14,House>And tummy tucks.

369
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,700
<14-15,Taub>没错  我做鼻部手术
<14-15,Taub>Yes. I do nose jobs.

370
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,400
<14-15,Taub>比如车祸之后被送过来的那个人
<14-15,Taub>Just like the guy who came here after a car crash,

371
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,800
<14-15,Taub>甚至不能呼吸  用他的
<14-15,Taub>Couldn't even breathe through his...

372
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,500
<14-15,Taub>如果他的静脉窦被感染和阻塞了的话
<14-15,Taub>Antibiotics wouldn't work if his sinuses

373
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,600
<14-15,Taub>抗生素是不会有效的
<14-15,Taub>Were infected and clogged.

374
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
<14-15,Taub>如果有一团细菌阻挠
<14-15,Taub>If there was a pocket of bacteria

375
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
<14-15,Taub>他的血液就不能到达脑部
<14-15,Taub>His blood vessels couldn't reach.

376
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
<14-15,Taub>你通过外科手术清空静脉窦 药就会有用了
<14-15,Taub>You surgically drain his sinuses the drugs will work.

377
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,700
<14-16,House>好主意
<14-16,House>Nice.

378
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,600
<14-16,House>那样不好受吧
<14-16,House>Tell me that didn't feel good.

379
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
<14-16,House>明天见
<14-16,House>See you tomorrow.

380
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,700
<14-17,Taub>别再来了
<14-17,Taub>Not coming back.

381
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
<15-1,Foreman>看来这次旅行很愉快
<15-1,Foreman>Looks like quite a trip.

382
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,600
<15-2,Thirteen>是啊
<15-2,Thirteen>It was.

383
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
<15-2,Thirteen>豪斯让你来跟我谈的吗
<15-2,Thirteen>House send you to talk to me?

384
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,900
<15-3,Foreman>不是
<15-3,Foreman>No.

385
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
<15-4,Thirteen>那就没什么好谈的了
<15-4,Thirteen>Then there's nothing to talk about.

386
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
<15-4,Thirteen>我不想替他工作
<15-4,Thirteen>I don't want to work for him.

387
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
<15-5,Foreman>你是个很棒的医生
<15-5,Foreman>You're a great doctor.

388
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,700
<15-5,Foreman>让你加入这个团队  豪斯是对的
<15-5,Foreman>House is right to want you in the mix.

389
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
<15-6,Thirteen>这样说是因为你仍对我有好感
<15-6,Thirteen>Are you saying this because you still have feelings for me

390
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,000
<15-6,Thirteen>想让我回去吗
<15-6,Thirteen>And you want me to come back?

391
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,100
<15-7,Foreman>我是说那不是问题
<15-7,Foreman>I'm saying that shouldn't be an issue.

392
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,200
<15-8,Thirteen>你到底还喜不喜欢我
<15-8,Thirteen>Do you have feelings for me or not?

393
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,000
<15-9,Foreman>我不希望我们在工作中
<15-9,Foreman>I don't want our work life

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
<15-9,Foreman>牵扯到任何私人感情
<15-9,Foreman>To have anything to do with our personal life.

395
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,900
<15-10,Thirteen>你不能把这两件事分开
<15-10,Thirteen>You couldn't keep them separate.

396
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
<15-10,Thirteen>这也是为什么我们没有个人的生活空间
<15-10,Thirteen>And that's why our personal life doesn't exist.

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,800
<15-11,Foreman>我们都没必要
<15-11,Foreman>None of that has to--

398
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,900
<15-12,Thirteen>我不能跟你一起工作
<15-12,Thirteen>I can't work with you.

399
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,700
<15-13,Foreman>事实上  你可以的
<15-13,Foreman>Actually, you can.

400
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,700
<15-13,Foreman>我才是有问题的那一个
<15-13,Foreman>I was the one who had the problem.

401
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,200
<15-13,Foreman>我再不会了
<15-13,Foreman>I don't anymore.

402
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
<16-1,House>我欠你一个道歉
<16-1,House>I owe you an apology.

403
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,200
<16-1,House>我...错...
<16-1,House>I was wr-rr-r...

404
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,400
<16-1,House>我...错...了
<16-1,House>I was wrr-r-rr...

405
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
<16-2,Chase>你哪错了
<16-2,Chase>What were you wrong about?

406
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,200
<16-3,House>你花了几周时间去努力地隐藏一件事
<16-3,House>You spent weeks elaborately concealing the fact that you...

407
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,400
<16-3,House>你撞了你爸爸的车
<16-3,House>Crashed daddy's car.

408
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
<16-3,House>你却承认了
<16-3,House>And then you just confessed.

409
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,400
<16-3,House>听起来很白痴  必会以彻底的失败而告终
<16-3,House>Seemed idiotic. Certain to end in disaster.

410
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,000
<16-3,House>然而你们要一起驶向落日的余晖
<16-3,House>Instead you're riding off into the sunset together.

411
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,900
<16-3,House>有什么理由解释吗
<16-3,House>Any theories on why?

412
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,200
<16-4,Chase>我想你已经
<16-4,Chase>I assume you've already

413
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,100
<16-4,Chase>不再考虑"她爱我"这个原因了
<16-4,Chase>Dismissed the "she loves me" theory?

414
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,800
<16-5,House>哦  这有可能
<16-5,House>Well, it's possible.

415
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,100
<16-5,House>那需要预先假定
<16-5,House>It would require the presupposition

416
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,000
<16-5,House>她在过去六年里所做的每一件事
<16-5,House>That everything she's done for the last six years

417
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,100
<16-5,House>与她的性格完全不相符
<16-5,House>Has been completely inconsistent with her character.

418
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,800
<16-5,House>但是是的  这有可能
<16-5,House>But yeah, it's possible.

419
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,100
<16-6,Chase>正如我们已结婚
<16-6,Chase>And as we've already established,

420
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,600
<16-6,Chase>也有可能你是错的
<16-6,Chase>It's also possible that you're wrong.

421
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
<16-7,House>或者有另外一个解释
<16-7,House>Or there's another explanation.

422
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,000
<16-7,House>既然你没有什么解释  我会一直找你的
<16-7,House>Since you don't have one, I'm gonna keep looking for you.

423
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
<16-8,Chase>让液体排干净  然后塞上麻醉剂和消毒纱布
<16-8,Chase>Let him drain, then pack it with anesthetics and sterile gauze.

424
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
<17-1,Wilson>你知道豪斯在干嘛吗
<17-1,Wilson>Do you have any idea what's going on with House?

425
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
<17-2,Cuddy>他正努力把那些老伙伴弄回来
<17-2,Cuddy>Uh, he's trying to get his old fellows back?

426
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
<17-3,Wilson>这叫做跟踪
<17-3,Wilson>It's called stalking.

427
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,900
<17-4,Cuddy>我正忙着应付法院人员
<17-4,Cuddy>I am way too busy to play officer of the court.

428
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,000
<17-5,Wilson>太可惜了  你可是整件事的起因
<17-5,Wilson>That's a shame, since you're the one who triggered this.

429
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,300
<17-5,Wilson>对了  你怎么看卢卡斯
<17-5,Wilson>What do you see in Lucas anyway?

430
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,400
<17-6,Cuddy>我不觉得这跟你有什么关系
<17-6,Cuddy>I don't see that it's any of your business.

431
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,400
<17-7,Wilson>你觉得豪斯不会发现吗
<17-7,Wilson>Did you think House wouldn't find out?

432
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,500
<17-7,Wilson>你至少可以事先告诉我  我就不用教他
<17-7,Wilson>You could've at least told me so I wouldn't have coached him

433
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,000
<17-7,Wilson>怎样证明自己对你的重要性
<17-7,Wilson>On how to prove his worthiness to you.

434
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
<17-8,Cuddy>我知道你对我失望了
<17-8,Cuddy>I know you're upset with me

435
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
<17-8,Cuddy>因为我没有选择跟你最好的朋友约会
<17-8,Cuddy>Because I didn't choose to date your best friend.

436
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
<17-8,Cuddy>但是我在过我的生活
<17-8,Cuddy>But I'm living my life.

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
<17-8,Cuddy>也是第一次我不用仅仅因为
<17-8,Cuddy>And for the first time I'm not gonna change that.

438
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,900
<17-8,Cuddy>这可能会影响他或者你而改变
<17-8,Cuddy>Because of how it might affect him or you.

439
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
<18-1,Cuddy>真是烦死我了
<18-1,Cuddy>I feel like crap.

440
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,000
<18-2,Lucas>是的  我们的关系是跟豪斯有关
<18-2,Lucas>Yeah, look, our relationship is gonna be about House,

441
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,400
<18-2,Lucas>还是跟我们自己有关
<18-2,Lucas>Or it's gonna be about us.

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,300
<18-2,Lucas>我觉得该跟我们自己有关
<18-2,Lucas>I vote for it being about us.

443
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,000
<18-3,Cuddy>豪斯会替我们选择跟他有关
<18-3,Cuddy>Well, House is gonna make it about him for us.

444
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,500
<18-4,Lucas>这很让人不舒服
<18-4,Lucas>This is very insulting.

445
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,400
<18-4,Lucas>你明显被这个影响了
<18-4,Lucas>You're apparently shocked by this,

446
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
<18-4,Lucas>就是说你觉得我们应该
<18-4,Lucas>Which means that you thought that there

447
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
<18-4,Lucas>有一些什么方式约个会
<18-4,Lucas>Was some way that we could date,

448
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,200
<18-4,Lucas>结个婚  生两个孩子  再养个狗
<18-4,Lucas>Get married, have two kids, a dog,

449
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,800
<18-4,Lucas>退休去佛罗里达  所有这些都不让豪斯知道
<18-4,Lucas>Retire to Florida, all without House finding out.

450
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,800
<18-4,Lucas>还是  你觉得我们约不约会无所谓
<18-4,Lucas>Or you thought that we wouldn't date all that long.

451
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
<18-4,Lucas>第一种可能意味着你在妄想
<18-4,Lucas>First means you're delusional.

452
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,700
<18-4,Lucas>第二种意味我在妄想
<18-4,Lucas>The second means I'm delusional.

453
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,500
<18-4,Lucas>严格地说这也可能是说
<18-4,Lucas>Technically it could also mean

454
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,900
<18-4,Lucas>你觉得豪斯是个成熟的男人
<18-4,Lucas>You thought House had matured,

455
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,600
<18-4,Lucas>但是我们仍然会回到现实
<18-4,Lucas>But then we're back to your being--

456
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,900
<18-5,Cuddy>闭嘴
<18-5,Cuddy>Shut up.

457
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
<18-5,Cuddy>你是对的  对不起
<18-5,Cuddy>You're right. I'm sorry.

458
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,000
<18-6,Lucas>过奖了
<18-6,Lucas>I'm also flattered.

459
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
<18-6,Lucas>是的  因为你和威尔森一起做了许多的事
<18-6,Lucas>Yeah, 'cause you acted all cool and everything with wilson,

460
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,100
<18-6,Lucas>但你跟我在一起会感觉很舒服 你可以随时对我发脾气的
<18-6,Lucas>But you feel comfortable enough with me that you can freak out.

461
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
<18-6,Lucas>很爽吧
<18-6,Lucas>That's cool.

462
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,500
<19-1,Chase>他的鼻窦清理干净了
<19-1,Chase>His sinuses are clear.

463
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,900
<19-1,Chase>抗生素这回能起作用了
<19-1,Chase>Antibiotics should work this time.

464
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
<19-1,Chase>你为什么会原谅我
<19-1,Chase>Why did you forgive me?

465
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
<19-1,Chase>我是说  我  我很高兴
<19-1,Chase>I mean, I'm--I'm glad.

466
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,300
<19-1,Chase>我很感激  但是我也很困惑
<19-1,Chase>I'm grateful, but I'm confused.

467
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,300
<19-1,Chase>你对病人要比对我严格得多
<19-1,Chase>You've been harder on the patient than you've been on me.

468
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
<19-2,Cameron>你和病人的区别是
<19-2,Cameron>Well, the difference between you and the patient

469
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,600
<19-2,Cameron>你会感到羞耻
<19-2,Cameron>Is that you feel shame.

470
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,300
<19-2,Cameron>内疚
<19-2,Cameron>Guilt.

471
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,100
<19-2,Cameron>这也是我为什么知道我们会渡过这个难关
<19-2,Cameron>That's how I know we're gonna get through this.

472
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,400
<19-3,Hank>我的胃
<19-3,Hank>My stomach.

473
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
<19-3,Hank>很疼
<19-3,Hank>It really hurts.

474
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
<19-3,Hank>他的肝脏衰竭
<19-3,Hank>His liver's failing.

475
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,600
<19-3,Hank>他的肝脏衰竭
<19-3,Hank>His liver's failing and

476
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,000
<20-1,Chase>下腹一直在积水  所以
<20-1,Chase>His abdomen Keeps filling with fluid, so--

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
<20-2,Cameron>他得的不是脑膜炎
<20-2,Cameron>It's not meningococcemia.

478
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,700
<20-3,House>不管你们多想结束对方的话
<20-3,House>No matter how much you finish each other's sentences,

479
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,100
<20-3,House>都指望以此做一个打包的诊断
<20-3,House>Don't count on being a diagnostic package deal.

480
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,500
<20-4,Foreman>病人的肝脏有毛病了
<20-4,Foreman>Patient's liver's not working.

481
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,600
<20-4,Foreman>我们没时间在这猜来猜去了
<20-4,Foreman>We don't have time for your little team-stakes.

482
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,900
<20-5,Chase>有时候你...也是...错的
<20-5,Chase>Sometimes you're just wr-rr-r-wrong.

483
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
<20-5,Chase>遗传基因
<20-5,Chase>Something genetic,

484
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
<20-5,Chase>还有他的家族病史我们忽略的吗
<20-5,Chase>Something in his family history we overlooked?

485
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,900
<20-6,Foreman>家族病史和遗传基因都没问题
<20-6,Foreman>History and genetics are spotless.

486
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,700
<20-6,Foreman>只是他小时候咳嗽得很厉害的时候
<20-6,Foreman>Plus every time he had a bad cough as a kid

487
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,800
<20-6,Foreman>会去看医生
<20-6,Foreman>He went to a doctor.

488
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
<20-7,Cameron>是胆管囊肿阻塞了胆汁腺吗
<20-7,Cameron>Klatskin tumor obstructing his bile ducts?

489
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
<20-8,Foreman>没有黄疸症状  那不会影响到眼睛
<20-8,Foreman>No jaundice. Wouldn't have ocular effects.

490
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,100
<20-9,Chase>但如果是胆管内发炎
<20-9,Chase>But if it's inflammation inside the bile channels,

491
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,000
<20-9,Chase>硬化性胆管炎
<20-9,Chase>Sclerosing cholangitis.

492
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
<20-10,Cameron>会让他不再产生
<20-10,Cameron>Could've stopped him from producing

493
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
<20-10,Cameron>血凝蛋白质  破坏他的血细胞
<20-10,Cameron>Clotting proteins, damaged his blood cells,

494
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,500
<20-10,Cameron>-引起一系列连锁反应  -够了
<20-10,Cameron>- Causing small strokes. - Enough!

495
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,300
<20-10,Cameron>够了
<20-10,Cameron>Enough!

496
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
<20-11,House>别再打击13和陶了
<20-11,House>Stop pummeling thirteen and Taub.

497
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,300
<20-11,House>很吻合
<20-11,House>It fits.

498
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
<20-11,House>准备给病人进行内镜逆行胰腺插管术
<20-11,House>Prep the patient for an ERCP.

499
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,100
<20-11,House>看有没有希望打通
<20-11,House>See if there's any hope of opening

500
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,300
<20-11,House>他阻塞的胆汁通道
<20-11,House>His blocked bile channels.

501
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,800
<20-11,House>再告诉他开始找肝脏捐赠者
<20-11,House>And tell him to start looking for a liver donor.

502
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
<20-11,House>奇斯医生
<20-11,House>Dr. Chase.

503
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,100
<20-11,House>轮到你了
<20-11,House>Your turn.

504
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,300
<20-11,House>她说了什么
<20-11,House>So what'd she say?

505
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,300
<20-12,Chase>她原谅我是因为我感到了愧疚
<20-12,Chase>She forgave me because I feel guilty.

506
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,100
<20-13,House>这也管用
<20-13,House>That works too.

507
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,100
<20-14,Chase>现在你希望我问你"也"指的是什么
<20-14,Chase>And now you expect me to ask you what the "too" refers to.

508
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,700
<20-15,House>只要你感兴趣
<20-15,House>Only if you're interested.

509
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,400
<20-15,House>只要你怀疑她的答案
<20-15,House>Only if you have doubts about her answer.

510
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,900
<20-15,House>她觉得你根本不用 为那件事情内疚
<20-15,House>She thinks that you don't have anything to feel guilty about,

511
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,500
<20-15,House>因为你没有杀死别人
<20-15,House>Because you didn't kill anybody.

512
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
<20-15,House>是我杀的
<20-15,House>I did.

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,100
<20-15,House>她责怪我是迪巴拉谋杀案的罪魁祸首 而不是你
<20-15,House>She blames me for Dibala's murder, Not you.

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,100
<20-16,Chase>你只是稍稍涉及了那个医疗案  她知道的
<20-16,Chase>You were barely involved in that case. She knows that.

515
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,500
<20-17,House>但是我创造了大的  坏的  邪恶的环境
<20-17,House>But I created the big, bad, evil climate

516
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,700
<20-17,House>导致了它的发生
<20-17,House>That allowed it to happen.

517
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,600
<20-18,Chase>你错了
<20-18,Chase>You're wrong.

518
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,900
<20-19,House>强势的辩论
<20-19,House>Powerful counter-argument.

519
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,800
<20-20,Chase>你为什么要这么做
<20-20,Chase>Why are you doing this?

520
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,600
<20-20,Chase>你为什么想让事情变得无法收拾
<20-20,Chase>Why are you trying to screw things up?

521
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,700
<20-21,House>你把时态搞错了
<20-21,House>You got the tense wrong.

522
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
<20-21,House>事情已经不可收拾了
<20-21,House>Things are already screwed up.

523
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,500
<20-21,House>所以你不能只是希望为我工作
<20-21,House>Which is why you don't just want to work for me,

524
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,400
<20-21,House>你必须这么做
<20-21,House>You need to.

525
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
<20-21,House>卡梅隆觉得你不过是我的私人手偶
<20-21,House>Cameron thinks you're my personal sock puppet.

526
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,500
<20-21,House>如果你不留下来  就很难证实你不是
<20-21,House>If you don't stay, it's gonna be hard to prove you're not.

527
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
<20-21,House>我得走了
<20-21,House>I have to go.

528
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,600
<21-1,House>上周  我的手杖只能坚持十分钟
<21-1,House>Last week, my cane could only do ten minutes.

529
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,000
<21-2,Thirteen>你来这干什么
<21-2,Thirteen>What are you doing here?

530
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,800
<21-3,House>等你偷个懒这样我能跑在前面
<21-3,House>Waiting for you to take a nap so I can surge into the lead.

531
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,400
<21-3,House>让患有硬化性胆管炎的病人
<21-3,House>What's the best way to restore the liver in someone

532
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
<21-3,House>恢复肝脏的最好方式是什么
<21-3,House>With sclerosing cholangitis?

533
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
<21-4,Thirteen>不想被卷进去
<21-4,Thirteen>Not getting drawn into this.

534
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
<21-5,House>你已经在其中了
<21-5,House>You already are.

535
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,900
<21-6,Thirteen>因为你毁了我的训练吗
<21-6,Thirteen>Because you crashed my workout?

536
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,300
<21-7,House>你在进行核心训练
<21-7,House>You're doing core training.

537
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,600
<21-7,House>这样能提高平衡性
<21-7,House>Which improves balance,

538
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,200
<21-7,House>还能延迟亨廷顿疾病所带来的
<21-7,House>Which staves off the most debilitating

539
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,500
<21-7,House>身体最虚弱的症状
<21-7,House>Symptoms of huntington's.

540
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
<21-7,House>你已经度过了自我放逐的阶段
<21-7,House>You've ended your self-destructive streak.

541
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,700
<21-7,House>现在想做一些有用的事情
<21-7,House>Want to do something significant,

542
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,800
<21-7,House>一些比你所剩不多的几年
<21-7,House>Something that'll last longer

543
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
<21-7,House>持续更久的事情
<21-7,House>Than the few years you have left.

544
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
<21-7,House>我的团队是你的第一选择
<21-7,House>My team is your first-best choice.

545
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
<21-8,Thirteen>我的第一选择是加入昨天我面试的
<21-8,Thirteen>My first choice is the community health clinic

546
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
<21-8,Thirteen>社区健康诊所
<21-8,Thirteen>I interviewed with yesterday.

547
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,400
<21-9,House>当然了  你应该做那个
<21-9,House>Absolutely, you should do that.

548
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,600
<21-9,House>一周三个小时  每个医生都该选择它
<21-9,House>Three hours a week. Every doctor should.

549
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,700
<21-9,House>因为每个医生都能应付
<21-9,House>'cause every doctor can.

550
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,100
<21-9,House>但是你不想做普通医生
<21-9,House>But you don't want to be every doctor.

551
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
<21-9,House>另外  加入我的团队的话
<21-9,House>Plus, on my team,

552
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,300
<21-9,House>你可以和福曼周旋
<21-9,House>You get to screw with Foreman.

553
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,700
<21-9,House>无处不在  但仅字面理解范围
<21-9,House>Every way but literally.

554
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
<21-10,Thirteen>你为什么要用这种方法
<21-10,Thirteen>Why are you doing it this way?

555
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,500
<21-10,Thirteen>你假装我们都会回去
<21-10,Thirteen>You're pretending to assume we're all coming back

556
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,200
<21-10,Thirteen>却连问都不问我们一下
<21-10,Thirteen>Without actually asking us.

557
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,100
<21-10,Thirteen>为什么
<21-10,Thirteen>Why?

558
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,400
<21-11,House>这就是你为什么会痛苦地
<21-11,House>See, this is why you'd be miserable

559
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,900
<21-11,House>在诊所哭鼻子
<21-11,House>Wiping noses in a clinic.

560
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,400
<21-12,Thirteen>你不问的原因是你怕被拒绝
<21-12,Thirteen>You can't ask because you can't face the rejection.

561
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,200
<21-12,Thirteen>为什么不呢  发生什么事情了
<21-12,Thirteen>Why not? What's going on?

562
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,800
<21-13,House>你在让我问你吗
<21-13,House>Are you asking me to ask you?

563
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,000
<21-14,Thirteen>我觉得你不该问  为了你  也为了我好
<21-14,Thirteen>I'm saying you shouldn't, for your sake as well as mine.

564
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,500
<22-1,Cameron>我们不知道硬性化胆炎
<22-1,Cameron>We don't know how much the sclerosing cholangitis

565
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,300
<22-1,Cameron>对你的肝脏造成了多大伤害
<22-1,Cameron>Has damaged your liver.

566
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,100
<22-1,Cameron>可能是一年  可能有十年
<22-1,Cameron>It might be in a year, it might be in ten.

567
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,800
<22-1,Cameron>但是有很大可能你需要一个新的肝脏
<22-1,Cameron>But the odds are you're gonna need a new one.

568
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,600
<22-1,Cameron>你需要明白
<22-1,Cameron>And you should know,

569
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,800
<22-1,Cameron>虽然移植委员不会直说
<22-1,Cameron>While no transplant committee will say this openly,

570
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,500
<22-1,Cameron>但他们绝不会同意把器官
<22-1,Cameron>They'll never grant an organ

571
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,200
<22-1,Cameron>给做你这一行的人
<22-1,Cameron>To someone working in your profession.

572
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,600
<22-2,Hank>你的意思是我得换工作
<22-2,Hank>You're saying I have to change jobs?

573
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,800
<22-2,Hank>你从医学角度建议我换工作
<22-2,Hank>You're medically advising me to change jobs.

574
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
<22-3,Lexa>汉克  如果你太虚弱
<22-3,Lexa>Hank, if you're too sick--

575
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,100
<22-4,Hank>她希望我改变宗教信仰
<22-4,Hank>She wants me to have some kind of religious conversion.

576
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,800
<22-4,Hank>事实上就是在唾弃它
<22-4,Hank>She's practically salivating over it.

577
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,400
<22-5,Cameron>我只是直言相告关于
<22-5,Cameron>I'm just being candid about--

578
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
<22-6,Hank>那你觉得我不贱
<22-6,Hank>So you don't think I'm scum.

579
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,500
<22-6,Hank>只是一些委员会成员觉得我贱
<22-6,Hank>Just some committee thinks I'm scum.

580
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,200
<22-7,Cameron>你的生活方式有危险
<22-7,Cameron>That your lifestyle has risks.

581
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,800
<22-8,Hank>你的工作比我能接触到更多 有病的人  细菌和血液
<22-8,Hank>You work around more sick people and germs and blood than I do.

582
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,000
<22-8,Hank>我才不会像我父母一样
<22-8,Hank>I'm not gonna live my life afraid

583
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,300
<22-8,Hank>畏惧我的生存方式
<22-8,Hank>Like my parents did.

584
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,500
<22-8,Hank>他们几乎都不让我出门
<22-8,Hank>Barely letting me play outside

585
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,100
<22-8,Hank>生怕我被抓伤
<22-8,Hank>And god forbid that I get a scratch.

586
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
<22-9,Lexa>我跟他谈吧
<22-9,Lexa>I'll talk to him.

587
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,500
<22-9,Lexa>他会平静下来  意识到这是唯一
<22-9,Lexa>He'll calm down and realize that this is the only--

589
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,100
<22-10,Hank>为什么每个人都想命令我怎么生活
<22-10,Hank>Why does everyone want to dictate the way I live my life?

590
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,700
<22-11,Lexa>因为我们现在的生活方式会要了你的命
<22-11,Lexa>Because the way we're living is gonna kill you.

591
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,700
<23-1,Chase>把胰管递给我
<23-1,Chase>Passing the pancreatic duct...

592
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,500
<23-2,Foreman>不要听豪斯的
<23-2,Foreman>Don't listen to House.

593
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,300
<23-3,Chase>你又不知道他说了什么
<23-3,Chase>You have no idea what he said.

594
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,000
<23-4,Foreman>我知道豪斯很喜欢操纵人心
<23-4,Foreman>I know that House is manipulative.

595
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,200
<23-4,Foreman>我知道你现在处于脆弱期
<23-4,Foreman>I know that you're in a vulnerable state right now,

596
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,200
<23-4,Foreman>我知道卡梅隆希望你们的婚姻能顺利
<23-4,Foreman>And I know that Cameron wants your marriage to work.

597
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,700
<23-1,Chase>你也是
<23-1,Chase>So do you.

598
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,300
<23-2,Foreman>所以不要听豪斯的
<23-2,Foreman>So don't listen to House.

599
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
<23-5,Chase>豪斯没有左右我的决定
<23-5,Chase>House doesn't make my decisions.

600
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,800
<23-5,Chase>现在是总胆管
<23-5,Chase>We're in the common bile duct.

601
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
<23-6,Foreman>这些乱七八糟是什么  胆结石?
<23-6,Foreman>What's that mass? Gallstone?

602
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
<23-7,Chase>可以放大五倍吗
<23-7,Chase>Can we magnify times five?

603
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
<23-7,Chase>那不是胆结石
<23-7,Chase>That's not a gall stone.

604
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,400
<23-8,Foreman>他的肝脏里全是寄生虫
<23-8,Foreman>His liver's completely filled with worms.

605
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,600
<24-1,Chase>你有杆线虫  是线虫的一种
<24-1,Chase>You have strongyloides, also known as threadworms.

606
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,100
<24-1,Chase>已经遍布全身了
<24-1,Chase>They disseminated all over your body,

607
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,300
<24-1,Chase>导致了你现在的所有症状
<24-1,Chase>Causing all your symptoms.

608
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,900
<24-2,Hank>我怎么会有寄生虫呢
<24-2,Hank>How'd I get a parasite?

609
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
<24-3,Chase>貌似是通过性传播的  但我们还不确定
<24-3,Chase>Most likely through sexual activity, but we can't be sure.

610
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,700
<24-4,Lexa>该如何治疗
<24-4,Lexa>What's the treatment?

611
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,700
<24-5,Chase>两片甲苯咪唑驱虫药
<24-5,Chase>Two mebendazole pills.

612
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,400
<24-6,Hank>就这么简单?
<24-6,Hank>That's it?

613
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,700
<24-7,Chase>你会好起来的  你的肝脏也是
<24-7,Chase>You'll be fine. Your liver too.

614
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
<24-7,Chase>回归你的生活去吧
<24-7,Chase>Go back to your lives.

615
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,400
<25-1,Chase>你知道这是医生休息室
<25-1,Chase>You know this is the doctor's lounge.

616
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,000
<25-1,Chase>我知道
<25-1,Chase>I know.

617
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,900
<25-2,Lucas>貌似是读取医生报告的地方
<25-2,Lucas>It seemed like the place to read doctors' notes.

618
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,700
<25-2,Lucas>你很擅长嘛  顺便说一句
<25-2,Lucas>You are good at it, by the way.

619
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,900
<25-3,Chase>你干吗看我的病历
<25-3,Chase>Why are you reading my charts?

620
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,900
<25-4,Lucas>因为我担心我女友
<25-4,Lucas>Because I'm worried about my girlfriend.

621
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
<25-5,Chase>你女朋友...
<25-5,Chase>Your girlfriend...

622
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,700
<25-5,Chase>是三级片男优吗
<25-5,Chase>Is a male porn star?

623
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,200
<25-6,Lucas>不  我对象是丽萨·卡迪
<25-6,Lucas>Oh, no, I'm dating lisa cuddy.

624
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,600
<25-7,Chase>真的吗
<25-7,Chase>Seriously?

625
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,400
<25-7,Chase>够酷吧
<25-7,Chase>Cool, huh?

626
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,900
<25-8,Lucas>而且如果豪斯的团队解散了
<25-8,Lucas>And if house doesn't have his team,

627
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,200
<25-8,Lucas>她会很痛苦的  也会让我很痛苦
<25-8,Lucas>That'll make her miserable, which will make me miserable.

628
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,100
<25-8,Lucas>所以事实上
<25-8,Lucas>Which brings us to the fact that

629
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,200
<25-8,Lucas>你的作用至关重要
<25-8,Lucas>You have elevated noting to an art form.

630
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,400
<25-9,Chase>我明白了
<25-9,Chase>I see the connection.

631
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,000
<25-10,Lucas>大部分医生都写"上午九点"
<25-10,Lucas>Most doctors write "9:00 A.M."

632
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
<25-10,Lucas>只要时间差不多就好
<25-10,Lucas>If they scrub in or anything near it.

633
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,600
<25-10,Lucas>而你写九点零三分
<25-10,Lucas>you write 9:03

634
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
<25-10,Lucas>而且稍有延迟你就会做上小标记
<25-10,Lucas>And you make little notations when procedures are delayed.

635
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
<25-11,Chase>你很敏感啊
<25-11,Chase>You're easily impressed.

636
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
<25-12,Lucas>是啊  没错
<25-12,Lucas>Well, yeah.

637
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,300
<25-12,Lucas>曾经是  直到我看到你 在差不多四周前停止
<25-12,Lucas>I was, till I saw that you had virtually stopped writing them

638
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
<25-12,Lucas>写病历
<25-12,Lucas>About four weeks ago.

639
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,600
<25-13,Chase>忙得很  就积压下了
<25-13,Chase>Been busy. Got a backlog.

640
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
<25-13,Chase>是吗
<25-13,Chase>Yeah...

641
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
<25-14,Lucas>你这个水平的医生
<25-14,Lucas>People with your level of precision

642
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,000
<25-14,Lucas>应该不只是"积压"这么简单吧
<25-14,Lucas>Don't really just "get" backlogs.

643
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
<25-14,Lucas>没人知道你为什么要离开医院
<25-14,Lucas>No one knows why you're leaving ppth.

644
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,400
<25-15,Chase>因为这是私人问题
<25-15,Chase>Because it's personal.

645
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,000
<25-16,Lucas>如果发生了什么事的话
<25-16,Lucas>Well, if something happened,

646
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,200
<25-16,Lucas>我是说  如果你
<25-16,Lucas>I mean, if you're leaving

647
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,100
<25-16,Lucas>想逃避一些你曾经做过的事儿
<25-16,Lucas>To get away from something that you did,

648
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,200
<25-16,Lucas>或是她的  或是你们俩的
<25-16,Lucas>Or she did, or both of you did.

649
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,600
<25-16,Lucas>我的意思是  感情上也许你是想逃避
<25-16,Lucas>I mean, emotionally maybe you want to run away,

650
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,500
<25-16,Lucas>但以我的经验来看
<25-16,Lucas>But in my experience,

651
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,600
<25-16,Lucas>如果你被别人家院子里的恶狗盯上了
<25-16,Lucas>If you're staring at a pit bull in some guy's back yard,

652
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,200
<25-16,Lucas>你最好待在那别动
<25-16,Lucas>You're better off staying right where you are.

653
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
<25-16,Lucas>直面问题
<25-16,Lucas>Face the problem.

654
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,100
<25-16,Lucas>这样它才不会扑上来咬你屁股
<25-16,Lucas>That way it can't bite you in the ass.

655
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,300
<25-17,Chase>谢谢你的寓言智慧
<25-17,Chase>Thanks for the folksy wisdom.

656
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
<25-18,Lucas>你有其他三个人的把柄吗
<25-18,Lucas>Hey, you got any, uh, dirt on any of the other three?

657
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,900
<25-18,Lucas>这样会帮助我的
<25-18,Lucas>It'd really help me out.

658
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,400
<26-1,Lexa>我记得你说过他吃了那两片药就会好
<26-1,Lexa>I thought you said those two pills was all he needed!

659
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,300
<26-2,Cameron>肺部充满液体
<26-2,Cameron>Lungs are filling with fluid.

660
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,500
<26-3,Chase>给他用气泵  输氧
<26-3,Chase>Suction him and get him on oxygen.

661
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,300
<26-3,Chase>病人肺部严重损坏
<26-3,Chase>Patient's lungs are severely compromised.

662
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,600
<27-1,Chase>肝功能仍在衰竭
<27-1,Chase>Liver's still failing.

663
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
<27-2,Cameron>寄生虫可能是巧合
<27-2,Cameron>Worms could easily have been a coincidence.

664
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
<27-2,Cameron>他甚至惊奇怎么会有寄生虫
<27-2,Cameron>Almost be surprising if he didn't have 'em.

665
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,300
<27-3,Chase>意味着可能是血液病
<27-3,Chase>Which means it could be a hematological problem

666
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
<27-3,Chase>外加心肌梗塞
<27-3,Chase>Plus cardiomyopathy.

667
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,600
<27-4,House>不  颈静脉平滑  心前区检查正常
<27-4,House>No, neck veins are flat, precordial exam was normal.

668
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
<27-5,Foreman>可能是淋巴瘤吗
<27-5,Foreman>What if it's lymphoma?

669
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,400
<27-5,Foreman>腹腔癌症广泛侵犯会导致肝功能衰竭
<27-5,Foreman>Peritoneal carcinomatosis explains the liver failure.

670
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,700
<27-5,Foreman>肿瘤伴随综合症可以解释所有症状
<27-5,Foreman>Paraneoplastic syndrome explains everything else.

671
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,600
<27-6,House>是淋巴瘤
<27-6,House>Lymphoma it is.

672
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,500
<27-6,House>准备给他做化疗
<27-6,House>Prep him for chemo.

673
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,400
<27-6,House>给陶博和13传真去最新情况
<27-6,House>Fax taub and thirteen the latest update on the case.

674
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,100
<27-7,Cameron>真的吗
<27-7,Cameron>Seriously?

675
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,200
<27-8,House>他们和团队里每个人一样有知情权
<27-8,House>They have as much right to know as anyone on the team.

676
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,400
<27-9,Cameron>你到底是喜不喜欢诊断
<27-9,Cameron>You either like the diagnosis or you don't.

677
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,000
<27-9,Cameron>如果不喜欢  就继续说下去
<27-9,Cameron>If you don't, we need to keep talking.

678
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,100
<27-9,Cameron>如果喜欢  就闭嘴
<27-9,Cameron>If you do, you need to shut up.

679
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,200
<27-9,Cameron>我们没劲和你玩这愚蠢游戏了
<27-9,Cameron>What we don't need is this stupid game.

680
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
<28-1,Chase>你冲豪斯发火  但你没冲我发火
<28-1,Chase>You're mad at house, but you're not mad at me.

681
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
<28-2,Cameron>你想让我冲你发火吗
<28-2,Cameron>Do you want me to be mad at you?

682
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,300
<28-3,Chase>你骂豪斯了  没骂我
<28-3,Chase>You blame House. Not me.

683
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,200
<28-4,Cameron>我冲豪斯发火是因为他是个混蛋
<28-4,Cameron>I am mad at House because he's an ass.

684
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,000
<28-4,Cameron>我也想冲你发火  但我不想离开你
<28-4,Cameron>And I am mad at you, but I don't want to leave you.

685
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,800
<28-5,Chase>我做了有生以来最糟糕的事情
<28-5,Chase>What I did may be the worst thing I ever did.

686
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,200
<28-5,Chase>也可能是最好的
<28-5,Chase>It may be the best.

687
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,500
<28-5,Chase>我既是个杀人犯  也是个阻止谋杀的角色
<28-5,Chase>I'm either a murderer or a guy who stopped a mass murderer,

688
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,900
<28-5,Chase>但确实是我做了  是我
<28-5,Chase>But I did it. Me.

689
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,000
<28-5,Chase>而且就算是曾经让我崩溃  但我今天仍要做
<28-5,Chase>And even if it destroys me, I'd do it again today.

690
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,300
<28-6,Cameron>你不是这个意思  不像你
<28-6,Cameron>You don't mean that. This isn't you.

691
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,400
<28-7,Chase>我不想逃避自己所做的一切
<28-7,Chase>I'm not running away from what I did

692
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
<28-7,Chase>只因为你想让我装作从未做过
<28-7,Chase>Because you want to pretend I never did it.

693
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
<28-8,Cameron>如果你是那么想的...
<28-8,Cameron>If that's how you feel...

694
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,000
<28-8,Cameron>好吧
<28-8,Cameron>Okay.

695
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,100
<29-1,House>我的策略毫不起作用
<29-1,House>My strategy's not completely working.

696
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,500
<29-1,House>他们四个都想跟我
<29-1,House>All four of them want to work for me,

697
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,100
<29-1,House>但他们四个也都有各自
<29-1,House>But all four of them have reasons

698
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,300
<29-1,House>不想跟我的理由
<29-1,House>Why they don't want to work for me.

699
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
<29-1,House>我怎么能选一个出来
<29-1,House>How do I get them to take one from column a

700
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,400
<29-1,House>其他都放弃呢
<29-1,House>And none from column b?

701
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
<29-1,House>对了
<29-1,House>Right.

702
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
<29-1,House>就这样  啥也不说
<29-1,House>Right, by not saying anything,

703
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,800
<29-1,House>你是说我已经有答案了
<29-1,House>You're saying that the answer is inside me.

704
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
<29-2,Wilson>答案和问题没有任何关系
<29-2,Wilson>The answer has nothing to do with the question.

705
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
<29-3,House>那么理论上说不算答案
<29-3,House>Then it's not technically the answer.

706
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
<29-4,Wilson>你为什么需要这3个医生呢
<29-4,Wilson>Why do you need three of these doctors?

707
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,700
<29-5,House>因为我知道他们很好
<29-5,House>Because I know they're good.

708
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
<29-5,House>其他医生归类到可能不错的类别
<29-5,House>Other doctors fall into the "might be good" category.

709
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,200
<29-6,Wilson>这跟他们好不好没有关系
<29-6,Wilson>It has nothing to do with them being good.

710
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
<29-6,Wilson>你觉得他们大部分时间都是笨蛋
<29-6,Wilson>You think they're idiots half the time,

711
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
<29-6,Wilson>但他们让你觉得舒服
<29-6,Wilson>But they're comfortable.

712
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,000
<29-6,Wilson>你感觉被卡迪抛弃了
<29-6,Wilson>You feel abandoned by Cuddy,

713
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
<29-6,Wilson>所以靠接近你认识的人来安慰自己
<29-6,Wilson>So you're reaching out to people you know for comfort.

714
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,900
<29-7,House>你说的没错
<29-7,House>Oh, my god, you're right.

715
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
<29-7,House>我根本不需要医生
<29-7,House>I don't need doctors at all.

716
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,600
<29-7,House>我需要的是一个好朋友
<29-7,House>I just need a good friend.

717
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,300
<29-8,Wilson>卡迪说的没错
<29-8,Wilson>Cuddy's right.

718
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,900
<29-8,Wilson>也许  只是也许
<29-8,Wilson>Maybe, just maybe,

719
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,400
<29-8,Wilson>如果我不合作  你会意识到
<29-8,Wilson>If I don't play along, you'll realize

720
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,100
<29-8,Wilson>肤浅的方法不能解决深奥的问题
<29-8,Wilson>You can't solve a deeper problem with a surface solution.

721
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,900
<29-9,House>如果你什么都不说问题会更深奥的
<29-9,House>Would've been more profound if you hadn't said anything.

722
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,400
<30-1,Foreman>你没事吧
<30-1,Foreman>You okay?

723
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
<30-2,Chase>正在解决
<30-2,Chase>Getting through it.

724
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,600
<30-3,Foreman>要是你们两个不在这儿问题会简单很多
<30-3,Foreman>Be a lot easier once you two are away from here.

725
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
<30-4,Chase>他在尿血
<30-4,Chase>He's peeing blood.

726
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
<30-4,Chase>血压升高
<30-4,Chase>BPs rising.

727
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
<30-5,Foreman>心率250
<30-5,Foreman>Heart rate's up to 250.

728
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,500
<30-5,Foreman>心跳要停止了
<30-5,Foreman>He's going into cardiac arrest.

729
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,600
<30-6,Chase>充电
<30-6,Chase>Charging.

730
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,800
<30-6,Chase>准备
<30-6,Chase>Clear.

731
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,700
<30-7,Foreman>在出血
<30-7,Foreman>He's bleeding out.

732
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,300
<30-8,Chase>他身体完全没反应
<30-8,Chase>His body's completely giving out.

733
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,900
<30-6,Chase>充电  准备
<30-6,Chase>Charging. Clear.

734
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
<31-1,Cameron>他已经稳定了
<31-1,Cameron>We've got him stabilized,

735
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,200
<31-1,Cameron>但是没有红血球  白血球
<31-1,Cameron>But no red cells, no white cells,

736
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,900
<31-1,Cameron>血小板也几乎没有
<31-1,Cameron>Practically no platelets either.

737
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,800
<31-2,Chase>甲苯咪唑会导致不良反应 但和他症状不同
<31-2,Chase>Mebendazole can cause adverse effects, but nothing like this.

738
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,600
<31-3,Foreman>他昨天就已经不做电磁波了
<31-3,Foreman>He's been off EM since yesterday, anyway.

739
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,700
<31-4,House>试着猜想任何可能性
<31-4,House>Long passes, wild guesses, anything.

740
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,300
<31-5,Chase>垂体机能减退
<31-5,Chase>Hypopituitarism.

741
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,500
<31-5,Chase>可能导致多器官衰竭
<31-5,Chase>Could cause multi-organ failure if...

742
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,300
<31-6,House>如果他的甲状腺激素不完全正常
<31-6,House>If his thyroid hormone wasn't completely normal.

743
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
<31-7,Cameron>肾细胞癌
<31-7,Cameron>Renal cell carcinoma.

744
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,100
<31-8,House>肾脏超声波没有问题
<31-8,House>Renal ultrasound was clean.

745
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,900
<31-9,Foreman>我觉得是白血病
<31-9,Foreman>I'd say aleukemic leukemia.

746
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,800
<31-9,Foreman>骨髓没有制造足够的正常细胞
<31-9,Foreman>Marrow's not making enough normal cells...

747
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,200
<31-10,House>烧蚀病人的骨髓
<31-10,House>Ablate the patient's bone marrow.

748
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
<31-10,House>找匹配的捐赠人
<31-10,House>Find him a donor match.

749
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,200
<31-11,Cameron>你想烧蚀骨髓吗
<31-11,Cameron>You want to nuke the patient's marrow?

750
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,000
<31-11,Cameron>没有证据显示他贫血
<31-11,Cameron>He had no evidence of being anemic

751
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,800
<31-11,Cameron>或免疫缺陷
<31-11,Cameron>Or immune-compromised when he was admitted.

752
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,000
<31-12,Chase>白细胞也正常
<31-12,Chase>Perfect white count as well.

753
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,300
<31-13,Foreman>烧蚀可能会致死
<31-13,Foreman>Ablation could kill him

754
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,500
<31-13,Foreman>或者让他对传染病丧失抵抗力
<31-13,Foreman>Or leave him defenseless against an infection that could.

755
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,700
<31-14,House>那就提出更好的建议
<31-14,House>Well, then come up with something better.

756
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,300
<31-14,House>正常治疗他也可能会死
<31-14,House>He may as well die while we're treating him.

757
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,600
<31-14,House>我找其他候选人参与进来
<31-14,House>Okay with you if I bring the other candidates

758
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,700
<31-14,House>你们没有意见吧
<31-14,House>Into the loop now?

759
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,900
<32-1,Taub>风险是及其微小的
<32-1,Taub>The risks are, uh, they're really minimal.

760
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,700
<32-1,Taub>我们会进行一系列无痛注射然后
<32-1,Taub>We'll do a series of painless injections, and...

761
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,000
<32-1,Taub>不好意思
<32-1,Taub>Excuse me.

762
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,500
<32-1,Taub>就像治疗普通门诊病人一样
<32-1,Taub>The whole thing can be done as an outpatient.

763
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
<33-1,Cuddy>你早上11点就走了吗
<33-1,Cuddy>You were leaving at 11:00 A.M.?

764
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
<33-2,House>相信我  马上就要结束了
<33-2,House>Trust me, case is almost over.

765
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,700
<33-3,Cuddy>福曼告诉我你打算烧蚀病人的骨髓
<33-3,Cuddy>Foreman told me you're ablating the patient's marrow,

766
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,300
<33-3,Cuddy>根据他自己放弃的没有依据的推测
<33-3,Cuddy>On a non-theory that Foreman himself withdrew.

767
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
<33-3,Cuddy>你会害死病人的
<33-3,Cuddy>You're gonna kill the patient.

768
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,100
<33-3,Cuddy>是因为我和卢卡斯的关系吗
<33-3,Cuddy>Is this about me and Lucas?

769
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,200
<33-3,Cuddy>我需要备选治疗方案
<33-3,Cuddy>I want alternatives for the patient.

770
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,400
<33-4,House>我也想
<33-4,House>So do I.

771
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,300
<34-1,Chase>我想加入
<34-1,Chase>I want to be on the team.

772
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
<34-2,House>你觉得它能挽救你的婚姻吗
<34-2,House>You think that's gonna save your marriage?

773
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,000
<34-3,Chase>不知道
<34-3,Chase>I don't know.

774
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
<34-4,House>四个候选  三个空缺
<34-4,House>Four candidates, three spots.

775
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,900
<34-4,House>我面临难题啊
<34-4,House>I got a tough decision ahead of me.

776
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,900
<34-4,House>瑞米  我是西品萨肯市
<34-4,House>Hi, Remy, this is Doctor Turner

777
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
<34-4,House>自由门诊的特纳尔医生
<34-4,House>From the Pennsauken Free Clinic.

778
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,200
<34-4,House>我们想见你  你来决定吧
<34-4,House>We all loved meeting you, and, well, the job's yours.

779
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,100
<34-4,House>给我回电话  我们约个时间
<34-4,House>Call me back. Let's pick a start date.

780
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,900
<35-1,Phyllis>我希望看起来自然
<35-1,Phyllis>I want it to look natural.

781
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,500
<35-1,Phyllis>我的意思是要年轻很多  但要自然
<35-1,Phyllis>I mean, much younger, but natural.

782
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,800
<35-1,Phyllis>可以同时去掉鱼尾纹吗
<35-1,Phyllis>Can you get rid of the crow's feet altogether?

783
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,900
<35-1,Phyllis>还是留下比较好
<35-1,Phyllis>Or is it better to leave a trace of them?

784
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,600
<35-1,Phyllis>反正我看起来也没有老到有眼纹的地步吧
<35-1,Phyllis>I don't look old enough to have them anyway, do I?

785
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
<35-2,Taub>当然
<35-2,Taub>Absolutely.

786
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,500
<35-3,Phyllis>我看起来老吗
<35-3,Phyllis>I do look old enough?

787
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,500
<35-4,Taub>不  什么  不好意思
<35-4,Taub>No. What? I'm sorry.

788
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,700
<35-4,Taub>稍等一下
<35-4,Taub>Hang on a second.

789
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,600
<36-1,Foreman>你怎么在这儿
<36-1,Foreman>Why are you here?

790
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,200
<36-2,House>因为我觉得我们错了
<36-2,House>Because I think we're wrong.

791
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
<36-2,House>可能将会出错
<36-2,House>Which means something's gonna go wrong.

792
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,600
<36-2,House>或者没有
<36-2,House>Or right.

793
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
<36-2,House>我是高山
<36-2,House>Takayama here.

794
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,700
<37-1,Taub>是我和13  停止烧蚀
<37-1,Taub>It's me and thirteen. Stop the ablation.

795
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,600
<37-2,House>原因呢
<37-2,House>Because?

796
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
<37-3,Thirteen>因为线虫
<37-3,Thirteen>Those threadworms.

797
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
<37-3,Thirteen>为什么线虫刚消失几个小时
<37-3,Thirteen>Why would his body have gone to hell

798
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,300
<37-3,Thirteen>他的身体就不行了
<37-3,Thirteen>Just hours after they were gone?

799
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
<37-4,Taub>蠕虫不会伤害他
<37-4,Taub>The worms weren't hurting him.

800
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
<37-4,Taub>它们在帮助他  他患有肠外克隆氏症
<37-4,Taub>They were helping him. He has extraintestinal crohn's.

801
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,300
<37-4,Taub>因为生活在过于干净
<37-4,Taub>He got it from being raised in a too clean,

802
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,400
<37-4,Taub>和过分保护的环境他才患上这种病
<37-4,Taub>Too overprotective of an environment.

803
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,700
<37-5,Thirteen>这是卫生假说
<37-5,Thirteen>It's the hygiene hypothesis.

804
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,100
<37-5,Thirteen>为什么发达世界会有这么多自身免疫疾病
<37-5,Thirteen>Why there's so much autoimmune disease in the developed world,

805
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,900
<37-5,Thirteen>而发展中国家却没有
<37-5,Thirteen>And almost none in the developing world.

806
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,600
<37-6,Taub>那些寄生虫抑制了克隆氏病发作
<37-6,Taub>The worms were keeping the crohn's in check,

807
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,300
<37-6,Taub>同时指导他的免疫系统
<37-6,Taub>Teaching his immune system

808
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,900
<37-6,Taub>如何忍辱负重生存下来
<37-6,Taub>What it should've learned from eating dirt growing up.

809
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
<37-7,Thirteen>一旦杀光寄生虫  他也危在旦夕了
<37-7,Thirteen>Once you killed them, it started killing him.

810
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,800
<37-8,House>也就是说  他肮脏的生活本无大碍
<37-8,House>So his life of filth wasn't the problem,

811
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,700
<37-8,House>企图净化才会带来问题
<37-8,House>Clean living was.

812
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,500
<37-8,House>给他用甲泼尼龙
<37-8,House>Let's start him on methylprednisolone.

813
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,100
<37-9,Taub>还有寄生虫
<37-9,Taub>And some helminths.

814
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,500
<37-9,Taub>虫子
<37-9,Taub>Worms.

815
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,700
<37-10,House>挺不错的啊
<37-10,House>Cool, huh?

816
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,700
<37-10,House>最优秀的三只鸭子
<37-10,House>Best out of three?

817
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,800
<38-1,Porn actress>你是个坏孩子吗
<38-1,Porn actress>Have you been a bad boy?

818
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
<38-2,Taub>我想回到队伍里
<38-2,Taub>I want to be on the team.

819
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,100
<38-3,House>你老婆会很高兴的
<38-3,House>Good news for your wife.

820
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,200
<38-3,House>谢谢你的讽刺
<38-3,House>Thanks for the sarcasm.

821
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,600
<38-4,Taub>我改变生活轨迹  努力挤出时间陪她
<38-4,Taub>I reorganized my life to spend more time with her,

822
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,100
<38-4,Taub>不过显然  我没有想象中那么爱她
<38-4,Taub>But apparently I don't love her as much as I thought.

823
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,600
<38-5,House>或者说  你更爱她一些
<38-5,House>Or you love her more.

824
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,700
<38-5,House>这份工作带给你的刺激程度
<38-5,House>This job gives you the thrill

825
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,500
<38-5,House>不亚于搞婚外情
<38-5,House>You used to find through philandering.

826
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
<38-5,House>用量杯和MRI骗人
<38-5,House>Better to cheat with a beaker and an mri

827
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,000
<38-5,House>总好过和银发女病号乱搞
<38-5,House>Than one of your platinum-blonde plastic surgery patients.

828
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,500
<38-5,House>有消息我会通知你
<38-5,House>I'll let you know.

829
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,100
<39-1,Chase>我告诉豪斯  自己仍想为他工作
<39-1,Chase>I told House I want to work for him again.

830
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,700
<39-1,Chase>留下来吧
<39-1,Chase>Stay on the team.

831
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,100
<39-1,Chase>你总是比我专注得多
<39-1,Chase>You were always more into it than I was,

832
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,800
<39-1,Chase>更专注于诊断病情
<39-1,Chase>More interested in diagnostics.

833
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,400
<39-1,Chase>除非豪斯猜对了你急于离开的原因
<39-1,Chase>Unless House was right about why you want out.

834
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,200
<39-1,Chase>这下位置全满了
<39-1,Chase>Four for four.

835
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,700
<40-1,House>我曾经爱上过你
<40-1,House>I was in love with you.

836
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,500
<40-2,Cameron>真是个白痴
<40-2,Cameron>I was an idiot.

837
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,400
<40-2,Cameron>尝试着追随你  努力理解你
<40-2,Cameron>Tried to be like you, tried to understand you

838
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,500
<40-2,Cameron>就因为相信自己能治愈你
<40-2,Cameron>Because I thought I could heal you.

839
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,900
<40-2,Cameron>你几乎杀了那个病人
<40-2,Cameron>You almost killed that patient.

840
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,200
<40-3,House>如果几乎挽救了他的性命意味着
<40-3,House>If almost not saving his life means--

841
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
<40-4,Cameron>你早就知道病因了
<40-4,Cameron>You knew the diagnosis a long time ago.

842
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,000
<40-4,Cameron>用另一个病人的生命诱骗老部下回来
<40-4,Cameron>You risked another patient's life to bait your old team.

843
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,300
<40-5,House>另一个
<40-5,House>Another one?

844
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
<40-6,Cameron>是你杀死了迪巴拉
<40-6,Cameron>You did kill Dibala.

845
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,400
<40-6,Cameron>你左右他人的生活  也教会我们这么做
<40-6,Cameron>By playing god and teaching us to do the same.

846
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,000
<40-7,House>我教会你们如何独立思考
<40-7,House>I taught you to think for yourselves.

847
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,100
<40-8,Cameron>在你眼中他们甚至算不上人
<40-8,Cameron>You don't even think of them as people.

848
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,500
<40-8,Cameron>只是供你解谜的小白鼠
<40-8,Cameron>They're just lab rats for your little puzzles.

849
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,300
<40-9,House>你去为人性歌颂吧
<40-9,House>As you celebrate their humanity,

850
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,700
<40-9,House>我宁可专注于解谜和挽救他们的性命
<40-9,House>I'd rather solve those little puzzles and save their lives.

851
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,800
<40-10,Cameron>动机固然很重要
<40-10,Cameron>Motives do matter.

852
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,100
<40-10,Cameron>但人死也不能重生
<40-10,Cameron>Lives can't come second.

853
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,600
<40-11,House>病人还活着  这就够了
<40-11,House>The patient is alive. That's what matters.

854
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,100
<40-12,Cameron>你不会满足的
<40-12,Cameron>Not to you.

855
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
<40-12,Cameron>你只想让陶博和13也参与到这个游戏里
<40-12,Cameron>All you care about is that Taub and Thirteen fell for your game.

856
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,900
<40-12,Cameron>像毒害奇斯一样  把他们也迷倒了
<40-12,Cameron>You'll poison them just like you poisoned Chase.

857
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,800
<40-13,House>你丈夫杀了个病人 你却要和我谈分手
<40-13,House>Your husband killed a patient and you're breaking up with me.

858
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,400
<40-14,Cameron>是你毁了他
<40-14,Cameron>You ruined him.

859
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,300
<40-14,Cameron>让他是非不分
<40-14,Cameron>So he can't even see right from wrong.

860
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
<40-14,Cameron>再也意识不到生命的神圣
<40-14,Cameron>Can't even see the sanctity of a human life anymore.

861
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,700
<40-14,Cameron>我爱过你
<40-14,Cameron>I loved you.

862
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,300
<40-14,Cameron>也爱过奇斯
<40-14,Cameron>And I loved Chase.

863
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,700
<40-14,Cameron>看到你们这样我很心痛
<40-14,Cameron>I'm sorry for you both.

864
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
<40-14,Cameron>你们已经变成这样
<40-14,Cameron>For what you've become.

865
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,700
<40-14,Cameron>因为
<40-14,Cameron>Because...

866
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,900
<40-14,Cameron>你们再也没有退路了
<40-14,Cameron>There's no way back for either of you.

867
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,100
<41-1,House>我在哪能领到一块
<41-1,House>Any idea where I can get

868
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
<41-1,House>任务完成的大牌子
<41-1,House>A great, big "mission accomplished" banner?

869
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,000
<41-1,House>恢复了理智
<41-1,House>Got my sanity back,

870
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,100
<41-1,House>执照也失而复得  现在
<41-1,House>My license back, and now...

871
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,900
<41-2,Wilson>开玩笑吧  全回归了
<41-2,Wilson>You're kidding. All of them?

872
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,100
<41-3,House>四个回来了三个
<41-3,House>Three out of four.

873
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,500
<41-3,House>几乎跟五个回来四个一样棒
<41-3,House>Which is almost as good as four out of five.

874
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,200
<41-4,Wilson>那是谁
<41-4,Wilson>Who was the--

875
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,100
<41-5,House>卡梅隆
<41-5,House>Cameron.

876
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,200
<41-6,Wilson>难以置信
<41-6,Wilson>I can't believe it.

877
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,600
<41-6,Wilson>真的不敢
<41-6,Wilson>I mean, really. I can't...

878
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,600
<41-6,Wilson>相信
<41-6,Wilson>Believe it.

879
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,000
<41-6,Wilson>没错  豪斯  这很好
<41-6,Wilson>You were right, House. Good for you.

880
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,800
<41-7,House>是啊
<41-7,House>Yeah, it is.

881
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,300
<41-7,House>她和奇斯分手了  离开了医院
<41-7,House>She's broken up with Chase, and she's leaving the hospital.

882
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,300
<41-7,House>四个留下仨  不算糟糕了
<41-7,House>Still, three out of four ain't bad.
