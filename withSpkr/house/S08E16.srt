<1-5,Bobby>I still got your wings rookie card.

5
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,910
<1-6,Szabo>那东西用来干嘛
<1-6,Szabo>So what's that worth?

6
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,050
<1-7,Bobby>作为收藏品啊
<1-7,Bobby>It's a collector's item.

7
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,340
<1-7,Bobby>如今的制卡门槛可没那么低
<1-7,Bobby>They don't make them like you anymore.

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,120
<1-8,Szabo>想打架吗
<1-8,Szabo>So do you wanna go?

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,080
<1-9,Bobby>正有此意  放马过来
<1-9,Bobby>Square up. Good luck.

10
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,310
<1-10,Linesman>他连碰都没碰到你啊
<1-10,Linesman>He didn't get a hand on you?

11
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,290
<1-10,Linesman>真是没人能跟你比打架了
<1-10,Linesman>You're going to be a force in the show.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,200
<1-13,Toros Fan>加油  公牛队
<1-13,Toros Fan>Come on, Toros!

13
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,720
<1-14,Linesman>找个队医来
<1-14,Linesman>Get a trainer over here!

34
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,680
<2-1,House>满座观众  全场起立
<2-1,House>Capacity crowd is on its feet.

35
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,590
<2-1,House>比赛还剩五秒结束
<2-1,House>Five seconds on the clock.

36
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,460
<2-1,House>这怎么可能  一个球员
<2-1,House>How is it possible for one man

37
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,030
<2-1,House>竟如此的技艺超群
<2-1,House>to be blessed with so much skill?

38
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,130
<2-2,Taub>我以前有个差不多的
<2-2,Taub>I had one just like this,

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,010
<2-2,Taub>不过是棕熊对蒙特利尔加拿大人
<2-2,Taub>except it was Bruins and the Habs.

40
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,620
<2-2,Taub>你从哪弄的
<2-2,Taub>Where did you get it?

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,760
<2-3,House>小儿肿瘤科某病童的生日礼物
<2-3,House>Birthday present for someone in pediatric oncology.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,630
<2-3,House>22岁执行者  咯血
<2-3,House>22-year-old enforcer with hemoptysis.

44
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,700
<2-4,Adams>他是冰球运动员吗
<2-4,Adams>He's a hockey player?

45
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,940
<2-5,House>不  他是超级英雄
<2-5,House>No, he's a superhero.

46
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,160
<2-6,Taub>他咳嗽咳出血来
<2-6,Taub>He's coughing up blood

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,720
<2-6,Taub>可能是由于  他以体育名义打断别人肋骨
<2-6,Taub>because he probably broke a rib and punctured a lung

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,210
<2-6,Taub>致使别人肺部被刺破时
<2-6,Taub>while breaking someone else's rib

49
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,240
<2-6,Taub>自己也受伤  肋骨骨折并刺破肺
<2-6,Taub>and puncturing their lung in the name of sport.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,310
<2-7,House>推断得挺好  不过18小时前
<2-7,House>Nice conclusion to which the E.R. already jumped

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,950
<2-7,House>已被急症室排除
<2-7,House>18 hours ago.

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-7,House>短脚虾就是受气包
<2-7,House>Short man equals bullied child.

53

<2-8,Taub>我小时是平均身高  没受过欺负
<2-8,Taub>I was average height as a kid and never bullied.

54
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,140
<2-9,Adams>到现在为止了
<2-9,Adams>Until now.

55
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,790
<2-9,Adams>胸片已排除创伤后遗症
<2-9,Adams>X-ray ruled out traumatic sequelae,

<2-9,Adams>overt TB, and lung cancer.

57

<2-10,Chase>结节病  结节可能很小
<2-10,Chase>Sarcoidosis. Nodules could be too small

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,300
<2-10,Chase>胸片查不出来
<2-10,Chase>to show up on an X-ray.

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,060
<2-10,Chase>打架是冰球最精彩的部分
<2-10,Chase>Fighting's the best part of hockey.

60
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,700
<2-10,Chase>少了斗殴  等于看溜冰
<2-10,Chase>Without it, you've got the Ice Capades.

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,560
<2-11,Taub>打架与冰球毫不相干
<2-11,Taub>Fighting has nothing to do with hockey.

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,380
<2-11,Taub>不过似于篮球赛的拉拉队
<2-11,Taub>It's like the cheerleaders at a basketball game.

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,220
<2-12,Chase>拉拉队助阵是篮球赛最精彩的部分
<2-12,Chase>Cheerleading's the best part of basketball.

64
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,020
<2-12,Chase>少了拉拉队  等于看  篮球
<2-12,Chase>Without it you've got... basketball.

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,450
<2-13,Adams>他是鸭猎人
<2-13,Adams>He's a duck hunter.

66
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,030
<2-13,Adams>可能经接触飞禽
<2-13,Adams>He could've contracted psittacosis

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,020
<2-13,Adams>而染上鹦鹉热
<2-13,Adams>from exposure to fowl.

68
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,200
<2-14,Taub>他两周前曾被打落三颗牙
<2-14,Taub>He had three teeth knocked out two weeks ago.

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,780
<2-14,Taub>可能为感染导致的口腔出血
<2-14,Taub>Infection could've led to oral bleeding.

70
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,700
<2-15,Park>他并没有持续性牙齿疼痛
<2-15,Park>Not without continuing dental pain.

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,220
<2-16,Taub>那就是他下消化道受创
<2-16,Taub>Then he took an elbow to the gut,

72
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,610
<2-16,Taub>导致食管撕裂
<2-16,Taub>which caused an esophageal tear.

73
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,900
<2-17,House>奇斯  给病人做CT查结节病
<2-17,House>Chase, CT the patient. Check for sarcoid.

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,310
<2-17,House>亚当斯  做痰培养
<2-17,House>Adams, sputum cultures

75
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,780
<2-17,House>和鹦鹉热的血清学检查  陶博
<2-17,House>and serologies for psittacosis. Taub...

76
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,830
<2-17,House>我挺想给你解释
<2-17,House>I'd tell you why I think your theory

77
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,020
<2-17,House>你理论的错谬与荒唐之处
<2-17,House>is not just wrong but ill-conceived,

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,180
<2-17,House>但让你化验粪便  看是否有血液
<2-17,House>but it's more fun to prove it

79
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,320
<2-17,House>而自己得出结论  那更有意思
<2-17,House>by having you check the stool for blood.

80
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,030
<2-17,House>在等粑粑仙子到来时
<2-17,House>And while we wait for the stool fairy,

81
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,410
<2-17,House>我这正好缺人  不如来场冰球
<2-17,House>I'm a man down, so you want to drop your pants

82
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,460
<2-17,House>让我虐一把
<2-17,House>and hit the ice.

83
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,660
<3-1,Bobby>你们能越快治愈我越好
<3-1,Bobby>The faster you guys can do this, the better.

84
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,820
<3-1,Bobby>国家冰球联盟正蠢蠢欲动
<3-1,Bobby>The NHL's been sniffing around,

85
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,660
<3-1,Bobby>住院对我职业前景没什么好处
<3-1,Bobby>and being in the hospital is not really helping my marketability.

86
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,810
<3-2,Adams>你应该相当抢手吧
<3-2,Adams>You have to be pretty good to get called up.

88
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,880
<3-3,Bobby>大概吧  害球队在我受罚期以少打多
<3-3,Bobby>Yeah, leading the league in penalty minutes.

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,900
<3-4,Taub>还是急症室常客  更别提你伤的人
<3-4,Taub>And visits to the E.R., not counting the ones you've caused.

90
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,430
<3-5,Bobby>我猜你不是冰球球迷
<3-5,Bobby>Not a hockey fan, I gather?

91
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,960
<3-6,Taub>我是  这才是问题
<3-6,Taub>I am. That's the point.

92
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,430
<3-6,Taub>打架让体育竞技变得粗俗
<3-6,Taub>Fighting cheapens a great sport.

93
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,560
<3-7,Bobby>拜托  那就好比说  传球让足球变得粗俗
<3-7,Bobby>Oh, come on, that's like saying passing cheapens football.

94
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,610
<3-7,Bobby>那是比赛的一部分
<3-7,Bobby>It's part of the game.

95
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,250
<3-7,Bobby>伤人的不是我
<3-7,Bobby>I don't cause injuries.

96
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,590
<3-8,Taub>难道他们自伤吗
<3-8,Taub>They're self-inflicted?

97
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,010
<3-9,Bobby>不  我防止伤害发生
<3-9,Bobby>No, I prevent them.

98
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,530
<3-9,Bobby>他们冲我来
<3-9,Bobby>I take the hit

99
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,560
<3-9,Bobby>小个子才能免于其难
<3-9,Bobby>so the smaller guys don't have to.

100
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,350
<3-9,Bobby>我以为你这样的会懂
<3-9,Bobby>I thought you'd appreciate that.

101
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,980
<4-1,House>又是邻居家的小孩
<4-1,House>Neighbor's baby again?

102
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,270
<4-2,Wilson>两个枕头  耳塞  三片安眠药
<4-2,Wilson>I could hear it through earplugs, two pillows,

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,840
<4-2,Wilson>依旧被吵得没法睡
<4-2,Wilson>and three sleeping pills.

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,120
<4-4,Wilson>你又想说什么
<4-4,Wilson>What is wrong with you?

105
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,160
<4-5,House>我只说了  "嗯"
<4-5,House>I just said, "Hmm."

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,210
<4-6,Wilson>我好几晚没睡好
<4-6,Wilson>You're trying to figure out

107
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,170
<4-6,Wilson>你却在探究
<4-6,Wilson>some deeper significance to my having

108
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,240
<4-6,Wilson>其中深意
<4-6,Wilson>a couple of crappy nights.

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,430
<4-7,House>是谁在对一个"嗯"刨根究底
<4-7,House>Which one of us is analyzing the word "Hmm" here?

110
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,340
<4-8,Wilson>好吧  我的错
<4-8,Wilson>Fine. Sorry.

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,880
<4-9,House>接受你的道歉
<4-9,House>Apology accepted.

112
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,480
<4-9,House>话说回来
<4-9,House>However...

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,720
<4-11,House>不是孩子哭闹吵得你没法睡
<4-11,House>it's not the crying that's keeping you awake.

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,570
<4-12,Wilson>黏人小孩的哭闹
<4-12,Wilson>The sound of a needy child

115
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,560
<4-11,House>让你父爱荡漾
<4-11,House>is stirring your paternal juices.

116
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,370
<4-12,Wilson>黏人小孩的哭闹
<4-12,Wilson>The sound of a needy child

117
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,860
<4-12,Wilson>高达112分贝  让我想杀人
<4-12,Wilson>at 112 decibels has stirred my inner murderer.

118
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,660
<4-12,Wilson>别惹我
<4-12,Wilson>Don't mess with me.

119
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,630
<4-13,House>解释了你衬衫上的污渍
<4-13,House>Explain the stains on your shirt.

120
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,850
<4-13,House>你在泌乳
<4-13,House>You're lactating.

121
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,190
<4-13,House>你是家里的一脉单传  这个事实
<4-13,House>The fact that you're the only fruit on your family tree

122
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,420
<4-13,House>让你寝食难安
<4-13,House>is getting to you.

123
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,030
<4-14,Wilson>这没什么大不了
<4-14,Wilson>It's not a big deal.

124
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,040
<4-14,Wilson>对  我可能永远当不了父亲
<4-14,Wilson>So I'll probably never be a dad.

125
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,430
<4-14,Wilson>是  很糟
<4-14,Wilson>It's-- it sucks.

126
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,550
<4-14,Wilson>我会因此辗转几夜  不过
<4-14,Wilson>I'll lose a little sleep, but--

127
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,320
<4-15,House>你躲过一劫干嘛还要难过
<4-15,House>You're not supposed to feel bad when you dodge a bullet.

128
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,450
<4-15,House>像是幸存者心怀罪恶感
<4-15,House>It's like you got survivor's guilt.

129
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,790
<4-16,Wilson>这世上确实有些事
<4-16,Wilson>There are actually things

130
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,250
<4-16,Wilson>比起肥皂剧和怪物卡车
<4-16,Wilson>in this world that give life even more meaning

131
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,120
<4-16,Wilson>能给生活带来更多意义
<4-16,Wilson>than soap operas and monster trucks.

132
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
<4-16,Wilson>而我们却错过了至少其一
<4-16,Wilson>And we happen to be missing out on at least one of them.

133
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,750
<4-17,House>记得那个驯鹰人吗
<4-17,House>Remember the falconer?

134
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,160
<4-18,Wilson>贝丝
<4-18,Wilson>Beth?

135
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
<4-19,House>你还和其他驯鹰人约会过吗  当然是贝丝了
<4-19,House>You dated two falconers? Yes, Beth.

136
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,890
<4-19,House>你俩分手那晚
<4-19,House>The night the two of you split up,

137
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,600
<4-19,House>你来到我家
<4-19,House>you came around to my place,

138
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,710
<4-19,House>自怜自哀  借酒浇愁
<4-19,House>wallowing in self-pity and tequila.

139
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,780
<4-19,House>昏睡过去
<4-19,House>You passed out.

140
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,640
<4-19,House>那晚她打来电话  让我转告你
<4-19,House>She called that night, asked me to give you a message.

141
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,460
<4-19,House>她说她怀孕了
<4-19,House>She said she was pregnant...

142
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,580
<4-19,House>就是说  老天保佑  心诚则灵
<4-19,House>which, God and planned parenthood willing,

143
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,570
<4-19,House>你现在有个11岁大的孩子
<4-19,House>means you are the father of an 11-year-old.

144
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,110
<4-19,House>次日早上我告诉你
<4-19,House>I told you the next morning...

145
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,570
<4-19,House>以假设性口吻
<4-19,House>Hypothetically.

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,150
<4-19,House>问你要是她怀孕你怎么想
<4-19,House>I asked you how you'd feel if Beth had gotten pregnant,

147
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,370
<4-19,House>我引用你当时的话
<4-19,House>and you said, and I quote,

148
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,510
<4-19,House>"那会是我一辈子最大的错误"
<4-19,House>"It would be the worst mistake of my life."

149
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,550
<4-20,Wilson>你演够了吧
<4-20,Wilson>And... scene.

150
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,700
<4-20,Wilson>别开国际玩笑了
<4-20,Wilson>Two performances sunday, dark mondays?

151
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,970
<4-21,House>你自便吧
<4-21,House>Just as well.

152
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
<5-1,Park>我想杀了我妈
<5-1,Park>I want to kill my mother.

153
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,540
<5-1,Park>我姥姥孤身一人
<5-1,Park>My popo's on her own,

154
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,180
<5-1,Park>我妈总让我去照顾她
<5-1,Park>and my mother always needs me to take care of her.

155
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,560
<5-2,Chase>那你杀了你姥姥不就行了么
<5-2,Chase>Well, you could kill popo instead.

156
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,040
<5-3,Park>我不得不带她逛街
<5-3,Park>I have to take her shopping,

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,530
<5-3,Park>访友  甚至去大西洋城
<5-3,Park>to her friends, to Atlantic city.

159
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,610
<5-3,Park>我爱她  但也不能每晚
<5-3,Park>I love her, but every night,

160
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,820
<5-3,Park>每个周末都要我照顾啊
<5-3,Park>every weekend...

161
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,670
<5-4,Chase>如果有一个解决方法
<5-4,Chase>And only if there was some solution,

162
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,980
<5-4,Chase>比如一个你可以住的地方...
<5-4,Chase>someplace where you could live...

163
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,590
<5-4,Chase>肯定不是跟你父母住
<5-4,Chase>That's not there.

164
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,860
<5-5,Park>我妈肯定不同意
<5-5,Park>My mom would freak.

165
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,050
<5-5,Park>那可是不敬不孝的表现
<5-5,Park>It would be the ultimate sign of disrespect.

166
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,540
<5-6,Chase>好吧  那就忍着吧
<5-6,Chase>Okay. Then stay.

167
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,410
<5-6,Chase>或者你考虑下别再抱怨了
<5-6,Chase>And maybe you consider not bitching about it?

168
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,330
<5-7,Park>可不是每个人都跟你一样幸运能这么独立
<5-7,Park>Not everyone's lucky enough to have your independence.

169
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,820
<5-8,Chase>别担心
<5-8,Chase>Don't worry.

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,660
<5-8,Chase>当你没有家人的时候  你也会这么"幸运"了
<5-8,Chase>When you lose your family, you'll have it too.

171
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,070
<5-9,Park>他没有结节病
<5-9,Park>He doesn't have sarcoid.

172
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,690
<5-10,Chase>看啊
<5-10,Chase>Look at that.

173
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,400
<5-11,Park>-那是他的脾脏  -我知道
<5-11,Park>- That's his spleen. - I know.

174
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,260
<5-12,Chase>但他脾脏增大很明显
<5-12,Chase>But he's gotten it supersized.

175
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,940
<6-1,Taub>他多次受伤及手术 任何一次都可致
<6-1,Taub>Deep vein thrombosis caused by any one of

176
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,620
<6-1,Taub>深静脉血栓形成
<6-1,Taub>his many injuries or surgeries.

177
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,810
<6-2,Park>白血病更能解释他的症状
<6-2,Park>Leukemia's a better fit.

178
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,210
<6-3,Taub>咱们这病人基本上
<6-3,Taub>We have a guy who is punishing

179
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,520
<6-3,Taub>每天都要虐自己的身体
<6-3,Taub>his body on a daily basis.

180
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,300
<6-3,Taub>你难道不觉得这比癌症可能性更大吗
<6-3,Taub>Don't you think that's a more likely cause than cancer?

181
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
<6-4,Adams>不  因为她可没有成见
<6-4,Adams>No, because she doesn't have an agenda.

182
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,540
<6-5,House>这话说得可就不专业了啊
<6-5,House>Well, that was incredibly unprofessional.

183
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,190
<6-5,House>这其实都是陶博的错
<6-5,House>Well, it was really Taub's fault.

184
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,310
<6-5,House>如果不是你准备把她直接驳倒
<6-5,House>If you're not prepared to slam her into the boards,

185
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,040
<6-5,House>她可不会跟你作对
<6-5,House>she's got no reason not to go after you.

186
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,750
<6-5,House>我建议先用她的球衣蒙住她的头
<6-5,House>Might I suggest pulling her jersey over her head first?

187
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,260
<6-6,Chase>用超声检验深静脉血栓并查白细胞检验白血病
<6-6,Chase>We should get an ultrasound for DVT and WBC for leukemia.

188
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,190
<7-1,Bobby>你认为我得了癌症吗
<7-1,Bobby>You think I could have cancer?

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,460
<7-2,Taub>更有可能是深静脉血栓
<7-2,Taub>More likely, it's just a DVT.

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,930
<7-3,Bobby>是我的经纪人  我得接这电话
<7-3,Bobby>This is my agent. I gotta get this, man.

191
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,140
<7-3,Bobby>说点好消息吧  肯尼
<7-3,Bobby>Give me some good news, Kenny.

192
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,900
<7-3,Bobby>我记得你说哪天都行
<7-3,Bobby>I thought you said any day.

193
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,230
<7-3,Bobby>好吧
<7-3,Bobby>Okay.

194
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,980
<7-3,Bobby>行
<7-3,Bobby>All right.

195
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,200
<7-3,Bobby>我得挂了
<7-3,Bobby>I gotta go.

196
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,750
<7-3,Bobby>我给贝丝打过电话了
<7-3,Bobby>I called Beth.

197
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,070
<8-1,Wilson>我有个11岁大的儿子
<8-1,Wilson>I have an 11-year-old son.

198
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,190
<8-1,Wilson>肝衰竭可改变激素水平
<8-1,Wilson>Liver failure could alter hormone levels,

199
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,080
<9-1,Chase>导致乳腺异常发育
<9-1,Chase>cause abnormal breast development.

200
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,470
<9-2,Park>酒精中毒
<9-2,Park>Alcoholism.

201
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,460
<9-2,Park>我们应该去检查他家和更衣室
<9-2,Park>We should search his home and locker room.

202
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,890
<9-3,House>注意  那个要检查别人家的人
<9-3,House>Note that the person who wants to search the home

203
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,560
<9-3,House>昨晚没回家
<9-3,House>didn't sleep in one last night.

204
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
<9-3,House>你脸上有安全带勒过的痕迹
<9-3,House>You have the imprint of a seatbelt buckle in your cheek.

205
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,390
<9-4,Park>我和我妈吵架了
<9-4,Park>I got in a fight with my mother.

206
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,910
<9-5,House>她拿安全带打你了吗
<9-5,House>She hit you with a seatbelt?

208
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,250
<9-6,Chase>有可能是血色病
<9-6,Chase>Could be hemochromatosis.

209
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,530
<9-7,Adams>可解释肝脾病变
<9-7,Adams>Explains the liver and the spleen,

210
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,260
<9-7,Adams>但不能解释咯血
<9-7,Adams>but hemoptysis is a stretch.

211
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,630
<9-7,Adams>会不会是钩体病
<9-7,Adams>What about leptospirosis?

212
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,510
<9-8,Taub>有道理
<9-8,Taub>That's a good fit,

213
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,150
<9-8,Taub>但你忘了他可是一个职业运动员
<9-8,Taub>if you ignore the fact that he's a pro athlete

214
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,680
<9-8,Taub>跟绿巨人一样健硕
<9-8,Taub>who looks like the Incredible Hulk,

215
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,410
<9-8,Taub>意味着他可能长期应用激素
<9-8,Taub>which means he's gotta be on steroids,

216
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,270
<9-8,Taub>这更有道理一点
<9-8,Taub>which is a better fit.

217
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,390
<9-9,House>我们一定要把他生病的原因
<9-9,House>All we really know for sure is it was his evil job

218
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,430
<9-9,House>归结到他邪恶的工作
<9-9,House>that caused the problems.

219
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,650
<9-10,Taub>没错  我不喜欢他
<9-10,Taub>Yes, I don't like him.

220
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,270
<9-10,Taub>但并不意味着我的判断力会受影响
<9-10,Taub>Doesn't mean my judgment's affected.

221
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,190
<9-11,House>可能吧  咱们看一段回放录像
<9-11,House>Maybe. Let's take a look at the instant replay.

222
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,360
<9-11,House>就是这个动作引起了
<9-11,House>This is the hit that precipitated

224
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,920
<9-11,House>后面的斗殴事件
<9-11,House>Bobby Orr's fight.

225
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,710
<9-11,House>这动作有没有犯规
<9-11,House>Dirty or clean?

226
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,400
<9-12,Taub>没有犯规
<9-12,Taub>The hit was clean.

227
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,230
<9-12,Taub>真的吗
<9-12,Taub>Really?

228
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,700
<9-13,Adams>那家伙至少在被撞
<9-13,Adams>The guy released the puck

229
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,330
<9-13,Adams>一秒前就把球传了出去
<9-13,Adams>at least a second before the hit.

230
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,380
<9-14,Taub>我们只是意见相左  仅此而已
<9-14,Taub>We have a difference of opinion. That's all.

231
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,790
<9-14,Taub>绝对的
<9-14,Taub>Absolutely.

232
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,770
<9-15,House>也许她跟你一样充满偏见
<9-15,House>Maybe she's as biased as you,

233
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,940
<9-15,House>或者整个联赛都是这样
<9-15,House>or maybe the entire league is.

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,030
<9-15,House>在看过录像后  联赛纪律委员
<9-15,House>After review, the league disciplinary commissioner

235
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,000
<9-15,House>认定这个动作是犯规而且危险的
<9-15,House>ruled the hit illegal and dangerous

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,990
<9-15,House>罚那个球员停赛三场
<9-15,House>and suspended the player for three games.

237
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,950
<9-15,House>亚当斯和陶博去做钩体病的抗体检测
<9-15,House>Adams and Taub, run antibody titers for lepto.

238
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,550
<9-15,House>奇斯和朴  去他家
<9-15,House>Chase and Park, check out the home,

239
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,650
<9-15,House>还有更衣室看看有没有酒  激素
<9-15,House>the locker room for booze, steroids,

240
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,890
<9-15,House>和陶博的客观性
<9-15,House>and Taub's objectivity.

241
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,500
<10-1,Chase>至少你现在自由了
<10-1,Chase>At least you're free.

242
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,760
<10-1,Chase>你会自己租房子吗
<10-1,Chase>Going to get your own place?

243
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,000
<10-2,Park>也得我能找到我租得起的房子
<10-2,Park>If I can find a place I can afford,

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,770
<10-2,Park>所以...就不了
<10-2,Park>so...no.

245
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,340
<10-3,Chase>如果你愿意
<10-3,Chase>If you want,

246
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,840
<10-3,Chase>你可以在我那凑合一段时间
<10-3,Chase>you can crash at my place

247
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,080
<10-3,Chase>我那有间卧室空着
<10-3,Chase>in the spare bedroom.

248
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,030
<10-4,Park>那有点怪吧
<10-4,Park>That might be kind of weird.

249
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,840
<10-5,Chase>我住公寓里  又不是地窖
<10-5,Chase>I live in an apartment, not a dungeon.

250
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,600
<10-6,Park>孤男寡女共处一室  我...
<10-6,Park>It's just two single people, opposite sex. I--

251
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,450
<10-7,Chase>你的卧室可以从里面反锁
<10-7,Chase>Your bedroom door has a lock on the inside.

252
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,220
<10-7,Chase>如果你更喜欢睡车里  随你好了
<10-7,Chase>Hey, if you prefer your car, be my guest.

253
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,780
<10-8,Park>有更昔洛韦的处方
<10-8,Park>Scrip for ganciclovir.

255
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,370
<10-8,Park>如果他隔壁的有传单  他可能也有
<10-8,Park>If his neighbor has mono, could mean he has mono.

256
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,080
<10-8,Park>如果他患传单  可解释脾病变和咯血
<10-8,Park>If he has mono, explains his spleen and hemoptysis.

257
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,660
<10-8,Park>该病为EB病毒所致
<10-8,Park>And it's caused by epstein-barr virus,

258
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,450
<10-8,Park>这也解释了他的肝脏问题
<10-8,Park>which explains his liver.

259
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,810
<10-8,Park>我车的天窗漏水
<10-8,Park>And my moonroof leaks.

260
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,200
<10-8,Park>谢谢你
<10-8,Park>Thank you.

261
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,360
<11-1,House>咱们为什么不假装你不是孩子的爸爸
<11-1,House>Why don't we just assume that you're not the dad?

262
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,140
<11-1,House>如果你不是孩子爸爸  那她肯定就是
<11-1,House>Either you're the dad, or she cheated on you

263
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
<11-1,House>跟你爸劈腿了
<11-1,House>with your dad.

264
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,500
<11-2,Wilson>沙画
<11-2,Wilson>Oh! Sand art.

265
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,840
<11-2,Wilson>我以前可喜欢这个了
<11-2,Wilson>I used to love this.

266
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,620
<11-3,House>他有点可怜  又不是弱智
<11-3,House>He's bitter, not mentally handicapped.

267
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,110
<11-3,House>谁知道贝丝是怎么跟他说起你的
<11-3,House>Who knows what Beth told him about you?

268
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,490
<11-3,House>最坏的情况  她可能说你是强奸犯
<11-3,House>At worst, you're a rapist.

269
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,250
<11-3,House>最好的情况  你还是个强奸犯
<11-3,House>At best, you're a rapist.

270
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,520
<11-4,Wilson>她可能说我是阵亡的战争英雄
<11-4,Wilson>Maybe she said I was a dead war hero.

271
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,040
<11-5,House>由一个疯子妈妈养大  还被爸爸抛弃
<11-5,House>Raised by a lunatic mother and abandoned by his father.

272
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,760
<11-5,House>我知道了  买松鼠手铐
<11-5,House>Oh, I know! Squirrel handcuffs.

273
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,090
<11-5,House>你说他应该需要这个玩意吧
<11-5,House>You think he's gotten need any of those?

274
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,790
<11-6,Wilson>如果你想让我知道后什么反应都没有
<11-6,Wilson>If you really wanted me to do nothing with this information,

275
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,930
<11-6,Wilson>那你当初为什么告诉我
<11-6,Wilson>then why did you give it to me?

276
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,330
<11-7,House>因为你想要个孩子
<11-7,House>Because you were pining for a kid,

277
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,590
<11-7,House>而且你也应该知道自己其实有个孩子
<11-7,House>and you deserved to know that you already had one.

278
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,190
<11-7,House>但你也就是想当爸爸  实际并没准备好
<11-7,House>But your parental cravings are more theoretical than applied.

279
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,250
<11-7,House>你更想要的是传宗接代
<11-7,House>You want vicarious immortality

280
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,050
<11-7,House>而不是你这一辈子的负担
<11-7,House>more than you want a lifelong burden.

281
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,660
<11-8,Wilson>你认为这孩子就是个噩梦吗
<11-8,Wilson>You're assuming he's going to be a nightmare.

282
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,890
<11-8,Wilson>如果他是个好孩子呢
<11-8,Wilson>What if he's a good kid?

283
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,770
<11-9,House>他是个孩子
<11-9,House>He's a kid.

284
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,390
<11-9,House>最好的情况就是他只是个噩梦
<11-9,House>Best you can hope for is he's a nightmare.

285
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,220
<11-10,Wilson>豪斯  我不天真
<11-10,Wilson>House, I'm not naive.

286
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,640
<11-10,Wilson>我知道这事可能会变得很麻烦
<11-10,Wilson>I realize that this thing could go very badly,

287
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,110
<11-10,Wilson>但重要的是  我儿子想见我
<11-10,Wilson>but the point is my son wants to meet me.

288
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,540
<11-10,Wilson>而我也想见他
<11-10,Wilson>And I want to meet him.

289
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,390
<12-1,Chase>你是姥姥吧
<12-1,Chase>Popo, I presume.

290
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,910
<12-2,Park>我自己进来了
<12-2,Park>I let myself in.

291
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,220
<12-2,Park>这位是
<12-2,Park>Um, this is--

292
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,050
<12-3,Chase>见过了
<12-3,Chase>We've met.

293
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,910
<12-3,Chase>不是说整件事旨在远离姥姥吗
<12-3,Chase>I thought the whole point of this was to get away from Popo.

294
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,770
<12-4,Park>我爸得了个囊肿要移除
<12-4,Park>My dad's getting a cyst removed,

295
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,150
<12-4,Park>我妈带他去诊所了
<12-4,Park>and my mother had to take him to the clinic.

296
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,520
<12-4,Park>别担心  她一小时后就走
<12-4,Park>Don't worry. She'll be gone in an hour.

297
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,890
<12-5,Chase>我不担心  因为这不是我的问题
<12-5,Chase>I'm not worried, because it's not my issue.

298
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,410
<12-5,Chase>她安静得出奇
<12-5,Chase>She seems awfully quiet.

299
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,110
<12-6,Park>你真该看看她喝醉的样子
<12-6,Park>You haven't seen her drunk.

300
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,130
<12-6,Park>鲍比
<12-6,Park>Bobby?

301
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,030
<12-6,Park>我看见他蜷缩在角落里哭泣
<12-6,Park>I found him crying in the fetal position.

302
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,230
<12-6,Park>不算新症状
<12-6,Park>It's not a new symptom.

303
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,000
<14-1,Taub>他哭是因为肝衰竭
<14-1,Taub>He's crying because his liver failure

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,280
<14-2,Park>引起的激素紊乱
<14-2,Park>threw his hormones out of whack.

305
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,500
<14-3,Adams>除了哭  他恢复得很好
<14-3,Adams>Aside from the crying, he's actually recovering nicely.

306
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,180
<14-3,Adams>除了在书局碰到的男人[暗杀者]
<14-3,Adams>Aside from the guy in the book depository,

307
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,330
<14-4,Taub>肯尼迪家族去达拉斯的旅程还好得很呢
<14-4,Taub>the Kennedys had a lovely trip to Dallas.

308
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,070
<14-4,Taub>对头部不断的冲击
<14-4,Taub>Repetitive blows to the head

309
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,330
<14-4,Taub>会导致慢性损伤性脑病
<14-4,Taub>can cause Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,

310
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,000
<14-4,Taub>症状包括攻击性行为和抑郁
<14-4,Taub>symptoms of which are aggressive behavior and depression.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,190
<14-5,House>你的意思是他的攻击性行为
<14-5,House>So your theory is that his aggressive behavior

312
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,750
<14-5,House>造成了他的攻击性行为
<14-5,House>caused his aggressive behavior.

313
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,970
<14-5,House>他没有抑郁
<14-5,House>He's not depressed.

314
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,560
<14-5,House>他那是烦恼  因为他知道
<14-5,House>He's just bummed because he knows

315
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,200
<14-5,House>他是个无能无才的白痴  只要输一场
<14-5,House>he's a talentless moron who's only one lost fight

316
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,880
<14-5,House>就得去酒吧端盘子去
<14-5,House>away from being a barista.

317
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,860
<14-5,House>我知道这会让人郁闷一阵的
<14-5,House>I understand that can get to a guy after a while.

318
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,220
<14-6,Taub>如果他不打冰球  或许可以保住一命
<14-6,Taub>If he quits being an enforcer, it could save his life.

319
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,680
<14-7,House>你不想救他的命
<14-7,House>You don't want to save his life.

320
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,590
<14-7,House>你是想断送他的前程
<14-7,House>You want to kill his career.

321
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,610
<14-8,Park>我搬去奇斯的公寓住了
<14-8,Park>I moved into Chase's apartment.

322
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,650
<14-8,Park>他知道了  他正盯着咱俩一样的咖啡杯
<14-8,Park>He knows. He was staring at our matching cups.

323
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,850
<14-8,Park>告诉过你我们不该住一起的
<14-8,Park>I told you we should split up.

324
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,210
<14-8,Park>我们没和对方上床
<14-8,Park>We're not having sex. With each other..

325
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,400
<14-9,House>还没
<14-9,House>Yet.

326
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,730
<14-10,Park>是的
<14-10,Park>Yes.

327
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,770
<14-10,Park>是什么是啊
<14-10,Park>Yes?

328
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,130
<14-12,Park>我只是想说没人能预见未来
<14-12,Park>I just mean no one knows the future right now,

329
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,930
<14-12,Park>所以我们也不知道是否...
<14-12,Park>so we don't really know--

330
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,840
<14-12,Park>唯一能确诊慢性创伤性脑病的
<14-12,Park>The only conclusive test

331
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,590
<14-12,Park>只有靠尸检了
<14-12,Park>for CTE is post-mortem.

332
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,910
<14-13,Taub>但大脑核磁共振
<14-13,Taub>But an MRI of his brain

333
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,820
<14-13,Taub>可能查出大脑白质不完整
<14-13,Taub>could reveal white matter disintegrity,

334
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,580
<14-13,Taub>也就是慢性创伤性脑病导致的症状
<14-13,Taub>which is the effect of CTE.

335
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,470
<14-14,House>为什么  你想睡她吗
<14-14,House>Why? Are you trying to sleep with her?

336
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,440
<14-14,House>更简单点  动动嘴皮子问一声就行
<14-14,House>'cause the simpler technique is just to ask.

337
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,650
<14-15,Chase>-我只是想做点好事  -不是
<14-15,Chase>- I was doing something nice. - Mm, no.

338
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,260
<14-16,House>不  这不对
<14-16,House>Th--mm. No, that doesn't fit.

339
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,800
<14-17,Adams>他十岁之后  只有过三次脑震荡
<14-17,Adams>He's only had three concussions since he was ten.

340
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,140
<14-17,Adams>不足以造成慢性创伤性脑病
<14-17,Adams>It's not enough to cause CTE.

341
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
<14-18,Chase>三次记录在案的脑震荡
<14-18,Chase>Three reported concussions.

342
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,700
<14-18,Chase>这些人从高中开始
<14-18,Chase>These guys are taught in high school

343
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,300
<14-18,Chase>就学会怎么在检测中蒙混过关了
<14-18,Chase>how to dupe the tests.

344
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,970
<14-19,House>内疚感
<14-19,House>Guilt?

345
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,550
<14-20,Park>这太诋毁人了
<14-20,Park>This is really insulting.

346
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,130
<14-21,Chase>这不是内疚感
<14-21,Chase>It's not guilt.

347
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,550
<14-21,Chase>朴克是朋友
<14-21,Chase>Park is a friend.

348
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,300
<14-22,House>就是内疚感
<14-22,House>So it's guilt.

349
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,620
<14-22,House>奇斯说服你离开你妈
<14-22,House>Chase convinced you to leave mommy,

350
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,430
<14-22,House>现在他觉得他该负责任
<14-22,House>and now he feels responsible.

351
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,930
<14-22,House>不做核磁共振  做个精神病学的评估
<14-22,House>No MRI. Do a psych eval.

352
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,470
<14-22,House>如果他不再哭了  就把他送回家
<14-22,House>If he doesn't start weeping again, send him home.

353
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,500
<15-1,Duncan>威尔森医生
<15-1,Duncan>Dr. Wilson?

354
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,610
<15-1,Duncan>邓肯
<15-1,Duncan>Duncan.

<15-10,Wilson>It's got three games built in,

366
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,130
<15-10,Wilson>但你可以从网站下载更多
<15-10,Wilson>but you can download more from the website.

367
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,820
<15-11,Duncan>是的  我知道
<15-11,Duncan>Yeah, I know.

368
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,040
<15-12,Wilson>你已经有一个了
<15-12,Wilson>You already have one.

369
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,950
<15-13,Duncan>多一个也没什么不好
<15-13,Duncan>I can always use a backup.

370
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,100
<15-14,Waitress>要给你们先上点喝的吗
<15-14,Waitress>Hi, can I start you with something to drink?

371
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,390
<15-15,Duncan>水就好了
<15-15,Duncan>Just water, please.

00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,760
<15-16,Waitress>他送了你一个游戏机
<15-16,Waitress>You got a gamedeck?

373
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,220
<15-16,Waitress>当爹的不错啊
<15-16,Waitress>Way to go, dad.

374
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,280
<16-1,Taub>精神病学的评估显示
<16-1,Taub>According to your psych eval,

375
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,650
<16-1,Taub>比你更欢乐的大概只有迪士尼乐园了
<16-1,Taub>the only thing happier than you is Disneyland.

376
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,780
<16-2,Bobby>很抱歉昨晚让你看见那样的我
<16-2,Bobby>I'm sorry you had to see me like that last night.

377
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,760
<16-2,Bobby>我只是因为住院很难过
<16-2,Bobby>I'm just upset about being in the hospital and...

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,140
<16-2,Bobby>还得吃奇怪的药
<16-2,Bobby>I'm on some weird meds,

379
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,670
<16-2,Bobby>但它们应该起效了
<16-2,Bobby>but they must be working,

380
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,380
<16-2,Bobby>因为我现在好多了
<16-2,Bobby>because I'm feeling a lot better now.

381
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,770
<16-3,Taub>抑郁可能是一些严重疾病的症状
<16-3,Taub>Depression could be the symptom of a serious illness.

382
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,910
<16-3,Taub>比如慢性创伤性脑病
<16-3,Taub>CTE.

383
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,380
<16-4,Bobby>我姑姑把她能找到的相关文章都发我了
<16-4,Bobby>Yeah, my aunt sends me every article she can find on it.

384
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,600
<16-5,Taub>你知道这是致命的
<16-5,Taub>And you know it could kill you.

385
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,710
<16-6,Bobby>长期来说咯  很多东西都致命的
<16-6,Bobby>In the long run, like a lot of things.

386
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,530
<16-7,Taub>你可能是对的
<16-7,Taub>You might be right.

387
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,900
<16-7,Taub>核磁共振能确诊
<16-7,Taub>And an MRI could confirm that.

388
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,830
<16-8,Bobby>我的档案里已经有很多脑部创伤的记录了
<16-8,Bobby>I have enough evidence of head trauma in my file already, so...

389
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,270
<17-1,Duncan>我妈说你不擅长和正常人
<17-1,Duncan>My mom said you had trouble maintaining relationships

390
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,550
<17-1,Duncan>维持恋情
<17-1,Duncan>with normal people.

391
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,630
<17-1,Duncan>她还说你是个好人
<17-1,Duncan>She also said you were a nice guy.

392
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,240
<17-1,Duncan>我一直觉得她在说谎
<17-1,Duncan>I always figured she was lying

393
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,460
<17-1,Duncan>因为她不想让我痛恨自己有个游手好闲的爸爸
<17-1,Duncan>'cause she didn't want me to hate my deadbeat dad.

394
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,390
<17-2,Wilson>我当时不知道
<17-2,Wilson>I didn't know--

395
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,300
<17-3,Duncan>我知道
<17-3,Duncan>I-I know...

396
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,710
<17-3,Duncan>现在知道了
<17-3,Duncan>now.

397
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,390
<17-4,Wilson>-你是个聪明的孩子  -这得感谢你
<17-4,Wilson>- You're a bright kid. - Thanks to you.

398
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,510
<17-5,Duncan>感谢我妈  我也是一个心太软的胆小鬼
<17-5,Duncan>Thanks to my mom, I'm also a big, soft-hearted wuss.

399
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,980
<17-6,Wilson>我觉得你这点可能是遗传了咱们俩的吧
<17-6,Wilson>I think you may have gotten that from both of us.

400
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,770
<17-7,Duncan>我得走了  但是很高兴见到你
<17-7,Duncan>Uh, I gotta go, but it was really nice meeting you.

401
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,530
<17-8,Wilson>很高兴见到你  邓肯
<17-8,Wilson>It was nice meeting you, Duncan.

402
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,480
<17-9,Duncan>你想再一起出来吗
<17-9,Duncan>Uh, you want to hang out again?

403
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,910
<17-10,Wilson>当然
<17-10,Wilson>Absolutely.

404
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,690
<17-11,Duncan>今晚呢
<17-11,Duncan>Tonight?

405
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,030
<17-11,Duncan>今晚吗
<17-11,Duncan>Tonight?

406
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,010
<17-12,Wilson>我...有...
<17-12,Wilson>Well, I-I-- there's, um...

407
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,400
<17-12,Wilson>那就今晚吧
<17-12,Wilson>That would be great.

408
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,420
<17-12,Wilson>好的
<17-12,Wilson>Okay.

409
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,870
<17-13,Duncan>我会短信你
<17-13,Duncan>I'll text you.

410
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,150
<18-1,Taub>谢谢  你怎么说服他做这个的
<18-1,Taub>Thank you. How did you talk him into it?

411
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,800
<18-2,Chase>我保证是匿名的  他就同意了
<18-2,Chase>He agreed once I promised him anonymity.

412
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,660
<18-2,Chase>张三夫妇明显喜欢李四这个名字
<18-2,Chase>Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked the name John apparently.

413
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,770
<18-2,Chase>不幸的是  我们只是浪费了他的时间
<18-2,Chase>Unfortunately we just wasted his time

414
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,550
<18-2,Chase>证明了豪斯是对的
<18-2,Chase>and proved House right.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,910
<18-2,Chase>没有发现吗
<18-2,Chase>Nothing?

416
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,420
<18-3,Taub>那是什么
<18-3,Taub>What about that?

417
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,830
<18-4,Chase>是个伪影
<18-4,Chase>That's an artifact.

418
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,190
<18-5,Taub>那是个肿块
<18-5,Taub>That's a density.

419
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,020
<18-5,Taub>我知道你肯定觉得我是在自欺欺人
<18-5,Taub>I know you think I'm convincing myself,

420
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,290
<18-5,Taub>但是这家伙的脑袋瓜饱受摧残
<18-5,Taub>But this brain has been hammered for years,

421
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,330
<18-5,Taub>症状虽然难以捉摸  但是确实存在着
<18-5,Taub>meaning evidence may be subtle, but it's there.

422
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,040
<18-6,House>意味着你只看到自己想看到的东西
<18-6,House>Meaning you see what you want to see.

423
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,080
<18-6,House>当然  除非
<18-6,House>Unless, of course,

424
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,770
<18-6,House>奇斯是个傻冒  而我确实有脑损伤
<18-6,House>Chase is an idiot, and I do have brain damage.

425
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,270
<18-7,Chase>病人晕过去了
<18-7,Chase>Patient's stroking out.

426
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,990
<18-8,House>奇斯
<18-8,House>Chase?

427
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,400
<18-8,House>能把我弄出去吗
<18-8,House>Can you get me out of--

428
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,820
<18-8,House>有人不
<18-8,House>Hello?

429
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,770
<19-1,House>好消息是
<19-1,House>The good news is,

430
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,970
<19-1,House>只是孤立的眼肌麻痹
<19-1,House>it's isolated ophthalmoplegia,

431
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,180
<19-1,House>也就是说你没有中风
<19-1,House>which means you didn't have a stroke.

432
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,000
<19-1,House>坏消息是  陶博说对了
<19-1,House>Bad news is, Taub was right.

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,210
<19-1,House>你的病还没好
<19-1,House>You're still sick.

434
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,190
<19-1,House>我说的是"正确"而不是"全能"
<19-1,House>I said "Right," not "Competent."

435
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,250
<19-1,House>别再做慢性创伤性脑病的梦了
<19-1,House>Bursts your CTE bubble.

436
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,390
<19-1,House>你需要套全新的理论
<19-1,House>You're going to need a whole new theory

437
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,060
<19-1,House>才能让杰西叔和奥尔森姐妹消停会
<19-1,House>to keep uncle Jesse and his Olsen twins on the bench.

439
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,460
<19-2,Taub>我们能换个地方讨论我的无能吗
<19-2,Taub>Can we discuss my incompetence somewhere else?

440
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,290
<19-3,Bobby>豪斯医生
<19-3,Bobby>Dr. House.

441
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,420
<19-3,Bobby>可以和你谈谈吗
<19-3,Bobby>Could I talk to you for a minute?

442
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,490
<20-1,Taub>可能是神经梅毒
<20-1,Taub>Could be neurosyphilis.

443
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,140
<20-2,Chase>他才二十二岁
<20-2,Chase>He's only 22.

444
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,870
<20-3,Taub>但是他从十四岁就开始打冰球了
<20-3,Taub>And he's been on the road since he was 14.

445
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,020
<20-4,House>也就是说他早已饱受摧残了
<20-4,House>So he was trash even before he was trash?

446
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,360
<20-4,House>你难道不好奇他找我干什么吗
<20-4,House>You curious about what he wanted?

447
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,160
<20-5,Taub>我想他是希望我不再跟这个案子
<20-5,Taub>I assume he wanted me off the case,

448
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,090
<20-5,Taub>而你告诉他我小时候脑袋受过伤
<20-5,Taub>and you told him I was hit in the head as a child,

449
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,810
<20-5,Taub>你母亲让你保证会照顾好我
<20-5,Taub>and your mother made you promise to take care of me.

450
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,810
<20-6,House>他做着自己一直以来在做的事情
<20-6,House>He was doing what he always does--

451
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,850
<20-6,House>保护弱小[小个子]
<20-6,House>sticking up for the little guy.

452
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,030
<20-6,House>他让我向你道歉
<20-6,House>He told me to apologize to you,

453
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,240
<20-6,House>不然他就给我好看
<20-6,House>or he would excrete down my throat.

454
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,540
<20-6,House>我想他说的就是这个意思
<20-6,House>I'm paraphrasing.

455
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,350
<20-6,House>所以如果他问起你来  就说我绅士般地道歉了
<20-6,House>So if he should ask, I was a gentleman,

456
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,880
<20-6,House>不然我就给你好看
<20-6,House>or I will excrete down your throat.

457
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,060
<20-7,Chase>显微镜下多血管炎符合
<20-7,Chase>Microscopic polyangiitis fits.

458
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,820
<20-8,Taub>我们应该立即开始血浆置换治疗
<20-8,Taub>We should start plasmapheresis immediately.

459
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,370
<20-9,Chase>首先需要检测抗中性粒细胞胞质抗体确诊
<20-9,Chase>We need to run an anca panel to confirm first.

460
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,470
<20-9,Chase>血浆置换可能会致死
<20-9,Chase>Putting him on plasmapheresis could make him bleed out.

461
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,010
<20-10,Taub>显微镜下多血管炎恶化得很快
<20-10,Taub>MPA can progress quickly.

462
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,720
<20-10,Taub>在他的肺受到影响前
<20-10,Taub>We may not have time

463
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,520
<20-10,Taub>我们没多少时间了
<20-10,Taub>before it reaches his lungs.

464
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,430
<20-11,House>我觉得你说的没错
<20-11,House>I think you're right.

465
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,260
<20-11,House>与我的客观判断一致
<20-11,House>Thus confirming my objectivity.

466
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,050
<20-11,House>开始治疗吧
<20-11,House>Start the treatment.

467
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,660
<21-1,House>一团糟吧
<21-1,House>Miserable yet?

468
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,240
<21-2,Wilson>他有礼貌  态度端正  是个全优生
<21-2,Wilson>He's polite, well-adjusted, and a straight-A student.

469
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,000
<21-3,House>也就是说他根本不需要你
<21-3,House>Which means he doesn't need you.

470
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,790
<21-3,House>那你为什么不趁着蝴蝶效应还未成型
<21-3,House>So why don't you get out while the butterfly effect

471
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,300
<21-3,House>就脱身呢
<21-3,House>is still in the cocoon stage?

472
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,540
<21-4,Wilson>我要给他做晚饭
<21-4,Wilson>I'm making him dinner.

473
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,980
<21-5,House>谁还会给十一岁的孩子做晚饭呢
<21-5,House>You don't make an 11-year-old dinner.

474
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,940
<21-5,House>给他罐花生酱就好了
<21-5,House>You give him a jar of peanut butter.

475
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
<21-6,Wilson>没问题的
<21-6,Wilson>It'll be fine.

476
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
<21-6,Wilson>我给他做道藜沙拉
<21-6,Wilson>I could give this kid a quinoa salad,

477
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
<21-6,Wilson>出于礼貌  他会吃的
<21-6,Wilson>and he would eat it just to be nice.

478
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,640
<21-7,House>因为他和他老爸一样
<21-7,House>'cause he's a gutless placater,

479
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,190
<21-7,House>是个懦弱只会讨好人的人
<21-7,House>just like his dad.

480
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,290
<21-8,Wilson>他人很好
<21-8,Wilson>He's nice.

481
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,270
<21-9,House>这主意太糟糕了
<21-9,House>This is a terrible idea.

482
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,310
<21-10,Wilson>因为我们喜欢彼此吗
<21-10,Wilson>Because we like each other?

483
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,230
<21-10,Wilson>没错
<21-10,Wilson>Yes.

484
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,260
<21-10,Wilson>是因为你说"我们喜欢彼此"
<21-10,Wilson>'cause of the statement "We like each other."

485
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,430
<21-11,House>你们才认识二十五分钟
<21-11,House>You've known him 25 minutes.

486
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,370
<21-11,House>你对他的了解就是他骗你说他喜欢藜沙拉
<21-11,House>All you know about him is that he'd lie about a quinoa salad,

487
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,860
<21-11,House>都不知道那是什么玩意
<21-11,House>whatever the hell that is.

488
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,890
<21-12,Wilson>你吃一个十一岁孩子的醋
<21-12,Wilson>You're jealous of an 11-year-old

489
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,040
<21-12,Wilson>因为你就像个十一岁的孩子那样不懂事
<21-12,Wilson>because you are an 11-year-old.

490
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,280
<22-1,Wilson>和我谈谈你吧
<22-1,Wilson>So tell me about yourself.

491
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,790
<22-1,Wilson>我知道你聪明
<22-1,Wilson>I mean, you're smart,

492
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,880
<22-1,Wilson>你人很好  那其他呢
<22-1,Wilson>you're nice, but what else?

493
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,930
<22-2,Duncan>我不知道  我还是个孩子
<22-2,Duncan>I don't know. I'm a kid.

494
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,980
<22-3,Wilson>没错
<22-3,Wilson>Right.

495
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,080
<22-3,Wilson>你在找什么
<22-3,Wilson>What are you looking for?

496

<22-12,Wilson>I think that was the best pizza I ever had.

506
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,780
<23-2,Duncan>是第戎风味
<23-2,Duncan>It was the hint of Dijon.

<23-3,Wilson>你有阿姨叔叔伯伯或祖父母吗
<23-3,Wilson>Do you have any aunts or uncles or grandparents?

<23-4,Duncan>我妈妈莫名其妙和外祖父闹僵了
<23-4,Duncan>My mom got into some stupid fight with my grandfather.

509
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,890
<23-4,Duncan>他们就不和我们来往了
<23-4,Duncan>They all kind of cut us off.

510
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,650
<23-6,Duncan>你和你的父母有往来吗
<23-6,Duncan>Are you talking to your parents?

<23-12,Wilson>好呀  好呀  今天...
<23-12,Wilson>Sure, sure. It was, uh--

517
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,800
<23-12,Wilson>我是说  很高兴和你一起吃晚餐
<23-12,Wilson>I mean, it was great to spend time with you and--

518
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,260
<23-13,Duncan>我爱你  爸爸
<23-13,Duncan>I love you, dad.

519
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,650
<24-1,Taub>当名冰球运动员肯定不容易吧
<24-1,Taub>Can't be easy doing what you do.

520
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,410
<24-1,Taub>我的意思是  你喜欢你的职业吗
<24-1,Taub>I mean, do you love it?

521
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,690
<24-1,Taub>有意思吗
<24-1,Taub>Is it fun?

522
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,160
<24-1,Taub>我以前有间整形诊所
<24-1,Taub>I had my own plastic surgery practice

523
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,960
<24-1,Taub>很赚钱
<24-1,Taub>making lots of money,

524
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,980
<24-1,Taub>但是我不开心
<24-1,Taub>but I wasn't happy.

525
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,180
<24-1,Taub>我上医学院不是为了给人整形的
<24-1,Taub>It wasn't what I went to med school for.

526
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,580
<24-2,Bobby>每年冬天我父亲都会在后院做个冰场
<24-2,Bobby>Every winter my dad would flood the backyard and made a rink.

527
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,490
<24-2,Bobby>我扮演拉缪
<24-2,Bobby>I was Lemieux.

529
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,990
<24-2,Bobby>我弟弟扮演格雷茨基
<24-2,Bobby>My little brother was Gretzky.

531
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,210
<24-2,Bobby>我比赛打得很好
<24-2,Bobby>I was good.

532
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,740
<24-2,Bobby>我连续三年获得北部冰球协会的
<24-2,Bobby>I won the NDHA scoring title

533
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,040
<24-2,Bobby>最佳得分选手称号
<24-2,Bobby>three years in a row.

534
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,650
<24-2,Bobby>我不断地长壮
<24-2,Bobby>I kept getting bigger

535
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,370
<24-2,Bobby>变得更强壮  打得更好
<24-2,Bobby>and stronger and better...

536
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,130
<24-2,Bobby>直到后来我水平下降了
<24-2,Bobby>till I didn't.

537
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,380
<24-2,Bobby>初级教练告诉我
<24-2,Bobby>My juniors coach told me that,

538
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,050
<24-2,Bobby>如果我还想留在冰球队
<24-2,Bobby>if I wanted to stay on the team,

539
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,230
<24-2,Bobby>那我就必须利用我的体格
<24-2,Bobby>then I'd have to use my size.

540
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,440
<24-2,Bobby>每次比赛  我上场打球的时间越来越少
<24-2,Bobby>Every game, I got less and less ice time

541
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,720
<24-2,Bobby>到现在我上场只为了打架
<24-2,Bobby>until it was all fighting

542
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,810
<24-2,Bobby>而不是打球
<24-2,Bobby>and no hockey.

543
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,660
<24-2,Bobby>我
<24-2,Bobby>I, uh...

544
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,750
<24-2,Bobby>我的胳膊觉得不太对劲
<24-2,Bobby>There's something going on with my arms.

545
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,990
<24-2,Bobby>我的手臂没有知觉了  我
<24-2,Bobby>I can't feel them. I--

546
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,790
<24-2,Bobby>医生  我感觉不到我的手臂
<24-2,Bobby>Doctor, I can't feel my arms.

547
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,840
<25-1,Taub>病人手臂麻痹了
<25-1,Taub>Patient's arms are now paralyzed.

548
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
<25-1,Taub>抗中性粒细胞胞质抗体呈阴性
<25-1,Taub>Anca panel was negative.

549
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,020
<25-1,Taub>显微镜下小血管炎
<25-1,Taub>It's not MPA.

550
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,870
<25-2,Adams>莱姆氏病会导致麻痹
<25-2,Adams>Lyme disease could cause paralysis.

551
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,090
<25-2,Adams>如果他打猎的话  有可能会接触到蜱
<25-2,Adams>If he was hunting, he'd be exposed to ticks.

552
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,790
<25-3,House>没有出现红疹和心脏方面的问题
<25-3,House>No target rash or cardiac involvement.

553
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,780
<25-3,House>同屋室友让你晚上不得休息了吗
<25-3,House>Roomies with benefits keeping you up?

554
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,990
<25-4,Chase>是纸牌
<25-4,Chase>Cribbage.

555
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,580
<25-4,Chase>和朴克的姥姥一起玩
<25-4,Chase>Played with Park's Popo.

556
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,350
<25-5,House>是两个独立事件吗
<25-5,House>Is that two separate events?

557
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,580
<25-6,Chase>是她祖母
<25-6,Chase>Grandmother.

558
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,290
<25-6,Chase>肌萎缩性侧索硬化症可以解释那些症状
<25-6,Chase>ALS could explain the symptoms.

559
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,450
<25-7,Park>涉及感觉可以排除肌萎缩性侧索硬化症
<25-7,Park>Sensory involvement rules out ALS.

560
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,870
<25-8,House>好吧  这实在很有趣
<25-8,House>Okay, yeah. This is interesting.

561
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,390
<25-8,House>我们一会再回来研究病人
<25-8,House>We'll get back to the patient in a second.

562
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,210
<25-8,House>你的问题同威尔森一样除了...
<25-8,House>Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except...

563
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,530
<25-8,House>你是被那些不检点的女人所惑
<25-8,House>You're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks.

564
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,530
<25-8,House>你并非因害朴克
<25-8,House>You don't feel guilty

565
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,010
<25-8,House>被赶出家门而愧疚
<25-8,House>about getting Park thrown out of her home.

566
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,690
<25-8,House>你是为那些被你毁了的女人而内疚
<25-8,House>You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over.

567
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,920
<25-8,House>我妈正好需要1000块换雪胎
<25-8,House>My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires.

568
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,620
<25-9,Chase>朴克是我的朋友  姥姥很有趣
<25-9,Chase>Park's a friend. Popo's fun.

569
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,450
<25-10,Taub>瘫痪由脸转移到胳膊上
<25-10,Taub>Paralysis has gone from his face to his arms,

570
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,310
<25-10,Taub>意味着其正在向下移动
<25-10,Taub>meaning it's descending, which is the hallmark

571
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,430
<25-10,Taub>这是肉毒杆菌中毒的标志
<25-10,Taub>of botulism.

572
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,110
<25-11,House>那就是他吃的东西有问题  真没意思
<25-11,House>So it was something he ate. How innocuous.

573
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,330
<25-11,House>你现在属于矫枉过正
<25-11,House>You've overcome your bias by reversing it.

574
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,770
<25-11,House>唯一的问题是爱一个病人
<25-11,House>The only problem is that being in love with a patient

575
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,050
<25-11,House>和恨一个病人同样会武断
<25-11,House>is just as judgmental as being in hate.

576
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,670
<25-11,House>我没发现任何污染的...
<25-11,House>We didn't find any contaminated--

577
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,790
<25-12,Taub>没有被污染的食物  我不是傻瓜
<25-12,Taub>No contaminated food. I'm not an idiot.

578
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,730
<25-12,Taub>但如果不是来自消化系统而是注射呢
<25-12,Taub>But what if it's not from ingesting but from injecting?

579
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,220
<25-12,Taub>他的队医为他进行过难治性肌肉痉挛
<25-12,Taub>He was treated for intractable muscle spasms

580
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,510
<25-12,Taub>的治疗
<25-12,Taub>by the team's trainers.

581
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,530
<25-12,Taub>有时他们就用肉毒杆菌
<25-12,Taub>Sometimes they use botox.

582
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,540
<25-13,Adams>我们需要用抗毒素...
<25-13,Adams>We need to start the antitoxin--

583
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,750
<25-14,Taub>抗毒素可能导致过敏
<25-14,Taub>The antitoxin could cause anaphylaxis.

584
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,600
<25-14,Taub>我们应该先进行测试确认
<25-14,Taub>We need to test first to confirm.

585
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,140
<25-15,House>为了证明我的观点  上次你说过
<25-15,House>As if to prove my point, last time you said

586
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,310
<25-15,House>在进行更危险的治疗前  没时间做测试了
<25-15,House>there wasn't enough time to test prior to a more dangerous treatment.

587
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,390
<25-16,Taub>情况不同
<25-16,Taub>It's a different situation,

588
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,000
<25-16,Taub>不同的症状  不同的诊断
<25-16,Taub>different symptom, different diagnosis.

589
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,230
<25-17,House>不同的情感
<25-17,House>Different emotion.

590
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,340
<25-17,House>给他用抗毒素
<25-17,House>Give him the antitoxin.

591
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,520
<26-1,Park>怎么样
<26-1,Park>Anything?

592
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,000
<26-2,Taub>没有副作用
<26-2,Taub>No adverse effects.

593
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,690
<26-3,Park>奇斯让我和他一起住
<26-3,Park>Chase let me move in with him

594
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,540
<26-3,Park>以便逃离我祖母
<26-3,Park>to get away from my grandmother.

595
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,420
<26-3,Park>可他实际上让我祖母也搬了进来
<26-3,Park>Then he practically let my grandmother

596
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,350
<26-3,Park>和我们一起住
<26-3,Park>move in with the both of us.

597
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,700
<26-3,Park>对我也太好了吧
<26-3,Park>He's being way more than nice.

598
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,710
<26-4,Taub>那究竟是为什么
<26-4,Taub>Then which answer is it?

599
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,790
<26-4,Taub>奇斯对于说服你搬出来住感到内疚
<26-4,Taub>Chase feels guilty for pushing you to move out?

600
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,930
<26-5,Park>他没有说服我
<26-5,Park>He didn't push me.

601
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,050
<26-7,Park>-那是为了那些女人  -他就喜欢那种女人
<26-7,Park>- Guilt about skanks? - He loves skanks.

602
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,470
<26-8,Taub>不会是第三种理由的
<26-8,Taub>It's not the other option.

603
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,910
<26-9,Park>也是有人喜欢我的
<26-9,Park>There are people that like me.

604
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,630
<26-9,Park>有人甚至想和我上床
<26-9,Park>People even want to sleep with me.

605
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,710
<26-9,Park>其中有些人还长得不错
<26-9,Park>Some of them are even good-looking.

606
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,120
<26-10,Taub>有他那样帅吗
<26-10,Taub>That good-looking?

607
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,780
<26-10,Taub>你看到了吗
<26-10,Taub>Did you see that?

608
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,800
<26-10,Taub>你感觉到什么了吗
<26-10,Taub>You're feeling something?

609
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,270
<26-11,Bobby>是的
<26-11,Bobby>Yeah.

610
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,120
<27-1,Wilson>我可以神神叨叨你害我等了11年的事
<27-1,Wilson>I could give you crap for making me wait 11 years,

611
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,290
<27-1,Wilson>不过相反我为你没让我
<27-1,Wilson>but instead I'm going to thank you

612
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,850
<27-1,Wilson>再等11年而感谢你
<27-1,Wilson>for not making me wait another 11.

613
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,030
<27-2,House>每个小女孩都想要匹小马
<27-2,House>Every little girl wants a pony

614
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,940
<27-2,House>直到他们发现得跟在后面收拾
<27-2,House>till they have to clean up after it.

615
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,230
<27-3,Wilson>你认为我会退缩
<27-3,Wilson>You think I'm going to quit on this?

616
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,640
<27-3,Wilson>面对一个11岁的小孩
<27-3,Wilson>On an 11-year-old?

617
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,730
<27-4,House>你唯一没退缩过的关系
<27-4,House>The only relationship you haven't quit on

618
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,790
<27-4,House>就是我
<27-4,House>has been with me.

619
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,490
<27-5,Wilson>一个贫困的刻薄的自我陶醉者
<27-5,Wilson>Hmm. A needy, truculent narcissist.

620
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,880
<27-5,Wilson>我认为这是完美的父母身份训练
<27-5,Wilson>I think it's been perfect training for parenthood.

621
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,340
<27-6,House>这一点也不挨边
<27-6,House>That's not even close.

622
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,670
<27-6,House>这可是你的余生
<27-6,House>This is the rest of your life.

623
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,340
<27-6,House>你搞砸了也没办法逃避
<27-6,House>You screw this up, you don't get to run away.

624
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,140
<27-6,House>你会毁了你们两人的生活
<27-6,House>You get to ruin both your lives.

625
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,720
<27-6,House>这比你以前处过和毁过的任何关系
<27-6,House>This is a bigger responsibility than any you've ever taken on

626
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
<27-6,House>都责任重大
<27-6,House>and screwed up.

627
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,600
<27-6,House>我明白
<27-6,House>I know.

628
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,600
<27-7,Wilson>这也是为什么我如此兴奋
<27-7,Wilson>That's why I'm so excited about it.

629
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,770
<28-1,Bobby>你真觉得现在的工作比每天看着乳房要愉快吗
<28-1,Bobby>You're really happier doing this than looking at boobs all day?

630
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,790
<28-2,Taub>还好我总会接触到你这样的病人
<28-2,Taub>Luckily I get patients like you every now and again

631
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,370
<28-2,Taub>能让我再次感受以前的快乐
<28-2,Taub>who let me reexperience the joy.

632
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,150
<28-3,Bobby>你知道我一天最好的时光就是
<28-3,Bobby>You know, the best part of my day is when I'm sitting

633
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,600
<28-3,Bobby>打完别人坐在惩罚屋里
<28-3,Bobby>in that penalty box after I beat someone up.

634
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,470
<28-3,Bobby>那是我唯一感到安全的时刻
<28-3,Bobby>That's the only time I know I'm safe.

635
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,290
<28-3,Bobby>你觉得拉缪有过这种体会吗
<28-3,Bobby>Think Lemieux ever felt that way?

636
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,910
<28-3,Bobby>我不会回去了
<28-3,Bobby>I'm not going back.

637
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,800
<28-4,Taub>冰球吗
<28-4,Taub>To hockey?

638
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,070
<28-5,Bobby>是被迫去做什么...
<28-5,Bobby>To enforcing...

639
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,580
<28-5,Bobby>无论付出什么代价
<28-5,Bobby>whatever that costs.

640
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,250
<28-6,Taub>那对你很好
<28-6,Taub>Good for you.

641
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,100
<28-6,Taub>第一个火箭射门得分
<28-6,Taub>First goal for the pocket rocket.

642
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,730
<28-6,Taub>鲍比
<28-6,Taub>Bobby?

643
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,490
<28-6,Taub>这里需要救护人员
<28-6,Taub>We need a team in here!

644
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,120
<29-1,Taub>他完全瘫痪了
<29-1,Taub>He's completely paralyzed,

645
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,460
<29-1,Taub>而且肉毒杆菌毒素检测为阴性
<29-1,Taub>and he tested negative for botulism.

646
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,130
<29-2,House>我现在接受孤注一掷的诊断了
<29-2,House>I am now accepting long shots.

647
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,710
<29-3,Adams>脊髓灰质炎
<29-3,Adams>Polio.

648
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,030
<29-3,Adams>有些孩子从来没接种过疫苗
<29-3,Adams>Some kids were never vaccinated.

649
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,820
<29-4,Taub>不会是这种一直从事体育运动
<29-4,Taub>Unless they played sports all their lives

650
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,700
<29-4,Taub>并且每年接受两次体检的人
<29-4,Taub>and had two physicals a year.

651
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,480
<29-5,Park>会不会是异染性脑白质营养不良
<29-5,Park>How about MLD?

652
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,850
<29-6,Taub>更不符合
<29-6,Taub>That's a bad fit.

653
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,460
<29-6,Taub>我这么说并非因为
<29-6,Taub>I say that not because

654
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,740
<29-6,Taub>异染性脑白质营养不良无法治疗
<29-6,Taub>there's no treatment for MLD

655
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,880
<29-6,Taub>而是确实不符合症状
<29-6,Taub>But because it's a bad fit.

656
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,980
<29-6,Taub>他的认知能力没有受到影响
<29-6,Taub>His cognitive abilities are unaffected.

657
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,570
<29-7,Chase>朊病毒病可以解释症状的周期性变化
<29-7,Chase>Prion disease could explain the waxing and waning symptoms.

658
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,220
<29-8,Taub>对于阮病毒病的检测是通过脑组织活体检查
<29-8,Taub>The test for prions is a brain biopsy.

659
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,620
<29-8,Taub>根据他的病史  肯定会发生脑肿胀
<29-8,Taub>Given his history, there's got to be brain swelling.

660
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,170
<29-8,Taub>我们不能冒险钻进他的颅骨里去
<29-8,Taub>We can't risk drilling into his skull.

661
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,400
<29-9,House>我们当然可以
<29-9,House>Pretty sure we can.

662
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,020
<29-10,Taub>我们也可以一直讨论下去直到
<29-10,Taub>We also could keep talking until we can find

663
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,820
<29-10,Taub>找到一个大家都同意的答案
<29-10,Taub>an answer we all can agree on.

664
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,480
<29-11,House>大家都同意吗
<29-11,House>All of us?

665
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,400
<29-11,House>那些喜欢他的  恨他的
<29-11,House>Those who love him, those who hate him,

666
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,470
<29-11,House>对他或你不屑一顾的...
<29-11,House>those who don't give a crap about him or you--

667
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,200
<29-12,Taub>或者我可以自己去跟福曼讨论这个可能性
<29-12,Taub>Or I could just discuss it on my own with Foreman.

668
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,950
<29-13,House>-他不是你的朋友  -我明白
<29-13,House>- He's not your friend. - I get it.

669
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,370
<29-14,Taub>他是病人  我不是...
<29-14,Taub>He's a patient. I'm not--

670
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,030
<29-15,House>他从没支持过你
<29-15,House>He never had your back.

671
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,100
<29-15,House>他没要求我一定要向你道歉
<29-15,House>He didn't insist that I apologize to you.

672
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,420
<29-15,House>他要求你不再跟进
<29-15,House>He asked me to take you off the case.

673
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
<29-15,House>给他做脑组织活体检查
<29-15,House>Biopsy his brain.

674
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,310
<30-1,Duncan>嘿  爸爸
<30-1,Duncan>Hey, dad.

675
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,520
<30-3,Duncan>不好意思我来晚了
<30-3,Duncan>Sorry I'm late.

676
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,260
<30-3,Duncan>和我妈吵了一架
<30-3,Duncan>Got in a fight with my mom.

677
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,610
<30-3,Duncan>她只考虑自己
<30-3,Duncan>She's such a tool.

678
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,260
<30-4,Wilson>我相信她是好意
<30-4,Wilson>I'm sure she means well.

679
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,170
<30-5,Duncan>她想在哥斯达黎加
<30-5,Duncan>She wants to open a reserve in Costa Rica

680
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,840
<30-5,Duncan>为食肉鸟建一个保护区
<30-5,Duncan>for rescued birds of prey.

681
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,540
<30-6,Wilson>她是说真的吗
<30-6,Wilson>But how serious is she?

682
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,700
<30-6,Wilson>我印象里她过去也常说...
<30-6,Wilson>From my recollection, she used to talk about doing a lot...

683
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,390
<30-7,Duncan>没错  可是她连周一的机票都买了
<30-7,Duncan>Yeah, but she bought plane tickets for Monday.

684
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,760
<30-8,Wilson>哥斯达黎加很美的
<30-8,Wilson>Well, Costa Rica is beautiful.

685
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,750
<30-8,Wilson>那里的学校应该也不错
<30-8,Wilson>And the schools are supposed to be great.

686
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,930
<30-9,Duncan>我才不去
<30-9,Duncan>Oh, I'm not going.

687
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,580
<30-9,Duncan>那是她的愚蠢梦想  又不是我的
<30-9,Duncan>It's her stupid dream, not mine.

688
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,850
<30-10,Wilson>那你打算怎么办
<30-10,Wilson>Then what will you do?

689
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,980
<30-11,Duncan>我想...我或许可以...
<30-11,Duncan>I-I thought maybe I could, uh...

690
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,000
<30-11,Duncan>我可以跟你住吗
<30-11,Duncan>Maybe I could stay with you?

691
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,980
<30-11,Duncan>你家离我学校才3英里
<30-11,Duncan>Uh, y-your place is only 3 miles away from my school.

692
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,420
<30-11,Duncan>我可以搭公交车上学
<30-11,Duncan>I could bus it every day.

693
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,970
<30-11,Duncan>我的衣服自己洗
<30-11,Duncan>And I do my own laundry.

694
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,210
<30-11,Duncan>房间也会很干净
<30-11,Duncan>I keep my room tidy.

695
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,980
<30-12,Wilson>邓肯  这...这个
<30-12,Wilson>Duncan, th-this--

696
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,150
<30-12,Wilson>太突然了
<30-12,Wilson>This is very sudden.

697
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,060
<30-12,Wilson>我知道
<30-12,Wilson>I know.

698
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,330
<30-13,Duncan>对不起
<30-13,Duncan>I'm sorry.

699
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,110
<30-13,Duncan>求你别让我去丛林
<30-13,Duncan>Please don't send me to the jungle.

700
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,660
<30-14,Wilson>如果你母亲同意  我这边没问题
<30-14,Wilson>If it's okay with your mother, it's okay with me.

701
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,380
<31-1,Taub>我请求退出此病例的治疗
<31-1,Taub>Take me off the case.

702
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,000
<31-1,Taub>很显然我已经丧失了客观性
<31-1,Taub>I've obviously completely lost my objectivity.

703
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,730
<31-1,Taub>不但帮不上忙  立场都不够中立
<31-1,Taub>I'm not helping, I'm not even neutral.

704
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,500
<31-2,House>我同意
<31-2,House>Agreed.

705
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,860
<31-2,House>所以我是不是该禁止你参与我所有病例呢
<31-2,House>So why shouldn't I take you off all my cases?

706
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,130
<31-3,Taub>你说的对  我恨恶霸
<31-3,Taub>Because you were right. I hate bullies.

707
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,660
<31-4,House>可你为我工作
<31-4,House>You work for me.

708
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,630
<31-5,Taub>你不是恶霸
<31-5,Taub>You're not a bully.

709
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,190
<31-6,House>我很确定我就是呢  蠢材
<31-6,House>Pretty sure I am, dickwad.

710
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,630
<31-7,Taub>我见过的恶霸很多
<31-7,Taub>I've known a lot of bullies--

711
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,290
<31-7,Taub>有人因为我身材矮小讨厌我
<31-7,Taub>People who didn't like me because I'm short,

712
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,460
<31-7,Taub>有人因为我是犹太人讨厌我
<31-7,Taub>People who didn't like me because I'm Jewish...

713
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,370
<31-8,House>好啦  我知道
<31-8,House>Yeah, I get it.

714
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,370
<31-8,House>你惹人讨厌的理由数不胜数
<31-8,House>There's a long list of reasons not to like you.

715
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,970
<31-9,Taub>你讥讽旁人毫不留情  但并不是出于自我膨胀
<31-9,Taub>You relentlessly mock, but it's not for self-aggrandizement.

716
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,490
<31-9,Taub>而是因为感情靠边思想为先
<31-9,Taub>It's because ideas are bigger than feelings.

717
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,100
<31-9,Taub>至少我乐于相信是这样
<31-9,Taub>At least that's what I choose to believe.

718
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,750
<31-9,Taub>你的副作用就是令我不再对讽刺敏感
<31-9,Taub>I also thought you had the side effect of desensitizing me.

719
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,280
<31-10,House>希伯来小个子
<31-10,House>You little Hebe.

720
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,170
<31-10,House>我给你讲讲道理  你搞砸了
<31-10,House>Here's some ideas for you. You screwed up.

721
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,060
<31-10,House>你总是搞砸  你刚刚说的都对
<31-10,House>You kept on screwing up. Everything you said is true,

722
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,200
<31-10,House>可是
<31-10,House>except...

723
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,220
<31-10,House>回避不是办法
<31-10,House>it doesn't mean you walk away.

724
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,930
<31-10,House>你要学会不轻信任何事情
<31-10,House>You just learn to trust nothing.

725
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,980
<31-10,House>你以为你感受到的一切
<31-10,House>Everything you think you feel,

726
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,670
<31-10,House>你以为你知晓的一切
<31-10,House>everything you think you know.

727
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,030
<31-10,House>每条线索都要质疑
<31-10,House>Question every call,

728
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,720
<31-10,House>每条血管都摸清
<31-10,House>play through every whistle.

729
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,520
<31-11,Taub>我刚有个灵感
<31-11,Taub>I just had a light bulb.

730
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,360
<31-11,Taub>好像是
<31-11,Taub>Maybe.

731
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,710
<31-12,House>灵感总是可信的
<31-12,House>You can trust light bulbs.

732
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,020
<32-1,Taub>停
<32-1,Taub>Stop.

733
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,770
<32-1,Taub>不是阮病
<32-1,Taub>It's not prions.

734
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,870
<32-1,Taub>EB病毒感染造成了传染性单核细胞增多症
<32-1,Taub>Epstein-Barr gave him Mono.

735
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,140
<32-1,Taub>同时也造成了米勒-费雪综合征
<32-1,Taub>It also gave him Miller Fisher Syndrome.

736
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,040
<32-1,Taub>血浆除去法疗效很好
<32-1,Taub>The plasmapheresis played through the whistle.

737
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,500
<32-1,Taub>我们采用血浆除去法治疗显微镜下多血管
<32-1,Taub>We gave it to him for MPA,

738
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,280
<32-1,Taub>病情恶化后我们停止了血浆除去法
<32-1,Taub>but when he got worse, we took him off.

739
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,980
<32-1,Taub>病情好转时又以为是抗毒素起了作用
<32-1,Taub>When he got better, we thought it was the antitoxin.

740
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,720
<32-1,Taub>其实那是血浆除去法的延续效果
<32-1,Taub>But it was actually the plasmapheresis still working.

741
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,320
<32-1,Taub>我们用对了疗法  只是诊错了病
<32-1,Taub>We had the right treatment, just the wrong diagnosis.

742
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,920
<32-2,House>是我的比喻给出了答案
<32-2,House>It was my metaphor that solved the case.

743
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,190
<32-2,House>重新用血浆除去法治疗  他会好起来的
<32-2,House>Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine.

744
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,130
<32-2,House>救场及时
<32-2,House>Nice save.

745
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,580
<32-2,House>可是纵观全场你还是无药可救
<32-2,House>Didn't quite make up for being a sieve the rest of the game.

746
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,570
<32-2,House>又在操心前女友的孩子
<32-2,House>Ex-girlfriend's baby again?

747
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
<33-1,House>他母亲要搬去哥斯达黎加
<33-1,House>His mother is moving to Costa rica.

748
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,290
<33-2,Wilson>他问可不可以和我住
<33-2,Wilson>He asked if he could move in with me.

749
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,330
<33-2,Wilson>我就答应了
<33-2,Wilson>And I said yes.

750
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,190
<33-3,House>不过是六七年而已
<33-3,House>Well, it's only six or seven years.

751
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,860
<33-3,House>除非他上不了大学  不过这种情况
<33-3,House>Unless he can't get into college, in which case,

752
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,830
<33-3,House>问题也在你心高命薄
<33-3,House>it's more a matter of your life expectancy.

753
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,910
<33-2,Wilson>我就答应了
<33-2,Wilson>I said yes,

754
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,220
<33-4,Wilson>尽管我心里知道  我还远没有准备好
<33-4,Wilson>knowing I'm not remotely ready for that,

755
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,120
<33-4,Wilson>而他也没有准备好与母亲分开
<33-4,Wilson>knowing he's not ready to be separated from his mother.

756
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,690
<33-4,Wilson>这完全不是一个成熟理性的成年人的行为
<33-4,Wilson>This isn't the act of a mature, rational adult.

757
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,620
<33-4,Wilson>我
<33-4,Wilson>I--

758
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,000
<33-4,Wilson>我做不来父亲  豪斯
<33-4,Wilson>I can't do this, House.

759
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,270
<33-4,Wilson>你是对的
<33-4,Wilson>You were right.

760
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,980
<33-5,House>我有个主意
<33-5,House>I have an idea...

761
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,630
<33-5,House>可以让这个问题再不困扰你
<33-5,House>that can make this entire problem go away.

762
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,030
<33-6,Wilson>好  我真的很想听你英明睿智的玩笑
<33-6,Wilson>Yes, I really want to hear

763
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,390
<33-6,Wilson>说我当初就不该要孩子
<33-6,Wilson>your clever late-term abortion joke.

764
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,980
<33-6,Wilson>你从前说的都是对的
<33-6,Wilson>You were right about everything.

765
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,280
<33-6,Wilson>这是生活  是真实的
<33-6,Wilson>This is life. It's real.

766
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,100
<33-6,Wilson>问题不会凭空消失
<33-6,Wilson>It doesn't just go away.

767
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,230
<33-7,House>你说的都不对[那都不是真的]
<33-7,House>None of that is true.

768
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,310
<33-9,Wilson>邓肯
<33-9,Wilson>Duncan.

769
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,390
<33-10,Duncan>其实我叫温德尔
<33-10,Duncan>Actually... Wendel.

770
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,380
<33-10,Duncan>一个L
<33-10,Duncan>One "L."

771
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,930
<33-10,Duncan>如果你生气了
<33-10,Duncan>If you're going to get pissy,

772
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,050
<33-10,Duncan>一定记得  这全是豪斯的主意
<33-10,Duncan>Remember, it was House's idea.

773
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,650
<33-11,Wilson>你是演员
<33-11,Wilson>You're an actor?

774
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,870
<33-12,Duncan>拍过五支广告  《我们的日子》常驻
<33-12,Duncan>Five commercials and a recurring on Days of Our Lives.

775
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,170
<33-13,House>你后悔没有孩子  所以我给你找了一个
<33-13,House>You were regretting not having kids, so I gave you one...

776
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,240
<33-13,House>以使你抛却遗憾
<33-13,House>Thereby rendering you regret-free.

777
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,610
<33-13,House>这份厚礼无价
<33-13,House>It's a priceless gift.

778
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,430
<33-15,House>-出去  -也不是无价
<33-15,House>- Get out. - Well, it's not priceless

779
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,900
<33-15,House>因为他只收我最低价
<33-15,House>'cause he charges sag minimum.

780
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,300
<33-14,Wilson>出去
<33-14,Wilson>Get out!

781
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,030
<33-17,Duncan>别太在意哦  老爸
<33-17,Duncan>Chillax, dad.

782
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,530
<33-18,House>你会澳洲口音吗
<33-18,House>Can you do an Australian accent?

783
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,180
<34-1,Bobby>我刚接了电话
<34-1,Bobby>I just got the call.

784
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,620
<34-1,Bobby>三年合同  两百一十万
<34-1,Bobby>Three-year deal. $2.1 million.

785
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,320
<34-2,Taub>那个后院冰场假装自己是拉缪的孩子呢
<34-2,Taub>What about the flooded backyard and pretending to be Lemieux?

786
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,390
<34-3,Bobby>所以我才签了
<34-3,Bobby>That's why I took it.

787
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,280
<34-3,Bobby>付出那么多走到今天
<34-3,Bobby>After all I did to get here,

788
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,600
<34-3,Bobby>残缺的梦想总强过一无所有
<34-3,Bobby>half a dream is better than nothing.

789
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,730
<34-3,Bobby>或许新教练能看到初级教练看不到的东西
<34-3,Bobby>Maybe my new coach will see what my juniors coach didn't.

790
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,580
<34-4,Taub>那倒不错
<34-4,Taub>That'd be nice.

<35-1,Park>我不会和你上床的
<35-1,Park>I'm not sleeping with you.

792
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,980
<35-2,Chase>真遗憾
<35-2,Chase>That's a shame.

793
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,880
<35-3,Park>都是为了婆婆吧
<35-3,Park>This is about popo.

<35-4,Chase>她也不会和我上床是吧
<35-4,Chase>She's not sleeping with me either, right?

797
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,490
<35-6,Chase>或许你拥有太多  而我又太少
<35-6,Chase>Maybe you've got too much, and I've got too little.

798
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,910
<35-7,Park>说不定我们会上床的
<35-7,Park>I might sleep with you after all.

799
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,730
<35-8,Wilson>跟我通话的女人是贝丝吗
<35-8,Wilson>The woman that I called-- that was really Beth?

<35-11,House>不收费  她还恨着你呢
<35-11,House>Nothing. She's still pissed at you.
