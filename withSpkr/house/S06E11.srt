1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,220
<1-1,Eddie>我出价35
<1-1,Eddie>So I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,910
<1-2,Marco>对我来说高了点
<1-2,Marco>Seems high to me.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,450
<1-3,Eddie>这种质量卖这个价很公平了
<1-3,Eddie>That's a fair price for quality like this.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,290
<1-4,Marco>我出30
<1-4,Marco>I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,280
<1-5,Mickey>怎么了  我以为你在开玩笑
<1-5,Mickey>What? I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,690
<1-6,Marco>我在和谁做生意  艾迪
<1-6,Marco>Who am I dealing with here, Eddie?

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,810
<1-6,Marco>是你还是他
<1-6,Marco>Him or you?

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,430
<1-7,Eddie>别紧张  米奇
<1-7,Eddie>Mickey, relax.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,060
<1-7,Eddie>这样吧  如果能和戈尔斯基合作
<1-7,Eddie>Now, If things move forward with Gorski,

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,620
<1-7,Eddie>让我们进入费城做生意
<1-7,Eddie>He lets us into philly,

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,180
<1-7,Eddie>到时候我就给你优惠
<1-7,Eddie>Then maybe I cut you a break.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,590
<1-8,Marco>现在就得给我优惠
<1-8,Marco>You cut me a break now,

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,760
<1-8,Marco>不然你没机会见到戈尔斯基
<1-8,Marco>Or maybe you don't get with Gorski.

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,480
<1-9,Eddie>马可
<1-9,Eddie>Marco...

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,210
<1-9,Eddie>我还以为咱俩都谈好了
<1-9,Eddie>I thought we had an understanding.

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,630
<1-10,Marco>别做傻事  汤米  把枪放下
<1-10,Marco>Tommy, don't be stupid. Put the gun down.

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,470
<1-11,Tommy>他已经给你留足面子了
<1-11,Tommy>First, he shows you some respect.

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,760
<1-12,Mickey>听从你老板的吩咐
<1-12,Mickey>Hey, You just-- just listen to your boss,

<1-13,Tommy>闭嘴
<1-13,Tommy>You shut up!

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,640
<1-14,Mickey>哥们  放松
<1-14,Mickey>Just relax, buddy.

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,630
<1-15,Tommy>天
<1-15,Tommy>Oh, god!

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,690
<1-16,Marco>你他妈干嘛呢
<1-16,Marco>What the hell were you thinking?

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,080
<1-17,Tommy>我没射中他  确定吗
<1-17,Tommy>I didn't shoot him! Are you sure?

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,420
<1-18,Marco>你看  他脸朝下摔倒在地上
<1-18,Marco>Look at him. He's face-down on the pavement!

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,940
<1-19,Tommy>我伤到自己的脚了
<1-19,Tommy>I nailed myself in the foot!

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,720
<1-19,Tommy>天
<1-19,Tommy>God!

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,990
<1-20,Eddie>他看起来没中弹
<1-20,Eddie>I--I don't think he's hit.

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,210
<1-21,Marco>那是怎么回事
<1-21,Marco>Then what happened?

30
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,780
<1-22,Tommy>我们赶紧走
<1-22,Tommy>Let's get outta here!

31
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,540
<1-23,Eddie>米奇  醒醒
<1-23,Eddie>Come on, Mickey, wake up.

32
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,900
<1-23,Eddie>米奇  醒一醒
<1-23,Eddie>Mickey! Wake up!

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,020
<2-1,Mickey>手术结束了吧
<2-1,Mickey>We almost done here?

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,620
<2-2,House>你的前额已经清理干净
<2-2,House>Assuming you did this shaving your forehead...

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
<2-2,House>下一步
<2-2,House>Okay, then.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,770
<2-2,House>我已经约好了脑部扫描
<2-2,House>I'm ordering a head C.T.

37
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,740
<2-3,Mickey>不用了  我既不头疼也不头晕
<2-3,Mickey>No, I don't have a headache. I'm not dizzy.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,900
<2-3,Mickey>艾迪  我得回去了
<2-3,Mickey>Eddie, I gotta get back.

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,590
<2-4,Eddie>你得留下来
<2-4,Eddie>You gotta stay here.

40
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,000
<2-4,Eddie>明天再收拾马可那边的烂摊子
<2-4,Eddie>We'll straighten out that mess with Marco tomorrow.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,310
<2-4,Eddie>让医生做完检查
<2-4,Eddie>Let the doc do his job.

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,310
<2-5,House>其实  为你缝合
<2-5,House>Actually, stitching you up

43
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,660
<2-5,House>本该是急诊室医生的职责
<2-5,House>Is really the E.R. Doc's job.

44
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,000
<2-5,House>是啊
<2-5,House>Yeah.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,470
<2-6,Mickey>等不及了
<2-6,Mickey>Too long of a wait.

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,220
<2-7,House>何况外科那边还有好多条子
<2-7,House>Yeah. Also, a lot of cops in the E.R.

47
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,170
<2-7,House>倒不是说你怕这个
<2-7,House>Not that you care about that.

48
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,000
<2-7,House>怎么受的伤
<2-7,House>So how did this happen?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,090
<2-7,House>好吧  这是个傻问题
<2-7,House>Yeah, you're right. That was a stupid question.

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,420
<2-7,House>因为答案很明显
<2-7,House>'cause the answer's kind of obvious.

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,610
<2-7,House>手上没有擦伤
<2-7,House>No scrapes on your hands

52
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,100
<2-7,House>意味着摔倒时你没有反抗
<2-7,House>Means you didn't try to break your fall.

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,150
<2-7,House>也就是说倒下时
<2-7,House>Means either out cold

54
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,580
<2-7,House>你已经完全失去意识或方向感了
<2-7,House>Or totally disoriented when you went down.

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,470
<2-7,House>除了这里没有别的外伤
<2-7,House>No sign of trauma other than the cut

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,370
<2-7,House>意味着没人打过你的头
<2-7,House>Means no one hit you in the head.

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,940
<2-7,House>夹克袖子上的火药味
<2-7,House>Powder burn on your jacket sleeve

58
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,170
<2-7,House>意味着有人开枪了
<2-7,House>Means someone shot a gun.

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,170
<2-8,Mickey>好了  艾迪  我们走吧
<2-8,Mickey>All right, Eddie. Come on, let's go.

60
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,430
<2-9,House>我不关心你们干什么勾当
<2-9,House>I don't care what you guys are into.

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,290
<2-9,House>不过如果不查出病因
<2-9,House>If you don't get this checked out,

62
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,440
<2-9,House>你还会发病的
<2-9,House>It'll happen again.

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,380
<2-10,Eddie>在什么情况下
<2-10,Eddie>Whoa. What will?

64
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,610
<2-10,Eddie>像这样
<2-10,Eddie>This.

65
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,240
<2-11,House>酷
<2-11,House>Cool.

66
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,040
<3-1,House>32岁男性
<3-1,House>32-year-old man,

67
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,510
<3-1,House>突然出现强噪音所致的眩晕
<3-1,House>Recently developed loud-noise-induced vertigo.

68
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,750
<3-1,House>脑部扫描没有问题
<3-1,House>C.T. Was clean.

69
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,410
<3-1,House>没有内出血和浮肿
<3-1,House>No internal bleeding, no edema.

70
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,140
<3-1,House>所有文件都在这里
<3-1,House>Everything else is in the file.

71
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,820
<3-1,House>离婚时卡梅隆带走了你的秀发吗
<3-1,House>Cameron get your hair in the divorce?

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,100
<3-2,Taub>三年前他后背受过伤
<3-2,Taub>This guy strained his back three years ago.

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,260
<3-2,Taub>就这些了
<3-2,Taub>And that's it.

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,630
<3-2,Taub>其他页都是空白
<3-2,Taub>All the rest of these pages are blank.

75
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,940
<3-3,House>没错  他嘴很严
<3-3,House>Yes, he won't tell us anything.

76
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,930
<3-3,House>作为一个毒贩子  这可以理解
<3-3,House>Understandable, since he's a drug dealer.

77
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,660
<3-4,Thirteen>这个病人危险而且有所隐瞒
<3-4,Thirteen>So he's dangerous and withholding,

78
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,180
<3-4,Thirteen>对你来说太有诱惑力了
<3-4,Thirteen>Which you find irresistible.

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,540
<3-4,Thirteen>不过这种人从来不打电话的
<3-4,Thirteen>But guys like that, they never call.

80
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,170
<3-5,Chase>他真说过自己是毒贩子吗
<3-5,Chase>He actually said he was a drug dealer?

81
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,360
<3-6,House>他没说
<3-6,House>Not out loud.

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,620
<3-6,House>不过戴着纯金的百达翡丽
<3-6,House>But he was wearing a solid gold patek philippe.

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,820
<3-6,House>他的朋友则是劳力士
<3-6,House>His friend had a rolex.

84
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,150
<3-6,House>却用着便宜的预付费手机
<3-6,House>But their phones were prepaid burners,

85
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,190
<3-6,House>以便联络完就扔掉
<3-6,House>So they can toss 'em as soon as they're done.

86
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,660
<3-7,Foreman>这家伙是不是毒贩子都不重要
<3-7,Foreman>It doesn't matter if this guy's a drug dealer or not.

87
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,860
<3-7,Foreman>噪音引发眩晕症状表明耳部或脑部有问题
<3-7,Foreman>Noise-induced vertigo means ear or brain.

88
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,700
<3-7,Foreman>脑部扫描没问题
<3-7,Foreman>Head C.T. was clean,

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,310
<3-7,Foreman>我猜测是听觉神经瘤
<3-7,Foreman>So I'm thinking acoustic neuroma.

90
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,130
<3-7,Foreman>需要做听性脑干反应测试听力
<3-7,Foreman>We need to do an A.B.R. To test his hearing.

91
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,820
<3-8,House>听觉神经瘤符合症状
<3-8,House>Acoustic neuroma fits.

92
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,400
<3-8,House>利多卡因中毒也说得通
<3-8,House>So does lidocaine toxicity.

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,330
<3-8,House>或者苯坐卡因  就看他用什么混可卡因
<3-8,House>Or benzocaine--depends what he's cutting the coke with.

94
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,490
<3-9,Thirteen>他不仅是个毒贩子
<3-9,Thirteen>So now he's not just a drug dealer,

95
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,850
<3-9,Thirteen>还是个卖可卡因的
<3-9,Thirteen>He's a cocaine dealer.

96
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,350
<3-10,House>这人看起来精力充沛
<3-10,House>He seemed peppy.

97
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,390
<3-10,House>你们给耳朵做检查
<3-10,House>You test his ears.

98
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,140
<3-10,House>我去检测一下可卡因
<3-10,House>I'm gonna go test his cocaine.

99
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,500
<3-11,Taub>你真以为这些人受你蛊惑
<3-11,Taub>You think this guy's just gonna hand over

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,330
<3-11,Taub>会乖乖的交出
<3-11,Taub>A briefcase full of illegal drugs

101
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,980
<3-11,Taub>手里的非法药物吗
<3-11,Taub>Because you ask nicely?

102
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,320
<3-12,House>希望不是
<3-12,House>I hope not.

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,370
<4-1,Wilson>这边最好的咖啡店是吉娜
<4-1,Wilson>So the best coffee's at Geena's,

104
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,640
<4-1,Wilson>最好的批萨则是吉诺家
<4-1,Wilson>And the best pizza is at Gino's.

105
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,100
<4-2,Nora>没错  千万别搞混了
<4-2,Nora>Yeah, And don't mix those up,

106
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,730
<4-2,Nora>因为Gino的咖啡难喝的要死
<4-2,Nora>Because the coffee at Gino's could kill ya.

107
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,410
<4-3,Wilson>那街角的干洗机怎么样
<4-3,Wilson>And how's the drycleaner on the corner?

108
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,010
<4-4,Nora>两个街区外有环保清洗机
<4-4,Nora>Go two blocks over to eco-clean.

109
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,820
<4-4,Nora>街角那台
<4-4,Nora>The one on the corner

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,080
<4-4,Nora>曾经绞碎了我男友的衬衫
<4-4,Nora>Used to shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

111
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,510
<4-5,Wilson>这样啊
<4-5,Wilson>Good to know.

112
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,350
<4-6,Nora>回想起来  真该感谢那些人
<4-6,Nora>In retrospect, I should really thank those cleaners.

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,650
<4-6,Nora>我们分手了
<4-6,Nora>We broke up.

114
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,380
<4-7,Nora>我该走了  有什么需要打听的
<4-7,Nora>This is my stop. So if you have any more questions

115
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,840
<4-7,Nora>生活信息  随时来找我
<4-7,Nora>About the neighborhood, I'm your girl.

116
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
<4-8,Wilson>最好的寿司店在哪
<4-8,Wilson>Uh, favorite sushi place.

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
<4-8,Wilson>我们可以吃个晚饭
<4-8,Wilson>Maybe we could get dinner sometime.

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,790
<4-9,Nora>当然  你得带着那个帅哥
<4-9,Nora>Sure...If you promise to bring that good-looking guy

119
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,460
<4-9,Nora>拄拐那个
<4-9,Nora>With the cane.

120
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,970
<4-10,Wilson>你是指豪斯吗
<4-10,Wilson>You mean House?

121
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,840
<4-11,Nora>你男友叫豪斯吗
<4-11,Nora>Your boyfriend's name is House?

122
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,550
<4-12,Wilson>他不是我男友
<4-12,Wilson>H-he's not my boyfriend.

123
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,140
<4-13,Nora>抱歉  说漏了
<4-13,Nora>Heh, I'm sorry.

124
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,020
<4-13,Nora>你们怎么称呼彼此
<4-13,Nora>Wh-what do you call each other?

125
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,790
<4-13,Nora>丈夫  伴侣
<4-13,Nora>Husband? Partner?

126
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,640
<4-13,Nora>爱人
<4-13,Nora>Lover?

127
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,560
<4-14,Wilson>我们不是同性恋
<4-14,Wilson>We're not gay.

128
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,630
<4-15,Nora>真的吗
<4-15,Nora>Seriously?

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,560
<5-1,Taub>你会听到一组咔哒声和嘶嘶声
<5-1,Taub>You're gonna hear a series of clicks and hisses.

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,350
<5-1,Taub>传感器会记录下传导至听觉神经
<5-1,Taub>Sensors measure electronic activity

131
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,840
<5-1,Taub>脑电波活动状况
<5-1,Taub>To your auditory nerve.

132
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,210
<5-2,Mickey>要检查多长时间
<5-2,Mickey>How long is this gonna take?

133
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,030
<5-3,Taub>一个或一个半小时
<5-3,Taub>An hour, maybe an hour and a half.

134
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,080
<5-3,Taub>或者你带着耳朵里的肿瘤出院
<5-3,Taub>Or you could walk away with a tumor in your ear.

135
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,600
<5-3,Taub>这家伙可能急着火拼去
<5-3,Taub>Guy's probably late to a stabbing.

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
<6-1,Taub>阻抗正常
<6-1,Taub>Impedances look good.

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,780
<6-2,Foreman>开始以每秒13下50分贝检测
<6-2,Foreman>Starting at 13 clicks per second at 50 decibels.

138
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,290
<6-2,Foreman>看看这个
<6-2,Foreman>Check this out.

139
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,420
<6-3,Taub>13的中间名是博勒加德
<6-3,Taub>13's middle name is beauregard?

140
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,140
<6-3,Taub>第三波潜伏期值为3.8
<6-3,Taub>Wave three latency is 3.8.

141
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,960
<6-4,Foreman>轻微滞后  不过没大问题
<6-4,Foreman>Slightly delayed, but nothing significant.

142
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,540
<6-4,Foreman>你就注意到那个了吗
<6-4,Foreman>That's what sticks out to you?

143
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,310
<6-4,Foreman>豪斯摆明了耍咱俩
<6-4,Foreman>House is clearly screwing with us.

144
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,740
<6-4,Foreman>这是伪造的工资单
<6-4,Foreman>It's a fake paystub.

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,010
<6-5,Taub>我觉得像真的
<6-5,Taub>Looks real to me.

146
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,630
<6-6,Foreman>没理由她挣这么多
<6-6,Foreman>There's no way she makes that much money.

147
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,470
<6-7,Taub>我也是这个数
<6-7,Taub>I make that much money.

148
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,220
<6-7,Taub>显然  你没这么多
<6-7,Taub>And...apparently, you don't.

149
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,350
<7-1,House>我想嗑药
<7-1,House>I need the drugs.

150
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,750
<7-2,Eddie>我们是搞服装生意的
<7-2,Eddie>We're in textiles.

151
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,520
<7-1,House>我想嗑药
<7-1,House>I need the drugs!

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,770
<7-3,House>这招对杰克·鲍尔[24小时主演]管用
<7-3,House>Hmm...works for Jack Bauer.

153
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,100
<7-4,Eddie>这有必要吗
<7-4,Eddie>Is this really necessary?

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,800
<7-4,Eddie>大厅里的椅子舒服多了
<7-4,Eddie>The chairs in the hall are way more comfortable.

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,540
<7-5,House>但是不太适合你
<7-5,House>But way less genre-appropriate.

156
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,070
<7-5,House>这么办吧
<7-5,House>Okay, here's the deal.

157
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,180
<7-5,House>我想打听点事
<7-5,House>I need information.

158
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,000
<7-5,House>你可以不告诉我
<7-5,House>You have reasons not to give me that information.

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,210
<7-5,House>要不我强迫你说出来
<7-5,House>So either I can force it out of you...

160
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,690
<7-5,House>或者你自己说
<7-5,House>Or I can't.

161
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,150
<7-6,Eddie>我真没什么可说的
<7-6,Eddie>I wish I could tell you.

162
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,770
<7-7,House>好吧  这样吧
<7-7,House>Okay...well, let's work with that.

163
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,880
<7-7,House>不提药了  说说你们的服装生意吧
<7-7,House>Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles.

164
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,470
<7-7,House>你们主要生产什么
<7-7,House>What's your major product?

165
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,970
<7-7,House>是不是以H开头
<7-7,House>Is it "H"?

166
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,790
<7-7,House>我是指袜子
<7-7,House>And by that I mean "Hosiery."

167
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,590
<7-8,Eddie>我们主要做
<7-8,Eddie>We do more with...

168
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,720
<7-8,Eddie>裙裤
<7-8,Eddie>Culottes.

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,980
<7-9,House>是以C开头还是K
<7-9,House>Is that with a "C" Or a "K"?

170
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,220
<7-10,Eddie>C
<7-10,Eddie>"C."

171
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,810
<7-10,Eddie>没人想要K了
<7-10,Eddie>Nobody wants "K" Anymore.

172
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,120
<7-11,House>你的朋友负责剪裁吗
<7-11,House>Does your friend cut the fabric

173
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,250
<7-12,Eddie>不  他负责销售
<7-12,Eddie>No, he's a sales guy.

174
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,170
<7-13,House>他肯定是自己动手做裙裤了
<7-13,House>Well, he must cut a culotte here and the

175
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,210
<7-14,Eddie>没人动过这批裙裤
<7-14,Eddie>No one touches the culottes.

176
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,320
<7-14,Eddie>抱歉
<7-14,Eddie>I'm sorry.

177
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,060
<7-15,Wilson>能说句话吗
<7-15,Wilson>Can I talk to you for a second?

178
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,390
<7-16,House>我正在审嫌疑犯呢
<7-16,House>I'm interrogating a suspect.

179
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,940
<7-16,House>有话快说
<7-16,House>Make it quick.

180
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,100
<7-17,Wilson>咱家大楼里每个人都觉得我们是同性恋
<7-17,Wilson>Everyone in our building thinks we're gay.

181
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,430
<7-18,House>我们都是30岁以上的成人了
<7-18,House>We're grown men overge of 30

182
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,980
<7-18,House>只不过搬到一起住
<7-18,House>Moved in together.

183
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,450
<7-18,House>到了维加斯我们就是两头老虎
<7-18,House>We're two tigers away n act in vegas.

184
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,330
<7-18,House>他们最终会明白的
<7-18,House>They'll figure out e straight eventually.

185
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,830
<7-19,Wilson>但是我现在就因为这个原因
<7-19,Wilson>Eventually is not when I want to go out

186
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,530
<7-19,Wilson>没法约3b那位可爱的姑娘
<7-19,Wilson>With the cute girl in 3-b.

187
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,830
<7-20,Eddie>能给我杯水喝吗
<7-20,Eddie>Any chance I could get some water over here?

188
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,300
<7-21,House>如果有什么东西
<7-21,House>If only there was some way

189
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,540
<7-21,House>能让她感觉是这样的话
<7-21,House>To communicate that information to her.

190
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,970
<7-21,House>难道是  我不知道  声音吗
<7-21,House>Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds.

191
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,740
<7-21,House>只要嗓音能...
<7-21,House>If only the larynx was capable of--

192
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,720
<7-21,House>她不相信我
<7-21,House>She didn't believe me.

193
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,330
<7-22,Wilson>她婉拒了我共进晚餐的邀请
<7-22,Wilson>She sidestepped my dinner invite.

194
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,530
<7-23,House>一个女人拒绝你
<7-23,House>And a woman would only reject you

195
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,580
<7-23,House>正因为她担心
<7-23,House>Because she's worried

196
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,290
<7-23,House>你可能对她不感兴趣
<7-23,House>That you might not be interested in her.

197
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,740
<7-24,Wilson>我们聊天很开心
<7-24,Wilson>We were chatting, having fun.

198
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,200
<7-24,Wilson>绝对有爱的火花
<7-24,Wilson>There was definitely a spark.

199
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,430
<7-25,House>基于她觉得你是基佬
<7-25,House>When she thought you were gay.

200
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,500
<7-25,House>你确定你哥们儿暗地里...
<7-25,House>You sure your friend isn't secretly tr--

201
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,310
<7-25,House>什么是裤裙
<7-25,House>What is a culotte, anyway?

202
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,730
<7-26,Wilson>看上去像裙子的裤子
<7-26,Wilson>Pants that hang like a skirt.

203
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,540
<7-26,Wilson>就是...
<7-26,Wilson>Just...

204
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,700
<7-27,Eddie>米奇讨厌那玩意儿
<7-27,Eddie>Mickey hates the stuff.

205
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,610
<7-27,Eddie>他是少数几个我信任的之一
<7-27,Eddie>He's one of the few guys I trust

206
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,830
<7-27,Eddie>能让他看着货过夜的人
<7-27,Eddie>To watch the product overnight.

207
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,520
<7-27,Eddie>他们一小时前带走了他
<7-27,Eddie>They took him away an hour ago.

208
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
<7-27,Eddie>你觉得他没事吗
<7-27,Eddie>You think he's okay?

209
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,840
<7-28,House>只是个耳朵测试罢了
<7-28,House>It's an ear test.

210
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
<7-28,House>肯定他会活着回来的
<7-28,House>Pretty sure he'll live.

211
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,590
<8-1,Taub>瞳孔缩小  心跳剧烈
<8-1,Taub>Pupils are constricted. Pulse is bounding!

212
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,420
<8-2,Foreman>导气管准备好了
<8-2,Foreman>Airway's clear.

213
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,750
<8-2,Foreman>快来个急救车
<8-2,Foreman>Need a crash cart in here!

214
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,700
<8-3,Taub>必须测血压
<8-3,Taub>Gotta be his blood pressure.

215
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,850
<8-3,Taub>我们得在他休克前搞定
<8-3,Taub>We need to get it down before he strokes out!

216
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,690
<8-4,Foreman>至少我们知道他的耳朵没问题
<8-4,Foreman>At least we know his ears are okay.

217
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,120
<8-4,Foreman>我们给他用了血管扩张药
<8-4,Foreman>We put the patient on vasodilators,

218
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,790
<9-1,Taub>血压稳定下来了
<9-1,Taub>Got his hypertension under control.

219
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,350
<9-2,Thirteen>他在医院反而症状更严重了
<9-2,Thirteen>He got worse here at the hospital.

220
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,320
<9-2,Thirteen>意味着不是犯罪活动让他生病的
<9-2,Thirteen>Means thug life probably isn't what's making him sick.

221
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,080
<9-3,Foreman>意味着我们可以不必当侦探
<9-3,Foreman>Which means we can stop the bloodhound gang routine

222
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
<9-3,Foreman>回头好好做医生了
<9-3,Foreman>And go back to being doctors.

223
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,610
<9-4,House>但我们一直是医生啊
<9-4,House>But we're doctors all the time.

224
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,320
<9-4,House>真没劲啊
<9-4,House>It's so boring.

225
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,660
<9-4,House>好吧
<9-4,House>Fine.

226
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,950
<9-5,Chase>可能是病态窦房结综合征
<9-5,Chase>Could be sick sinus syndrome.

227
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,820
<9-6,Taub>胸腔没有疼痛  呼吸困难
<9-6,Taub>No chest pain, shortness of breath.

228
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,730
<9-6,Taub>是脑动脉瘤导致了多囊性肾病吗
<9-6,Taub>Brain aneurysm secondary to polycystic kidney disease?

229
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,840
<9-7,Foreman>做了常规尿检
<9-7,Foreman>Normal urinalysis.

230
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,380
<9-7,Foreman>表明肾部没问题
<9-7,Foreman>Kidney's impalpable.

231
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,770
<9-7,Foreman>那...  是块新表吗
<9-7,Foreman>Is...that a new watch?

232
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,330
<9-8,Thirteen>我觉得该对自己好一点
<9-8,Thirteen>Thought I'd give myself a little treat.

233
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,550
<9-8,Thirteen>如果不是他脑部的问题
<9-8,Thirteen>What if it's not his brain,

234
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,050
<9-8,Thirteen>那么很可能是到脑部之前的问题
<9-8,Thirteen>But it's on the way to his brain?

235
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,020
<9-8,Thirteen>颈动脉狭窄
<9-8,Thirteen>Carotid stenosis.

236
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,680
<9-9,House>给他做颈动脉超声波检查
<9-9,House>Get an ultrasound of his carotids.

237
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,780
<9-9,House>看看他是否有动脉栓塞
<9-9,House>See if his arteries are clogged.

238
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,200
<9-10,Foreman>你挣多少钱
<9-10,Foreman>How much money do you make?

239
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,320
<10-1,Foreman>我要求加薪
<10-1,Foreman>I want a raise.

240
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,190
<10-2,Cuddy>我倒是愿意在
<10-2,Cuddy>And I will be happy to talk about that

241
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,900
<10-2,Cuddy>你的下一次评估时讨论此问题...  八月
<10-2,Cuddy>At your next review... in august.

242
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,830
<10-3,Foreman>我知道你给我的钱
<10-3,Foreman>I know that you're paying me

243
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,380
<10-3,Foreman>比小组里任何一个人都少
<10-3,Foreman>Less than everyone else on the team.

244
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,880
<10-4,Cuddy>我不能谈论其他人的工资
<10-4,Cuddy>I can't discuss other people's salaries.

245
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,430
<10-4,Cuddy>你知道的
<10-4,Cuddy>You know that.

246
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,970
<10-5,Foreman>因为他们都知道我赚的比他们少了
<10-5,Foreman>Now that they know I'm making less than they are,

247
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,130
<10-5,Foreman>他们会轻视我的
<10-5,Foreman>They'll never respect me.

248
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,470
<10-6,Cuddy>那么是谁告诉他们你挣多少钱的呢
<10-6,Cuddy>And who told them how much you make?

249
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,720
<10-7,Foreman>我挣的钱比我管的人
<10-7,Foreman>It's not fair for me to make less

250
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,070
<10-7,Foreman>都少  这不公平
<10-7,Foreman>Than the people I supervise.

251
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,950
<10-8,Cuddy>薪水不是关乎公平的
<10-8,Cuddy>Salary isn't about fairness.

252
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,500
<10-8,Cuddy>而是关乎你能否占据谈判的有利地位
<10-8,Cuddy>It's about what you can leverage in negotiation.

253
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,410
<10-8,Cuddy>如果桌上没有一份有竞争力的应聘书的话
<10-8,Cuddy>Which isn't much without a competing offer on the table.

254
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,850
<10-8,Cuddy>而我们都知道你没有
<10-8,Cuddy>And we both know you don't have one.

255
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,290
<11-1,Thirteen>超声波显示病人颈动脉
<11-1,Thirteen>Ultrasound showed no narrowing

256
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,410
<11-1,Thirteen>没有狭窄或栓塞
<11-1,Thirteen>Or obstruction in the patient's carotid.

257
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,540
<11-2,Taub>现在他担心的是...
<11-2,Taub>Not that he's worried--

258
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,230
<11-2,Taub>他一直问我什么时候可以出院
<11-2,Taub>Keeps asking me when he can leave.

259
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,190
<11-4,Thirteen>你在他病房装了窃听器吗
<11-4,Thirteen>You bugged his room?

260
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,650
<11-5,House>我们的病人住在
<11-5,House>Our patient sleeps in the building

261
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,270
<11-5,House>他们窝赃的地方
<11-5,House>Where they keep their stash.

262
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,620
<11-5,House>终于  他们要说出
<11-5,House>Eventually, he'll say something

263
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,710
<11-5,House>他们把毒品放到哪里了
<11-5,House>That gives away where that is.

264
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,250
<11-5,House>而我们也会找到他的病因
<11-5,House>And we'll find out what's making him sick.

265
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,120
<11-6,Thirteen>但我们已经排除了环境因素
<11-6,Thirteen>But we ruled out environmental causes.

266
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,620
<11-7,House>是你排除了环境因素
<11-7,House>You ruled out environmental causes.

267
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,770
<11-8,Taub>但你还假装同意了
<11-8,Taub>And you pretended to agree,

268
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,700
<11-8,Taub>所以趁我们把他带出病房时
<11-8,Taub>Just so we'd take him out of his room

269
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,190
<11-8,Taub>你就安装了窃听器
<11-8,Taub>So you could plant the bug.

270
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,530
<11-9,House>颈动脉狭窄是个不错的想法
<11-9,House>Carotid stenosis was a decent idea.

271
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,860
<11-9,House>但更正点的想法
<11-9,House>But an even decent-er idea

272
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,130
<11-9,House>是他把毒品藏在了他的脂肪细胞里
<11-9,House>Is that he's got toxins stored in his fat cells.

273
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,960
<11-9,House>他燃烧的每卡热量都让病情更严重
<11-9,House>Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.

274
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,760
<11-10,Taub>如果我们要处理毒品超量
<11-10,Taub>If we're going with toxic exposure,

275
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,850
<11-10,Taub>我们应该开始检查出最可能的嫌疑人
<11-10,Taub>We should just start testing for the most likely suspects.

276
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,660
<11-11,Thirteen>窃听器是个好主意
<11-11,Thirteen>Bug's a better idea

277
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,940
<11-11,Thirteen>总比成天瞎做检查的强
<11-11,Thirteen>Than blindly running tests for days.

278
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,830
<11-12,House>告诉他还得几周
<11-12,House>Tell him it'll take weeks.

279
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,910
<11-12,House>会很快的
<11-12,House>It'll be faster.

280
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,600
<12-1,Mickey>你说几周是什么意思
<12-1,Mickey>What do you mean weeks?

281
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
<12-2,Taub>检查需要时间
<12-2,Taub>These tests take time.

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,380
<12-2,Taub>因为有很多种致病可能
<12-2,Taub>There are a lot of possibilities.

283
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,970
<12-3,Mickey>不  但我  我不能在这待那么久
<12-3,Mickey>No, but I--I can't sit here this long.

284
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,620
<12-3,Mickey>我有事要处理
<12-3,Mickey>I got things I gotta take care of.

285
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,820
<12-4,Taub>如果你是为那些穷学生
<12-4,Taub>If you're worried about all the poor school children

286
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,410
<12-4,Taub>没有毒品而担心
<12-4,Taub>Going without their drugs,

287
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,230
<12-4,Taub>我肯定有人...
<12-4,Taub>I'm sure someone--

288
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,310
<12-5,Mickey>我要出院
<12-5,Mickey>I wanna be discharged.

289
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,320
<12-6,Taub>我去拿表格
<12-6,Taub>I'll get the forms.

290
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,780
<13-1,Chase>太荒谬了
<13-1,Chase>This is ridiculous.

291
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,240
<13-2,Thirteen>比成天待在实验室强
<13-2,Thirteen>Beats sitting in a lab all day.

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,860
<13-3,Chase>在实验室
<13-3,Chase>In the lab,

293
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,860
<13-3,Chase>很显然极少有被杀的危险
<13-3,Chase>There is significantly less chance of getting killed.

294
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,090
<13-3,Chase>跟得太近了  慢点
<13-3,Chase>You're too close. Slow down.

295
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,520
<13-4,Thirteen>我们光天化日之下待在一辆车里
<13-4,Thirteen>We're in a car in broad daylight.

296
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,220
<13-4,Thirteen>会有什么事
<13-4,Thirteen>What's gonna happen?

297
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,010
<13-5,Chase>你天真地以为他不会在车里放把枪吗
<13-5,Chase>You honestly think he doesn't have a gun in that car?

298
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,350
<13-6,Thirteen>他会用那个来射击医生吗
<13-6,Thirteen>That he's gonna use to shoot doctors?

299
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,900
<13-7,Chase>你就...  离远点
<13-7,Chase>Just...back off.

300
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
<13-7,Chase>手表的戏演得不错  顺便说
<13-7,Chase>Hey, well played with the watch, by the way.

301
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,080
<13-8,Thirteen>从一个朋友那借的
<13-8,Thirteen>Borrowed it from a friend.

302
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,800
<13-9,Chase>我们要骗他多久
<13-9,Chase>How much longer are we gonna keep lying to him?

303
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,910
<13-10,Thirteen>直到不好玩了为止
<13-10,Thirteen>Until it's no longer fun.

304
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,430
<13-10,Thirteen>我们都觉得他应该变得低调点
<13-10,Thirteen>We all thought he needed to be taken down a few notches.

305
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,020
<13-11,Chase>所以只是玩玩  不是让事态严重化吗
<13-11,Chase>So we're just having fun, not getting even?

306
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,390
<13-12,Thirteen>靠
<13-12,Thirteen>Oh, crap.

307
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,960
<13-14,Thirteen>会跟丢的
<13-14,Thirteen>He's gonna get away.

308
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,810
<13-15,Thirteen>闭嘴
<13-15,Thirteen>Shut up.

309
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,630
<13-15,Thirteen>3-b吗
<13-15,Thirteen>3-b?

310
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,190
<14-1,House>你是诺拉  对吗
<14-1,House>You're Nora, right?

311
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,800
<14-1,House>我室友告诉我说你是我们应该感谢的
<14-1,House>My roommate tells me you're the one to thank

312
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,190
<14-1,House>那个总是贴纸条通知我们的邻居
<14-1,House>For all the tips about the neighborhood.

313
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,660
<14-2,Nora>-格雷格  -很高兴认识你
<14-2,Nora>- Greg. -Nice to meet you.

314
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,210
<14-3,House>我听说你以为威尔森和我
<14-3,House>I hear you thought that wilson and I

315
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,680
<14-3,House>喜欢互相亮剑的
<14-3,House>Liked to polish each other's swords.

316
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,680
<14-3,House>我说的"剑"  其实应该是"手枪"
<14-3,House>And by swords, I mean pistols.

317
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,380
<14-4,Nora>当然他会告诉你的
<14-4,Nora>Of course he told you about that.

318
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,990
<14-5,House>别担心
<14-5,House>Oh, don't worry.

319
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,100
<14-5,House>实际上我很惊讶  这样的事很少发生
<14-5,House>Actually, I'm surprised that doesn't happen more often.

320
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,740
<14-5,House>我们俩都很直男
<14-5,House>We're both straight.

321
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,500
<14-5,House>我的...  上帝啊
<14-5,House>Oh, my...god.

322
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,120
<14-5,House>真漂亮
<14-5,House>That is beautiful.

323
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,320
<14-5,House>我们终于有一件可以
<14-5,House>We finally have the room

324
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,670
<14-5,House>彰显房间品质的物件了
<14-5,House>To display it the way it deserves.

325
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,730
<14-5,House>你能...  你能帮我搬到楼上去吗
<14-5,House>Would you--would you help me get this upstairs?

326
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,480
<14-6,Nora>当然
<14-6,Nora>Absolutely.

327
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,030
<14-7,House>顺便说  鞋真漂亮
<14-7,House>Nice shoes, by the way.

328
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,840
<14-7,House>鲁布托牌的吗
<14-7,House>Louboutin?

329
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,390
<15-1,Taub>你和卡迪说了吗
<15-1,Taub>You talk to Cuddy?

330
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,020
<15-2,Foreman>雷死我了
<15-2,Foreman>Shot me down.

331
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,660
<15-3,Taub>那么  现在怎么办
<15-3,Taub>So, uh, what are you gonna do now?

332
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,120
<15-4,Foreman>我得等待8月的评估
<15-4,Foreman>I'll wait for my review in August.

333
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,320
<15-5,Taub>什么
<15-5,Taub>What?

334
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
<15-6,Foreman>没什么
<15-6,Foreman>Nothing.

335
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,300
<15-7,Taub>是我也会那么做的
<15-7,Taub>That's what I would do.

336
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,520
<15-7,Taub>但我是个懦夫
<15-7,Taub>But I'm a coward.

337
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,410
<16-1,Yvette>他朋友15分钟前送他来的
<16-1,Yvette>His friend brought him in 15 minutes ago.

338
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,580
<16-1,Yvette>体温105华氏摄氏度
<16-1,Yvette>Temp's 105.

339
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,850
<16-1,Yvette>脉搏纤弱
<16-1,Yvette>Pulse is weak and thready.

340
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,610
<16-2,Eddie>他一点意识都没有
<16-2,Eddie>He's not making any sense.

341
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,040
<16-3,Mickey>有很多钱  艾迪
<16-3,Mickey>It's too much money, Eddie.

342
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,450
<16-3,Mickey>不能成交
<16-3,Mickey>That wasn't the deal.

343
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,540
<16-3,Mickey>不能成交
<16-3,Mickey>That wasn't the deal.

344
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,660
<16-4,Eddie>他会没事吗
<16-4,Eddie>Is he gonna be okay?

345
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,950
<16-5,Mickey>艾迪
<16-5,Mickey>Eddie!

346
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,120
<16-5,Mickey>我们给他用退烧药和类固醇来退烧
<16-5,Mickey>We gave him antipyretics and soft steroids

347
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,870
<17-1,Taub>防止器官损坏
<17-1,Taub>To reduce the fever and prevent organ damage.

348
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,230
<17-1,Taub>他已经不再神志不清了
<17-1,Taub>He's no longer delirious.

349
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,110
<17-2,Chase>病人出院  回来后情况更糟
<17-2,Chase>Patient went out, came back worse than before.

350
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,480
<17-2,Chase>指明我们应该回到环境问题上
<17-2,Chase>Points us back to environmental,

351
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,620
<17-2,Chase>关系到他去过哪
<17-2,Chase>Tied to wherever he went.

352
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,710
<17-3,House>不是  福曼去哪里
<17-3,House>No, it doesn't. Where's Foreman?

353
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,870
<17-4,Taub>他和卡迪开会呢
<17-4,Taub>He had a meeting with Cuddy.

354
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,150
<17-5,Thirteen>你说"不是"是什么意思
<17-5,Thirteen>What do you mean, "No, it doesn't"?

355
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,240
<17-5,Thirteen>我们没跟上  我的车被甩了
<17-5,Thirteen>We screwed up the tail. My car was impounded.

356
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,380
<17-6,House>确实  好玩  而且毫无意义
<17-6,House>True, amusing, and irrelevant.

357
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,030
<17-6,House>福曼落入薪水圈套了吗
<17-6,House>Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?

358
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,480
<17-7,Taub>是的
<17-7,Taub>Uh, yeah.

359
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
<17-8,House>祝他好运
<17-8,House>Mazel tov.

360
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,330
<17-8,House>看好戏很好玩吧
<17-8,House>Should be fun to watch.

361
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,360
<17-9,Thirteen>你觉得不是环境问题吗
<17-9,Thirteen>You're off environmental?

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,630
<17-10,House>无论他去哪  时间都不够久
<17-10,House>Wherever he went, It wasn't for long enough.

363
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,840
<17-10,House>从发烧来看  更像是感染
<17-10,House>Add in the fever and infection's way more likely.

364
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
<17-10,House>而且如果是感染的话
<17-10,House>And if it is an infection,

365
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,270
<17-10,House>他的症状显示已经入侵大脑了
<17-10,House>His symptoms suggest it's moved to his brain.

366
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,270
<17-10,House>意味着
<17-10,House>Which means...

367
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,440
<17-11,Chase>我们得做个腰椎穿刺
<17-11,Chase>We'll do a lumbar puncture.

368
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,400
<18-1,Mickey>下次跟踪车的时候
<18-1,Mickey>Next time you're tailing someone,

369
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,110
<18-1,Mickey>开两辆车
<18-1,Mickey>Take two cars.

370
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,720
<18-2,Chase>你知道我们跟踪你了吗
<18-2,Chase>You knew we were following you?

371
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,890
<18-3,Mickey>对不起  我必须甩掉你们
<18-3,Mickey>I'm sorry. I had to lose you.

372
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,310
<18-3,Mickey>我还有正事要做
<18-3,Mickey>I had business to take care of.

373
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,070
<18-4,Chase>对啊  因为你是个商人呢
<18-4,Chase>Right, because you're a businessman.

374
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,020
<18-4,Chase>你知道每星期有多少吸毒者
<18-4,Chase>Do you know how many junkies

375
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,390
<18-4,Chase>因脑部融化而被送进急诊室吗
<18-4,Chase>Come into the e.r. every week with their brains melting?

376
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,300
<18-5,Mickey>我打赌更多人因酗酒而切除肝脏
<18-5,Mickey>I'll bet there's more drunks with their livers giving out.

377
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,260
<18-5,Mickey>我猜一个经营酒类商店的人
<18-5,Mickey>A liquor store owner

378
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,060
<18-5,Mickey>在这个手术台上  也不会得到尊重
<18-5,Mickey>Laying on this table-- I'm guessing he doesn't get attitude.

379
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,680
<18-6,Taub>我刺到骨头了
<18-6,Taub>I hit bone.

380
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,420
<18-6,Taub>他背部的旧伤
<18-6,Taub>His old back injury

381
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,870
<18-6,Taub>一定把椎间盘磨平了
<18-6,Taub>Must have flattened out his discs.

382
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,220
<18-6,Taub>对不起  可是我要再试一遍
<18-6,Taub>Sorry, but I've got to try this again.

383
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,800
<18-6,Taub>-你还好吗  -没事
<18-6,Taub>- You okay? - Yeah.

384
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,180
<18-7,Mickey>一个成年人想颓废一下
<18-7,Mickey>An adult wants to get wasted,

385
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,000
<18-7,Mickey>为什么每个人都要管他用的是哪种方式
<18-7,Mickey>Why is it anybody's business what substance they use?

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,100
<18-8,Taub>因为有些方式是违反法律的
<18-8,Taub>Because some of those substances are against the law.

387
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,160
<18-9,Mickey>所以你是说问题不在于它是不道德的
<18-9,Mickey>So your problem isn't that it's immoral.

388
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,490
<18-9,Mickey>问题在于它是违法的
<18-9,Mickey>Your problem is that it's illegal.

389
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,670
<18-9,Mickey>我也有同样的问题
<18-9,Mickey>I got the same problem.

390
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,470
<18-10,Taub>进去了
<18-10,Taub>I'm in.

391
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,820
<18-11,Chase>看他的心率
<18-11,Chase>Look at his heart rate.

392
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
<18-12,Taub>正常啊
<18-12,Taub>It's normal.

393
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,210
<18-13,Chase>我知道
<18-13,Chase>I know.

394
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,930
<19-1,Wilson>我今早碰见诺拉了
<19-1,Wilson>I ran into Nora this morning.

395
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,800
<19-1,Wilson>她跟我说你的贝隆夫人音乐派对
<19-1,Wilson>She told me about your Evita listening party.

396
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,580
<19-2,House>伦敦和纽约的唱碟差别很大呢
<19-2,House>The London and New York recordings are so different.

397
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,140
<19-3,Wilson>你本应告诉她我们是异性恋的
<19-3,Wilson>You were supposed to tell her that we're straight.

398
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,340
<19-4,House>她也不相信我啊
<19-4,House>She didn't believe me, either.

399
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,870
<19-5,Wilson>你现在这么做是给我捣乱
<19-5,Wilson>You're doing this to mess with me.

400
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,440
<19-6,House>纠正  我刚开始就是给你捣乱
<19-6,House>Correction--I started doing this to mess with you.

401
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,760
<19-6,House>我现在正努力达成目标
<19-6,House>Now I'm honestly trying to hit that.

402
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,390
<19-7,Wilson>所以你装成一个和我在一起的
<19-7,Wilson>By pretending you're gay

403
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,990
<19-7,Wilson>和我有关系的同性恋吗
<19-7,Wilson>And in a relationship with me?

404
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,650
<19-8,House>我们的关系让我们都不高兴
<19-8,House>We're in a relationship and we're really unhappy.

405
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,110
<19-8,House>沟通对我们来说从来没容易过
<19-8,House>Communication's never been easy for us.

406
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,880
<19-8,House>也许因为我们总是不开诚布公
<19-8,House>Probably 'cause we're so closeted.

407
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,270
<19-8,House>我计划好了
<19-8,House>I got it all figured out.

408
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,270
<19-8,House>诺拉和我在几星期内会
<19-8,House>Nora and I spend the next few weeks

409
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,030
<19-8,House>一起出去玩
<19-8,House>Hanging out,

410
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,260
<19-8,House>成为好姐妹
<19-8,House>Become best girlfriends.

411
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,720
<19-8,House>我对她坦白我们的关系
<19-8,House>I confide in her about our issues.

412
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,450
<19-9,Wilson>我不知道你的计划是
<19-9,Wilson>I can't decide if this plan

413
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,240
<19-9,Wilson>卑鄙呢还是无逻辑
<19-9,Wilson>Is more despicable or illogical.

414
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,970
<19-10,House>然后有一晚  我们喝醉了
<19-10,House>Then, one night, we get drunk...

415
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,360
<19-10,House>背部按摩转移到了前面
<19-10,House>Back rub turns into a front rub...

416
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,770
<19-10,House>第二天早上
<19-10,House>The next morning,

417
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,930
<19-10,House>我从来没有对女人有这种感觉
<19-10,House>"I've never felt this way about a woman before."

418
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,360
<19-11,Wilson>你确实很有决心要上
<19-11,Wilson>That's...quite a commitment you've made

419
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,940
<19-11,Wilson>我想约会的女人
<19-11,Wilson>To jumping the girl I'd like to date.

420
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,620
<19-12,House>我想跟她约会
<19-12,House>I'd like to date her.

421
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,780
<19-12,House>意味着我可以重复上她
<19-12,House>In the sense that I'd like to jump her repeatedly.

422
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,040
<19-13,Wilson>我先见到她的
<19-13,Wilson>I saw her first.

423
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,960
<19-14,House>什么  你是在引用男人之间的条例吗
<19-14,House>Seriously? You're invoking the guy code?

424
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,670
<19-15,Wilson>我们是男人啊  而且这是条惯例
<19-15,Wilson>We're guys. It's a code.

425
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,740
<19-16,House>只有在知道自己要输的时候
<19-16,House>You're only bringing this up

426
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
<19-16,House>你才会把这条提出来
<19-16,House>'cause you know you're gonna lose.

427
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,770
<19-17,Chase>不是感染
<19-17,Chase>It's not an infection,

428
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,670
<19-17,Chase>可是有可能是自主神经絮乱症
<19-17,Chase>But it might be an autonomic nerve disorder.

429
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,520
<19-18,House>我还是看不惯你的新发型
<19-18,House>The hair is still bumping me.

430
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,150
<19-18,House>你剪头发
<19-18,House>Did you get it cut

431
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,780
<19-18,House>是因为你已经准备好翻开新的篇章还是
<19-18,House>Because you're ready for the next chapter or--

432
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,730
<19-19,Chase>两次取骨髓的时候针都被卡住了
<19-19,Chase>We stuck a needle into his spinal bodies twice.

433
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,470
<19-19,Chase>心率正常
<19-19,Chase>His heart rate stayed normal.

434
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,370
<19-19,Chase>如果我们把这和其他症状联想起来
<19-19,Chase>If we add that to his other symptoms...

435
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,170
<19-20,House>那是不对的
<19-20,House>That would be a mistake.

436
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,560
<19-21,Wilson>她不会中计的
<19-21,Wilson>She's never gonna fall for it.

437
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,620
<19-22,House>那你就没什么可担心的啦  亲爱的
<19-22,House>Well, then, you got nothing to worry about, sweetie.

438
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,060
<20-1,House>你是个懦夫
<20-1,House>You're a wuss.

439
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,500
<20-2,Mickey>等我好起来的时候才这么说我
<20-2,Mickey>Say that when I'm better.

440
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,030
<20-3,House>什么啊  你想打我啊
<20-3,House>What, are you gonna beat me up?

441
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,530
<20-3,House>好怕哦
<20-3,House>That sounds stressful.

442
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,780
<20-3,House>也许你应该先嗑点贝塔受体阻滞药
<20-3,House>Maybe you should pop one of your beta blockers first.

443
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,980
<20-4,Chase>你心脏有问题吗
<20-4,Chase>You have a heart problem?

444
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,150
<20-5,House>医学上说  没有
<20-5,House>Medically, no.

445
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,660
<20-5,House>要有的话他会告诉我们
<20-5,House>He would have told us about that.

446
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,810
<20-5,House>暗示着
<20-5,House>Metaphorically...

447
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,860
<20-6,Mickey>是法律以外的事情造成的结果
<20-6,Mickey>It's an effect from operating outside of the law.

448
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,960
<20-6,Mickey>有时候我得对无辜的人
<20-6,Mickey>Sometimes, I have to do bad things.

449
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,640
<20-6,Mickey>做坏事
<20-6,Mickey>And not always to bad people.

450
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,280
<20-6,Mickey>上几个月  我过得不太好
<20-6,Mickey>Last few months, that hasn't been so easy.

451
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,600
<20-6,Mickey>有个人给了我一些药丸
<20-6,Mickey>A guy got me the pills.

452
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,370
<20-6,Mickey>它们减轻了我的压力
<20-6,Mickey>And they control the stress.

453
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,920
<20-6,Mickey>听着  别告诉艾迪好吗
<20-6,Mickey>Look, don't-- don't say anything to Eddie. All right?

454
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,850
<20-6,Mickey>我最不想见到的事情
<20-6,Mickey>The last thing I need

455
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,120
<20-6,Mickey>就是他们以为我已经不行了
<20-6,Mickey>Is the guys thinking that I've gone soft.

456
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,020
<20-7,House>在我们起初接诊你之前
<20-7,House>When was your last pill

457
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,930
<20-7,House>你最后是什么时候服用过
<20-7,House>before we originally admitted you?

458
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,850
<20-8,Mickey>那晚之前
<20-8,Mickey>Um, the night before.

459
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,760
<20-9,House>我们是在这里给你取骨髓的
<20-9,House>And we stuck you in here,

460
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,770
<20-9,House>你没服用贝塔受体阻滞药
<20-9,House>And you went into beta blocker withdrawal.

461
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,260
<20-9,House>这导致了高血压
<20-9,House>That's what caused the hypertension.

462
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,910
<20-9,House>他从这里出去之后  又吃了一片
<20-9,House>When he got out of here, he took another pill,

463
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,240
<20-9,House>于是高血压症状没有了
<20-9,House>And the hypertension went away.

464
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,540
<20-9,House>意味着这从来就不是一个症状
<20-9,House>Which means it was never a symptom.

465
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,660
<20-9,House>排除了这一点
<20-9,House>We take that off the table,

466
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,440
<20-9,House>我们还有眩晕  发烧的症状
<20-9,House>We've got vertigo, fever...

467
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,000
<20-10,Chase>还有紧张
<20-10,Chase>And stress.

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,270
<20-10,Chase>他玩这个游戏有段时间了
<20-10,Chase>He's been in this game for a while.

469
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,580
<20-10,Chase>要不就是他最后几个月突然有了良知
<20-10,Chase>Either he grew a conscience over the last few months

470
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,610
<20-10,Chase>或者他产生过量肾上腺素
<20-10,Chase>Or he's producing excess adrenaline.

471
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,760
<20-11,House>嗜铬细胞瘤
<20-11,House>Pheochromocytoma.

472
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,070
<20-12,Mickey>-什么  -这就是希腊语
<20-12,Mickey>- What? - It's Greek for,

473
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,030
<20-13,House>对好人做坏事会
<20-13,House>"You'll be back doing bad things to good people

474
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,400
<20-13,House>现世报
<20-13,House>In no time."

475
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,100
<20-13,House>给他肾上腺做核磁共振
<20-13,House>M.R.I. His adrenal glands.

<20-13,House>You're okay with that, right? You're not gonna put a pillow over his face?

<21-4,Nora>天啊  就这儿
<21-4,Nora>Oh! God. Right there.

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,450
<21-6,Nora>给你倒一杯
<21-6,Nora>I'll pour you a glass.

484
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,580
<21-7,House>他不喝酒的
<21-7,House>He doesn't drink.

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,720
<21-8,Nora>那我们再喝多点
<21-8,Nora>Oh. Well, more for us, then.

<21-9,Wilson>我想我可以
<21-9,Wilson>I think I might...

487

<21-9,Wilson>吃一些
<21-9,Wilson>Have a little...

488
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,030
<21-9,Wilson>宫爆
<21-9,Wilson>Kung pao.

489
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,270
<22-1,Taub>卡迪怎么说
<22-1,Taub>How'd it go with Cuddy?

490
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,040
<22-2,Foreman>她说我需要谈判筹码
<22-2,Foreman>She told me I needed leverage.

491
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,980
<22-2,Foreman>所以我告诉她我有另外一个工作邀请
<22-2,Foreman>So...I told her about an offer I had

492
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,750
<22-2,Foreman>让我去领导一个在仁爱医院的神经科
<22-2,Foreman>To help run the neuro department at mercy.

493
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,090
<22-3,Taub>你真的要跳槽吗
<22-3,Taub>Are you really gonna take the job?

494
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,120
<22-4,Foreman>没有其他工作
<22-4,Foreman>There is no other job.

495
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,220
<22-4,Foreman>我在虚张声势  她回应了
<22-4,Foreman>I bluffed. She called it.

496
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,660
<22-4,Foreman>我可不要求她涨工资
<22-4,Foreman>I'm not gonna beg to be underpaid.

497
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,160
<22-4,Foreman>这个病例完了我就离开
<22-4,Foreman>I'm leaving when this case is over.

498
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,370
<22-4,Foreman>豪斯骗你的
<22-4,Foreman>House is lying to you.

499
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,740
<23-1,Wilson>我知道
<23-1,Wilson>I know.

500
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,400
<23-2,Nora>你也是
<23-2,Nora>And so are you.

501
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,540
<23-2,Nora>现在都2010年了
<23-2,Nora>It's 2010, I mean...

502
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,640
<23-2,Nora>没有人会在意你是同性恋的
<23-2,Nora>You know, nobody cares if you're gay anymore.

503
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,110
<23-2,Nora>我的意思是  你可以出柜
<23-2,Nora>I mean, you don't have to be in the closet.

504
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,380
<23-2,Nora>我不是
<23-2,Nora>I'm not, I...

505
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,550
<23-3,Wilson>看看你周围
<23-3,Wilson>Look around you.

506
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,050
<23-3,Wilson>这真的像是一个
<23-3,Wilson>Does this really look like a place

507
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,350
<23-3,Wilson>同性恋住的地方吗
<23-3,Wilson>Gay men live?

508
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,120
<23-3,Wilson>除了那个海报
<23-3,Wilson>Apart from the poster.

509
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,690
<23-3,Wilson>我们唯一的家具是这些凳子
<23-3,Wilson>Those stools are our only furniture.

510
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,920
<23-3,Wilson>窗户也没有装饰
<23-3,Wilson>There are no window treatments.

511
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,060
<23-4,Nora>我的前男友甚至不知道
<23-4,Nora>Well, my ex-boyfriend didn't even know

512
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,730
<23-4,Nora>什么叫窗户装饰
<23-4,Nora>What window treatments were.

513
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,660
<23-4,Nora>那木匠兄妹乐队唱片是格雷戈的还是你的
<23-4,Nora>Is that Greg's carpenters album or yours?

514
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,020
<23-5,Wilson>听着  豪斯讨厌音乐剧和时尚
<23-5,Wilson>Look, House hates musicals and fashion

515
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,770
<23-5,Wilson>还有蛋白酥皮
<23-5,Wilson>And meringue.

516
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,310
<23-5,Wilson>他一直在做戏
<23-5,Wilson>This whole thing is an act

517
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,310
<23-5,Wilson>为了赢得你的信任
<23-5,Wilson>Designed to earn your trust...

518
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,980
<23-5,Wilson>从而可以跟你上床
<23-5,Wilson>In order to sleep with you.

519
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,780
<23-6,Nora>我明白了
<23-6,Nora>I get it.

520
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,380
<23-7,Wilson>终于明白了
<23-7,Wilson>Finally.

521
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,790
<23-8,Nora>你是在吃醋
<23-8,Nora>You're jealous.

522
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,390
<23-8,Nora>如果你想多和格雷戈在一起
<23-8,Nora>You know, if you want to spend more time with Greg,

523
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,090
<23-8,Nora>你应该直接告诉他啊
<23-8,Nora>You should just tell him.

524
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,440
<24-1,Foreman>你错了
<24-1,Foreman>You were wrong.

525
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,230
<24-1,Foreman>核磁共振显示没有任何嗜铬细胞瘤的迹象
<24-1,Foreman>M.R.I. Revealed no sign of a pheochromocytoma,

526
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,000
<24-1,Foreman>意味着米奇的紧张
<24-1,Foreman>Which means Mickey's stress

527
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,960
<24-1,Foreman>只是紧张
<24-1,Foreman>Is just stress.

528
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,460
<24-1,Foreman>回到眩晕和发烧
<24-1,Foreman>We're back to vertigo and fever.

529
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,690
<24-2,Taub>所以环境又变回我们
<24-2,Taub>And environmental is back at the top

530
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,870
<24-2,Taub>清单的首选因素
<24-2,Taub>Of our list of suspects.

531
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,130
<24-2,Taub>我们要缩小可能性的范围
<24-2,Taub>We're trying to narrow down the possibilities.

532
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,830
<24-3,House>那个接收器对人工刺激没有回应
<24-3,House>That receiver doesn't respond to manual stimulation.

533
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,170
<24-3,House>也许你可以脱衣服
<24-3,House>Maybe if you took off your shirt.

534
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,040
<24-4,Thirteen>实际上我采取更奇怪的方式
<24-4,Thirteen>Actually, I resorted to something more exotic.

535
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,720
<24-4,Thirteen>我管它叫阅读说明书
<24-4,Thirteen>I call it reading the instructions.

536
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,210
<24-4,Thirteen>事实证明如果你把天线
<24-4,Thirteen>Turns out if you screw the antennae

537
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,090
<24-4,Thirteen>插进错的插口
<24-4,Thirteen>Into the wrong sockets,

538
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,680
<24-4,Thirteen>它是工作不了的
<24-4,Thirteen>It doesn't actually work.

539
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,930
<24-5,Chase>我们就是在特顿外跟丢米奇的
<24-5,Chase>We lost Mickey just outside Trenton.

540
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,840
<24-6,Thirteen>本应是要找一个开放频率
<24-6,Thirteen>It's supposed to search for an open frequency.

541
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,350
<24-7,Chase>那边的建筑大多是建于
<24-7,Chase>Most buildings there were built

542
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,940
<24-7,Chase>1920至1940年间
<24-7,Chase>Between 1920 and 1940.

543
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,500
<24-7,Chase>我们收集了最常见的毒品清单
<24-7,Chase>We're compiling a list of toxins most common--

544
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,680
<24-8,House>至少得有一个开放频率
<24-8,House>There's got to be at least one open frequency.

545
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,720
<25-1,House>我需要跟你朋友说说话
<25-1,House>I need a few minutes with your friend.

546
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,430
<25-1,House>你想的话可以留下
<25-1,House>Or stay if you want.

547
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,430
<25-1,House>直肠测试
<25-1,House>Rectal exam.

548
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,130
<25-2,Eddie>我去看看那些餐厅
<25-2,Eddie>I'll check out the cafeteria.

549
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,540
<25-3,House>为什么是贝塔受体阻滞药呢
<25-3,House>Why the beta blockers?

550
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,740
<25-4,Mickey>你什么意思
<25-4,Mickey>What do you mean?

551
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,320
<25-5,House>安定和阿普唑仑也缓解紧张
<25-5,House>Valium and xanax actually reduce stress.

552
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,570
<25-5,House>贝塔受体阻滞药只能减少由压力的病症
<25-5,House>Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress.

553
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,920
<25-7,House>稳定心跳的速度  缓轻手抖
<25-7,House>Keep the heart from racing, hands from shaking,

554
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,040
<25-7,House>以及诸如此类的问题
<25-7,House>and all those stage fright issues.

555
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,170
<25-7,House>所以有些人会在表演的时候把他们带上
<25-7,House>That's why some people take them when they perform.

556
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,370
<25-8,Mickey>这是什么
<25-8,Mickey>What the hell is that?

557
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,170
<25-9,House>这是我的窃听器
<25-9,House>This is my bug.

558
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,280
<25-9,House>而这个
<25-9,House>And this...

559
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,890
<25-10,Mickey>这个
<25-10,Mickey>Um... this...

560
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,270
<25-11,House>这个是你的
<25-11,House>This is yours.

561
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,520
<25-12,Thirteen>你居然窃听自己的房间
<25-12,Thirteen>You bugged your own room?

562
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,020
<25-12,Thirteen>你是告密吗
<25-12,Thirteen>Are you...an informant?

563
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,710
<25-13,House>告密者会在他第一次发病的时候
<25-13,House>An informant would have sold his pals out to us

564
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,530
<25-13,House>就出卖他的朋友
<25-13,House>at the first sign of a sniffle.

565
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,930
<25-13,House>这个人是个条子
<25-13,House>This guy...is a cop.

566
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,530
<26-1,Foreman>我可没看出这有什么关系
<26-1,Foreman>I don't see how this is relevant.

567
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,610
<26-2,House>你搞无聊
<26-2,House>In the land of no fun,

568
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,810
<26-2,House>还真是有一手啊
<26-2,House>you got a really sensible piece of property.

569
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,010
<26-3,Taub>让他休息会儿吧
<26-3,Taub>Give him a break.

570
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,070
<26-3,Taub>就算知道了他是卧底
<26-3,Taub>Knowing this guy's an undercover cop

571
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,710
<26-3,Taub>也不能帮助我们治愈他
<26-3,Taub>doesn't get us any closer to curing him.

572
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,390
<26-4,House>说的好  知道人们怎么说吗
<26-4,House>Good point. You know what they say.

573
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,760
<26-4,House>信息不是力量
<26-4,House>Information is not power.

574
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,940
<26-5,Thirteen>-等等  -你的意思是我们该利用
<26-5,Thirteen>- Wait... - You're saying we should

575
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,020
<26-5,Thirteen>这一点去胁迫他开口
<26-5,Thirteen>use the cop thing to force him to talk?

576
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,050
<26-6,House>胁迫吗
<26-6,House>Force?

577
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,020
<26-6,House>我是打算用类似女人的那套怀柔政策
<26-6,House>I'm talking about the womanly art of persuasion.

578
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,220
<26-6,House>我是说类似女人的
<26-6,House>I said womanly.

579
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,260
<26-7,Thirteen>如果你不想说
<26-7,Thirteen>If you won't talk to us,

580
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,600
<26-7,Thirteen>那我们就去找愿意说的人
<26-7,Thirteen>we'll find someone who will.

581
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,750
<26-7,Thirteen>你肯定有个上级
<26-7,Thirteen>I mean, you must have a supervisor,

582
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,380
<26-7,Thirteen>接头人之类的吧
<26-7,Thirteen>a...handler.

583
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,220
<26-8,Mickey>祝你们好运
<26-8,Mickey>Good luck with that.

584
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,990
<26-8,Mickey>你们不知道我的真名
<26-8,Mickey>You don't know my real name.

585
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,250
<26-8,Mickey>也不知道我是当地警察还是州警察
<26-8,Mickey>You don't know if I'm local or state,

586
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,890
<26-8,Mickey>是FBI还是药品管理局的
<26-8,Mickey>F.B.I., D.E.A.

587
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,560
<26-8,Mickey>不过随你们了  打电话去问吧
<26-8,Mickey>But, by all means, get on the phone.

588
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,290
<26-9,Chase>我明白  这些人行为卑劣
<26-9,Chase>I get it. These guys are lowlifes.

589
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,530
<26-9,Chase>你想把他们从街上清除掉
<26-9,Chase>You want them off the street.

590
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,660
<26-10,Mickey>他们不仅仅是卑劣
<26-10,Mickey>They're not just lowlifes.

591
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,770
<26-10,Mickey>艾迪三周前杀了一名告密者
<26-10,Mickey>Eddie killed a snitch three weeks ago.

592
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,170
<26-10,Mickey>这是老板的命令
<26-10,Mickey>Boss' orders.

593
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,470
<26-10,Mickey>这个老板是全国最大的
<26-10,Mickey>The boss, he's one of the biggest cocaine importers

594
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,840
<26-10,Mickey>可卡因进口商之一
<26-10,Mickey>in the entire state.

595
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,010
<26-10,Mickey>他打算把买卖扩张至费城
<26-10,Mickey>And he wants to expand down to Philly.

596
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,180
<26-10,Mickey>明晚他和艾迪将
<26-10,Mickey>Tomorrow night, he and Eddie

597
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,180
<26-10,Mickey>与一名重要人物会见
<26-10,Mickey>are meeting the big fish.

598
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,520
<26-10,Mickey>届时警察将会突击逮捕他们
<26-10,Mickey>And the cops are gonna bust it.

599
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,050
<26-10,Mickey>如果因为你们在这儿逛悠而暴露我的身份
<26-10,Mickey>But if you guys get caught poking around there,

600
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,490
<26-10,Mickey>那整件事就会被搅黄了
<26-10,Mickey>The whole thing gets called off.

601
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,330
<26-11,Thirteen>你的行为令人钦佩
<26-11,Thirteen>That's noble,

602
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,730
<26-11,Thirteen>可你不能将自己的生命置于险境
<26-11,Thirteen>but you can't put your life at risk.

603
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,800
<26-12,Mickey>我已经做了16个月的卧底
<26-12,Mickey>I've been undercover for 16 months.

604
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,800
<26-12,Mickey>我一直没有回家
<26-12,Mickey>I haven't seen my wife...

605
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,870
<26-12,Mickey>没见我的妻子和我的狗
<26-12,Mickey>my house, my dog.

606
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,510
<26-12,Mickey>为此我付出了太多
<26-12,Mickey>I have put far too much into this,

607
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,340
<26-12,Mickey>我不会让这一切半途而废的
<26-12,Mickey>and I will not let it fail.

608
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,580
<26-12,Mickey>所以
<26-12,Mickey>So just...

609
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,180
<26-12,Mickey>只要让我再活24小时就行了
<26-12,Mickey>just keep me alive for another 24 hours.

610
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,550
<26-12,Mickey>到时我会告诉你们想知道的一切
<26-12,Mickey>And I will tell you everything you need to know.

611
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,860
<26-13,Eddie>我能进来吗
<26-13,Eddie>Uh, can I come in?

612
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,960
<26-13,Eddie>护士们一直粘着我
<26-13,Eddie>Nurses out here can't keep their hands off of me.

613
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,930
<26-14,Mickey>他还真是个花花公子啊
<26-14,Mickey>He's a casanova, huh?

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,740
<26-14,Mickey>那么  你给我带了一份三明治吗
<26-14,Mickey>What, you bringing me my sandwich?

615
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,270
<26-15,Eddie>没有  因为
<26-15,Eddie>No, because, guess what.

616
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,310
<26-15,Eddie>我不会读心术
<26-15,Eddie>I don't read minds.

617
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,040
<26-15,Eddie>你怎么了
<26-15,Eddie>You okay?

618
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,120
<27-1,Chase>由于肠系膜上动脉血液凝块
<27-1,Chase>He had a G.I. Infarction caused by a clot

619
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,420
<27-1,Chase>导致的心肌梗死
<27-1,Chase>in his superior mesenteric artery.

620
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,760
<27-1,Chase>我们得切除一段肠
<27-1,Chase>We had to remove a foot of bowel.

621
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,860
<27-2,Thirteen>如果血栓继续增加
<27-2,Thirteen>If more clots keep forming,

622
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,630
<27-2,Thirteen>他可能活不过24小时
<27-2,Thirteen>he may not last 24 hours.

623
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,560
<27-3,House>可那个傻子还不愿开口
<27-3,House>And the moron still won't talk.

624
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,730
<27-4,Taub>坏人拉风  好人就是傻子吗
<27-4,Taub>Bad guy, cool; good guy, moron?

625
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,760
<27-5,House>差不多
<27-5,House>Pretty much.

626
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,300
<27-6,Chase>他可是个英雄
<27-6,Chase>Guy's a hero.

627
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,420
<27-6,Chase>为了把毒贩送进大牢他可冒着生命危险
<27-6,Chase>He's risking his life  to put these dealers in jail.

628
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,340
<27-7,House>那些因此而上位的毒贩
<27-7,House>I'm sure the dealers who take their places

629
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,470
<27-7,House>肯定会对他心存感激
<27-7,House>will be very grateful.

630
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,940
<27-8,Foreman>那么他的症状是头晕  发热还有血栓
<27-8,Foreman>So vertigo, fever, and thrombosis.

631
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,080
<27-8,Foreman>我们已经排除了癌症以及感染的可能性
<27-8,Foreman>We've already ruled out cancer and infection.

632
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,510
<27-8,Foreman>使用类固醇以后  他的病加重了
<27-8,Foreman>He got worse on steroids,

633
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,110
<27-8,Foreman>那也排除了自身免疫系统问题
<27-8,Foreman>which suggests it's not autoimmune.

634
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,970
<27-8,Foreman>所以我们就卡在环境因素上了
<27-8,Foreman>So we're stuck with environmental.

635
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,140
<27-9,Taub>可究竟是什么环境因素呢
<27-9,Taub>But what kind of environmentals?

636
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,380
<27-9,Taub>毒药  寄生虫还是过敏呢
<27-9,Taub>Toxins, parasites, allergens.

637
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,340
<27-10,Foreman>我们应该选出10种可能性最大的疾病
<27-10,Foreman>We should just pick the top ten possibilities

638
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,180
<27-10,Foreman>-一起治疗  -怕是这么做会
<27-10,Foreman>- And treat for all of them. - Except that treating for everything

639
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,320
<27-11,Thirteen>让他死的更快
<27-11,Thirteen>could kill him faster than whatever's killing him.

640
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,710
<27-12,House>你有更好的想法吗
<27-12,House>Got a better idea?

641
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,380
<27-13,Thirteen>差不多  奇斯说的对
<27-13,Thirteen>Sort of. Chase is right.

642
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,050
<27-13,Thirteen>我们的病人为了高尚的事业顽强坚持着
<27-13,Thirteen>Our patient is holding out for noble reasons:

643
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,280
<27-13,Thirteen>那就是掩护这次搜查
<27-13,Thirteen>protecting his bust.

644
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,950
<27-13,Thirteen>如果这支队伍里的其他人生病了
<27-13,Thirteen>Anybody else on that crew got sick,

645
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,150
<27-13,Thirteen>我想他们会更配合我们吧
<27-13,Thirteen>I'm guessing they'd be a little more self-serving.

646
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
<28-1,Eddie>谢谢
<28-1,Eddie>Thanks.

647
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,430
<28-2,Thirteen>手术很顺利
<28-2,Thirteen>Surgery went well.

648
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,400
<28-2,Thirteen>你一会儿就能看见他了
<28-2,Thirteen>You'll be able to see him soon.

649
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,200
<28-3,Eddie>以前说这么做可以解决儿童睡眠问题
<28-3,Eddie>Yeah, used to be all about ferberizing your kid.

650
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,270
<28-3,Eddie>现在他们又说这会扰乱他们的睡眠
<28-3,Eddie>Now they're saying it could mess them up.

651
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,880
<28-3,Eddie>我的孩子六岁半了
<28-3,Eddie>My--mine's 6 1/2.

652
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,750
<28-4,Thirteen>米奇的病情在恶化
<28-4,Thirteen>Mickey's getting worse.

653
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,480
<28-4,Thirteen>出现血栓是不好的预兆
<28-4,Thirteen>The clot is a very bad sign.

654
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,750
<28-4,Thirteen>请你告诉我们他去过哪里
<28-4,Thirteen>We really need you to tell us where he's been.

655
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,920
<28-5,Eddie>是我做的
<28-5,Eddie>I do that...

656
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,520
<28-5,Eddie>本来我很可能会
<28-5,Eddie>There's a very good chance

657
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,790
<28-5,Eddie>在缅因县变成个无名死尸
<28-5,Eddie>that I could end up John Doe at the county M.E.

658
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,630
<28-6,Thirteen>米奇因为过分暴露而染上疾病
<28-6,Thirteen>Look, Mickey got sick because he had the most exposure.

659
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,230
<28-6,Thirteen>其他人也有危险
<28-6,Thirteen>Other guys are at risk too.

660
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,070
<28-6,Thirteen>你不想
<28-6,Thirteen>You don't want to...

661
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,130
<28-6,Thirteen>你没事吧
<28-6,Thirteen>You okay?

662
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,300
<28-7,Eddie>我觉得头晕
<28-7,Eddie>I -- I feel dizzy.

663
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,300
<28-8,Thirteen>你有糖尿病吗
<28-8,Thirteen>Are you diabetic?

664
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,910
<28-9,Eddie>没有
<28-9,Eddie>No.

665
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,810
<28-10,Thirteen>上一次去你的办公室是什么时候
<28-10,Thirteen>When was the last time you were at your office?

666
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,640
<28-11,Eddie>-你是不是给我下药了  -什么
<28-11,Eddie>- Whoa...did you drug me? - What?

667
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,780
<28-13,Eddie>你想让我觉得我病了
<28-13,Eddie>You're trying to make me think that I'm sick

668
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,280
<28-13,Eddie>那我就会带你去我们的藏身处
<28-13,Eddie>So I'll take you to the stash.

669
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,920
<28-14,Thirteen>当然不是  如果你病了
<28-14,Thirteen>Of course not, but if you are sick--

670
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,090
<28-15,Eddie>我没病  我感觉被下药了
<28-15,Eddie>No, I don't feel sick. I feel drugged!

671
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,920
<28-15,Eddie>别想蒙我  我知道两者之间的区别
<28-15,Eddie>Trust me, I know the difference.

672
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,930
<28-16,Thirteen>你一半都没喝完
<28-16,Thirteen>You didn't even drink half of it.

673
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,430
<28-16,Thirteen>一小时后你就会没事了
<28-16,Thirteen>You'll be fine in an hour.

674
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,130
<28-17,Eddie>你们觉得米奇会死吗
<28-17,Eddie>You think Mickey could die?

675
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,540
<28-17,Eddie>好吧  就这么一次
<28-17,Eddie>Ah, it's just a deal.

676
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,110
<28-17,Eddie>我带你去
<28-17,Eddie>I'll take you.

677
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,220
<29-1,Thirteen>我们在这儿头都抬不起来
<29-1,Thirteen>Couldn't have given us a heads up

678
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,780
<29-1,Thirteen>他真的是住在洗衣房吗
<29-1,Thirteen>that he was living in a drycleaner?

679
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,750
<29-1,Thirteen>这活生生的就是个毒药缸子
<29-1,Thirteen>It's like living in a vat of poison.

680
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,590
<29-2,Eddie>看完没  我们可以走了吗
<29-2,Eddie>Is that it? Can we get out of here?

681
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,220
<29-3,Thirteen>我得把所有地方都查看一遍
<29-3,Thirteen>I gotta cover all our bases.

682
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,460
<29-4,Eddie>好吧  看那儿
<29-4,Eddie>Okay, fine. Look...back there.

683
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,730
<29-4,Eddie>快点
<29-4,Eddie>Hurry up.

684
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,110
<29-5,Thirteen>这是什么  是化学药品吗
<29-5,Thirteen>What are these, more chemicals?

685
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,940
<29-6,Eddie>不完全是
<29-6,Eddie>Oh, not exactly.

686
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,850
<29-6,Eddie>如果这是病因的话
<29-6,Eddie>Uh...if this stuff was the problem,

687
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,450
<29-6,Eddie>那就不会只有他一个人生病
<29-6,Eddie>there'd be a lot more sick people.

688
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,320
<29-6,Eddie>你打电话给条子了吗
<29-6,Eddie>Did you call the cops?

689
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,320
<29-7,Thirteen>没有
<29-7,Thirteen>No.

690
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,960
<29-8,Eddie>不应该有人在这儿的啊
<29-8,Eddie>No one's supposed to be here.

691
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,230
<29-9,Thirteen>过来
<29-9,Thirteen>Come here.

692
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,130
<29-9,Thirteen>我说了不准吻我
<29-9,Thirteen>I said no kissing!

693
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,430
<29-9,Thirteen>艾迪
<29-9,Thirteen>Eddie.

694
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,760
<29-10,Guy>没想到你在这里啊
<29-10,Guy>I didn't know you'd be here.

695
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,830
<29-12,Thirteen>听着  我只跟你有交易
<29-12,Thirteen>Look, the deal was just for you.

696
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,540
<29-12,Thirteen>这个男人想看的话  你得再付50美元
<29-12,Thirteen>This guy wants to watch, it's an extra 50.

697
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,410
<29-13,Eddie>哥们儿  这是私人聚会
<29-13,Eddie>Yeah, private party, man.

700
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,400
<30-1,House>我都快嫉妒死了
<30-1,House>The jealousy is... killing me.

701
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,330
<30-2,Nora>那个  显然他在意你
<30-2,Nora>Well...he clearly cares about you.

702
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,630
<30-2,Nora>非常的在意你
<30-2,Nora>Very much.

703
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,670
<30-3,House>为什么他就不能正常的表达出来呢
<30-3,House>Why can't he show it in a-- in a normal way?

704
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,910
<30-3,House>我受够了
<30-3,House>I'm so tired of...

705
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,270
<30-3,House>他的沉默和对我的忿恨
<30-3,House>the whole silence and the resentment.

706
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,410
<30-3,House>今晚我都不想回去
<30-3,House>I don't know if I can go back there tonight.

707
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,750
<30-3,House>我需要一些时间
<30-3,House>I need some time.

<30-5,House>Really?

710
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,130
<30-6,Nora>肯定会很有趣的
<30-6,Nora>It'll be fun.

711
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,290
<30-6,Nora>就像那种通宵派对
<30-6,Nora>You know, like a -- like a sleepover.

712
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,430
<30-7,House>那将会  那将会
<30-7,House>That would -- that would be...

713
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,600
<30-7,House>那将会极大的帮助我
<30-7,House>It would be such a help.

714
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,670
<30-7,House>谢谢你
<30-7,House>Thank you.

715
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,340
<30-8,Wilson>豪斯
<30-8,Wilson>House.

716
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,210
<30-9,House>你来这儿干吗
<30-9,House>What are you doing here?

717
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,640
<30-10,Wilson>我来这儿是因为
<30-10,Wilson>I'm here because...

718
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,540
<30-11,House>你说什么也无法改变既定的事实
<30-11,House>Nothing you can say is going to change anything.

719
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,980
<30-12,Wilson>我爱这个男人
<30-12,Wilson>I love this man.

720
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,900
<30-12,Wilson>我不会再浪费生命的一刻
<30-12,Wilson>And I am not wasting another moment

721
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,360
<30-12,Wilson>去否认这一切
<30-12,Wilson>of my life denying that.

722
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,000
<30-12,Wilson>格利高里·豪斯
<30-12,Wilson>Gregory House...

723
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,470
<30-12,Wilson>你愿意嫁给我吗
<30-12,Wilson>Will you marry me?

724
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,780
<30-13,House>太意外了
<30-13,House>This is unexpected.

725
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,750
<30-14,Lady>快说愿意啊
<30-14,Lady>Say yes!

726
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,060
<30-15,Nora>我该走了
<30-15,Nora>I'm gonna go.

727
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,090
<30-16,House>别别  别走
<30-16,House>No--no, no, no.

728
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,860
<30-17,Nora>你们显然有话要说
<30-17,Nora>You two obviously have some talking to do.

729
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,930
<30-17,Nora>不好意思
<30-17,Nora>Excuse me.

730
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,910
<31-1,Chase>怎么样了
<31-1,Chase>How's it coming?

731
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,180
<31-2,Taub>目前为止  一无所获
<31-2,Taub>So far, nothing.

732
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,350
<31-2,Taub>地毯  画  隔热材料
<31-2,Taub>Carpet, paint, insulation.

733
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,220
<31-2,Taub>甚至连冰箱里所有的食物都检查了
<31-2,Taub>Even the gross food in the fridge.

734
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,420
<31-2,Taub>都没有异样
<31-2,Taub>Everything's coming up clean.

735
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,020
<31-3,Thirteen>只剩下干洗剂没有排除
<31-3,Thirteen>which leaves the dry-cleaning chemicals.

736
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,450
<31-3,Thirteen>几分钟后出结果
<31-3,Thirteen>Should have the results in a few minutes.

737
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,460
<31-4,Chase>福曼已经给他用了
<31-4,Chase>Foreman's already started him

738
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,960
<31-4,Chase>吸入式沙丁胺醇
<31-4,Chase>on inhaled albuterol.

739
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,560
<31-4,Chase>有可能这病例已经解决了
<31-4,Chase>Chances are, this case is over.

740
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,460
<31-5,Taub>-我们得告诉他  -不行
<31-5,Taub>- We have to tell him. - We can't tell him.

741
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,860
<31-6,Thirteen>这改变不了卡迪让他卷铺盖的事实
<31-6,Thirteen>Won't change the fact that Cuddy let him walk.

742
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,060
<31-6,Thirteen>只会让他知道
<31-6,Thirteen>It'll just let him know

743
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,370
<31-6,Thirteen>这只是一个白痴恶作剧闯的祸
<31-6,Thirteen>it was all because of a stupid prank.

744
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,580
<31-7,Chase>我们得跟卡迪讲
<31-7,Chase>We have to tell Cuddy.

745
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,630
<31-7,Chase>自首然后求她让他留下
<31-7,Chase>We confess and beg her to take him back.

746
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,540
<31-8,Taub>祈求有用的话  他就该加了薪了
<31-8,Taub>If begging worked, he would have a raise,

747
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,550
<31-8,Taub>我们也不用在这儿焦头烂额的
<31-8,Taub>and we wouldn't be screwed.

748
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,080
<31-9,Foreman>沙丁胺醇不起作用
<31-9,Foreman>Albuterol is not helping.

749
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,220
<31-9,Foreman>病人开始咳血了
<31-9,Foreman>Patient started coughing blood.

750
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,950
<31-10,Taub>再加异丙托铵怎么样
<31-10,Taub>What about adding ipratropium?

751
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,990
<31-10,Taub>那就会
<31-10,Taub>That might--

752
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,950
<31-11,Thirteen>别费那劲了
<31-11,Thirteen>Don't bother.

753
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,860
<31-11,Thirteen>本来猜想干洗剂用的是全氯乙烯
<31-11,Thirteen>We assumed this place was using perchloroethylene.

754
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,730
<31-11,Thirteen>结果是...石油溶剂
<31-11,Thirteen>Turns out... petroleum solvents.

755
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,400
<31-12,Chase>毒贩子开了个环保干洗店吗
<31-12,Chase>The drug dealers are running a green drycleaner?

756
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,760
<31-13,Taub>真抱歉拆你这黑色幽默的台
<31-13,Taub>I hate to push past the irony,

757
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,800
<31-13,Taub>但我们的病人现在肺出血
<31-13,Taub>but our patient's bleeding into his lungs,

758
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,110
<31-13,Taub>我们还一无所获
<31-13,Taub>and we've got nothing.

759
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,900
<32-1,Chase>昨晚得到的肺扫描通气-灌注系数
<32-1,Chase>The v/q scan last night

760
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,800
<32-1,Chase>显示存在一个肺动脉瘤
<32-1,Chase>showed a pulmonary aneurysm.

761
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,640
<32-1,Chase>解释了咳血症状
<32-1,Chase>Explains the coughing blood.

762
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,610
<32-1,Chase>我做了栓塞止血
<32-1,Chase>I did an embolization to stop the bleeding,

763
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,710
<32-1,Chase>但他今早又开始咳
<32-1,Chase>He then started up again this morning.

764
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,560
<32-1,Chase>结果出现了另三个动脉瘤
<32-1,Chase>Three more aneurysms.

765
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,500
<32-2,Foreman>像是霉菌性动脉瘤
<32-2,Foreman>Those look like mycotic aneurysms.

766
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,870
<32-2,Foreman>显示有真菌感染
<32-2,Foreman>Indicates a fungal infection.

767
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,770
<32-3,Taub>这就和症状切合了
<32-3,Taub>That'd be consistent with his other symptoms:

768
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,860
<32-3,Taub>眩晕  发热
<32-3,Taub>The vertigo, the fever.

769
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,610
<32-4,Thirteen>我没在那儿看见过霉菌
<32-4,Thirteen>I didn't see any fungus at the location,

770
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,500
<32-4,Thirteen>试样也全都--
<32-4,Thirteen>And none of the samples--

771
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,540
<32-5,House>似乎有些人漏掉了什么东西
<32-5,House>Looks like somebody missed something.

772
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,680
<32-5,House>对有些人来说这真是太丢脸了
<32-5,House>which is embarrassing for somebody.

773
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,750
<32-6,Thirteen>而且  我们给他用的类固醇
<32-6,Thirteen>And...the steroids we gave him

774
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,550
<32-6,Thirteen>抑制了免疫系统
<32-6,Thirteen>would have suppressed his immune system.

775
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,820
<32-6,Thirteen>如果是真菌  他会有30个动脉瘤
<32-6,Thirteen>If that was a fungus, he'd have 30 aneurysms.

776
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,130
<32-7,House>某些人说得挺在点
<32-7,House>Somebody's got a good point.

777
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,470
<32-8,Taub>十二个小时内从一个发展成四个么
<32-8,Taub>One bleed to four in less than 12 hours?

778
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,870
<32-8,Taub>我觉得这表明病情在恶化
<32-8,Taub>That seems like an uptick to me.

779
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,680
<32-9,Foreman>趁他还没被自己的血淹死
<32-9,Foreman>We need to start him on antifungal meds

780
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,180
<32-9,Foreman>得给他上抗真菌药了
<32-9,Foreman>before he drowns in his own blood.

781
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,780
<32-10,House>用吧
<32-10,House>Do it.

782
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,720
<33-1,Eddie>过多久起作用呢
<33-1,Eddie>How long till it starts working?

783
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,490
<33-2,Foreman>几个小时吧
<33-2,Foreman>Give it a few hours.

784
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,820
<33-2,Foreman>我们会回来检查的
<33-2,Foreman>We'll be back to check on you.

785
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,410
<33-3,Eddie>来
<33-3,Eddie>There you go.

786
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
<33-3,Eddie>轻松点
<33-3,Eddie>Take it easy.

787
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,920
<33-4,Mickey>你不该带她去那儿的
<33-4,Mickey>You shouldn't have taken her there,

788
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,090
<33-4,Mickey>你这白痴
<33-4,Mickey>You imbecile.

789
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,620
<33-4,Mickey>他们什么都没发现
<33-4,Mickey>They found nothing.

790
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,290
<33-4,Mickey>你有可能被人爆头的
<33-4,Mickey>You could have got your brains blown out.

791
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,260
<33-5,Eddie>我必须做点什么
<33-5,Eddie>I had to do something.

792
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,160
<33-5,Eddie>我不能就这么眼睁睁地看着你...
<33-5,Eddie>I couldn't just sit and watch and...

793
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,270
<33-5,Eddie>你是我朋友
<33-5,Eddie>You're my friend.

794
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
<33-6,Mickey>谢谢
<33-6,Mickey>Thanks.

795
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,650
<33-7,Eddie>你也会为我这么做的
<33-7,Eddie>You'd do it for me.

796
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,420
<33-7,Eddie>我  我得走了
<33-7,Eddie>I-I should get going.

797
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,990
<33-7,Eddie>费城的大人物今晚到
<33-7,Eddie>Got the big man from philly coming in tonight.

798
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,930
<33-7,Eddie>你要我留下  我就留下
<33-7,Eddie>You want me to stay, I'll stay.

799
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,190
<33-7,Eddie>我们知道的吉米全都知道
<33-7,Eddie>Jimmy knows everything that we know.

800
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,570
<33-7,Eddie>不
<33-7,Eddie>No.

801
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,660
<33-8,Mickey>我们花在这上面的六个月...
<33-8,Mickey>The six months we put in on this...

802
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,750
<33-8,Mickey>你得在场
<33-8,Mickey>You gotta be there.

803
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,990
<33-9,Eddie>明天来看你
<33-9,Eddie>I'll swing by tomorrow.

804
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
<33-10,Mickey>艾迪
<33-10,Mickey>Hey, Eddie.

805
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,660
<33-11,Eddie>嗯
<33-11,Eddie>Yeah?

806
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,160
<33-11,Eddie>对不起
<33-11,Eddie>I'm sorry.

807
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,730
<33-12,Mickey>我没法和你一起去
<33-12,Mickey>You know that... I can't go with you.

808
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,150
<34-1,Thirteen>这都是我们的错
<34-1,Thirteen>It was all our fault.

809
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,720
<34-2,Taub>我们在作弄福曼
<34-2,Taub>We were screwing with Foreman,

810
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,120
<34-2,Taub>想让他以为自己工资比我们低
<34-2,Taub>Trying to make him think he made less than we did.

811
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,260
<34-2,Taub>显然  事情有些不受控制
<34-2,Taub>Obviously, things got out of control.

812
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
<34-3,Cuddy>好吧  有些人干了些
<34-3,Cuddy>Well, someone does something

813
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,890
<34-3,Cuddy>愚蠢又欠考虑的事情
<34-3,Cuddy>stupid and insensitive,

814
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,930
<34-3,Cuddy>我总以为是豪斯
<34-3,Cuddy>I always figure it was house.

815
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,400
<34-3,Cuddy>真高兴这做得很抢眼
<34-3,Cuddy>Good to know it's catching.

816
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,130
<34-4,Chase>没有什么第二份工作存在
<34-4,Chase>Look, there is no other job.

817
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,370
<34-4,Chase>他就是想加薪
<34-4,Chase>He was just trying to get a raise.

818
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,040
<34-4,Chase>就算你只多给他一丁点钱
<34-4,Chase>Even if you gave him a little more money,

819
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,270
<34-4,Chase>他都会留下的
<34-4,Chase>I know he'd stay.

820
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,070
<34-5,Cuddy>我不会只因为你们三个想取乐
<34-5,Cuddy>I'm not giving Foreman a raise

821
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,570
<34-5,Cuddy>就加他薪的
<34-5,Cuddy>because the three of you decided to amuse yourselves.

822
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,310
<34-6,Thirteen>我们知道  所以
<34-6,Thirteen>We know, and that's why

823
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,140
<34-6,Thirteen>多出的钱扣我们的账吧
<34-6,Thirteen>we want you to take it out of our paychecks.

824
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,230
<34-7,Cuddy>你们俩没意见吗
<34-7,Cuddy>You two okay with this?

825
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,650
<34-8,Taub>有其他选择吗
<34-8,Taub>Is there any other option?

826
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,390
<34-9,Chase>没意见
<34-9,Chase>We're okay with it.

827
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,020
<34-9,Chase>福曼是个好组长
<34-9,Chase>Foreman is a good team leader.

828
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,060
<34-9,Chase>他应得的
<34-9,Chase>He deserves it.

829
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,260
<34-9,Chase>那行
<34-9,Chase>Okay, then.

830
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,230
<34-10,Cuddy>我会这么做的
<34-10,Cuddy>That is what I will do.

831
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,830
<34-10,Cuddy>最后说一句
<34-10,Cuddy>And just so you know...

832
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,900
<34-10,Cuddy>我不知道你们在说什么
<34-10,Cuddy>I have no idea what you're talking about.

833
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,440
<34-10,Cuddy>我这三天都没见过福曼
<34-10,Cuddy>I haven't seen Foreman in three days.

834
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,690
<34-11,Foreman>我突然想起那句"谁是你老板"
<34-11,Foreman>The phrase "Who's your daddy?" Comes to mind.

835
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,100
<35-1,Nora>来杯咖啡怎么样
<35-1,Nora>Want to grab some coffee?

836
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,120
<35-2,House>正窝工呢
<35-2,House>Kind of a bad time.

837
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,800
<35-3,Nora>抱歉  你让我顺便来看看  所以
<35-3,Nora>Sorry. Uh, you told me to drop by, so...

838
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,010
<35-3,Nora>我只能这时候来
<35-3,Nora>This is when I could make it.

839
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,240
<35-3,Nora>好吧
<35-3,Nora>Right.

840
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,440
<35-4,House>进来吧
<35-4,House>Come in, yeah.

841
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,480
<35-4,House>威尔森的这整回事
<35-4,House>This whole thing with Wilson...

842
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,720
<35-4,House>全是我的错
<35-4,House>It's all my fault.

843
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,660
<35-4,House>我们不是不出柜  我们不是同性恋
<35-4,House>We're not closeted, because we're not gay.

844
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,160
<35-4,House>真的不是
<35-4,House>For real.

845
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,290
<35-4,House>威尔森觉得你很可爱
<35-4,House>Wilson thought you were cute,

846
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,870
<35-4,House>我就是想让他掉链子
<35-4,House>And I was just yanking his chain.

847
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,630
<35-4,House>这么说可能不太对
<35-4,House>Maybe that's not the best phrasing.

848
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,400
<35-5,Nora>所以你和我一起
<35-5,Nora>So you were only spending time with me

849
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,730
<35-5,Nora>只是为了让他搞砸吗
<35-5,Nora>to screw with him?

850
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,710
<35-5,Nora>天  不是
<35-5,Nora>God, no.

851
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,530
<35-5,Nora>我和你一起
<35-5,Nora>I was spending time with you

852
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,250
<35-6,House>是因为我想摸你咪咪
<35-6,House>because I want to touch your boobs.

853
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,310
<35-6,House>贝隆夫人听两次就够了
<35-6,House>Enough to listen to Evita, twice.

854
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,560
<35-6,House>我讨厌他们讨厌得不行
<35-6,House>And I really hate Evita.

855
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,890
<35-6,House>你看我多有喜欢你的咪咪
<35-6,House>That's how much I like your boobs.

856
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,200
<35-6,House>等等  哇哇哇
<35-6,House>Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

857
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,900
<35-6,House>等一等  等一等
<35-6,House>Wait, wait.

858
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,810
<35-6,House>威尔森  他是个很好的人
<35-6,House>Wilson... He's a really good guy.

859
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,940
<35-6,House>他真的很喜欢你
<35-6,House>And he really likes you.

860
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,210
<35-7,Nora>好吧  这真是...
<35-7,Nora>Well, it's really...

861
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,080
<35-7,Nora>就你而言这么撑你的朋友还真是不容易
<35-7,Nora>It's sweet of you to stick up for your friend like that.

862
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,160
<35-7,Nora>而你依然试着想和我睡
<35-7,Nora>And you're still trying to sleep with me.

863
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,210
<35-7,Nora>我说不定还会给他电话呢
<35-7,Nora>You know, maybe I will call him.

864
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,530
<35-7,Nora>对你而言不错吧
<35-7,Nora>It would serve you right.

865
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,130
<35-8,House>威尔森也是个混蛋
<35-8,House>Wilson's a jerk too.

866
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
<35-9,Nora>好吧  他至少试着做正确的事
<35-9,Nora>Well, at least he tried to do the right thing.

867
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,460
<35-10,House>他离了三次婚
<35-10,House>He's been divorced three times.

868
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,190
<35-10,House>和快死的病人上床
<35-10,House>He slept with a dying patient.

869
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,870
<35-10,House>的确他看上去像个童子军
<35-10,House>Sure, he looks like a boy scout,

870
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,570
<35-10,House>但其实...
<35-10,House>But then...

871
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,560
<35-10,House>那些动脉瘤
<35-10,House>The aneurysms

872
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,190
<36-1,House>看上去是霉菌性的  实际不是
<36-1,House>Look mycotic, but they're not.

873
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,830
<36-1,House>它们是炎症
<36-1,House>They're inflammatory.

874
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,300
<36-1,House>这不是真菌感染
<36-1,House>Because this is not a fungal infection.

875
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,080
<36-1,House>高血压是真的症状
<36-1,House>The hypertension was a real symptom.

876
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,060
<36-1,House>你在误打误撞地
<36-1,House>You've been unwittingly

877
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,360
<36-1,House>用贝塔阻滞剂治疗
<36-1,House>Treating it with beta blockers.

878
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,940
<36-1,House>你停药了  血压又回升了
<36-1,House>You stopped taking them,and your blood pressure went up

879
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,780
<36-3,Chase>是肺动脉栓塞综合征症
<36-3,Chase>It's hughes-stovin.

880
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,250
<36-2,Mickey>好吧  那么怎么...怎么治呢
<36-2,Mickey>Okay, so how-- how do we treat this?

881
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,020
<36-3,Chase>没有疗法
<36-3,Chase>We don't.

882
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,640
<36-3,Chase>肺动脉栓塞综合征是自体免疫病
<36-3,Chase>Hughes-stovin is an autoimmune disease.

883
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,130
<36-3,Chase>只要一恶化
<36-3,Chase>Once it's this advanced,

884
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,830
<36-3,Chase>我们就做不了什么了
<36-3,Chase>There's not much we can do.

885
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,290
<36-3,Chase>动脉瘤将持续增殖
<36-3,Chase>The aneurysms keep multiplying.

886
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,970
<36-3,Chase>最终  其中之一将会破裂
<36-3,Chase>Eventually...one of them will rupture.

887
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,140
<36-4,Mickey>你确定吗
<36-4,Mickey>Are you sure?

888
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,610
<36-5,House>要是你在第二天就死掉  我就确定了
<36-5,House>If you die in the next day or so, I will be.

889
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,180
<36-6,Thirteen>即使你把所知的一切都告诉我们
<36-6,Thirteen>Even if you had told us everything we wanted to know,

890
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,480
<36-6,Thirteen>也不会有用的
<36-6,Thirteen>It wouldn't have made a difference.

891
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,850
<36-6,Thirteen>你做了正确的事情
<36-6,Thirteen>You did the right thing.

892
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,830
<36-7,Mickey>我想通知我的妻子
<36-7,Mickey>I think I should call my wife now.

893
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,850
<37-1,Wilson>你病人的事  我很遗憾
<37-1,Wilson>I'm sorry about your patient.

894
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,650
<37-2,House>死时他自认是个英雄
<37-2,House>He died a hero in his own mind.

895
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,790
<37-2,House>我想这总比一无所有强一些
<37-2,House>Guess it's better than nothing.

896
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,770
<37-3,Wilson>在电梯里碰见诺拉了
<37-3,Wilson>Ran into Nora in the elevator.

897
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,870
<37-3,Wilson>她不觉得我们是同性恋了
<37-3,Wilson>She no longer thinks we're gay.

898
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,370
<37-3,Wilson>现在她觉得我们是骗人的混蛋
<37-3,Wilson>Now she thinks we're mendacious dirt bags.

899
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,570
<37-4,House>撒谎的混球对我来说更自然些
<37-4,House>Mendacious dirt bag comes much more naturally to me.

900
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,700
<37-4,House>至少可以把那东西扔掉了
<37-4,House>Least we can get rid of that.

901
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,370
<37-5,Wilson>我挺喜欢它呢
<37-5,Wilson>I kind of like it.

902
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,640
<37-5,Wilson>倒是挺讨厌这沙发的
<37-5,Wilson>Unlike this sofa.

903
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,210
<37-6,House>这可是500美金啊
<37-6,House>It's 500 bucks.

904
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,340
<37-6,House>还能让你躺着呢
<37-6,House>And... it reclines.

905
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,480
<37-6,House>*一个*
<37-6,House>*One*

908
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,150
<37-8,House>我要揍你脸了
<37-8,House>I will punch you in the face.

909
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,760
<37-9,Wilson>不扔沙发我就不停
<37-9,Wilson>I'll stop, if you get rid of the sofa.

910
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,390
<37-10,House>不可能
<37-10,House>No chance.

911
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,160
<37-10,House>*令人兴奋的组合*
<37-10,House>*Thrilling combination*

912
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,930

<32-7,House>*Every move that she makes*

913
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,310

<32-8,Taub>*One smile and suddenly nobody else,boom*

914
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,500
<32-9,Foreman>*将*
