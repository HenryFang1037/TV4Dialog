1
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,780
<1-1,Marcus>放下来  把他弄下来
<1-1,Marcus>Bajar lo. Get him down.

2
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,390
<1-1,Marcus>你跟小妞们有什么仇啊
<1-1,Marcus>What you got against chickens?

3
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,450
<2-1,House>因为你昨晚有个姑娘被噎到了
<2-1,House>One got choked last night, thanks to you.

4
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,680
<2-2,Cuddy>33岁男性  咳血  高烧
<2-2,Cuddy>33-year-old male with hemoptysis, fever...

5
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,010
<2-3,House>我们能谈谈吗
<2-3,House>Can't we even talk about it?

6
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,890
<2-4,Cuddy>你不道歉  就没得谈
<2-4,Cuddy>You can't apologize, we can't talk.

7
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,410
<2-4,Cuddy>他还有刺伤
<2-4,Cuddy>And puncture wounds.

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,000
<2-5,House>我不会为正确的举动向你道歉
<2-5,House>I'm not apologizing for doing the right thing.

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,210
<2-6,Cuddy>对我撒谎可不是什么正确的事
<2-6,Cuddy>Lying to me was not the right thing.

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,420
<2-6,Cuddy>刺伤是钉在十字架上造成的
<2-6,Cuddy>Puncture wounds are from a crucifixion.

33
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,640
<2-7,House>我说谎是为了救病人的命
<2-7,House>I lied to save my patient's life.

34
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,620
<2-7,House>我没骗你  我骗的是我的上司
<2-7,House>I didn't lie to you. I lied to my boss.

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,800
<2-7,House>这些解释够吗
<2-7,House>Either of those arguments working yet?

36
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,360
<2-7,House>看来我不用参加周六的婚礼了
<2-7,House>I guess that means I don't have to go to the wedding on Saturday.

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,750
<2-8,Cuddy>你是说医院董事长的婚礼吗
<2-8,Cuddy>The hospital's chairman of the board?

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,680
<2-8,Cuddy>我不会放他鸽子  你也不会
<2-8,Cuddy>I'm not gonna stand him up, and neither are you.

39
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,890
<2-9,House>我讨厌死婚礼了
<2-9,House>I loathe weddings

40
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,810
<2-9,House>还有人们的各种伪善面目
<2-9,House>and their seven levels of hypocrisy.

41
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,620
<2-9,House>不过似乎你真生我气了
<2-9,House>But you do seem awfully hissy.

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,090
<2-9,House>再说能把你灌醉再成功得逞的机会
<2-9,House>And there's an outside chance

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,010
<2-9,House>可是千载难逢
<2-9,House>that I could get you drunk and score.

44
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,330
<2-9,House>只要你别认为这是我在认错
<2-9,House>So as long as you don't take it as an admission of guilt,

45
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,580
<2-9,House>那行  我去
<2-9,House>sure, count me in.

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,630
<2-9,House>一不小心真相了
<2-9,House>A bit too much honesty?

47
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,060
<2-10,Cuddy>周五晚的婚礼彩排你也得去
<2-10,Cuddy>You're also going to the rehearsal dinner Friday night.

48
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,440
<2-10,Cuddy>别穿太正式了
<2-10,Cuddy>Dressy casual.

49
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,170
<3-1,House>客房服务
<3-1,House>Housekeeping.

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,810
<3-1,House>要么是你疯了
<3-1,House>Either you're crazy

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,380
<3-1,House>要么是你在赎罪
<3-1,House>or you're atoning for something naughty

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
<3-1,House>而且还疯了
<3-1,House>and you're crazy.

53
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,630
<3-2,Masters>他是医生
<3-2,Masters>He's a doctor.

54
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,690
<3-3,Ramon>我没在赎罪
<3-3,Ramon>I'm not atoning for anything.

55
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,310
<3-4,House>看来你是疯了  多谢
<3-4,House>That answers that. Thanks.

56
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,210
<3-5,Ramon>我女儿玛丽莎被确诊为脑癌晚期
<3-5,Ramon>My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

57
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,000
<3-5,Ramon>第四阶段恶性胶质瘤
<3-5,Ramon>Stage iv glioblastoma.

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,290
<3-5,Ramon>当医生说她还能活两个月时
<3-5,Ramon>When the doctors said she had two months to live,

59
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,300
<3-5,Ramon>我决定要作笔交易
<3-5,Ramon>that's when I made my bargain.

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,240
<3-6,House>跟你的医疗保险公司吗
<3-6,House>With your health insurance carrier?

61
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,770
<3-7,Ramon>是跟上帝
<3-7,Ramon>With god.

62
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,170
<3-8,House>-对哦  -我告诉他
<3-8,House>- Oh. - I told him

63
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,360
<3-9,Ramon>我将每年把自己钉在十字架上
<3-9,Ramon>I would nail myself to a cross every year

64
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,820
<3-9,Ramon>只要他让她活下去
<3-9,Ramon>he kept her alive.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,410
<3-10,House>协商结果如何
<3-10,House>How did that negotiation go?

66
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,310
<3-10,House>难道上帝同意让你换成打耳洞了
<3-10,House>You lowballed with ear piercing and god countered?

67
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,600
<3-11,Ramon>三周以后
<3-11,Ramon>Three weeks later,

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,130
<3-11,Ramon>她痊愈了
<3-11,Ramon>she was cancer-free.

69
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,470
<3-11,Ramon>这是四年前的事了
<3-11,Ramon>And that was four years ago.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,100
<3-12,House>彼拉多  多么伟大的肿瘤学家啊
<3-12,House>Pontius Pilate-- misunderstood oncologist.

72
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,360
<3-13,Ramon>我前妻也以为我疯了
<3-13,Ramon>My ex-wife thinks I'm crazy too.

73
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,080
<3-13,Ramon>我第一次这么干时她就搬走了
<3-13,Ramon>She moved out the first time I did this.

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,700
<3-14,House>至少你女儿还有个神智清醒的榜样在
<3-14,House>Well, at least your daughter has one viable role model.

75
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,810
<3-15,Marisa>你不信仰上帝吗
<3-15,Marisa>You don't believe in god?

76
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,420
<3-16,House>信啊  所以我长了卷发
<3-16,House>I did. Then I grew my curly hairs.

77
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,950
<3-17,Marisa>那你以为我是怎么痊愈的
<3-17,Marisa>So how do you think I was cured?

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,970
<3-18,House>或许一开始就是个误诊
<3-18,House>Maybe you were misdiagnosed in the first place.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,590
<3-19,Ramon>你们自有说法  医生
<3-19,Ramon>You have your answer, doctors.

80
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,470
<3-19,Ramon>但我们依然信仰上帝
<3-19,Ramon>We have ours.

81
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,650
<3-20,House>宿命论认为
<3-20,House>Causal determinism.

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,450
<3-20,House>人生来就渴求得到答案
<3-20,House>We are hardwired to need answers.

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,150
<3-20,House>听到灌木丛里的沙沙声
<3-20,House>The cave man who heard a rustle in the bushes

84
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,140
<3-20,House>而外出查看的洞人
<3-20,House>checked out to see what it was

85
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,780
<3-20,House>比假设那只是阵风的洞人要活得久
<3-20,House>lived longer than the guy who assumed it was just a breeze.

86
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,740
<3-20,House>问题是  当我们无法找到合理的解释时
<3-20,House>The problem is, when we don't find a logical answer,

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,150
<3-20,House>就会找个蹩脚的糊弄自己
<3-20,House>we settle for a stupid one.

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,770
<3-20,House>宗教仪式就是我们丧失理智的产物
<3-20,House>Ritual is what happens when we run out of rational.

89
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,160
<3-21,Chase>要是你嘲讽完了  我们要准备做腰椎穿刺了
<3-21,Chase>If you're done mocking him, we need to prep for an lp.

90
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,860
<3-22,House>很好  多戳个洞  能让上帝更高兴
<3-22,House>Good. Another hole in him should really make god's day.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,220
<3-22,House>你怎么迟到了
<3-22,House>Why are you late?

92
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,200
<4-1,House>要到明年一月你才见牙医
<4-1,House>Your next dental appointment isn't till January,

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,690
<4-1,House>八天前又刚见过你的全科医生
<4-1,House>and you just saw your GP eight days ago.

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,440
<4-1,House>你觉得一个患第四阶段恶性胶质瘤的八岁小孩
<4-1,House>You think stage iv glioblastoma in an eight-year-old

95
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,120
<4-5,Wilson>能在三周内痊愈吗
<4-5,Wilson>could disappear in three weeks?

96
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,220
<4-2,Wilson>我轮胎没气了  你的病人得癌症了吗
<4-2,Wilson>I had a flat tire. Your patient has cancer?

97
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,920
<4-3,House>你的轮胎还没跑够五千英里呢
<4-3,House>Your tires got less than 5,000 miles on them.

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,970
<4-3,House>我的病人没有  他女儿也没有
<4-3,House>No, and neither does my patient's daughter.

99
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,090
<4-4,Wilson>在工地附近
<4-4,Wilson>I hit a piece of rebar

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,090
<4-4,Wilson>我压到了一条钢筋
<4-4,Wilson>near a construction site.

101
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,130
<4-5,Wilson>三周以内吗
<4-5,Wilson>In three weeks?

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,420
<4-5,Wilson>极度不可能
<4-5,Wilson>It's highly unlikely.

103
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,260
<4-6,House>你家到这的路上可没什么工地
<4-6,House>There's no construction site between here and your home.

104
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,370
<4-6,House>我也觉得  我想是囊肿被误诊了
<4-6,House>I agree. I think it was a misdiagnosed cyst.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,910
<4-7,Wilson>但从干洗店到这里的路上有
<4-7,Wilson>But there is one between here and my dry cleaner.

106
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,150
<4-7,Wilson>可能是误诊
<4-7,Wilson>It could be a misdiagnosis,

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
<4-7,Wilson>也可能是自然痊愈
<4-7,Wilson>or it could be spontaneous remission.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,840
<4-7,Wilson>但
<4-7,Wilson>But...

109
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,000
<4-7,Wilson>我有什么好骗你的
<4-7,Wilson>Why would I lie about this?

110
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,090
<4-8,House>我还不知道
<4-8,House>I don't know yet.

111
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,030
<4-8,House>但要在平时你早把领带一起干洗了
<4-8,House>But you would have dropped off your tie.

112
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,270
<4-8,House>上面有芥末渍
<4-8,House>It's got a mustard stain.

113
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,670
<4-9,Wilson>我去买订婚戒指了
<4-9,Wilson>I was buying an engagement ring.

114
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,550
<4-9,Wilson>我打算在婚礼上向萨姆求婚
<4-9,Wilson>I'm gonna propose to Sam at the wedding.

115
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,880
<4-10,House>这是我今天听到第二蠢的决定
<4-10,House>That is the second stupidest thing I've heard today.

116
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,400
<4-10,House>想不到你离第一蠢也不远了
<4-10,House>And I'm surprised how close you came.

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,910
<4-10,House>用不着买个新戒指
<4-10,House>You don't need to buy her a new ring.

118
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,930
<4-10,House>第一次的婚戒就足够用了
<4-10,House>Isn't the first one good for all you can marry?

119
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,180
<4-11,Wilson>你大概还没跟卡迪道歉吧
<4-11,Wilson>I assume you haven't apologized to Cuddy yet.

120
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,690
<4-11,Wilson>看来你的愚蠢也需要时间让你清醒
<4-11,Wilson>Your stupidity demands equal time.

121
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,180
<4-12,House>没什么好道歉的
<4-12,House>Nothing to apologize for.

122
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,760
<4-13,Wilson>那就假装跟她道歉
<4-13,Wilson>Pretend to apologize.

123
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,740
<4-14,House>你要我说谎吗
<4-14,House>You want me to lie?

124
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,940
<4-15,Wilson>说谎有可爱的两面性
<4-15,Wilson>There's a lovely symmetry to it.

125
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,860
<4-15,Wilson>说谎能让你陷入麻烦
<4-15,Wilson>The lie got you into it.

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,950
<4-15,Wilson>也能让你摆脱麻烦
<4-15,Wilson>A lie gets you out of it.

127
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,470
<4-16,House>每个人都说谎
<4-16,House>Everybody lies.

128
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,800
<4-16,House>我保证卡迪
<4-16,House>I'm sure Cuddy...

129
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,910
<4-17,House>只要给她这么个机会
<4-17,House>Just need to give her a chance.

130
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,340
<4-18,Wilson>是啊  我还真就是这个意思
<4-18,Wilson>Yeah, that must have been what I meant.

131
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,080
<5-1,Foreman>有人见过准新娘了吗
<5-1,Foreman>Have you seen the bride-to-be?

132
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,880
<5-2,Chase>美妞一个  年纪小他一半
<5-2,Chase>Gorgeous woman half his age.

133
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,560
<5-2,Chase>幸运男
<5-2,Chase>He's a lucky guy.

134
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,890
<5-3,Foreman>暂且算是吧
<5-3,Foreman>Yeah, for a while.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,870
<5-4,Masters>我父亲比我母亲大19岁
<5-4,Masters>My father's 19 years older than my mother,

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
<5-4,Masters>他们幸福得共度了32年
<5-4,Masters>and they've been happily married for 32 years.

137
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,520
<5-5,Foreman>我猜你爸爸不在福布斯财富榜上
<5-5,Foreman>I'm guessing your dad wasn't on the Forbes 400

138
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,190
<5-5,Foreman>你妈妈看着也不像泳装模特吧
<5-5,Foreman>and your mom didn't look like a swimsuit model.

139
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,760
<5-5,Foreman>抱歉  这话不太合适
<5-5,Foreman>Sorry. That didn't come out right.

140
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,300
<5-6,Masters>我父亲是哥伦比亚大学的古典学教授
<5-6,Masters>My father was the classics chair at Columbia,

141
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,900
<5-6,Masters>我母亲是他的学生
<5-6,Masters>and my mother was his student.

142
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,340
<5-6,Masters>他的漂亮学生
<5-6,Masters>His gorgeous student.

143
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,240
<5-7,Taub>如果有人拿着手机
<5-7,Taub>What's it mean when somebody takes

144
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,490
<5-7,Taub>进浴室洗澡
<5-7,Taub>their cell phone into the bathroom

145
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,050
<5-7,Taub>说明什么
<5-7,Taub>when they're taking a shower?

146
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,050
<5-8,Foreman>以防有人查他们的通话记录  电邮和短信
<5-8,Foreman>It means they don't want you to check their calls, emails, or texts.

147
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,820
<5-9,Chase>如果我们说的是你老婆
<5-9,Chase>If we're talking about your wife,

148
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,960
<5-9,Chase>说明你是恶有恶报
<5-9,Chase>it means the chickens are coming home to roost.

149
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,360
<5-10,Chase>陶博出过轨
<5-10,Chase>Taub has been known to dabble.

150
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,170
<5-10,Chase>曾经
<5-10,Chase>Used to be.

151
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,700
<5-11,Masters>可能只是生活习惯
<5-11,Masters>Maybe it's just a habit.

152
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,690
<5-11,Masters>我就是这样的  我一个人住
<5-11,Masters>I do that with my cell phone, and I live alone.

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,190
<5-12,Taub>她今天1:30有个会议
<5-12,Taub>She has a meeting today at 1:30.

154
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,590
<5-12,Taub>地点在旅馆
<5-12,Taub>At a hotel.

155
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,050
<5-13,Master>那我同意奇斯的说法
<5-13,Master>I'm gonna go with the chicken thing.

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,030
<5-13,Master>不是弓蛔虫  类杆菌
<5-13,Master>Negative for toxocara, Bacteroides,

157
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,720
<5-13,Master>蛔虫  什么都不是
<5-13,Master>Ascaris, everything.

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,060
<5-14,Chase>那是什么看似感染
<5-14,Chase>So what looks like an infection

159
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,400
<5-14,Chase>而测试结果不是呢
<5-14,Chase>but doesn't test like one?

160
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,830
<5-15,Taub>动物
<5-15,Taub>Animals.

161
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,770
<5-16,Chase>我肯定你老婆见的是男人
<5-16,Chase>I'm sure your wife's just seeing a dude.

<5-17,Taub>Card's in the file.

164

<5-17,Taub>负责搭建马厩  谷仓和摊位
<5-17,Taub>Specializing in stables, barns, and stalls.

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,640
<5-17,Taub>他工作中能接触到动物  是马红球菌
<5-17,Taub>He works around animals. Rhodococcus equi.

166
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,650
<5-18,Chase>要么这家伙真睡马槽里
<5-18,Chase>Unless this guy's sleeping in the manger...

167
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,130
<5-19,Taub>要么就是他曾有过开放伤
<5-19,Taub>Or has a history of open wounds.

168
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,920
<6-1,Taub>我们认为你感染了马红球菌
<6-1,Taub>We think you have rhodococcus equi,

169
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,960
<6-1,Taub>常感染马

<6-1,Taub>人类中很罕见
<6-1,Taub>It's pretty rare in humans,

171
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,080
<6-1,Taub>但用抗生素很容易治愈
<6-1,Taub>but easily treatable with antibiotics.

172
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,030
<6-2,Ramon>会导致牙齿脱落吗
<6-2,Ramon>Does it make your teeth fall out?

173
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,830
<6-3,Chase>不会
<6-3,Chase>No.

174
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,190
<6-4,Chase>那说明我们保不齐又搞错了
<6-4,Chase>Then again, maybe we were wrong.

175
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,700
<6-4,Chase>发热  咳血
<6-4,Chase>Fever, coughing up blood,

176

<6-4,Chase>coughing up teeth.

177
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,450

<7-1,House>So either God sweetened the deal

<7-2,Taub>Radiation sickness.

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,960
<7-3,Chase>是啊  没准那木匠造了个微波炉呢
<7-3,Chase>Yeah, maybe the carpenter builds microwave ovens.

181
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,140
<7-4,Masters>卡波氏肉瘤
<7-4,Masters>Kaposi's sarcoma?

182
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,640
<7-5,Foreman>未见皮肤损伤
<7-5,Foreman>No skin lesions.

183

<7-6,Chase>Canned tuna, sushi, lead paint.

185
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,160
<7-7,House>就它了  去他家搜查一下
<7-7,House>Heavy metal it is. Do a home search

186
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,460
<7-7,House>周边探查一下
<7-7,House>and a peripheral smear.

187
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,140
<7-8,Taub>去不了  我有点私事要去办
<7-8,Taub>I can't. I have a personal errand to run.

188
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,580
<7-9,House>想去抓你老婆的奸夫吗
<7-9,House>Trying to catch your wife cheating?

189
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,290
<7-10,Taub>你何出此言
<7-10,Taub>Oh... Why would you say that?

190
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,310
<7-11,House>光环暗淡
<7-11,House>Missing mojo.

191
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,160
<7-11,House>气势低落
<7-11,House>Posture's slumped.

192
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,370
<7-11,House>情绪萎靡
<7-11,House>Expression defeated.

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,120
<7-11,House>懒得据理力争
<7-11,House>Didn't try to back up your theory.

194
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,810
<7-11,House>而且奇斯告密
<7-11,House>And Chase told me.

195
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,260
<7-11,House>去吧  把光环找回来
<7-11,House>Go. Find your mojo.

196
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,600
<8-1,House>售货小姐  我需要一份病历
<8-1,House>Shopkeeper? I need a patient file.

197
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,560
<8-2,Cuddy>去档案科找
<8-2,Cuddy>Ask records.

198
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,790
<8-3,House>不是我们的病人
<8-3,House>Not one of our patients.

199
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,120
<8-3,House>是我病人的女儿
<8-3,House>My patient's daughter.

200
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,050
<8-4,Cuddy>找你病人要
<8-4,Cuddy>Ask your patient.

201
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,120
<8-5,House>他觉得我的目的是拆穿他的信仰
<8-5,House>He thinks I only want it to debunk his faith.

202
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,780
<8-6,Cuddy>他为什么这么想
<8-6,Cuddy>And why would he think that?

203
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,030
<8-7,House>因为这蠢蛋眼力倒挺好
<8-7,House>Because he's strangely perceptive for an idiot.

204
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,570
<8-8,Cuddy>莫非我要为了让你高兴
<8-8,Cuddy>And I'm going to violate patient privacy laws

205
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,720
<8-8,Cuddy>而违反医患保密条例吗
<8-8,Cuddy>just to keep you happy?

206
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,440
<8-9,House>我好  你也好嘛
<8-9,House>You keep me happy, I return the favor.

207
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,900
<8-9,House>我必将涌泉相报
<8-9,House>Think of it as tat for tit.

208
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,050
<8-10,Cuddy>工作场所
<8-10,Cuddy>When we're at work,

209
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,010
<8-10,Cuddy>只谈工作  不谈其他
<8-10,Cuddy>we need to focus on our work thoughts.

210
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,300
<8-10,Cuddy>你干嘛穿成这样
<8-10,Cuddy>Why are you wearing that?

211
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,720
<8-11,House>我休闲装就这样
<8-11,House>It's my dressy casual.

212
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,630
<8-11,House>觉得怎样
<8-11,House>What do you think?

213
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,520
<8-12,Cuddy>看起来像威尔森
<8-12,Cuddy>You look like Wilson.

214
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,960
<8-12,Cuddy>很诡异
<8-12,Cuddy>It looks weird.

215
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,150
<8-12,Cuddy>你明知道我的看法
<8-12,Cuddy>Well, you knew I'd think that.

216
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,380
<8-12,Cuddy>倒是你失望的神情让我很是好奇
<8-12,Cuddy>which makes me wonder why you look disappointed.

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,670
<8-13,House>你伤害了我  我还一笑而过么
<8-13,House>If you prick me, do I not bleed?

218
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,850
<8-14,Cuddy>你明知我不会喜欢  可你觉得我会谎称喜欢
<8-14,Cuddy>You knew I wouldn't like it, but you thought i would say I did.

219
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,410
<8-14,Cuddy>原来你在琢磨这个
<8-14,Cuddy>That's what this is about.

220
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,260
<8-14,Cuddy>你想骗我撒谎
<8-14,Cuddy>You're trying to trap me into lying to you.

221
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,470
<8-15,House>是吗  听起来好幼稚
<8-15,House>You sure? 'cause that sounds so juvenile.

222
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,580
<9-1,Chase>不排斥擅闯民宅了吗
<9-1,Chase>You're okay with burglary now?

223
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,240
<9-2,Masters>我请求过许可了
<9-2,Masters>I asked his permission.

224
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,450
<9-2,Masters>我们以前不请求许可
<9-2,Masters>The reason we don't ask permission

225
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,110
<9-2,Masters>是因为害怕病人有所隐瞒
<9-2,Masters>is we're afraid the patient is going

226
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,660
<9-2,Masters>可这位病人不住家  独居
<9-2,Masters>to hide something, but our patient hasn't been home, lives alone.

227
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,640
<9-2,Masters>无依无靠
<9-2,Masters>He doesn't have any help,

228
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,010
<9-2,Masters>没有隐藏的动机
<9-2,Masters>and he has no motive to hide anything.

229
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,870
<9-3,Chase>你问他拿钥匙没有
<9-3,Chase>Did you ask for his key too?

230
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,550
<9-4,Masters>他没有
<9-4,Masters>Oh, doesn't have one.

231
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,610
<9-5,Chase>明白原因了
<9-5,Chase>And now we know why.

232
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,760
<9-5,Chase>你觉得他是疯子吗
<9-5,Chase>You think he's crazy?

233
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,140
<9-6,Masters>不是疯子能自己上十字架嘛
<9-6,Masters>Crucifixion's pretty convincing evidence.

234
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,860
<9-6,Masters>有白铅漆吗
<9-6,Masters>Lead paint?

235
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,730
<9-7,Chase>这房子太新了
<9-7,Chase>The place is too new.

236
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,350
<9-7,Chase>他相信超自然力量会影响他的生活
<9-7,Chase>He believes in a higher power that can affect his life.

237
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,640
<9-7,Chase>这点上与其他人无异
<9-7,Chase>Like most people on the planet.

238
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,740
<9-8,Masters>没错  但另一方面  却自虐至此
<9-8,Masters>True. On the other hand, crucified himself.

239
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,310
<9-9,Chase>没有罐头金枪鱼
<9-9,Chase>No canned tuna.

240
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,970
<9-9,Chase>看起来寿司也不大可能
<9-9,Chase>And I don't think we have to worry about sushi.

241
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,960
<9-10,Masters>没电脑  没电视
<9-10,Masters>No computer. No television.

242
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,020
<9-10,Masters>没音乐  他平时都干嘛
<9-10,Masters>No music. What does he do?

243
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,850
<9-11,Chase>看书
<9-11,Chase>He reads.

244
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,460
<9-11,Chase>已经证明  祈祷有助于恢复
<9-11,Chase>Prayer's been proven to aid recovery.

245
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,930
<9-12,Masters>只有当他知道有人为他祈祷才管用
<9-12,Masters>Only if the person knows they're being prayed for.

246
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,810
<9-12,Masters>也就是说客观上无用
<9-12,Masters>Means there's no objective effect.

247
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,480
<9-13,Chase>信仰本由心生
<9-13,Chase>So faith comes from within.

248
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,380
<9-13,Chase>也不是什么稀奇事
<9-13,Chase>Not exactly a newsflash.

249
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,840
<9-14,Masters>看来忧国忧民确实催人消瘦
<9-14,Masters>I guess worry is good for the waistline.

250
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,100
<9-15,Chase>不是忧虑所致
<9-15,Chase>It's not worry.

251
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,700
<9-15,Chase>是饥饿
<9-15,Chase>It's starvation.

252
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,050
<9-15,Chase>他的牙齿脱落
<9-15,Chase>His tooth didn't fall out

253
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,240
<9-15,Chase>不是因为重金属中毒
<9-15,Chase>because of heavy metal poisoning.

254
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,850
<9-15,Chase>是由于营养不良
<9-15,Chase>It fell out because of malnutrition.

255
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,660
<9-16,Masters>他确实感染了马红球菌
<9-16,Masters>He does have rhodococcus equi.

256
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,050
<9-17,Chase>陶博是对的
<9-17,Chase>Taub was right.

257
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,070
<9-17,Chase>只是原因不明而已
<9-17,Chase>He just didn't know why.

258
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,430
<10-1,House>锁上了
<10-1,House>It's locked.

259
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,170
<10-2,Wilson>我很忙
<10-2,Wilson>I'm busy!

260
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,300
<10-3,House>我等着
<10-3,House>I'll wait.

261
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,610
<10-4,Wilson>我真的很忙
<10-4,Wilson>I really am busy.

262
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,860
<10-5,House>卡迪给我找来了女儿的病历
<10-5,House>Cuddy got me the daughter's file.

263
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,610
<10-5,House>倒不是她本人  签名而已
<10-5,House>Well, not Cuddy exactly. Her signature.

264
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,860
<10-5,House>倒也不是她本人签名
<10-5,House>Well, not exactly her signature.

265
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,570
<10-6,Wilson>你又扯谎
<10-6,Wilson>Another lie?

266
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,180
<10-7,House>想来找你帮忙看看
<10-7,House>Thought you could take a look at it for me.

267
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,320
<10-8,Wilson>你没听清吗  我很忙
<10-8,Wilson>Maybe you hadn't heard. I'm kind of busy.

268
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,550
<10-9,House>忙啥
<10-9,House>With what?

269
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,350
<10-10,Wilson>数独  你以为呢
<10-10,Wilson>Sudoku. What do you think?

270
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,650
<10-10,Wilson>我作为一家大医院的肿瘤科主管
<10-10,Wilson>I'm the head of oncology at a major hospital.

271
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,030
<10-11,House>可是  这些病历并非来自本院
<10-11,House>And yet these files are not from this hospital.

272
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,710
<10-11,House>这是从准老婆纪念医院弄来的
<10-11,House>These are from where-my-fiancee-works memorial.

273
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,530
<10-12,Wilson>萨姆的老板要用她的所有病历
<10-12,Wilson>Sam's boss is doing a clinical review

274
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,770
<10-12,Wilson>做一个临床综述
<10-12,Wilson>of all of her files,

275
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,860
<10-12,Wilson>她只是想在他周一开工前
<10-12,Wilson>And she just wanted to make sure

276
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,200
<10-12,Wilson>把东西整理出一个头绪来
<10-12,Wilson>everything was in order before he starts on monday.

277
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,950
<10-13,House>难怪她忙得没时间帮我看病历
<10-13,House>Which explains why Sam is too busy to look at my file.

278
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,780
<10-14,Wilson>我要是不帮她  她就去不了婚礼
<10-14,Wilson>If I don't help her, she can't go to the wedding and...

279
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,390
<10-14,Wilson>我们在她表亲的婚礼上相爱
<10-14,Wilson>We fell in love at her cousin's wedding,

280
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,930
<10-14,Wilson>所以我想在婚礼上向她求婚
<10-14,Wilson>which is why I want to propose to her at a wedding.

281
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,150
<10-14,Wilson>我现在给你一分钟时间
<10-14,Wilson>And now you have 60 seconds

282
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,280
<10-14,Wilson>对我这一行为以及帮老婆做作业这事儿
<10-14,Wilson>to berate me for that and for helping my girlfriend

283
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,790
<10-14,Wilson>尽情吐槽
<10-14,Wilson>with her homework.

284
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,280
<10-15,House>可千万别在婚礼上求婚
<10-15,House>You don't want to propose at a wedding.

285
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,900
<10-15,House>大家都情绪高涨  人都疯了似的
<10-15,House>Emotions running high, people on edge.

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,940
<10-15,House>你应该去个佛家寺庙之类的地方
<10-15,House>You ought to try somewhere like a buddhist temple

287
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,740
<10-15,House>水族馆也行
<10-15,House>or an aquarium.

288
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,040
<10-15,House>或者佛家水族馆
<10-15,House>Or a buddhist aquarium.

289
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,310
<10-15,House>十秒搞定
<10-15,House>That only took ten seconds.

290
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,790
<10-15,House>省下的时间你可以帮我看病历了
<10-15,House>You can spend the rest of the time on my file.

291
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,200
<11-1,Taub>瑞秋
<11-1,Taub>Rachel?

292
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,250
<11-2,Taub>还有多久到家
<11-2,Taub>Hey. How long before you're home?

293
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,210

<11-3,Rachel>Not long.

294
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,490
<11-4,Taub>你电脑忘关了
<11-4,Taub>Uh, you left your laptop on.

295
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,720
<11-5,Rachel>我今天看到你了
<11-5,Rachel>Saw you today.

296
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,670
<11-5,Rachel>在宾馆那边
<11-5,Rachel>At the hotel.

297
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,970
<11-5,Rachel>你是去查岗吗
<11-5,Rachel>Were you checking up on me?

298
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,820
<11-6,Taub>对

302
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,700
<11-10,Taub>就这样
<11-10,Taub>That's it?

303
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,950
<11-11,Rachel>你都说了满意了
<11-11,Rachel>You said you're satisfied.

304
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,850
<11-11,Rachel>不就行了嘛
<11-11,Rachel>It's enough.

305
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,230
<11-12,Taub>你不好奇我为什么这样吗
<11-12,Taub>You're not wondering why it started.

306
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,150
<11-12,Taub>貌似你不想让我谈起这事
<11-12,Taub>That makes me think you don't want to talk about this,

307
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,580
<11-12,Taub>这不禁让我觉得
<11-12,Taub>which makes me think...

308
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,840
<11-13,Rachel>你太多疑了
<11-13,Rachel>You're being paranoid.

309
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,230
<11-14,Taub>你今天早上洗澡的时候
<11-14,Taub>You took your cell phone with you into the bathroom

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,950

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,670
<12-1,Masters>为什么不告诉我们你在刻意节食
<12-1,Masters>Why didn't you tell us you were starving yourself?

319
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,090
<12-2,Ramon>我不是故意的
<12-2,Ramon>Well, I wasn't trying to.

320
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,360
<12-2,Ramon>我现在手头很紧  而且这食量也过得去
<12-2,Ramon>I'm on a tight budget, and it seemed like an okay diet.

326
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,540
<12-7,Masters>那你为什么还笑
<12-7,Masters>Then why are you smiling?

327
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,960
<12-8,Ramon>我没笑
<12-8,Ramon>I'm not smiling.

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,400
<13-9,House>我觉得你触怒他了
<13-9,House>I think you offended him.

348
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,500
<13-10,Taub>你是说病人的宗教极端主义
<13-10,Taub>You're saying the patient's religious extremism

349
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,730

<14-4,House>and somebody else wants to make a very big deal of it.

360
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,850
<14-5,Cuddy>是四十三
<14-5,Cuddy>4-3.

361
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,080
<14-5,Cuddy>四十三

362
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,110
<14-6,House>-你确定吗  -相当确定
<14-6,House>- Are you sure? - Very.

363
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,200
<14-7,Cuddy>我怎么会犯这种错误
<14-7,Cuddy>How could I make such a mistake?

364
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,740
<14-8,House>我可看过你的人事档案啊
<14-8,House>In reading your H.R. file?

<14-8,House>不  等等  我没看错

366
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,550
<14-8,House>于是  平地一声惊雷
<14-8,House>And boom goes the dynamite.

367
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,930
<14-8,House>说谎比分持平  咱们两不相欠了
<14-8,House>Scores are tied. We are even steven.

368
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,950
<14-8,House>你说得不错
<14-8,House>You're right.

369
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,380
<14-9,Cuddy>我确实撒谎了  骗的是人事处不是你
<14-9,Cuddy>I did lie. To H.R. not to you.

370
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,960
<14-9,Cuddy>我最初申请副院长职务的时候
<14-9,Cuddy>When I first applied for the VP admin job,

371
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,750
<14-9,Cuddy>才二十九岁
<14-9,Cuddy>I was 29 years old.

372
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,330
<14-9,Cuddy>我想要是自己刚好三十出头
<14-9,Cuddy>I knew I would be taken more seriously

373
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,910
<14-9,Cuddy>别人肯定会更把我当回事儿
<14-9,Cuddy>if I were in my first 30s,

374
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,600
<14-9,Cuddy>所以我虚报了两岁
<14-9,Cuddy>so I added two years to my age.

375
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,960
<14-10,House>你为了让自己变老而撒谎吗
<14-10,House>You lied to make yourself older?

376
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,150
<14-10,House>莫非你还是个伪娘
<14-10,House>Are you lying about being a woman?

377
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,260
<14-11,Cuddy>就算我中了你的套
<14-11,Cuddy>Even if you can trap me,

378
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,030
<14-11,Cuddy>你觉得我会突然对说谎大加赞赏吗
<14-11,Cuddy>you think I'll suddenly embrace the value of lying?

379
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,560
<14-12,House>我想说的是你早就撒过谎
<14-12,House>My point is you already have.

380
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,360
<14-12,House>我只是需要证明这点
<14-12,House>I just need to prove it.

381
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,930
<15-1,Taub>不是恶有恶报
<15-1,Taub>Chickens aren't roosting.

382
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,470
<15-1,Taub>她只是交了个朋友
<15-1,Taub>She's just got a friend.

383
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,970
<15-1,Taub>在网上配偶出轨互助小组认识了一个男的
<15-1,Taub>A guy she met in an online support group for cheating spouses.

384
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,850
<15-2,Chase>我听说过那个小组
<15-2,Chase>I've heard of that group.

385
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,020
<15-2,Chase>名叫世事讽刺
<15-2,Chase>It's called irony.

386
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,780
<15-3,Taub>你觉得她正背着你
<15-3,Taub>You think she's cheating on her spouse

387
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,900
<15-3,Taub>和那个在互助小组认识的人交往吗
<15-3,Taub>with someone from a cheating spouse support group?

388
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,550
<15-4,Chase>听来像是钓到脆弱女人的好地方
<15-4,Chase>Sounds like the perfect place to hit on vulnerable women.

389
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,150
<15-5,Masters>看  多重高密度损伤
<15-5,Masters>Look. Multiple dense lesions.

390
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,060
<15-6,Chase>看上去像是多发性硬化
<15-6,Chase>It looks like M.S.

391
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,630
<15-7,Masters>我们怎会漏掉多发性硬化呢
<15-7,Masters>How did we miss M.S.?

392
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,860
<15-8,Chase>被之前营养不良掩盖了症状
<15-8,Chase>It was hiding behind the malnutrition.

393
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,270
<15-8,Chase>多发性硬化攻击免疫系统
<15-8,Chase>M.S. attacks the immune system.

394
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,710
<15-8,Chase>免疫缺陷  就没有症状
<15-8,Chase>No system, no symptoms.

395
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,130
<15-9,Taub>而我们现在给他吃的  使两种症状并现了
<15-9,Taub>And now we're feeding him, so they're both back.

396
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,970
<16-1,House>你感觉怎样
<16-1,House>How are you feeling?

397
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,360
<16-2,Ramon>糟透了
<16-2,Ramon>Terrible.

398
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
<16-3,House>看得出来
<16-3,House>Obviously.

399
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,840
<16-3,House>你的朋友们呢
<16-3,House>Where are your friends?

401
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,220
<16-3,House>还在"为你的里衣拈阄"吗
<16-3,House>Still casting lots for your clothes?

402
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,050
<16-4,Ramon>我只求他们为我祈祷
<16-4,Ramon>All I ask is that they pray for me.

403
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,360
<16-5,House>总是舍己为人
<16-5,House>Always sacrificing.

404
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,800
<16-5,House>真是鼓舞人心
<16-5,House>Very inspirational.

405
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,140
<16-5,House>你的颞叶区出现病变
<16-5,House>The lesions are in your temporal lobes.

406
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,350
<16-5,House>当这些区域变得紊乱时
<16-5,House>When those areas get messed with,

407
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,660
<16-5,House>人们就会感受到一些离奇的经历
<16-5,House>people have strange experiences--

408
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,900
<16-5,House>比如鬼怪附身  被外星人绑架  穿越
<16-5,House>like hauntings, alien abductions, past lives.

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,640
<16-5,House>和上帝做交易也算吗
<16-5,House>Deals with god?

410
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,970
<16-6,Ramon>你不是来看我病情有没有好转的
<16-6,Ramon>You didn't come to see if I was better.

411
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,320
<16-6,Ramon>而是来看药物是否能把我变成个无神论者
<16-6,Ramon>You came to see if your medicine has turned me into an atheist.

412
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,920
<16-7,House>变成不可知论者我也认了
<16-7,House>I'd settle for agnostic.

413
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,610
<16-8,Ramon>有信仰不是一种病
<16-8,Ramon>Faith is not a disease.

414
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,810
<16-9,House>不 当然不是
<16-9,House>No, of course not.

415
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,940
<16-9,House>但从另一方面来说  它会传染
<16-9,House>On the other hand, it is communicable,

416
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,510
<16-9,House>而且害死过很多人
<16-9,House>and it kills a lot of people.

417
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,450
<16-10,Ramon>我胳膊不能动了
<16-10,Ramon>I can't move my arm.

418
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,620
<16-11,House>有感觉吗
<16-11,House>You feel that?

419
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,300
<16-12,House>看来你的朋友们祈祷得还不够
<16-12,House>Your friends are not praying hard enough.

420
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,830
<17-1,Chase>不是多发性硬化
<17-1,Chase>It's not M.S.

421
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,770
<17-2,Foreman>麻痹是多发性硬化的症状之一
<17-2,Foreman>Paralysis is a symptom of M.S.A

422
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,950
<17-2,Foreman>腿疼和假性延髓病感染也是
<17-2,Foreman>So are leg pain and pseudobulbar affect.

423
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,430
<17-3,Chase>他用了强的松后病情恶化了
<17-3,Chase>He's getting worse on the prednisone.

424
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,940
<17-1,Chase>不是多发性硬化
<17-1,Chase>It's not M.S.

425
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,950
<17-4,Taub>核磁共振结果也一目了然
<17-4,Taub>The MRI was clear.

426
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,470
<17-4,Taub>他脑组织有病变
<17-4,Taub>He has lesions.

427
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,210
<17-5,Masters>可能是血管畸形  脑梗塞
<17-5,Masters>Could be an AVM, cerebral infarction.

428
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,610
<17-6,House>举手表决吧
<17-6,House>Let's put it to the vote.

429
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,630
<17-6,House>背心还是腰带
<17-6,House>Vest or cummerbund?

430
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,040
<17-7,Masters>腰带
<17-7,Masters>Cummerbund.

431
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,650
<17-8,House>你真了解我
<17-8,House>You know me.

432
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,710
<17-8,House>我反驳不了你们中的任何一位
<17-8,House>I can't say no to any of you guys.

433
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,650
<17-8,House>你们说的都对
<17-8,House>You're all correct.

434
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,840
<17-8,House>他是得了多发性硬化
<17-8,House>He has M.S.

435
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,380
<17-8,House>但不是友好的邻家大叔型
<17-8,House>But not the friendly Mr. Rogers M.S.

436
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,310
<17-8,House>而是开集装箱的怪叔叔类型
<17-8,House>This is the weird guy in the panel van kind.

437
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,000
<17-9,Masters>马尔堡式多发性硬化吗
<17-9,Masters>Marburg M.S.?

438
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,840
<17-10,House>我刚说什么来着
<17-10,House>What did I just say?

439
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,940
<17-11,Masters>那他顶多只能活两三天了
<17-11,Masters>He'll be dead in two to three days at the most.

440
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,870
<17-12,House>除非我们能赶紧找个人
<17-12,House>That's unless we can get someone

441
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,260
<17-12,House>把自己钉在十字架上
<17-12,House>to nail themselves to a cross as soon as possible.

442
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,220
<17-12,House>或者用干细胞疗法
<17-12,House>Or stem cell treatment.

443
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,670
<17-13,Taub>这还是一种实验性疗法
<17-13,Taub>That's an experimental treatment.

444
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,330
<17-14,Foreman>对脱髓鞘类疾病有显著疗效
<17-14,Foreman>That's had promising results with demyelinating diseases.

445
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,300
<17-14,Foreman>这是我们最好的选择
<17-14,Foreman>It's our best shot.

446
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,960
<17-15,Chase>这得用胚胎干细胞治疗才有效果
<17-15,Chase>It would be if it wasn't embryonic stem cell treatment.

447
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,080
<17-15,Chase>咱们的病人一心朝圣
<17-15,Chase>Our patient's right of the pope.

448
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,700
<17-15,Chase>他是不会同意的
<17-15,Chase>He's never gonna consent to that.

449
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,440
<17-16,House>这事你知  我知
<17-16,House>I know that, and you know that.

450
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,080
<17-16,House>他并不知
<17-16,House>He doesn't know that.

451
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,020
<17-16,House>但现在被她知道了
<17-16,House>But now she knows that,

452
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,170
<17-16,House>他也早晚会知道
<17-16,House>he's gonna know that.

453
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,250
<17-16,House>有本事
<17-16,House>Way to go.

454
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,690
<17-17,House>确认是不是马尔堡病
<17-17,House>Confirm Marburg.

455
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,150
<17-17,House>再看看他是不是伪君子
<17-17,House>Then see if he's a fair-weather flagellator.

457
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,470
<18-1,House>玛尼佩妮小姐  你看起来容光焕发
<18-1,House>You look smashing, Miss Moneypenny.

458
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,410
<18-1,House>系宽腰带
<18-1,House>Cummerbund?

459
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,350
<18-2,Wilson>样子很蠢  邦德先生
<18-2,Wilson>Very foolish, Mr. Bond.

460
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,810
<18-3,Wilson>他女儿的病是真的
<18-3,Wilson>The daughter's case checks out.

461
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,180
<18-3,Wilson>立体定向活检已经确认
<18-3,Wilson>Stereotactic biopsy confirmed

462
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,210
<18-3,Wilson>是四期多形性胶质母细胞瘤
<18-3,Wilson>stage IV glioblastoma multiforme.

463
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,250
<18-3,Wilson>化疗对其无效
<18-3,Wilson>Doesn't respond to chemo,

464
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,450
<18-3,Wilson>但医生们死马当活马医  结果发生了奇迹
<18-3,Wilson>But they gave it to her anyway as a Hail Mary and just got lucky.

465
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,900
<18-4,House>要么真是上帝帮了忙  一种省事的解释
<18-4,House>So either God intervened, which is a lazy explanation,

466
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,750
<18-4,House>要么我们不知道为什么
<18-4,House>Or we just don't know why.

467
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,210
<18-4,House>这是没有解释
<18-4,House>Which is no explanation.

468
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,560
<18-5,Wilson>有些事情就是解释不通
<18-5,Wilson>Sometimes there is no explanation.

469
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,370
<18-5,Wilson>我也不是很在意
<18-5,Wilson>And I'm just fine with that.

470
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,700
<18-6,House>这让我十分受不了
<18-6,House>Which annoys me to no end.

471
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,690
<18-7,Wilson>把那份文件还给我  还有椅子和桌子
<18-7,Wilson>I need that file, that chair, and that desk.

472
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,160
<18-8,House>你女朋友篡改了事实
<18-8,House>Your woman is fudging the facts.

473
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,420
<18-8,House>五个病人
<18-8,House>Five of those cases,

474
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,900
<18-8,House>他们受到的放射性损伤与她说的剂量并不符合
<18-8,House>the stated doses don't explain the radiation damage.

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
<18-9,Wilson>不同病人敏感度不一
<18-9,Wilson>Sensitivities vary.

476
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,930
<18-10,House>差别不会那么大
<18-10,House>Not that much.

477
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,230
<18-11,Wilson>是呀  我也是这样想的
<18-11,Wilson>Yeah. That's what I thought.

478
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,350
<18-11,Wilson>我直接了当问过她
<18-11,Wilson>I asked her point blank about this.

479
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,720
<18-11,Wilson>她说辐射剂量是准确的
<18-11,Wilson>She said the dosages were accurate,

480
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,620
<18-11,Wilson>她没犯任何错误
<18-11,Wilson>and that she had done nothing wrong.

481
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,950
<18-11,Wilson>从道德角度讲  她确实没做错
<18-11,Wilson>Because morally she didn't.

482
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,370
<18-12,House>五个病人都已经到了晚期
<18-12,House>All five patients were terminal.

483
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,910
<18-12,House>她使用了高于标准的剂量
<18-12,House>She exceeded the dosing protocols

484
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,880
<18-12,House>试图挽救他们的生命
<18-12,House>to try to save their life.

485
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,360
<18-12,House>换作你也会做同样的事情
<18-12,House>You would have done the same.

486
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,270
<18-12,House>她是个傻冒  跟你绝配
<18-12,House>She's a sap, and she's perfect for you.

487
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,710
<19-1,House>我讨厌婚礼  也同样讨厌彩排宴会
<19-1,House>I hate rehearsal dinners almost as much as I hate weddings.

488
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,190
<19-2,House>一般人结婚的唯一原因
<19-2,House>The only reason anyone gets married

489
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,850
<19-2,House>是雌性直立人在哺乳时需要保护
<19-2,House>is that homo erectus females needed protection

490
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,520
<19-2,House>免受野兽攻击
<19-2,House>from predators while breast feeding.

491
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,020
<19-2,House>他们两个结婚的唯一原因
<19-2,House>The only reason these two are getting married

492
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,940
<19-2,House>就是为了举办一场恶心的晚会
<19-2,House>is to throw an obnoxious gala

493
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,340
<19-2,House>让参加宴会的人感到自惭形秽
<19-2,House>and make the rest of us feel unworthy.

494
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,660
<19-3,House>虽然我们可以断定不出两年时间
<19-3,House>Even though we know in two years

495
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,960
<19-3,House>他们的律师就会开始相互争夺财产
<19-3,House>their lawyers are gonna be fighting over the Bentleys.

496
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,420
<19-4,Cuddy>多么美妙的祝酒辞
<19-4,Cuddy>That'll make a lovely toast.

497
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,460
<19-5,House>男财女貌
<19-5,House>She's got looks. He's got money.

498
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,150
<19-5,House>没一个是永恒的
<19-5,House>One of them is bound to run out.

499
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,220
<19-6,Cuddy>我估计19个月
<19-6,Cuddy>I give it 19 months.

500
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,420
<19-7,House>怎么这么具体
<19-7,House>That's very specific.

501
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,850
<19-8,Cuddy>新泽西州法律规定
<19-8,Cuddy>No fault divorce in New Jersey

502
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,300
<19-8,Cuddy>夫妻双方均无过错
<19-8,Cuddy>requires couples to live

503
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,460
<19-8,Cuddy>分居满18个月才可以离婚
<19-8,Cuddy>at least 18 months apart.

504
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,930
<19-8,Cuddy>真算起来我只给他们几个礼拜
<19-8,Cuddy>I'm actually only giving it a few weeks.

505
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,160
<19-9,House>我以为我才是悲观者
<19-9,House>Oh. Thought I was supposed to be the dark one.

506
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,530
<19-10,Cuddy>今天不是
<19-10,Cuddy>Not today.

507
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,360
<19-11,House>说
<19-11,House>Yeah.

508
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,010
<19-12,House>你得一个人赴宴了
<19-12,House>You're gonna have to go stag.

509
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,780
<19-12,House>我的病人拒绝接受治疗
<19-12,House>My patient is refusing treatment.

510
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,790
<19-13,Cuddy>-你在乎呀  -不
<19-13,Cuddy>- And you care? - No.

511
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,550
<19-14,House>但这个借口你必须接受
<19-14,House>But it's an excuse you can't argue with.

512
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,070
<20-1,Ramon>接受治疗就是对上帝不敬
<20-1,Ramon>Accepting this treatment is an insult to God.

513
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,680
<20-1,Ramon>就不能指望他遵守约定了
<20-1,Ramon>I can't expect Him to keep our deal.

514
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,390
<20-2,House>你已经违反了约定
<20-2,House>You already broke it.

515
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,010
<20-2,House>根据你的验血报告
<20-2,House>Your blood test showed

516
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,890
<20-2,House>你体内含有大量布洛芬
<20-2,House>you were loaded with ibuprofen.

517
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,690
<20-3,Ramon>吃止疼药也算违反约定吗
<20-3,Ramon>Taking painkillers breaks my deal?

518
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,810
<20-4,House>你就想像你救世主那样受难  对吧
<20-4,House>The point is to suffer like your Savior did, right?

519
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,190
<20-4,House>他又没吃"没药"  古罗马时期的扑热息痛
<20-4,House>Well, He didn't take Myrrh, the Tylenol of ancient Rome.

520
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,870
<20-4,House>再说他钉子钉在手腕上
<20-4,House>And His nails went through His wrists,

521
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,760
<20-4,House>不是手掌
<20-4,House>not through His palms.

522
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,340
<20-4,House>懦夫才会钉在手掌上
<20-4,House>Palms are for sissies.

523
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,870
<20-4,House>还有那三十九下的鞭笞
<20-4,House>And what about the 39 lashes

524
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,360
<20-4,House>拳打脚踢和荆棘冠呢
<20-4,House>And the beatings and the crown of thorns?

525
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,800
<20-4,House>你经受的痛苦顶多是剪坏了手指甲
<20-4,House>What you go through is closer to a bad manicure

526
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,770
<20-4,House>跟耶稣受难差远了
<20-4,House>than a crucifixion.

527
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,400
<20-5,Ramon>这不是为了向上帝表明我受了苦
<20-5,Ramon>It's not about showing God my pain.

528
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,060
<20-5,Ramon>而是为了表明我对他的信仰
<20-5,Ramon>It's about showing Him my faith.

529
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,470
<20-5,Ramon>如果他让我为我女儿去死
<20-5,Ramon>If He asks me to die for my daughter,

530
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,330
<20-5,Ramon>我会欣然接受
<20-5,Ramon>I'll do it gladly.

531
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,990
<20-6,House>别拿你女儿说事儿
<20-6,House>Don't make this about your daughter.

532
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,470
<20-6,House>你只是害怕如果我们找到治疗方法
<20-6,House>You're just worried that if we find a cure,

533
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,310
<20-6,House>你就会失去信仰
<20-6,House>that it'll cost you your faith.

534
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,550
<20-6,House>变得跟普通人一样了
<20-6,House>And then you'll be like the rest of us.

535
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,730
<20-7,Ramon>孤独又害怕
<20-7,Ramon>Alone and afraid?

536
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,360
<20-7,Ramon>你说得对
<20-7,Ramon>You're right.

537
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,140
<20-7,Ramon>-我不想那样  -你笑了
<20-7,Ramon>- I don't want that. - You're smiling.

538
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,350
<20-8,Masters>是不是表示你对自己的选择
<20-8,Masters>Does that mean that you're comfortable

539
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,610
<20-8,Masters>很满意
<20-8,Masters>with your choice?

540
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,570
<20-8,Masters>还是你在害怕
<20-8,Masters>Or that you're afraid?

541
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,200
<20-8,Masters>因为这可能是你唯一的希望
<20-8,Masters>Because this may be your only hope.

542
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,350
<20-9,Ramon>你可以开出各种处方
<20-9,Ramon>You can prescribe a lot of things,

543
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,690
<20-9,Ramon>但开不出"希望"
<20-9,Ramon>but hope isn't one of 'em.

544
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,230
<20-10,House>坚持自己的信念
<20-10,House>Sticking by your convictions

545
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,820
<20-10,House>不计一切的后果
<20-10,House>and damning the consequences.

546
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,890
<20-10,House>你们两个挺相像
<20-10,House>You two have a lot in common.

547
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,270
<20-10,House>都是傻瓜
<20-10,House>You're both idiots.

548
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,060
<20-11,Masters>所有的信念都同样荒谬吗
<20-11,Masters>All conviction's equally ridiculous?

549
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,210
<20-12,House>不看情形死板的坚持就是
<20-12,House>Just when they're applied indiscriminately to all circumstances.

550
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,440
<20-13,Masters>他需要见见他女儿
<20-13,Masters>He needs to see his daughter.

552
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,980
<20-14,House>他需要看"向上帝挑战"
<20-14,House>He needs to see Inherit the Wind.

553
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,280
<20-15,Masters>告诉她女儿他要死了
<20-15,Masters>And tell her he's dying

554
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,450
<20-15,Masters>因为上帝不想让他吃药
<20-15,Masters>because God doesn't want him to take his medicine.

555
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,610
<20-16,Masters>诚实也不是一无是处
<20-16,Masters>Honesty's not all bad.

556
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,650
<20-17,House>把她找来
<20-17,House>Get her in here.

557
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,090
<21-1,Marisa>吃了那些药  你还可以继续活下去
<21-1,Marisa>You don't have to die, not if you take their medicine.

558
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,650
<21-2,Ramon>这治疗违背上帝的原则
<21-2,Ramon>The treatment violates god's laws.

559
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,810
<21-2,Ramon>他不希望我接受
<21-2,Ramon>He doesn't want me to take it.

560
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,270
<21-3,Marisa>可上帝也不希望你死去
<21-3,Marisa>But God doesn't want you to die.

561
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,070
<21-3,Marisa>他不希望任何人死去  神的国度里只有爱
<21-3,Marisa>He doesn't want anyone to die. He's all about love.

562
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,520
<21-4,Ramon>我知道这是你妈妈教你的
<21-4,Ramon>I know this is coming from your mother.

563
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,580
<21-4,Ramon>这是我自己的想法
<21-4,Ramon>This is coming from me.

564
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,630
<21-5,Marisa>我去鬼门关闯过一次
<21-5,Marisa>I'm the one who almost died.

565
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,020
<21-5,Marisa>我知道什么感觉
<21-5,Marisa>I know what it's like.

566
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,190
<21-5,Marisa>你是我爸爸  你不能死
<21-5,Marisa>And you're my dad. You can't die.

567
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,540
<21-6,Ramon>我也希望我可以活下去
<21-6,Ramon>I wish I didn't have to.

568
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,510
<21-7,Marisa>爸爸  你可以活下去
<21-7,Marisa>You don't have to, daddy.

569
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,350
<21-7,Marisa>只要把药吃了
<21-7,Marisa>Just take the medicine.

570
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,060
<21-7,Marisa>你总是让我好好吃药  求你了
<21-7,Marisa>You always tell me to take the medicine. Please.

571
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,990
<21-8,Ramon>总有一天
<21-8,Ramon>One day,

572
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,340
<21-8,Ramon>你会理解的
<21-8,Ramon>you're going to understand.

573
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,810
<21-9,Marisa>我不理解
<21-9,Marisa>No, I'm not.

574
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,870
<21-9,Marisa>我永远也不能理解
<21-9,Marisa>I am never going to understand that.

575
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,090
<21-9,Marisa>如果上帝真这样做
<21-9,Marisa>If God could do this,

576
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,750
<21-9,Marisa>我会痛恨他
<21-9,Marisa>I hate God.

577
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,260
<22-1,Chase>我刚在巧克力喷泉那儿
<22-1,Chase>I just spotted a couple of hot girls

578
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,080
<22-1,Chase>瞄到几个辣妹
<22-1,Chase>by the chocolate fountain.

579
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,490
<22-2,Foreman>你刚才不是在楼上跟...
<22-2,Foreman>Weren't you just upstairs with...

580
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,020
<22-3,Chase>要不是兄弟你  我哪能有这福气呀
<22-3,Chase>And it wouldn't have happened if not for you, buddy.

581
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,790
<22-3,Chase>总得有人把没喝醉的朋友支开吧
<22-3,Chase>Someone had to distract the sober friend.

582
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
<22-4,Foreman>我可不是来给你当跟班的
<22-4,Foreman>I'm not here to be your wingman.

583
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,960
<22-5,Chase>这次我给你当跟班
<22-5,Chase>I'll be your wingman this time.

584
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,330
<22-6,Foreman>我也不是来找女人的
<22-6,Foreman>I didn't come here to get lady.

585
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,220
<22-7,Chase>那就不找
<22-7,Chase>Then don't.

586
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,020
<22-7,Chase>跟美女搭讪一点都没意思
<22-7,Chase>Talking to beautiful women isn't nearly as much fun

587
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,630
<22-7,Chase>还不如看陶博如何不搭理他老婆呢
<22-7,Chase>as watching Taub not talking to his wife.

588
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,230
<23-1,Taub>我看了你的电子邮件
<23-1,Taub>I went through your emails.

589
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,710
<23-2,Rachel>里面没有任何不合适的内容
<23-2,Rachel>There's nothing in there that's inappropriate.

590
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,150
<23-2,Rachel>我们只是朋友
<23-2,Rachel>We're friends, Chris.

591
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,860
<23-3,Taub>可是你给他讲的事  从不对我说
<23-3,Taub>But you tell him things that you've never told me.

592
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,590
<23-4,Rachel>我没法告诉你  所以才对他讲
<23-4,Rachel>I tell him things I can't tell you. That's the point.

593
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,990
<23-5,Taub>你说的全是你的事  从来不提我
<23-5,Taub>Not things about me. About you.

594
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,600
<23-5,Taub>你换了新工作  染了头发
<23-5,Taub>About your new job. About coloring your hair.

595
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,550
<23-5,Taub>你母亲去世时你的感受
<23-5,Taub>About how you felt when your mother died.

596
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,460
<23-5,Taub>这些事情我都想知道
<23-5,Taub>I want to know those things.

597
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,650
<23-6,Rachel>跟他交流很容易
<23-6,Rachel>He's easy to talk to.

598
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,130
<23-6,Rachel>他心态开放  诚实
<23-6,Rachel>He's open and honest.

599
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,370
<23-6,Rachel>让我有安全感
<23-6,Rachel>He makes me feel safe.

600
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,010
<23-7,Taub>听上去像是你爱上他了
<23-7,Taub>Sounds like you love him.

601
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,630
<23-8,Rachel>我没有出轨
<23-8,Rachel>I am not having an affair.

602
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,800
<23-8,Rachel>他住在俄勒冈州  我从没见过他
<23-8,Rachel>He lives in Oregon. I've never met him.

603
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,180
<23-8,Rachel>很可能永远也不会见到他
<23-8,Rachel>I probably never will.

604
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,660
<23-9,Taub>你出轨了  感情上
<23-9,Taub>You are having an affair. An emotional one.

605
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,900
<23-10,Rachel>你把我现在的事和你以前所为划等号吗
<23-10,Rachel>Are you equating what I'm doing with what you did?

606
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,570
<23-11,Taub>我做过非常对不起你的事情
<23-11,Taub>I've done terrible things to you,

607
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,860
<23-11,Taub>会有今天是我罪有应得
<23-11,Taub>And I deserve all of this and more,

608
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,030
<23-11,Taub>可你不能装作你现在的行为不伤害我的感情
<23-11,Taub>but you can't pretend that what you're doing isn't hurtful.

609
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,620
<23-12,House>某人今晚很迷人嘛
<23-12,House>Someone looks lovely tonight.

610
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,330
<23-13,Cuddy>谢谢
<23-13,Cuddy>Thank you.

611
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,670
<23-13,Cuddy>我说我自己
<23-13,Cuddy>I meant me.

612
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,040
<23-14,House>另一位某人美得惊艳
<23-14,House>Someone else looks simply stunning.

613
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,270
<23-14,House>这次是说你  还有吧台那金发美女
<23-14,House>That was you. And the blonde at the bar.

614
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,640
<23-15,Cuddy>澄清一点
<23-15,Cuddy>Just to be clear,

615
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,040
<23-15,Cuddy>你这次小小表现没用的
<23-15,Cuddy>this whole little act isn't gonna work.

616
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,230
<23-15,Cuddy>我需要的是道歉
<23-15,Cuddy>I need an apology.

617
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,790
<23-15,Cuddy>不是奉承
<23-15,Cuddy>Not flattery.

618
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,590
<23-16,House>这不是表现
<23-16,House>It's not an act.

619
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,820
<23-16,House>是婚礼嘛
<23-16,House>It's the wedding.

620
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,690
<23-17,Cuddy>-你讨厌婚礼  -我以为我讨厌
<23-17,Cuddy>- You hate weddings.  - I thought I did.

621
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,830
<23-18,House>然后我意识到  我从没参加过婚礼
<23-18,House>Then I realized I've never been to one.

622
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,070
<23-19,Cuddy>从没有
<23-19,Cuddy>Never?

623
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,260
<23-20,House>原来婚礼还是蛮好玩的
<23-20,House>Turns out they're kind of fun.

624
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,870
<24-1,Chase>我可不能说上司坏话
<24-1,Chase>Well, I can't complain about my boss.

625
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,610
<24-1,Chase>他人就在这儿呢
<24-1,Chase>He's right here.

626
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,050
<24-2,Nika>你是他上司
<24-2,Nika>You're his boss?

627
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,340
<24-4,Chase>仅限周一至周五
<24-4,Chase>Only Mondays through Fridays.

628
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,490
<24-4,Chase>周末的时候  他是我好兄弟
<24-4,Chase>On the weekends, he's my bra.

629
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,810
<24-5,Foreman>这一轮好兄弟请了
<24-5,Foreman>This round's on the bra.

630
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:04,900
<25-1,Masters>你女儿的事  对不起
<25-1,Masters>I'm sorry about your daughter.

631
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,020
<25-1,Masters>我无意伤害她
<25-1,Masters>I never meant to hurt her.

632
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,520
<25-2,Ramon>你以为她能令我改变主意
<25-2,Ramon>You just thought she would change my mind.

633
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,920
<25-3,Masters>我很惊讶她没能说服你
<25-3,Masters>I was surprised she didn't.

634
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,760
<25-4,Ramon>我也很惊讶
<25-4,Ramon>So was I.

635
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,040
<25-4,Ramon>我说我不怕死
<25-4,Ramon>I didn't tell you the truth,

636
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,080
<25-4,Ramon>那不是真话
<25-4,Ramon>when I said I'm not afraid to die.

637
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,840
<25-5,Masters>不过你死后会上天堂  所以
<25-5,Masters>But you're going straight to heaven, so...

638
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,760
<25-6,Ramon>我相信是那样  可我也是人
<25-6,Ramon>That's what I believe, but I'm human.

639
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,550
<25-7,Masters>所以你知道  自己可能是错的
<25-7,Masters>So you know you may be wrong.

640
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,640
<25-7,Masters>你是怎么做到的
<25-7,Masters>How could you do what you just did?

641
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,810
<25-8,Ramon>所以人才需要有信仰
<25-8,Ramon>That's why we have beliefs.

642
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,410
<25-8,Ramon>当我们被怀疑和恐惧蒙蔽了双眼
<25-8,Ramon>So we can still see the right thing to do

643
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,680
<25-8,Ramon>只有信仰能让我们看到正确的路
<25-8,Ramon>when we're blinded with doubt and fear.

644
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
<25-8,Ramon>信仰告诉我们自己是谁
<25-8,Ramon>Our beliefs define us.

645
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,520
<25-8,Ramon>丢掉了信仰
<25-8,Ramon>If we lose them,

646
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,780
<25-8,Ramon>我们又成了什么呢
<25-8,Ramon>who are we?

647
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,110
<26-1,Taub>听我说  对不起
<26-1,Taub>Look, I'm sorry.

648
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,440
<26-1,Taub>刚才闹成那样不是我的本意
<26-1,Taub>I didn't mean for it to go that way.

649
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,990
<26-2,Rachel>你认为我这样是为我自己
<26-2,Rachel>You think I'm being selfish,

650
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,670
<26-2,Rachel>但我不是
<26-2,Rachel>but I'm not.

651
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,570
<26-2,Rachel>他让我对自己和我们的关系都看开了许多
<26-2,Rachel>He makes me feel better about me and about us.

652
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,300
<26-3,Taub>这说法不太容易接受
<26-3,Taub>Well, that is hard to believe,

653
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,390
<26-3,Taub>因为我现在只觉得被背叛了
<26-3,Taub>because all I feel right now is betrayed.

654
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,940
<26-4,Rachel>我没想要你这样
<26-4,Rachel>I never wanted that.

655
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,540
<26-4,Rachel>很好
<26-4,Rachel>Good.

656
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,320
<26-5,Taub>因为正如你当初要求我停止我的行为
<26-5,Taub>Because just like you asked me to stop my behavior,

657
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,940
<26-5,Taub>我也要求你停止这种行为
<26-5,Taub>I'm asking you to stop this.

658
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,110
<26-6,Taub>不行吗
<26-6,Taub>No?

659
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,890
<26-7,Rachel>我不会骗你
<26-7,Rachel>I'm not gonna lie to you.

660
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,200
<26-8,Taub>你是在报复我吗
<26-8,Taub>Is this revenge?

661
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,600
<26-9,Rachel>我不知道
<26-9,Rachel>I don't know.

662
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,940
<26-9,Rachel>我只知道这是我现在需要的
<26-9,Rachel>But I do know that it's something I need right now.

663
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,710
<27-1,House>你婚礼上会穿什么
<27-1,House>What would you wear?

664
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,910
<27-2,Cuddy>我钟情白色婚纱
<27-2,Cuddy>Well, I'm a sucker for the white gown.

665
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,510
<27-3,House>第一次结婚的年轻新娘的传统选择
<27-3,House>Traditionally for young, first-time brides.

666
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
<27-4,Cuddy>我或许是不年轻
<27-4,Cuddy>Well, I may not be young,

667
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,190
<27-4,Cuddy>但会是我第一次结婚
<27-4,Cuddy>but I'll be first-time.

668
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,960
<27-5,House>你骗人
<27-5,House>That is a lie.

669
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,500
<27-5,House>你之前结过婚
<27-5,House>You were married before.

670
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,730
<27-5,House>1987年  为时六天
<27-5,House>1987 for six days.

671
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,700
<27-5,House>你对新泽西州离婚法的熟悉令我生疑
<27-5,House>Your knowledge of new Jersey divorce law made me suspicious,

672
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,640
<27-5,House>所以我做了调查
<27-5,House>so I looked it up.

673
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,110
<27-6,Cuddy>这些都是你的陷阱
<27-6,Cuddy>So this was all your trap?

674
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,080
<27-7,House>陷阱太原始
<27-7,House>Trap's primitive.

675
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,680
<27-7,House>我更喜欢骗局
<27-7,House>I prefer inveiglement.

676
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,230
<27-7,House>总之重点是  我骗了你  你也骗了我
<27-7,House>Anyway, the point is, I lied to you, you lied to me,

677
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,920
<27-7,House>我原谅你
<27-7,House>I forgive you.

678
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,210
<27-8,Cuddy>演得好
<27-8,Cuddy>Well played.

679
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,770
<28-1,Sam>你是不是累了  看了那么多文件
<28-1,Sam>You're tired, aren't you? All those files?

680
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,100
<28-1,Sam>不累
<28-1,Sam>No.

681
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,920
<28-2,Wilson>我是在想
<28-2,Wilson>No, I was thinking...

682
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,650
<28-2,Wilson>如果他俩能有百万分之一的机会白头到老
<28-2,Wilson>I mean, if those two even have the slightest chance of making it,

683
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,650
<28-7,Wilson>那我们一定能
<28-7,Wilson>then we have to be a sure thing.

684
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,000
<28-8,Sam>而且我们该犯的错误都已经犯过了
<28-8,Sam>And we've already made all our mistakes.

685
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,860
<28-2,Wilson>而且
<28-2,Wilson>And...

686
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,660
<28-3,Wilson>我意识到
<28-3,Wilson>I've come to realize

687
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,910
<28-3,Wilson>我比想象中更爱你
<28-3,Wilson>that I love you even more than I thought I did.

688
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,350
<28-3,Wilson>萨姆  你愿意再嫁我一次吗
<28-3,Wilson>Sam, will you marry me again?

689
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,020
<28-4,Sam>我不知说什么才好
<28-4,Sam>Wow. I don't even know what to say.

690
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,940
<28-5,Wilson>我有备选答案哦
<28-5,Wilson>I have a suggestion.

691
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,790
<28-6,Sam>你怎么会突然求婚
<28-6,Sam>Where did this even come from?

692
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,260
<28-6,Sam>你是什么时候
<28-6,Sam>When did you...

693
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:04,290
<28-6,Sam>你说你刚刚意识到什么事让你更爱我了
<28-6,Sam>You just came to realize what made you love me even more?

694
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,890
<28-7,Wilson>你做的每一件事
<28-7,Wilson>Everything you've done.

695
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,470
<28-7,Wilson>你的工作   你的
<28-7,Wilson>Your work. Your...

696
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,920
<28-7,Wilson>你的道德感
<28-7,Wilson>Your sense of morality.

697
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,430
<28-7,Wilson>那五个病例
<28-7,Wilson>The five cases.

698
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,500
<28-7,Wilson>对你的做法我不仅赞同
<28-7,Wilson>I not only agree with what you did.

699
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,710
<28-7,Wilson>而且钦佩
<28-7,Wilson>I admire it.

700
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,710
<28-8,Sam>我什么都没有做
<28-8,Sam>I didn't do anything.

701
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,290
<28-8,Sam>你之前已经问过我了
<28-8,Sam>You already asked me about the files.

702
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,640
<28-8,Sam>-我也对你说了实话  -我知道
<28-8,Sam>- And I told you the truth.  - I know.

703
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,650
<28-9,Wilson>我能明白
<28-9,Wilson>And I get it.

704
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,140
<28-10,Sam>你不相信我
<28-10,Sam>You don't believe me.

705
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,470
<28-11,Wilson>我相信你是个非常好的人
<28-11,Wilson>I believe that you are a wonderful person.

706
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,800
<28-12,Sam>一个撒谎的骗子
<28-12,Sam>Who lies and cheats.

707
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,780
<28-13,Wilson>不  萨姆  听我说  我是支持你的
<28-13,Wilson>No, Sam, listen. I'm on your side.

708
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,960
<28-14,Sam>我不敢相信
<28-14,Sam>I can't believe this.

709
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,550
<28-15,Wilson>萨姆  萨姆  别走
<28-15,Wilson>Sam. Sam, don't do this...

710
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,240
<29-1,House>一共几个妞
<29-1,House>So how many do you think?

711
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,630
<29-2,Foreman>至少三个
<29-2,Foreman>At least three.

712
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,340
<29-3,House>奇斯上演帽子戏法
<29-3,House>A hat trick, Chase.

713
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,540
<29-3,House>看到啦  单身汉的生活
<29-3,House>See? The life of the bachelor.

714
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,970
<29-3,House>充满激情  毫无愧疚
<29-3,House>All of the sex, none of the guilt.

715
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,840
<29-4,Taub>这事没完
<29-4,Taub>It's not over, okay?

716
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,630
<29-4,Taub>我只是判断错误
<29-4,Taub>I just really miscalculated.

717
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,250
<29-4,Taub>我以为她已经原谅了我
<29-4,Taub>I thought she'd forgiven me for everything.

718
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,070
<29-4,Taub>可是那些被我伤害的感情
<29-4,Taub>All those hurt feelings,

719
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,250
<29-5,House>从没真正消失
<29-5,House>they never really went away.

720
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,360
<29-5,House>这样说有道理得多
<29-5,House>That makes a lot more sense.

721
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,250
<29-6,Wilson>不用理他
<29-6,Wilson>Ignore him.

722
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,570
<29-6,Wilson>他又来灵感了
<29-6,Wilson>He just got an idea.

723
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,860
<29-7,House>我还有项测验要做
<29-7,House>I have one more test to run.

724
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,370
<29-8,Foreman>我恨婚礼
<29-8,Foreman>Ugh. I hate weddings.

725
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,450
<30-1,House>末日近了
<30-1,House>It won't be long now.

726
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,740
<30-1,House>在你还没反应过来之前  就要面临永恒的虚无
<30-1,House>You'll be staring down the yawning void before you know it.

727
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,010
<30-2,Ramon>你从婚礼上跑回来就为了告诉我这些
<30-2,Ramon>You came from a wedding to tell me that?

728
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,470
<30-3,House>不  我跑回来
<30-3,House>Nope. I came from a wedding

729
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,470
<30-3,House>为了做个PET扫描
<30-3,House>to run a PET-scan.

731
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,060
<30-4,Ramon>我以为你已经放弃我了
<30-4,Ramon>I thought you'd given up on me.

732
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,420
<30-4,Ramon>我是放弃了
<30-4,Ramon>I have.

733
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,130
<30-5,House>PET扫描是为你女儿安排的
<30-5,House>PET-scan was for your daughter.

734
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,050
<30-5,House>她的诊断我弄错了
<30-5,House>I was wrong about her.

735
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,230
<30-5,House>她的确得了恶性胶质母细胞瘤
<30-5,House>She did have Glioblastoma.

736
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,260
<30-5,House>而且现在还有
<30-5,House>And she still does.

737
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,020
<30-5,House>肿瘤从未去除
<30-5,House>The cancer never went away.

738
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,780
<30-6,Ramon>不  已经没有了
<30-6,Ramon>Yes, it did.

739
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,590
<30-6,Ramon>医生每年都给她检查
<30-6,Ramon>They tested her every year.

740
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,420
<30-6,Ramon>做的是CT
<30-6,Ramon>With a CT-scan.

741
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,460
<30-7,House>会漏掉各种微小肿瘤
<30-7,House>Which misses all the tiny, little tumors

742
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,810
<30-7,House>但PET不会
<30-7,House>that a PET-scan doesn't.

743
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,690
<30-8,Ramon>你弄错了
<30-8,Ramon>You've made a mistake.

744
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,150
<30-8,Ramon>她已经没有癌症了
<30-8,Ramon>She does not have cancer anymore.

745
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,980
<30-9,House>我查过两遍了
<30-9,House>I ran it twice.

746
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,500
<30-9,House>没弄错
<30-9,House>No mistake.

747
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,350
<30-9,House>似乎上帝违约了
<30-9,House>Looks like god broke your deal.

748
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,200
<30-9,House>对不起
<30-9,House>I'm sorry.

749
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,680
<30-9,House>但我说的是事实
<30-9,House>But I'm also right.

750
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:29,160
<30-10,Ramon>你就是个混蛋
<30-10,Ramon>You're a bastard.

751
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,010
<30-10,Ramon>想怎样治随你吧
<30-10,Ramon>Do whatever you want to me.

752
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,370
<30-11,House>明智的决定
<30-11,House>Good call.

753
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,030
<31-1,Foreman>真令人吃惊  你还有精力来上班
<31-1,Foreman>Surprised you've got enough strength to come to work today.

754
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,060
<31-2,Chase>一天半的时间够我恢复了
<31-2,Chase>36 hours is long enough for me to recover.

755
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,540
<31-2,Chase>可要让这家伙好起来还差远了
<31-2,Chase>And not nearly long enough for this guy to be getting better.

756
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,330
<31-3,Taub>豪斯交待无论如何要每12小时检查一次
<31-3,Taub>House wanted us checking every 12 hours anyway.

757
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,240
<31-4,Chase>抱歉我丢下你了
<31-4,Chase>Sorry I took off on you.

758
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,660
<31-5,Foreman>两次哦
<31-5,Foreman>Twice?

759
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,980
<31-6,Chase>第一次是我不应该
<31-6,Chase>First one was my bad.

760
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,430
<31-6,Chase>第二次我没得选啊
<31-6,Chase>Second one, I had no choice.

761
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,120
<31-6,Chase>那可是3P哎
<31-6,Chase>It was a threesome.

762
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,610
<31-7,Taub>3P也没多大了不起
<31-7,Taub>They're overrated.

763
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,550
<31-8,Chase and Foreman>他在吹牛
<31-8,Chase and Foreman>He's bluffing.

764
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,080
<31-9,Taub>叫豪斯来
<31-9,Taub>Get house.

765
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,040
<32-1,House>给你看点东西
<32-1,House>Got something to show you.

766
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,040
<32-1,House>这是你女儿的PET扫描结果
<32-1,House>Your daughter's PET-scan.

767
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,420
<32-1,House>没东西
<32-1,House>It's clean.

768
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,060
<32-1,House>健健康康
<32-1,House>She's fine.

769
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,860
<32-1,House>我的错
<32-1,House>My bad.

770
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,840
<32-1,House>我把她和马里恩·西尔弗搞混了
<32-1,House>Got her mixed up with Marion Silver.

772
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,160
<32-1,House>玛丽莎·席尔瓦
<32-1,House>Marisa Silva.

773
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,050
<32-1,House>这个可以有  对吧
<32-1,House>That's believable, right?

774
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,030
<32-1,House>总之  对你来说是个好消息
<32-1,House>Anyhow, good news for you,

775
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,730
<32-1,House>对席尔瓦先生来说可就是个坏消息了
<32-1,House>Bad news for Mr. Silver.

776
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,780
<32-2,Ramon>你耍我
<32-2,Ramon>You tricked me.

777
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,610
<32-2,Ramon>上帝从来就没有违约
<32-2,Ramon>God didn't break our deal.

778
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,800
<32-2,Ramon>是我
<32-2,Ramon>I did.

779
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,790
<32-2,Ramon>你抛给我诱惑
<32-2,Ramon>You led me into temptation.

780
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,890
<32-2,Ramon>我陷进去了
<32-2,Ramon>And I followed.

781
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,630
<32-3,House>上帝会因此而惩罚你的
<32-3,House>And God will punish you for that.

782
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,870
<32-5,House>-必须的  -因为如果他不
<32-5,House>-He has to. -'cause if he didn't,

783
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,580
<32-5,House>你肯定百思不得其解了  对吧
<32-5,House>Well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it?

784
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,260
<32-6,Ramon>他会的
<32-6,Ramon>He will.

785
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,270
<32-7,House>所以我就想不通了
<32-7,House>Well, that's why I'm so confused by this.

786
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,970
<32-7,House>这是你的核磁共振
<32-7,House>This is your MRI.

787
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,200
<32-7,House>显示病情明显改善
<32-7,House>Shows incremental improvement.

788
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,890
<32-7,House>你正在好转
<32-7,House>You're getting better.

789
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,900
<32-7,House>我这次反复核对了姓名
<32-7,House>I double-checked the name on this one.

790
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,480
<32-7,House>不过也不完全是好消息
<32-7,House>But it's not all good news.

791
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,290
<32-7,House>这个病人完蛋了
<32-7,House>This patient is screwed.

792
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,700
<32-7,House>说正经点叫做必死无疑
<32-7,House>Technical term is dead as a doornail.

793
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,260
<32-8,Ramon>这是谁
<32-8,Ramon>Who is that?

794
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,960
<32-8,Ramon>上帝
<32-8,Ramon>God.

795
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,720
<32-9,House>你违了约
<32-9,House>You broke your deal with him,

796
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,570
<32-9,House>你女儿没事  你正在好转
<32-9,House>your daughter's fine, you're getting better.

797
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,180
<32-9,House>没有不幸的事发生
<32-9,House>Nothing bad happened.

798
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,050
<32-9,House>这只能说明一件事情
<32-9,House>Which can only mean one thing.

799
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,780
<32-9,House>根本就没有上帝
<32-9,House>There is no God.

800
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,590
<32-9,House>当然  要是你女儿今天被流星砸到
<32-9,House>Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today,

801
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,770
<32-9,House>我就要遭受愤怒的鸡蛋了
<32-9,House>I would have some serious egg on my face.

802
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,420
<32-10,House>你在笑
<32-10,House>You're smiling.

803
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,310
<32-10,House>我猜这是你痛苦的表现吧
<32-10,House>I assume that means you're miserable.

804
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,640
<32-11,Ramon>我很高兴
<32-11,Ramon>It means I'm happy.

805
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,450
<32-11,Ramon>这证明不了上帝不存在
<32-11,Ramon>It doesn't mean God doesn't exist.

806
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,660
<32-11,Ramon>只能说明上帝他  真的很仁慈
<32-11,Ramon>It just means he's-- he's truly merciful.

807
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,490
<32-11,Ramon>我美丽的玛丽莎说得对
<32-11,Ramon>My beautiful Marisa was right.

808
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,010
<32-11,Ramon>神的国度里只有爱
<32-11,Ramon>God is all about love.

809
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,540
<32-12,House>有惩罚证明上帝存在
<32-12,House>Punishment is proof of God,

810
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,520
<32-12,House>没有惩罚也证明上帝存在
<32-12,House>and no punishment is proof of god?

811
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,040
<32-12,House>这论点很有创意
<32-12,House>Ingenious argument.

812
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,540
<32-13,Ramon>信仰不需要论证
<32-13,Ramon>Faith isn't an argument.

813
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,120
<32-13,Ramon>我要见我女儿
<32-13,Ramon>I'd like to see my daughter.

814
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,280
<32-14,Masters>其他人都知道你的计划吗
<32-14,Masters>Everyone else knew?

815
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,940
<32-15,House>我信得过的人都知道
<32-15,House>Everyone I could trust.

816
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,770
<32-15,House>所以是滴
<32-15,House>So yes.

817
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,740
<32-16,Masters>如果你预先告诉我  他现在已经死了
<32-16,Masters>If you had told me, he'd be dead by now.

818
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,010
<32-16,Masters>那为什么我还要说实话
<32-16,Masters>So why do I still want to tell the truth?

819
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,450
<32-17,House>要么你是天真要么就是有良心
<32-17,House>Either you're naive or you have scruples.

820
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,980
<32-17,House>我不知道哪个更坏事
<32-17,House>I'm not sure which is worse.

821
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,230
<32-18,Masters>这太出格了  我们不能这么干
<32-18,Masters>This is insane. We can't work like this.

822
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,720
<32-19,House>我能
<32-19,House>I can.

823
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,770
<33-1,Wilson>萨姆
<33-1,Wilson>Sam?

824
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,200
<33-2,Sam>抱歉  我本想在你回来前收拾好
<33-2,Sam>Sorry. I was hoping to be done before you got home.

825
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,190
<33-3,Wilson>我们是吵了一架
<33-3,Wilson>We had a fight.

826
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,150
<33-3,Wilson>就吵了这么一架
<33-3,Wilson>We had one fight.

827
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,570
<33-3,Wilson>我也已经认过错了
<33-3,Wilson>And I admitted I was wrong.

828
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,030
<33-3,Wilson>我们可以坐下来谈啊  把这一切都忘掉
<33-3,Wilson>We can talk about it. We can get over it.

829
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,300
<33-4,Sam>这关乎信任
<33-4,Sam>This is about trust.

830
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,760
<33-5,Wilson>我从没对你撒过任何谎
<33-5,Wilson>I never lied to you about anything.

831
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,070
<33-6,Sam>我知道  我也一直信任你
<33-6,Sam>I know. And I always trusted you.

832
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,910
<33-6,Sam>我...
<33-6,Sam>I...

833
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,680
<33-7,Wilson>不然我们去看婚姻咨询师
<33-7,Wilson>Maybe we could talk to a counselor.

834
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,480
<33-7,Wilson>你说过上次离婚后  那很管用
<33-7,Wilson>You said that helped after our divorce.

835
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,730
<33-8,Sam>是有用  我觉得我改变了很多
<33-8,Sam>It did. And I think I changed a lot.

836
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,260
<33-9,Wilson>难道我没改变吗
<33-9,Wilson>And I haven't?

837
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,070
<33-9,Wilson>这是我的错吗
<33-9,Wilson>This is my fault?

838
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,450
<33-10,Sam>我知道会有什么结果
<33-10,Sam>I know where this is going.

839
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,860
<33-10,Sam>我不想重蹈覆辙
<33-10,Sam>And I don't want to go there again.

840
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,330
<33-11,Wilson>你在退缩  萨姆
<33-11,Wilson>You're quitting, Sam.

841
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,580
<33-11,Wilson>你又退缩了
<33-11,Wilson>You're quitting again.

842
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,860
<33-11,Wilson>所以看来你并没有改变多少
<33-11,Wilson>So I guess you haven't changed that much.

843
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,810
<34-1,Cuddy>今天干得不错
<34-1,Cuddy>Good work today.

844
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,320
<34-1,Cuddy>我都不担心你的病人会告你
<34-1,Cuddy>I don't even think your patient's gonna sue.

845
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,360
<34-1,Cuddy>总算皆大欢喜了
<34-1,Cuddy>It looks like everybody's happy.

846
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,400
<34-1,Cuddy>我一直太愚了
<34-1,Cuddy>I've been an idiot.

847
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,660
<34-2,House>固执己见以为很有道理
<34-2,House>I got this argument stuck in my head.

848
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,250
<34-2,House>如果人人都撒谎
<34-2,House>If everybody lies,

849
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,630
<34-2,House>信任就既无根据也没意义
<34-2,House>then trust is not only unfounded and pointless,

850
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,080
<34-2,House>成了虚假
<34-2,House>it's fictional.

851
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,660
<34-2,House>但信任绝不是一场辩论
<34-2,House>But trust is not an argument

852
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,750
<34-2,House>它争不出个输赢
<34-2,House>that can be won or lost.

853
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:35,940
<34-2,House>或许我该放下我的愤世嫉俗  开始有点信仰
<34-2,House>Maybe I just have to suspend my cynicism and believe.

854
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,000
<34-2,House>或许我该迈出这一步了
<34-2,House>Maybe it's time I took a leap of faith.

855
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,900
<34-2,House>对不起
<34-2,House>I'm sorry.

856
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,730
<34-2,House>我不会再对你撒谎了
<34-2,House>I won't lie to you again.

857
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,360
<34-2,House>谢谢你
<34-2,House>Thank you.

858
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,360
<35-1,Wilson>萨姆离开我了
<35-1,Wilson>Sam left me.

859
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,710
<35-2,House>真是白痴
<35-2,House>What a moron.

860
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,700
<35-3,Wilson>太快了吧  我还爱着她呢
<35-3,Wilson>Too soon. I'm still in love with her.

861
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,350
<35-4,House>我是说你
<35-4,House>I meant you.

862
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,610
<35-5,Wilson>有酒吗  越多越好
<35-5,Wilson>Do you have a drink? Or drinks?

863
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,990
<35-6,House>卡迪要过来
<35-6,House>Cuddy's coming over.

864
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,250
<35-7,Wilson>她知道你在这儿吗
<35-7,Wilson>Does she know you're here?

865
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,290
<35-8,House>我跟她道歉了
<35-8,House>I apologized to her.

866
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,600
<35-9,Wilson>很好啊
<35-9,Wilson>Good for you.

867
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,880
<35-9,Wilson>不见得
<35-9,Wilson>Not really.

868
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,190
<35-10,House>我撒谎了
<35-10,House>I lied.

869
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,230
<35-10,House>我只是采纳了你的建议
<35-10,House>I just took your advice.

870
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,220
<35-10,House>可惜你自己却没有
<35-10,House>Too bad you didn't.
