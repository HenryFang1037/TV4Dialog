<2-3,House>我这是委婉的说法
<2-3,House>It's a figure of speech.

22
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,020
<2-3,House>你总是这么望文生义
<2-3,House>Always so literal.

29
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,510
<2-9,House>我这还是在用修辞手法
<2-9,House>Again with the literal translation.

30
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,420
<2-9,House>沃格勒  他的象征意义

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,500
<2-10,Cameron>以前有点怪怪的
<2-10,Cameron>The way they were was kind of weird.

<2-11,House>我喜欢怪怪的
<2-11,House>Hmm. Weird works for me.

<2-18,Cameron>你应该去处理  这是要紧事
<2-18,Cameron>You should go. It's important.

<2-19,House>我现在做的才是要紧事
<2-19,House>What I'm doing now is important.

<2-20,Cameron>为什么要我回去
<2-20,Cameron>Why do you want me back?

47
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,900
<2-21,House>因为你是个好医生

49
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,250
<2-24,Cameron>对我来说不够

<5-4,House>上面有个污渍  大概两天前粘上去的
<5-4,House>It's got a smudge on it. Probably two days old.

87
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,390
<5-4,House>这说明你不知道你的夹克被人穿过
<5-4,House>Which means you didn't know the jacket had been worn.

88
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,410
<5-4,House>所以说  要么你的丈夫是个异装癖
<5-4,House>So either your husband is a cross-dresser,

89
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,910
<5-4,House>要么你的女儿曾背着你穿过这件衣服
<5-4,House>or your daughter's been borrowing your clothes without telling you.

90
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,340
<5-4,House>她可能想打扮得成熟点  混进酒吧
<5-4,House>She probably wants to look older to get into bars.

<5-5,Patient>我没有女儿
<5-5,Patient>I don't have a daughter.

<6-3,Patient>- You're gonna be fine. - I'm gonna die.

96
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,960
<6-4,Chase>这是可以治疗的  你只要去二楼就行了
<6-4,Chase>It's treatable-- as long as you go to the second floor.

97
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,050

<6-4,Chase>Next.

98
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,930
<7-1,House>发热吗  是不是表示我被传染了
<7-1,House>Fever? Does that mean I have it?

99
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,050
<7-2,Mary>身上出疹子吗
<7-2,Mary>Do you have a rash?

<7-5,House>Does your neck hurt? If it does, you hit the trifecta.

104

<7-5,House>那没什么
<7-5,House>It's nothing.

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,050
<10-3,House>她的疹子一周前就有了
<10-3,House>She's had the rash a week.

122
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,760
<10-3,House>如果是脑膜炎  早没命了
<10-3,House>If it was this meningitis she'd be dead by now.

123
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,690
<10-4,Cuddy>你们几个以为楼下的活儿都干完了
<10-4,Cuddy>You guys figure we're done down there?

124
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,140
<10-4,Cuddy>难道那八百号人里三层外三层的
<10-4,Cuddy>The 800 people milling around

<10-5,House>发热  皮疹  脖子疼  却不是脑膜炎
<10-5,House>Fever, rash, neck pains. Not meningitis.

128
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,340
<10-6,Cuddy>脑膜炎明明就是这么定义的
<10-6,Cuddy>It's the definition of meningitis.

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,710
<10-7,House>没错  椎管里有脓液
<10-7,House>Sure. Pus in the spinal canal

130
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,700
<10-7,House>头上下活动  会使你的脖子疼
<10-7,House>makes it hurt to move your head up and down,

131
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,610
<10-7,House>但她的脖子只有左右转动时才疼
<10-7,House>but her neck only hurts moving side to side.

132
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,770
<10-8,Cuddy>-噢  左右呀  -这不符合脑膜炎的症状
<10-8,Cuddy>- Oh, side to side. - Doesn't fit.

<10-11,House>对洛加尼斯小姐根本没用
<10-11,House>aren't gonna do Miss Louganis squat.

<10-12,Cuddy>你是存心不想去处理疫情
<10-12,Cuddy>You just don't want to deal with the epidemic.

138
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,830
<10-12,Cuddy>照你这么说
<10-12,Cuddy>That's right.

139
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,250
<10-13,House>我安排一个十二岁的孩子进行一系列危险
<10-13,House>I'm subjecting a 12-year-old to a battery of dangerous

<10-13,House>and invasive tests to avoid being bored.

141
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,860
<10-13,House>好吧 也许我是做得出来  但现在不是
<10-13,House>Okay, maybe I would do that. But I'm not.

142
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,050
<10-13,House>假如被你说对了
<10-13,House>If it turns out she's got meningitis,

143
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,870
<10-13,House>她确实是脑膜炎  我心悦诚服
<10-13,House>you're right, you win;

144
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,900
<10-13,House>但如果我们现在回楼下去  结果她死了
<10-13,House>but if we go back downstairs and she dies--

145
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,770
<10-13,House>你的脸会红得像猴屁股

<14-17,Foreman>That's not blood.

234
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,810
<14-17,Foreman>但是这个
<14-17,Foreman>But that--

235
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,950
<14-17,Foreman>这个是血
<14-17,Foreman>That's blood.

236
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,130
<15-1,Mary>你要把这个伸进我肚子里吗
<15-1,Mary>That's going into my stomach?

237
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,180
<15-2,Chase>洗胃结果表明你的消化道出血
<15-2,Chase>The lavage showed blood in your G.I. Tract.

238
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,890
<15-2,Chase>我们要找到出血位置
<15-2,Chase>We need to find where it's coming from.

239
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,820
<15-2,Chase>这没什么感觉的
<15-2,Chase>You won't feel it.

240
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,930
<15-2,Chase>我会给你的喉咙里喷点儿麻药
<15-2,Chase>I'm gonna numb the back of your throat,

241
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,240
<15-2,Chase>福曼医生会给你打针镇静剂
<15-2,Chase>and Dr. Foreman is gonna give you a sedative.

242
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,790
<15-2,Chase>张开嘴
<15-2,Chase>Open.

243
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,440
<16-1,Chase>咽下去
<16-1,Chase>Swallow.

244
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,350
<15-2,Chase>侧过身来
<15-2,Chase>Now lay on your side for me.

245
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,270
<15-2,Chase>好了  开始
<15-2,Chase>And... here we go.

246
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,300
<15-2,Chase>想想办法
<15-2,Chase>Yell fire or something.

247
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,810
<15-3,Foreman>各位  这里是高度感染区域
<15-3,Foreman>People, this area is highly contagious.

248
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,610
<15-3,Foreman>请退后  不要站在高度感染区内
<15-3,Foreman>Please step back. Highly contagious.

249
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,790
<15-4,Chase>可以了  尽量放松  玛丽
<15-4,Chase>All right. Try to relax, Mary.

250
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,500
<15-4,Chase>一会儿就好
<15-4,Chase>This shouldn't take too long.

251
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,410
<15-5,Foreman>我看不出任何伤口或者病灶
<15-5,Foreman>I don't see any tears or lesions.

252
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,760
<15-6,Chase>行了
<15-6,Chase>All right.

253
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,760
<15-6,Chase>可以看到胃部了
<15-6,Chase>I'm in the stomach.

254
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,090
<15-6,Chase>没有出血
<15-6,Chase>It's not bleeding.

255
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,050
<15-7,Foreman>她口腔里有超过一汤勺的血
<15-7,Foreman>There was more than a tablespoon of blood in the mouth

256
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,060
<15-7,Foreman>所以一定有出血的地方
<15-7,Foreman>so it's gotta be there.

257
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,290
<15-7,Foreman>会不会是小肠
<15-7,Foreman>Maybe her small intestine.

258
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
<15-8,Chase>消化道有30尺
<15-8,Chase>Thirty feet of digestive tract,

259
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,700
<15-8,Chase>哪里都有可能
<15-8,Chase>it could be anywhere in there.

260
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,770
<15-8,Chase>我们用这个是看不到的
<15-8,Chase>We're not gonna see it with this.

261
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,810
<16-1,Chase>信不信由你
<16-1,Chase>Believe it or not,

262
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,480
<16-1,Chase>这是个照相机
<16-1,Chase>this is a camera.

263
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,750
<16-1,Chase>你把它吞了
<16-1,Chase>You swallow it,

264
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,610
<16-1,Chase>它会穿过你的整个消化系统
<16-1,Chase>and it goes all the way through your system.

265
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,050
<16-1,Chase>天线接收到这个胶囊发出的信号
<16-1,Chase>The antennae pick up the signal from the pill.

266
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,390
<16-1,Chase>然后我们可以看到你小肠的画面
<16-1,Chase>Then we look at the video of your intestines,

267
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,420
<16-1,Chase>找到出血点  把它补好
<16-1,Chase>see where the blood is coming from, and fix it.

268
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,590
<16-1,Chase>好吗  需要水吗
<16-1,Chase>All right? Water?

269
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,640
<16-1,Chase>喝下去吧
<16-1,Chase>Down the hatch.

270
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,720
<17-1,House>我好像看过这部电影
<17-1,House>Think I've seen this movie.

271
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,600
<17-1,House>结局有点黑暗
<17-1,House>The ending's kind of dark.

272
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,860
<17-1,House>来一个吗
<17-1,House>You want one?

273
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,320
<17-1,House>为什么是你做内窥镜
<17-1,House>How come you did the endoscopy?

274
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,280
<17-3,Foreman>-他找我帮忙  -她的血压太高了
<17-3,Foreman>- He asked for help. - Her blood pressure was high.

275
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,140
<17-4,House>福曼不是你的老板
<17-4,House>Foreman is not your boss.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,210
<17-4,House>我叫你做事的时候...
<17-4,House>When I tell you to do something--

277
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,230
<17-4,House>喔  等会儿
<17-4,House>Whoa. Hold it there.

278
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,130
<17-4,House>倒退几帧
<17-4,House>Back it up a couple of frames.

279
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,730
<17-4,House>看点来了
<17-4,House>Oh, yeah. That's your money shot.

280
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,780
<17-5,Foreman>-我没有看到任何东西  -没有吗
<17-5,Foreman>- I don't see anything. - Really?

281
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,840
<17-6,House>她小肠右侧那个"巨大"的东西
<17-6,House>"Ginormous" thing on the right side of her intestine.

282
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
<17-6,House>没有吸引到你吗
<17-6,House>That doesn't intrigue you?

283
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,490
<17-7,Foreman>你所谓"巨大"是非常大
<17-7,Foreman>Does "Ginormous" mean really big,

284
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,390
<17-7,Foreman>还是非常非常小
<17-7,Foreman>or really, really small?

285
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,460
<17-7,Foreman>-我是看不出什么东西来  -是那儿吗
<17-7,Foreman>- 'Cause I don't see anything. - There?

286
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,280
<17-8,Chase>是Dieulafoy病吗
<17-8,Chase>The Dieulafoy?

288
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,980
<17-9,Foreman>是的话  我们可以给那些血管消消肿
<17-9,Foreman>Well, we can burn off the swollen blood vessel,

289
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,240
<17-9,Foreman>可这不能解释她的其它症状
<17-9,Foreman>but it still doesn't account for her other symptoms.

290
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,340
<17-10,House>是不能  但它说明了一些问题
<17-10,House>No, but it does tell us something.

291
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,510
<17-10,House>只是我还不知道是什么
<17-10,House>Though I have no idea what.

292
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,610
<17-11,Foreman>可能是肠套叠的前兆
<17-11,Foreman>Could be a precursor to intestinal intussusception.

293
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,850
<17-12,House>前兆不会导致其它任何症状  还会是什么
<17-12,House>Precursor isn't causing all her other symptoms. What else?

294
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,620
<17-13,Cuddy>你  马上去大厅
<17-13,Cuddy>You, in the lobby now.

295
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,840
<17-14,House>我腿疼  我也有蓝色小纸条
<17-14,House>I hurt my leg. I have a note.

296
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,180
<17-15,Cuddy>一个小时已过  算起来是三个小时了
<17-15,Cuddy>You had your hour-- three, actually.

297
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,800
<17-16,House>奇斯医生  我和你说过
<17-16,House>Dr. Chase, I told you to

298
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,330
<17-16,House>时间到了提醒我们
<17-16,House>tell us when our time was up.

299
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,230
<17-16,House>-她肠内出血  -她可以等等
<17-16,House>- She has intestinal bleeding. - She'll wait.

300
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,890
<17-17,Cuddy>又拉来两车人  楼下需要你帮忙
<17-17,Cuddy>Two more buses just arrived. We need you downstairs.

301
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,060
<17-18,House>错  你需要的是更多的护士
<17-18,House>No, you need more nurses,

302
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,920
<17-18,House>但你裁减了护士的人手
<17-18,House>but you cut back on the nursing staff,

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,980
<17-18,House>所以现在你叫医生干护士的活
<17-18,House>so now you've got doctors doing what nurses should be doing.

304
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,300
<17-18,House>这我承认
<17-18,House>That's true.

305
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,490
<17-19,Cuddy>不过我在想这是不是
<17-19,Cuddy>I wonder if that has anything to do

306
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,290
<17-19,Cuddy>你导致我们损失一亿美金的呢
<17-19,Cuddy>with you costing us $100 million.

307
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,580
<17-19,Cuddy>[请注意  如果您没有蓝色的表格]
<17-19,Cuddy>Attention. If you do not have a blue form,

308
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,420
<17-19,Cuddy>[请不要离开隔离区域]
<17-19,Cuddy>you will not be allowed to leave the quarantine area.

309
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,420
<18-1,House>走吧  你自由了
<18-1,House>Go. Be free.

310
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,850
<18-2,Foreman>如果不是肠套叠
<18-2,Foreman>If it's not the intussusception,

311
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,750
<18-2,Foreman>会不会是胃癌
<18-2,Foreman>what about stomach cancer?

312
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,190
<18-3,Wilson>-她腹痛吗  -没有
<18-3,Wilson>- Does she have any abdominal pain? - No.

313
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,480
<18-5,Wilson>那就不是胃癌  查过败血症没
<18-5,Wilson>Then it's not stomach cancer. Have you ruled out sepsis?

314
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,060
<18-6,Chase>脊椎穿刺和血涂片结果显示无感染
<18-6,Chase>The L.P. and blood smears showed no signs of infection.

315
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,600
<18-6,Chase>拿着  吃了这两片药就可以走了
<18-6,Chase>Here. Take these two pills and you can go.

316
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,600
<18-7,Foreman>化验室现在是超负荷工作
<18-7,Foreman>Well, the lab's working at double their capacity.

317
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,910
<18-7,Foreman>可能会有人忙中出错
<18-7,Foreman>Maybe someone screwed up.

318
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,700
<18-8,House>不发热  无脖子疼
<18-8,House>No fever, no neck pain.

319
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,410
<18-8,House>乘电梯到三楼
<18-8,House>Take the elevator to the third floor--

320
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,260
<18-9,Wilson>喂  喂  喂  不是那个表格
<18-9,Wilson>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wrong form.

321
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,210
<18-9,Wilson>没有发热  脖子也不痛  她没事
<18-9,Wilson>No fever, no neck pain. She's fine.

322
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,290
<18-10,House>她的头发没有氯的味道
<18-10,House>Smell her hair. No chlorine.

323
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,810
<18-10,House>说明她不是从泳池那边过来的
<18-10,House>Which means she wasn't at the pool,

324
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,160
<18-10,House>就是说她主动闯进隔离区域的
<18-10,House>which means she's come to a quarantined area...

325
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,770
<18-10,House>因此她要么是傻子要么是疯子
<18-10,House>because she's an idiot or she's insane.

326
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,730
<18-10,House>你说谁会这么笨啊
<18-10,House>No one is that stupid.

327
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,720
<18-10,House>精神病区在东楼  拜拜
<18-10,House>East wing, psych ward. Bye-bye.

328
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,520
<18-11,Chase>骨癌会导致脖子疼
<18-11,Chase>Neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer.

329
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,730
<18-12,House>已经查到B开头的了啊  干得好
<18-12,House>You up to the B's? Well done.

330
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,010
<18-13,Wilson>这可以解释她为何有脑膜炎的症状
<18-13,Wilson>That would account for all her meningeal symptoms--

331
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,580
<18-13,Wilson>皮疹  发热  你没事
<18-13,Wilson>rash, fever. You're fine.

332
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,630
<18-13,Wilson>服下这两片药
<18-13,Wilson>Take these two pills.

333
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,660
<18-14,House>去取她的骨髓样本
<18-14,House>Get a sample of her bone marrow.

334
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,800
<18-16,House>-就在这儿吗  -利用休息时间
<18-16,House>- From here? - Break time.

335
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,070
<18-17,Foreman>我要的时间可不止十五分钟
<18-17,Foreman>I need more than 15 minutes.

336
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,240
<18-18,House>把奇斯的也用上
<18-18,House>Use Chase's break too.

337
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,710
<18-18,House>去吧
<18-18,House>Go.

338
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,540
<19-1,Wilson>你干脆炒了奇斯得了
<19-1,Wilson>You should just fire Chase.

339
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,460
<19-2,House>什么  那多没乐趣啊
<19-2,House>What, and miss out on all this fun?

340
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,690
<19-3,Wilson>那你打算先折磨他一阵子再开除他
<19-3,Wilson>So you're gonna torture him for a while and then fire him?

341
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,420
<19-3,Wilson>你还真无情
<19-3,Wilson>That's cold.

342
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,300
<19-4,House>你不觉得他活该吗
<19-4,House>You don't think he has it coming?

343
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,630
<19-5,Wilson>-我说了开了他  -你这才无情呢
<19-5,Wilson>- Hey, I said fire him. - That's cold.

344
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,480
<19-6,House>-他只是想保住自己的饭碗  -开玩笑
<19-6,House>- All he did was save his job. - What?

345
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,310
<19-7,Wilson>他明显搅得你不得安宁
<19-7,Wilson>He completely screwed you over.

346
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,770
<19-8,House>右转
<19-8,House>Right rudder.

347
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,730
<19-8,House>侧倾  侧倾  侧倾
<19-8,House>Bank, bank, bank.

348
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,010
<19-9,Cuddy>咖啡好喝吗

<22-7,House>他们在图书馆一坐就是二十个钟头
<22-7,House>don't leave the library for 20-hour stretches.

407
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,930
<22-7,House>他们才是我行我素的人
<22-7,House>They're the ones who don't care what you think.

410
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,160
<22-8,Wilson>找有亚洲名字的

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
<22-9,House>实际上  那些亚洲孩子大概
<22-9,House>Actually, the Asian kids are probably

412
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,060
<22-9,House>只是迫于家长的压力
<22-9,House>just responding to parental pressure,

413
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,940
<22-9,House>不过我的观点依然成立
<22-9,House>but my point is still valid.

414
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,150
<23-1,Teammate 1>医生说没说你几时能离开这里
<23-1,Teammate 1>So when do they think you're getting out of here?

<23-4,Teammate 1>这些设备看上去像是出土文物
<23-4,Teammate 1>This equipment looks like it's 100 years old.

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,020
<23-10,Foreman>我们还没查明究竟是什么造成她的...
<23-10,Foreman>We still don't know yet exactly what's causing the--

<24-20,House>还有别吃甜甜圈  多吃点提子麦麸
<24-20,House>And try some Raisin Bran instead of the donuts.

461
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,580
<24-20,House>做个CT扫描  看看有没有颅内出血
<24-20,House>Do a C.T. Scan. Check for intracranial bleeding.

462
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,210
<24-21,Foreman>门都没有  放射科已经爆满了
<24-21,Foreman>Not a chance. Radiology's totally swamped.

463
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,890
<24-22,House>我们的病人若是颅内出血
<24-22,House>If our patient's bleeding into her brain,

464
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,260
<24-22,House>会在八小时之内死亡
<24-22,House>she's gonna be dead in eight hours.

465
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,120
<24-23,Foreman>她是可能会死
<24-23,Foreman>She could be,

466
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,570
<24-23,Foreman>但如果脑膜炎病人不做CT就一定会死
<24-23,Foreman>but a meningitis patient will be without a C.T. Scan.

467
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,640
<24-24,Chase>我在医学院的时候  有个教我的老教授
<24-24,Chase>When I was in med school, I had this old professor

468
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,560
<24-25,House>老是摸你的敏感部位吗
<24-25,House>Who touched you in the naughty place?

469
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,800
<24-26,Chase>在CT扫描技术诞生之前
<24-26,Chase>Before the CT scan was introduced,

470
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,370
<24-26,Chase>他是经颅超声方面的专家
<24-26,Chase>he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.

471
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,530
<24-27,House>是个古老的办法
<24-27,House>Ancient,

472
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,240
<24-27,House>但如果出血量大应该可以看出来
<24-27,House>but if there's enough bleeding it might work.

473
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,480
<24-27,House>你去  按照这个
<24-27,House>Okay, do what the guy

474
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
<24-27,House>不是神经学专家的家伙说的做
<24-27,House>who didn't specialize in Neurology said.

475
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,640
<24-28,Chase>这是我点子
<24-28,Chase>It was my idea.

476
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,610
<24-29,House>继续去查找从Q到Z开头的
<24-29,House>You've still gotta cover "Q" To "Z".

477
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,490
<25-1,House>不好意思  迟到了  我去上大号了
<25-1,House>Sorry I'm late. I was taking a dump.

478
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,610
<25-1,House>我猜想在这之后
<25-1,House>I'm guessing I'm better off

479
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,860
<25-2,Wilson>跟你面试比较好
<25-2,Wilson>interviewing right after than right before.

<25-3,House>你是真会说四种语言
<25-3,House>You actually speak four languages,

483
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,630
<25-3,House>还是指望着
<25-3,House>or are you just banking on

484
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,730
<25-3,House>面试你的人统统不会
<25-3,House>never being interviewed by anyone who does?

485
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,410
<25-3,House>我确实会  而且还会用另外两种骂人
<25-3,House>It's true, and I can swear in two more.

486
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,010
<25-4,House>为什么不在黑泽尔医生那儿干了
<25-4,House>Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?

487
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,320
<25-4,House>是不是爱上他  然后不知所措了
<25-4,House>Did you fall for him and can't handle it,

488
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,020
<25-4,House>还是反过来他爱上了你
<25-4,House>or was it the other way around?

489
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,120
<25-5,Wilson>是啊  大多数的雇佣关系都是这样结束的吧
<25-5,Wilson>Yes, well, pretty much every fellowship ends that way.

490
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,450
<25-5,Wilson>不  不是那回事
<25-5,Wilson>No, it was nothing like that.

<25-7,House>I know you like to say outrageous things

497
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,930

<25-15,Wilson>叫你要当心穿绿色鞋子的女人
<25-15,Wilson>tell you to avoid women wearing green shoes?

511
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,490
<25-16,House>眼神笑容都可以伪装
<25-16,House>The eyes can mislead, a smile can lie,

512
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,870
<25-16,House>但是脚上的鞋子总是会说实话
<25-16,House>but the shoes always tell the truth.

513
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,850
<25-17,Wilson>她穿的是普拉达  说明她品味很好
<25-17,Wilson>They were Prada. Means she has good taste.

514
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,230
<25-18,House>根本就不是普拉达
<25-18,House>They were not Prada.

515
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,960
<25-18,House>只有狠狠地踩在你的小弟弟上
<25-18,House>You wouldn't know Prada

516
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,140
<25-18,House>你才会知道它是一双普拉达
<25-18,House>if one stepped on your scrotum.

517
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,410
<25-19,Wilson>好吧  它们很好看  尖尖的
<25-19,Wilson>Okay. Well, they were nice. Pointy.

518
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,900
<25-20,House>正是  它们非常时髦  但穿起来很疼
<25-20,House>Exactly. They were stylish, and very painful to wear.

519
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,890
<25-20,House>只有一个肤浅
<25-20,House>Only an incredibly shallow,

520
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,590
<25-20,House>没安全感的的女人才会宁可成天忍受痛苦
<25-20,House>insecure woman would rather be in pain all day long

521
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,400
<25-20,House>也不要穿样子一般但舒舒服服的鞋子
<25-20,House>than wear a decent-looking, comfortable shoe,

522
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,130
<25-20,House>我这里最不需要的就是这种女人
<25-20,House>and that's exactly the type I don't need around here.

523
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,060
<25-21,Wilson>不对  可以忍受这么多痛苦的人
<25-21,Wilson>No. Someone who can handle a lot of pain...

<25-21,Wilson>正是你需要的
<25-21,Wilson>is exactly the type you do need.

<27-2,Foreman>这可以帮助我们找出问题
<27-2,Foreman>This should help us figure out what's going on.

530
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,300
<28-1,House>蓝色表格交给警卫
<28-1,House>Blue form to the security guard.

531

<28-2,Wilson>你对任何人都不会满意的
<28-2,Wilson>You're not gonna be happy with anyone.

532
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,860
<28-3,House>所以呢  你的建议是
<28-3,House>So what, your advice is...

533
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,700
<28-3,House>雇个我不满意的然后还要高高兴兴的
<28-3,House>hire someone I'm not happy with and be happy?

534
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,690
<28-4,Wilson>不  我的建议要中肯得多
<28-4,Wilson>No, my advice is much more subtle.

535
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,540
<28-4,Wilson>别再这么混球
<28-4,Wilson>Stop being an ass.

<28-4,Wilson>你总是找出一些微不足道的缺点
<28-4,Wilson>You always find some tiny little flaw

537
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,510
<28-4,Wilson>拒人们于千里之外
<28-4,Wilson>to push people away.

538
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,640
<28-5,House>现在是人们了
<28-5,House>Oh, now it's people.

539
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,490
<28-5,House>我以为我们在谈雇用员工呢
<28-5,House>I thought we were talking about fellowship applicants.

540
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,620
<28-6,Wilson>这种事儿你有前科
<28-6,Wilson>You have a history of this.

541
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,580
<28-7,House>当我决定把你推开时

00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,460
<28-7,House>让你狠狠地栽个跟头  摔得头破血流

<29-4,Coach>不  没有
<29-4,Coach>No, nothing like that.

580
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,880
<29-4,Coach>那为什么她会脑出血  她会好起来吗
<29-4,Coach>Then why is she bleeding? Is she gonna be all right?

581
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,780
<29-5,Foreman>对不起  我们现在还不清楚
<29-5,Foreman>I'm sorry. We still don't know.

<30-1,Chase>不是中毒  没有肿瘤  也不是骨癌
<30-1,Chase>No toxins, no tumor, no bone cancer.

586
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,110
<30-2,Foreman>肾功能衰竭可能引起
<30-2,Foreman>Renal failure could cause

<30-2,Foreman>皮疹  发热和肌肉疼痛

588
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,080
<30-2,Foreman>也许是种遗传性肾功能紊乱
<30-2,Foreman>Maybe it's some sort of genetic kidney disorder

589
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,510
<30-3,Chase>没有家族病史
<30-3,Chase>No family history.

592
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,200
<30-5,Chase>你想根据可能出现的症状
<30-5,Chase>You want to do a differential

593
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,580
<30-5,Chase>进行鉴别诊断吗
<30-5,Chase>based on symptoms that might happen?

594
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,960
<30-6,Foreman>-你有更好的主意吗  -住口
<30-6,Foreman>- You got a better idea? - Stop it.

00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,850
<30-7,House>别管那些我们不知道的
<30-7,House>Stop looking for things we don't know

596
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,720
<30-7,House>把注意力放在已知的事情上
<30-7,House>and focus on what we do know.

597
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,180
<30-7,House>除了那上面写着的
<30-7,House>What do we actually know,

598
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,700
<30-7,House>我们明确知道的还有什么
<30-7,House>besides what's up there?

<30-7,House>快点
<30-7,House>Come on.

601
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,250
<30-7,House>告诉我你们所知道的有多难
<30-7,House>How hard can it be to tell me what you already know?

602
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,630
<30-9,Foreman>-她十二岁  -长时间泡在泳池里
<30-9,Foreman>- She's 12. - She spends a lot of time in pools

603
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,960
<30-9,Foreman>接触到化学物质
<30-9,Foreman>exposure to chemicals.

<30-12,House>还有呢
<30-12,House>What else?

606
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,680
<30-12,House>快想
<30-12,House>Come on!

607
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,300
<30-12,House>我们就把你安排在这儿
<30-12,House>We're gonna put you right here.

608
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,300
<31-1,House>我们遗漏了什么
<31-1,House>We're missing something.

609
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,750
<31-3,House>-什么  -我要是知道  就不会遗漏了
<31-3,House>- What? - Well, if I knew that, it wouldn't be missing.

610
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,360
<31-4,Chase>可能她是领养的
<31-4,Chase>Maybe she's adopted

611
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,500
<31-4,Chase>我们看到的不是她的家族史
<31-4,Chase>and we've got the wrong history.

612
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,190
<31-5,House>不会  她的眼睛像母亲
<31-5,House>No. She's got her mom's eyes

613
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,350
<31-5,House>一头的红发和父亲一模一样
<31-5,House>and a red patch of hair just like Dad.

614
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,610
<31-6,Foreman>会不会是过敏反应
<31-6,Foreman>What about an allergic reaction?

615
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,610
<31-7,Chase>这样皮疹和肌肉疼痛都解释得通
<31-7,Chase>That could explain the rash and muscle pain,

616
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,650
<31-7,Chase>但解释不了出血和失神发作
<31-7,Chase>but probably not the bleeding or seizures.

617
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,440
<31-8,House>好多的气球
<31-8,House>That's a lot of balloons.

618
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,800
<31-9,Chase>你觉得她对聚酯过敏吗
<31-9,Chase>You think she's allergic to polyester?

619
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,760
<31-10,House>除非她这么些年都是裸体上场比赛的
<31-10,House>Not unless she's been competing in the nude all these years.

620
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,060
<31-11,Chase>那你是怎么想的  这些气球说明什么问题
<31-11,Chase>Then what are you thinking? What do the balloons mean?

621
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,820
<31-12,House>要是我们所认为的皮疹
<31-12,House>What if the rash

622
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,550
<31-12,House>不是皮疹呢
<31-12,House>isn't a rash?

623
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,500
<31-13,Foreman>你在说什么呢
<31-13,Foreman>What are you talking about?

624
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,450
<31-14,House>气球谁送的
<31-14,House>Who gave her the balloons?

625
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,470
<31-15,Foreman>她队里的几个女孩子
<31-15,Foreman>Some of the girls from her team.

<31-15,Foreman>她们经常来看她
<31-15,Foreman>They've been visiting her pretty regularly,

627
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,970
<31-17,Foreman>-但没有一个生病  -男孩儿们呢
<31-17,Foreman>- but none of them are sick. - What about the guys?

628
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,410
<31-17,Foreman>也没有一个生病
<31-17,Foreman>None of them are sick either.

629
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,000
<31-18,House>具体哪些男孩来看过她
<31-18,House>Which guys visited her?

630
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,130
<31-19,Foreman>实际上  没有
<31-19,Foreman>Actually, none.

<31-20,House>她可爱迷人
<31-20,House>She's cute. She's nice.

<31-20,House>还是个出色的跳水选手
<31-20,House>She's a kick-ass diver.

633
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,580
<31-20,House>男孩子们为了接近她
<31-20,House>You'd think the guys would be falling

634
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,290
<31-20,House>会争得你死我活
<31-20,House>all over themselves to get close to her.

635
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,370
<31-20,House>她才十二岁
<31-20,House>She's 12.

636
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,520
<31-21,Foreman>她队里最小的男孩也已经十六了
<31-21,Foreman>The youngest guy on her team is 16.

637
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,670
<31-22,House>那好  也许他们只是对她不感兴趣
<31-22,House>Okay, so maybe they're just not interested,

638
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,000
<31-23,Chase>-或者  -他们在躲着她
<31-23,Chase>- or - They're avoiding her.

639
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,330
<31-24,House>她的血涂片上有细胞碎片吗
<31-24,House>There any cell fragments in her blood smears?

640
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,730
<31-25,Chase>没有  红细胞都完好无损
<31-25,Chase>No. Red blood cells were intact.

641
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,670
<31-26,House>再查一遍
<31-26,House>Check 'em again.

642
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,520
<32-1,Chase>现在看上去像是从搅拌机里出来的一样
<32-1,Chase>Blood looks like it's been put through the blender now.

643
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,830
<32-2,House>-你检查完了没  -你是对的
<32-2,House>- You done yet? - You were right.

644
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,410
<32-2,House>皮疹不是皮疹
<32-2,House>The rash wasn't a rash.

645
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,890
<32-3,Foreman>她的皮肤里在出血  是紫癜
<32-3,Foreman>She's bleeding into her skin. It's purpura.

646
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,450
<32-4,Chase>血栓性血小板减少性紫癜
<32-4,Chase>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?

647
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,770
<32-5,House>T打头  你就差那么点儿
<32-5,House>Starts with "T". You were so close.

648
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,320
<32-6,Foreman>什么会引发这个
<32-6,Foreman>What could have set it off?

649
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,750
<32-6,Foreman>她的血培养里没有大肠杆菌
<32-6,Foreman>She had no traces of E. Coli in her cultures.

650
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,020
<32-6,Foreman>显然她还没到更年期
<32-6,Foreman>She's obviously not menopausal,

651
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,120
<32-6,Foreman>所以不是雌激素的原因
<32-6,Foreman>so no estrogen.

652
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,780
<32-7,House>还有另外一种可能
<32-7,House>There is one other possible cause.

653
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,820
<32-8,Chase>哦  上帝啊
<32-8,Chase>Oh, God.

654
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,670
<32-8,Chase>怀孕时
<32-8,Chase>Pregnancy causes...

655
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,680
<33-1,House>女人身体内部发生生化反应
<33-1,House>all kinds of chemical and biological changes... in a woman's body--

656
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,190
<33-1,House>或者一个女孩的身体  具体情况不同
<33-1,House>or a girl's body, as the case may be.

657
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,770
<33-1,House>在极为罕见的情况下
<33-1,House>In extremely rare cases,

658
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,140
<33-1,House>所有东西会像发疯一样
<33-1,House>everything goes haywire.

659
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,960
<33-1,House>这叫作T.T.P
<33-1,House>It's called T.T.P.

660
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,210
<33-1,House>血液开始大量凝结
<33-1,House>Blood starts clotting like crazy

661
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,470
<33-1,House>阻塞大脑和肾脏的血管
<33-1,House>and clogs the vessels in your brain and kidneys.

662
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,980
<33-1,House>红细胞穿过凝血块时
<33-1,House>Red blood cells end up getting shredded

663
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,970
<33-1,House>挤得粉身碎骨
<33-1,House>as they squeeze past the clot,

664
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,980
<33-1,House>就像一个胖子在酒吧里挤来挤去
<33-1,House>like a fat guy in a crowded bar.

665
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,050
<33-1,House>你肯定知道那是什么样
<33-1,House>I'm sure you know what that's like.

666
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,170
<33-1,House>我是说  你才十二岁
<33-1,House>I mean, you're only 12,

667
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,310
<33-1,House>但你已经长大成人了  对吗
<33-1,House>but you're all grown up, right?

668
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:37,000
<33-1,House>自己一个人出门  在酒店房间待着
<33-1,House>Travel on your own, hang out in hotel rooms...

669
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,440
<33-1,House>和队友们一起叫客房服务
<33-1,House>getting room service with your teammates.

670
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,520
<33-1,House>可能有人偷偷带进几瓶啤酒
<33-1,House>Maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers.

671
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,190
<33-1,House>你们开始玩儿转瓶游戏[转瓶选择接吻对象]
<33-1,House>You start playing spin the bottle.

672
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,140
<33-1,House>接下来你发现自己醒来
<33-1,House>Next thing you know you're waking up

673
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,430
<33-1,House>全身上下只剩双袜子
<33-1,House>with nothing on but your socks.

674
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,260
<33-3,House>-不是那样的  -当然不是
<33-3,House>- It wasn't like that. - Of course not.

<33-3,House>-是你想要的  -是的 是我要的
<33-3,House>- You wanted it. - Yeah. I did.

676

<33-4,Mary>结果没想到他是个混蛋  可是...
<33-4,Mary>He turned out to be a jerk, but--

677
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,560
<33-5,House>根据新泽西州法律  准确称呼应该是重罪犯
<33-5,House>Actually, under New Jersey law, the term is felon.

678
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,340
<33-6,Mary>我知道自己在做什么
<33-6,Mary>I knew what I was doing.

679
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,670
<33-7,House>我们要采用一种叫血浆除去法的治疗方法
<33-7,House>We're gonna have to do something called plasmapheresis.

680
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,140
<33-7,House>清除你血液里的抗体
<33-7,House>Cleans the antibodies from your blood.

681
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,840
<33-7,House>我们还要终止你的妊娠
<33-7,House>We're also gonna have to terminate the pregnancy.

682
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,750
<33-8,Mary>你们要告诉我的父母吗
<33-8,Mary>You gonna tell my parents?

683
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,410
<33-9,House>总要有人去说  石头剪刀布
<33-9,House>Someone should. Rock, paper, scissors?

684
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,790
<33-10,Mary>他们不需要知道
<33-10,Mary>They don't need to know.

685
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,400
<33-10,Mary>我会没事的
<33-10,Mary>I'll be all right.

686
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,190
<33-10,Mary>当然你会
<33-10,Mary>Of course you will.

687
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,930
<33-11,House>我想如果你已经成熟到有月经的话
<33-11,House>I mean, if you're old enough to bleed out of your vagina,

688
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,530
<33-11,House>很明显你已经成熟到可以
<33-11,House>then obviously you're mature enough...

689
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,730
<33-11,House>处理像不依靠父母
<33-11,House>to handle a simple thing
