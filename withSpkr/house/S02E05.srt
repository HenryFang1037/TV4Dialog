75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,690
<3-21,Wilson>不能解释这么低的白细胞
<3-21,Wilson>Doesn't explain the low white count.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,090
<3-21,Wilson>他是黑人

<3-22,House>我假设他不只是黑而已
<3-22,House>I'm assuming he's not just really dirty,

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,290
<3-22,House>他应该有非洲家系
<3-22,House>but is of african descent.

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,990
<3-22,House>他白细胞这么低是什么意思?
<3-22,House>Which means he'd have a lower white count.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,090
<3-23,Wilson>没这么低
<3-23,Wilson>Not this low.

81
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,390
<3-23,Wilson>他是摔跤手
<3-23,Wilson>He's a wrestler.

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,190
<3-24,House>也许他用利尿剂来减肥
<3-24,House>Probably uses diuretics to cut weight.

83
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,390
<3-24,House>这个也能引起低白细胞
<3-24,House>It can also cause low white count.

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,490
<3-23,Wilson>不会这么低

<3-29,Wilson>Something's missing.

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,790
<3-30,House>去找出来是什么
<3-30,House>Find out what it is.

90
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,990
<3-31,Foreman>我还不知道是什么意思
<3-31,Foreman>I don't even know what that means.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,790
<3-32,House>去找出来
<3-32,House>Well, figure it out, find it out,

<5-11,Foreman>On admission his bac was 2.0.

123
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,090
<5-11,Foreman>肝化酶已经分解了它
<5-11,Foreman>Liver enzymes off the chart.

124
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,390
<5-12,Cameron>这是个毕业狂欢周末
<5-12,Cameron>It was graduation weekend.

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,990
<5-12,Cameron>他在这之前到几个星期里几乎都没喝酒
<5-12,Cameron>He barely drank in the weeks before that.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,290
<5-12,Cameron>他在整个摔跤赛季根本就没喝酒
<5-12,Cameron>And he didn't drink at all during his,wrestling season.

127
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,690
<5-13,Foreman>如果你相信他的话
<5-13,Foreman>If you believe him.

128
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,590
<5-14,Cameron>我做了酒精测试
<5-14,Cameron>I did a tox screen--

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,990
<5-15,Chase>她相不相信他不重要
<5-15,Chase>it doesn't matter if she believes him or not.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,390
<5-15,Chase>但它确实有可能
<5-15,Chase>It's already in the chart.

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,590
<5-15,Chase>我们应该去找不见的东西
<5-15,Chase>We're supposed to find out what's missing.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,890
<6-1,Wilson>哇,这个
<6-1,Wilson>Well this--

133
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,290
<6-1,Wilson>太棒了
<6-1,Wilson>this is perfect.

<6-2,House>星期三晚上请我去吃饭吧
<6-2,House>Invite me to dinner thursday night.

<6-5,Wilson>时速150英里的摩托车
<6-5,Wilson>Two-wheeled vehicles that travel 150 miles,an hour

139
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,890
<6-5,Wilson>这个瘸着腿又不负责的药罐子不配他
<6-5,Wilson>don't really go well with crippled,irresponsible drug addicts.

140
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,390
<6-6,House>实际上摩托车每小时开180英里
<6-6,House>Actually, two-wheeled vehicles that go,180 miles an hour

141
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,090
<6-6,House>一个健康的,负责的设计师也不配他
<6-6,House>do not go well with healthy,,responsible architects

142
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,290
<6-6,House>不知道怎么区分刹车和转弯
<6-6,House>who don't know how to separate,braking and turning.

143
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,690
<6-6,House>好消息是降价了
<6-6,House>The good news is it brings the price,right down.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,190
<6-7,Wilson>你要把它退回去
<6-7,Wilson>You're taking it back.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,590
<6-7,Wilson>妈呀
<6-7,Wilson>Mom.

146
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,090
<6-8,Wilson>讲讲我们要一起吃的饭吧
<6-8,Wilson>How 'bout we talk about this over dinner?

147
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,790
<6-8,Wilson>别提吃饭了
<6-8,Wilson>Forget dinner.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,390
<6-8,Wilson>你要去自杀?
<6-8,Wilson>You're gonna kill yourself?

149
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,790
<6-9,Chase>好车

<6-10,House>看吧,这才是你该做的
<6-10,House>See, that's how you do it.

<6-10,House>恭维,晚饭
<6-10,House>Compliments, dinner.

153

<6-11,Cameron>你的拐杖怎么办?,请我吃饭我就告诉你
<6-11,Cameron>What do you with your cane?

154
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,790
<6-12,House>Evel knievel(魔幻摩托车游戏)有一样的构造
<6-12,House>Evel knievel had the same set up.

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,590
<6-13,Cameron>他摔断了他全身的骨头
<6-13,Cameron>And he broke every bonein his body.

156
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,190
<6-14,Foreman>我们研究了所有的影像
<6-14,Foreman>we went through all the imaging studies

157
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,890
<6-14,Foreman>重做了血细胞培养
<6-14,Foreman>and redid the blood culturesand...

158
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,090
<6-15,House>我不要那些旧东西,我要新信息
<6-15,House>I don't want hand-me-downs.,I want brand new stuff.

159
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,390
<6-18,Foreman>什么都没有
<6-18,Foreman>There's nothing--

160
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,190
<6-18,Foreman>什么都没有不见
<6-18,Foreman>there's nothing missing!

161
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,390
<6-17,House>对不起我没有听到最后一点
<6-17,House>Sorry, I didn't catchthat last part.

162
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,590
<6-18,Foreman>我们什么都不能做
<6-18,Foreman>There's nothing elsewe can do.

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,290
<6-19,House>你们查了警局记录没有?
<6-19,House>You check the police report?

164
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,790
<6-20,Foreman>查什么?
<6-20,Foreman>On what?

165
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,490
<6-21,House>她妈妈的车祸
<6-21,House>On his mom's car accident.

166
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,490
<6-22,Cameron>那个发生在15年前了
<6-22,Cameron>It was 15 years ago.

167
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,990
<6-22,Cameron>那孩子根本就不在车上
<6-22,Cameron>The kid wasn't even in the car.

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,190
<6-23,House>她突然驶离了直线,在大白天干燥的宽马路上
<6-23,House>She veered off a straight,,dry road in broad daylight.

169
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,390
<6-23,House>你对这点不奇怪吗?
<6-23,House>That doesn't seem odd to you?

170
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,190
<6-24,Foreman>可能她正在换电台或做其它的事而分心了
<6-24,Foreman>She probably got distracted changing radio,stationsor something.

171
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,790
<6-25,House>警察也这么想的
<6-25,House>That's whatthe police thought.

172
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,290
<6-25,House>他们当然不知道她是这个家的一员
<6-25,House>Of course they didn't know that she has,a family member

173
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,790
<6-25,House>经常性的休克,还可以做事?
<6-25,House>who is frequently incapacitated by,shock-like sensations.

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,890
<6-26,Cameron>基因分析排除这种可能性
<6-26,Cameron>A genetic componentseems unlikely.

175
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,990
<6-27,House>这很有意思
<6-27,House>But it's interesting.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,390
<6-27,House>一种纤维神经瘤症可能会引起这种休克
<6-27,House>A type two neurofibromatosiscould,cause the shock.

177
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,190
<6-28,Foreman>你早就知道这个被漏掉了?
<6-28,Foreman>You knew this was missing?

178
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,190
<6-29,House>我只知道某样东西被漏掉了
<6-29,House>I knew something was missing.

179
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,690
<6-29,House>也许是这个,也许是别的
<6-29,House>Maybe this.Maybe something else.

180
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,490
<6-29,House>对第22对长染色体做DNA分析
<6-29,House>Get a dna analysis of the long arm ,of chromosome 22.

181
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,590
<6-30,House>你真的要跟你妻子吃饭?
<6-30,House>You'd rather have dinnerwith your wife?

182
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,090
<6-31,Wilson>是的,我会的...,如果她跟我说话的话
<6-31,Wilson>Yes, I would...if she were speaking to me.

183
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,390
<6-32,House>跟她不一样,
<6-32,House>Unlike her,

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,590
<6-32,House>我值得你跟我一起吃饭
<6-32,House>I could make it worth your while.

185
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,890
<6-33,Wilson>好
<6-33,Wilson>Fine.

186
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,190
<6-34,House>我要开车吗
<6-34,House>Should I drive?

187
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,590
<6-34,House>不
<6-34,House>no.

188
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,690
<6-35,Wilson>直到我看见你的钱包我才让你上我的车
<6-35,Wilson>And I'm not letting you in mycar until,I see your wallet.

189
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,490
<7-1,Foreman>nf2是一种遗传病
<7-1,Foreman>Nf2, it'san inherited disease.

190
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,690
<7-1,Foreman>这会引起头盖骨神经的不正常生长
<7-1,Foreman>It could cause abnormal growths on,the cranial nerves.

191
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,490
<7-1,Foreman>这可以解释这种症况下的休克
<7-1,Foreman>It would explain the shocksand other symptoms.

192
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,690
<7-2,Cameron>DNA分析可以显示你的儿子,是否有哪种具体的染色体变异
<7-2,Cameron>Dna analysis will show whether your son,has the specific chromosome mutation

193
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,690
<7-2,Cameron>引起了这种病
<7-2,Cameron>which causes the disease.

194
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,790
<7-3,Ken>但是如果它是遗传的
<7-3,Ken>But if it's inherited

195
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,890
<7-3,Ken>这就使说我们家其他人有这个病
<7-3,Ken>that means someone else in our family would, have it.

196
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,490
<7-4,Foreman>我们认为你妻子可能有这个病
<7-4,Foreman>We think your wifemay have had it.

197
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,090
<7-5,Ken>不,她身体一向很健康
<7-5,Ken>No, she never had anysort of health problems.

198
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,490
<7-6,Cameron>没有难看的雀斑?虹膜里没有小块?
<7-6,Cameron>No odd-looking freckles?Nodules in the iris?

199
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,390
<7-6,Cameron>没有
<7-6,Cameron>nothing.

200
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,790
<7-7,Ken>为什么你们认为她有病
<7-7,Ken>Why would you thinkshe was sick?

201
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,790
<7-8,Cameron>我们认为她的车祸另有原因
<7-8,Cameron>We think it may have beenwhat caused,her car accident.

202
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,990
<7-9,Carnell>等一下,这是什么意思
<7-9,Carnell>Wait, what do you mean?

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,790
<7-9,Carnell>我妈妈的车被一个醉鬼撞了
<7-9,Carnell>My mom's car was hitby a drunk driver.

204
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,590
<7-10,Foreman>警察的调查报告里可不是这么写的
<7-10,Foreman>That's not whatthe police report indicated.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,790
<7-11,Carnell>你们看到的肯定是错的报告
<7-11,Carnell>You must have gottenthe wrong report.

206
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,790
<7-11,Carnell>不
<7-11,Carnell>No.

207
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,590
<7-12,Ken>他们没错
<7-12,Ken>They didn'T.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,490
<7-12,Ken>当你开始开车时,我,
<7-12,Ken>When you started driving,I,

209
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,590
<7-13,Carnell>你撒谎了?
<7-13,Carnell>you lied about how mom died?

210
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,590
<7-14,Ken>我觉得她至少可以不用白白死掉
<7-14,Ken>I figured if her death could somehow,mean something--

211
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,790
<7-15,Carnell>不用白白死掉是什么意思?
<7-15,Carnell>how's lying about itmean something?

212
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,390
<7-15,Carnell>你怎么这么利用她,爸爸?
<7-15,Carnell>How could you use her like that, dad?

213
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,390
<7-15,Carnell>她的死?
<7-15,Carnell>Her death?

214
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,590
<7-16,Ken>我只是想保护你
<7-16,Ken>I was just tryingto protect you.

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,790
<7-17,Carnell>还有什么是假的
<7-17,Carnell>What else isn't true?

216
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,090
<7-17,Carnell>她不是个老师?
<7-17,Carnell>She wasn't a teacher.

217
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,690
<7-17,Carnell>你只想我读书？
<7-17,Carnell>You just wanted me to read?

218
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,090
<7-18,Foreman>这是什么味道
<7-18,Foreman>What's that smell?

219
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,290
<7-19,Cameron>我没闻到
<7-19,Cameron>I don't smell...

220
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,590
<7-20,Foreman>我们要叫个护士
<7-20,Foreman>we're gonna need a nurse.

221
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,090
<7-21,Carnell>天
<7-21,Carnell>What the hell?

222
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,290
<7-22,Cameron>没问题，我们会搞定的
<7-22,Cameron>It's okay.We'll take care of it.

223
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,590
<7-23,Ken>你没感觉到？
<7-23,Ken>You didn't feel anything?

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,790
<7-24,Carnell>没有
<7-24,Carnell>No.

225
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,790
<7-25,Foreman>痛吗？
<7-25,Foreman>You feel that?

226
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,390
<7-27,Cameron>但是你不知道你要方便?
<7-27,Cameron>But you didn't feel any of this?

227
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,390
<7-27,Cameron>没有
<7-27,Cameron>No.

228
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,690
<8-1,Foreman>肛门括约肌麻痹症加上休克等于米勒费雪综合症
<8-1,Foreman>Sphincter paralysis plus shocksequals miller,fisher syndrome.

229
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,290
<8-2,Chase>如果你加上他的大便样品,显示的是空肠弯曲菌阴性,就不算米勒费雪综合征了
<8-2,Chase>Not if you add the stool sample,which is negative,for C.Jejuni.

230
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,590
<8-3,House>他在她妻子的死上对他儿子撒谎了?
<8-3,House>He lied to his son about how his mom died?

231
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,590
<8-4,Cameron>他只想保护他
<8-4,Cameron>he was just protecting him.

232
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,790
<8-5,House>操纵他
<8-5,House>Manipulating him.

233
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,690
<8-6,Cameron>父母都这么做
<8-6,Cameron>That's what parents do.

234
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,590
<8-7,House>他们对我们撒谎是因为他们爱我们
<8-7,House>They lie to us because they love us.

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,790
<8-7,House>谁想要哭?
<8-7,House>Who's getting teary?

236
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,290
<8-8,Foreman>母亲的死没有关系
<8-8,Foreman>Mom's death is irrelevant.

237
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,790
<8-8,Foreman>DNA分析显示没有神经纤维肿瘤迹象,或别的遗传疾病
<8-8,Foreman>Dna revealed no nf2 markersor any other,inherited disease.

238
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,290
<8-8,Foreman>很显然,她在开车时的确睡着了
<8-8,Foreman>Apparently, she really did fall asleep,at the wheel.

239
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,190
<8-9,House>我们现在到底在讨论什么?
<8-9,House>So what exactlyare we talking about here?

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,690
<8-9,House>一点偷窥就让草原犬鼠
<8-9,House>A little peekeror did the prairie dog

241
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,090
<8-9,House>从洞里出来玩?
<8-9,House>actually come out to play?

242
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,990
<8-10,Cameron>对不起?
<8-10,Cameron>Excuse me?

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,790
<8-11,House>我们在讲爆炸吗?
<8-11,House>Are we talking explosive?

244
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,990
<8-12,Cameron>潜血检查呈阴性
<8-12,Cameron>The hemacultwas negative for blood.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,690
<8-12,Cameron>我不会讲他真的爆炸了
<8-12,Cameron>And I wouldn't say he actually exploded.

246
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,890
<8-12,Cameron>更像大量涌出
<8-12,Cameron>More like gushed.

247
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,190
<8-13,House>我们有一些进展了
<8-13,House>Good.We're getting somewhere.

248
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,790
<8-14,Foreman>真的?什么地步?
<8-14,Foreman>Yeah?Where?

249
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,190
<8-15,House>我不知道
<8-15,House>I have no idea.

250
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,490
<8-16,Foreman>当然,我们爱猜谜语
<8-16,Foreman>Of course.Love the riddles.

251
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,590
<8-17,House>嗨,妈妈

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,590
<8-17,House>好,谢谢
<8-17,House>Okay, thanks.

257
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,890
<8-18,Cameron>谁打的?
<8-18,Cameron>Who was that?

258
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,490
<8-19,House>安吉利娜 卓琳.我妈妈
<8-19,House>Angelina jolie.I call her mom.

259
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,890
<8-19,House>谁觉得这个好笑?
<8-19,House>Who thinks that's sexy?

260
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,890
<8-19,House>到底是爆炸还是大量涌出?
<8-19,House>So explosive or gushing?

261
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,490
<8-20,Cameron>她从来不打这里的电话.有事吗?
<8-20,Cameron>She never calls here.Is everything okay?

262
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,090
<8-20,Cameron>没事,很好
<8-20,Cameron>Great.Yeah.

263
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,090
<8-21,House>我爸爸要带她去欧洲
<8-21,House>My dad's taking her to europe.

264
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,990
<8-21,House>他们周三要在纽约停留9小时
<8-21,House>They got a nine-hour layoverin newark,on thursday.

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,190
<8-21,House>如果这时肠胃的-
<8-21,House>If it's gastrointestinal--

266
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,590
<8-22,Cameron>你为了不见你妈妈而撒谎?
<8-22,Cameron>you lied to avoid seeingyour own mom?

267
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,390
<8-23,House>你在开玩笑?我从来不对妈妈说谎.
<8-23,House>Are you kidding?I can't lie to my mom.

268
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,190
<8-23,House>很认真的,我不能
<8-23,House>Seriously, I can'T.

269
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,690
<8-23,House>Wilson 请我吃饭
<8-23,House>Wilson's invited me to dinner.

270
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,190
<8-23,House>放一个借了我5000大洋的人鸽子,不是明智之举
<8-23,House>It would be rudeto stand up a guy who just,loaned me five grand.

271
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,990
<8-23,House>横向脊髓炎?
<8-23,House>Transverse myelitis?

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,590
<8-24,Foreman>这个能使他失去知觉,肛门括约肌失去功能
<8-24,Foreman>It causes numbness, anal sphincter dysfunction.

273
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,690
<8-24,Foreman>还有休克
<8-24,Foreman>And the shocks.

274
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,390
<8-25,House>多谢你转移话题了
<8-25,House>Thank you for taking no interestin my mother.

275
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,490
<8-25,House>现在避开这个问题,什么引起了横向脊髓炎?
<8-25,House>That begs the question, whatcaused,the transverse myelitis?

276
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,090
<8-26,Foreman>我们排除了癌症和多样硬化症.就剩感染了.
<8-26,Foreman>We've ruled out cancer and ms.Leaves infection.

277
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,490
<8-27,Cameron>如果有感染,那就有发热
<8-27,Cameron>If there was infection,there'd be a fever.

278
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,490
<8-28,Chase>他的血液和脑脊液分析都是阴性的
<8-28,Chase>And his blood and csf culturesare already,negative.

279
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,690
<8-29,Foreman>也许感染已经好了,但是记忆还停留在那
<8-29,Foreman>Maybe the infection's gone,but the memory remains.

280
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,490
<8-30,House>分子模拟,好极了
<8-30,House>Molecular mimicry.Nice.

281
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,490
<8-30,House>现在去拿一台免疫球蛋白分析仪和电泳仪
<8-30,House>Now get an immunoglobulin leveland,electrophoresis.

282
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,290
<8-31,House>你很棒.我相信我们会再见面的
<8-31,House>You're good, my friend.I'm sure we'll meet again.

283
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,090
<9-1,Cameron>你真的认为那是他妈妈打的电话?
<9-1,Cameron>You really thinkthat was his mom on the phone?

284
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,990
<9-2,Chase>也许吧,我只是搞不懂他为什么要撒这个谎.
<9-2,Chase>Probably, I don't know whyhe'd lie about that.

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,290
<9-3,Foreman>管他呢
<9-3,Foreman>Who cares?

286
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,790
<9-4,Cameron>你一点都不好奇他父母什么样的?
<9-4,Cameron>You're not the least bit curious,what his parents are like?

287
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,190
<9-5,Foreman>我肯定他的她妈妈的一件作品
<9-5,Foreman>I'm sure his mom'sa piece of work.

288
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,090
<9-5,Foreman>只有妈妈才能做出这么大的毁害
<9-5,Foreman>Only a mother could dothat much damage.

289
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,090
<9-6,Chase>我敢打赌他生下来就是这样的
<9-6,Chase>My bet's he was born the way he is.

290
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,290
<9-6,Chase>刚好相反,也许是他折磨他的父母呢?
<9-6,Chase>Probably tormented his parents,not the, other way around.

291
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,790
<9-7,Foreman>他既跑不快也不会打架
<9-7,Foreman>He was either a fast runneror one hell, of a fighter.

292
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,290
<9-7,Foreman>你去哪里?
<9-7,Foreman>Where you going?

293
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,790
<9-8,Cameron>你们能搞定这些测试的,对吧?
<9-8,Cameron>You guys can handlethe tests, right?

294
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,690
<10-1,Cameron>你和豪斯有很重要的事非要在吃饭时讨论?
<10-1,Cameron>Is there something important that

296
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,590
<10-2,Wilson>放高利贷
<10-2,Wilson>Other thanthe skyrocketing interest rates,on personal loans?

297
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,990
<10-2,Wilson>你知道,这是第四次
<10-2,Wilson>You know,this is the fourth time

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,590
<10-2,Wilson>我借他钱了.不是吃饭的钱--钱
<10-2,Wilson>I've loaned him money.Not lunch money--money, ,money.

299
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,090
<10-3,Cameron>豪斯的父母？
<10-3,Cameron>House's parents?

300
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,490
<10-3,Cameron>周三晚上他们要在纽约逗留
<10-3,Cameron>They have a layover in newark thursday evening.

301
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,090
<10-4,Wilson>我取消这顿饭
<10-4,Wilson>I'm canceling dinner.

302
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,290
<10-5,Cameron>不用,其实我觉得你可以邀请更多的人
<10-5,Cameron>No, I thought maybe you couldjust invite,a few more people.

303
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,990
<11-1,Foreman>传染性的药剂的分子结构跟脊柱分子的很像
<11-1,Foreman>an infectious agent'smolecular structure can,resemble the spinal cord'S.

304
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,990
<11-1,Foreman>当免疫系统攻击感染时
<11-1,Foreman>When the immune systemattacks the infection

305
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,690
<11-1,Foreman>它也会停止攻击脊柱细胞
<11-1,Foreman>it ends up attackingthe spinal cord's as well.

306
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,390
<11-2,Ken>这么说他被感染了
<11-2,Ken>So he hasan infection.

307
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,490
<11-3,Carnell>他们刚说我没感染
<11-3,Carnell>They just said I don'T.

308
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,490
<11-4,Foreman>即便没有感染了,它还是会继续攻击
<11-4,Foreman>Even after the infection isgone,,it goes right on attacking

309
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,690
<11-4,Foreman>因为脊柱束仍然在
<11-4,Foreman>because the spinal cordis still there.

310
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,590
<11-5,Ken>有治疗方法吗?
<11-5,Ken>is there a treatment?

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,090
<11-6,Chase>这得看感染源是什么
<11-6,Chase>Depends on whatthe original infection was.

312
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,790
<11-6,Chase>很好,你做到了
<11-6,Chase>All right, you're done.

313
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,190
<11-6,Chase>你要平板上躺一个小时做腰神经刺穿
<11-6,Chase>You need to lay flat after a lumbar puncturefor,about an hour.

314
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,590
<11-7,Carnell>我要吐了
<11-7,Carnell>I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

315
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,190
<11-7,Carnell>爸爸,给我拿罐可乐吧
<11-7,Carnell>Hey dad, can you get mea coke please?

316
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,390
<11-8,Ken>好,他们通常很有用
<11-8,Ken>Yeah, that usually helps.

317
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,790
<11-9,Chase>你吐了
<11-9,Chase>You're done.

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,590
<11-10,Foreman>如果你觉得恶心
<11-10,Foreman>If you're nauseous--

319
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,490
<11-11,Carnell>不,我不恶心
<11-11,Carnell>no, I'm not nauseous.

320
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,290
<11-11,Carnell>我只想他离开这
<11-11,Carnell>I just want him outta here.

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,790
<11-12,Chase>他是你爸爸
<11-12,Chase>He's your dad.

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,490
<11-12,Chase>他会一直在你身边
<11-12,Chase>He's gonna be around.

323
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,490
<11-13,Carnell>是的,我知道
<11-13,Carnell>Yeah, I know.

324
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,590
<11-13,Carnell>不是这个,那是....
<11-13,Carnell>it's not that, it'S...

325
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,890
<12-1,House>难道就没有人讲真话了吗?
<12-1,House>are these peoplecompletely incapable

326
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,290
<12-1,House>他跟朋友去过牙买加
<12-1,House>of telling the truthto each other?

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,390
<12-3,House>怪不得他撒谎了
<12-3,House>No wonder he lied.

329
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,590
<12-3,House>家长认为孩子们不应该到处玩
<12-3,House>Children aren't supposedto have good times.

330
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,490
<12-4,Foreman>他的一个朋友带他们去的
<12-4,Foreman>One of his friendsflew them down.

331
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,190
<12-4,Foreman>Carnel的爸爸不能接受他的有钱朋友
<12-4,Foreman>Carnell's dad has this thing about him accepting,stuff from rich friends.

332
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,490
<12-4,Foreman>他希望他儿子不要忘本
<12-4,Foreman>Wants him to remember who he is, and where, he came from.

333
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,990
<12-5,House>你去哪里了?
<12-5,House>Where have you been?

<12-7,House>他跟父亲关系不好
<12-7,House>that the patient has a crappy relationship,with his dad.

337
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,190
<12-8,Cameron>他们看上去很在乎对方
<12-8,Cameron>They seem to actually care.

338
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,290
<12-9,House>哦,我不这么认为
<12-9,House>well, I don'T.

339
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,590
<12-9,House>任何一个孩子去牙买加都只有一个原因
<12-9,House>There's only one reason any kidwith a plane,flies to jamaica.

340
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,990
<12-10,Foreman>不是因为大麻
<12-10,Foreman>It wasn't for marijuana.

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,190
<12-10,Foreman>他什么都没做只是喝酒
<12-10,Foreman>He doesn't do anythingbut drink.

342
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,590
<12-11,House>他这么跟你说还是这么跟他爸爸说?
<12-11,House>He said that to youor his pops?

<12-13,House>就算酒瓶子都被冲掉了
<12-13,House>Even pot would havewashed out by now.

346
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,990
<12-14,Foreman>就算他吸大麻了
<12-14,Foreman>Even if he'd smoked,

347
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,590
<12-14,Foreman>也不可能会引起横向脊髓炎啊?
<12-14,Foreman>no way marijuanacauses transverse myelitis?

348
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,590
<12-15,House>对,但是他们放的这个东西可以引起

351
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,890
<12-17,Foreman>而在吸大麻上撒谎?
<12-17,Foreman>but lie about smoking pot?

352
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,890
<12-18,Chase>他也不可能因为吸毒而得了农药中毒啊
<12-18,Chase>He wouldn't have necessarily have to smoke,to get pesticide poisoning.

353
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,790
<12-18,Chase>他可能吃了撒了农药的水果
<12-18,Chase>He could have eaten fruitthat had been sprayed

354

<16-1,House>如果是脊髓炎的话这里应该有"itis"
<16-1,House>We knew if was myelitisthere had to be an "itis."

439
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,890
<16-2,Cameron>肯定是感染引起的
<16-2,Cameron>This must be the infectionthat set it off.

440
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,990
<16-3,House>除非这个病例太与众不同
<16-3,House>Yeah, except in this universeeffect follows cause.

441
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,090
<16-3,House>我对这个很不满,但是
<16-3,House>I've complained about it, but--

442
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,190
<16-4,Cameron>也许检测都错了
<16-4,Cameron>maybe the tests were wrong.

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,690
<16-5,House>不,检测是对的

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,790
<16-5,House>昨天他没有发热也没有感染
<16-5,House>Yesterday he had no fever.No infection.

445
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,890
<16-6,Chase>那就是他在这里时受到细菌感染了?
<16-6,Chase>So he just happened to catcha bug,while he was here?

446
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,090
<16-6,Chase>就是这个?
<16-6,Chase>That's all this is?

447
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,490
<16-7,House>因为他的白血细胞数正在下降
<16-7,House>Yeah, because his white bloodcell count was down,

448
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,490
<16-7,House>他现在失去免疫力了
<16-7,House>he was vulnerable.

449
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,990
<16-7,House>因为白细胞数很低,很可能会杀死他
<16-7,House>Because it's really down, it might kill him,

450
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,890
<16-7,House>就是这个
<16-7,House>but that's all this is.

451
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,790
<16-7,House>他还是大小便失禁?
<16-7,House>Is he still pooping his pants?

452
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,990
<16-8,Chase>他又开始了
<16-8,Chase>He just started again.

453
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,390
<16-9,House>又?
<16-9,House>Again?

454
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,590
<16-10,Chase>当他有点好转时停过
<16-10,Chase>It stopped when hewas getting better.

455
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,690
<16-11,House>他只是感到好多了,他从没真正好多了
<16-11,House>He was feeling better.,He was never getting better.

<16-13,Chase>That stop and startfor no apparent reason.

459
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,690
<16-14,Cameron>在他被感染杀死前我们要找出答案
<16-14,Cameron>We need to find an answerbefore this infection ,kills him.

460
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,490
<16-14,Cameron>这样最理想了
<16-14,Cameron>Yeah, that'd be the ideal.

<21-13,Cameron>That's what I told him the first time.

<22-2,Cuddy>干什么?你要什么?
<22-2,Cuddy>Why?What do you need?

590
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,390
<22-3,Cameron>我能给一个病人发传票吗?
<22-3,Cameron>Can I subpoena a patient?

591
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,590
<22-3,Cameron>豪斯要我把那个孩子给骗过来
<22-3,Cameron>House wants me to lie to the kidto get him, in here.

592
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,690
<22-4,Cuddy>好,那你就有传票了
<22-4,Cuddy>Well, then you'll be the onegetting the subpoena.

595
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,190
<22-7,Cameron>没有检测,豪斯只想看一下
<22-7,Cameron>There is no test.House just wants to look at it.

596
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,790
<22-8,Cuddy>那就叫豪斯做这个测试
<22-8,Cuddy>Then take houseto it.

597
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,690
<22-9,Cameron>就像这就要发生了

<22-10,Cuddy>他为了逃避他们哪里都会去的
<22-10,Cuddy>He'll go anywherejust to avoid them.

601
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,290
<22-11,Cameron>那就可以对豪斯撒谎而不能对病人撒谎?
<22-11,Cameron>So it's okay to lie to house,but not,to a patient?

602
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,590
<23-1,Foreman>怎么了?

609
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,390
<24-1,Chase>这个可以修复的
<24-1,Chase>It's repairable.

610
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,490
<24-2,Foreman>这说明抗生素没有用
<24-2,Foreman>It means the antibioticsaren't working.

611

<24-3,House>加倍剂量

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,090
<24-8,Cameron>我没有打算撒谎
<24-8,Cameron>I'm not gonna lie.

618
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,490
<24-9,House>为什么,因为撒谎是不对的?
<24-9,House>Why?Because it's wrong?

619
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,390
<24-9,House>还是因为你是懦夫?
<24-9,House>Or because you'rea coward?

620
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,490
<24-10,Cameron>艰难的选择
<24-10,Cameron>tough choice.

621
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,090
<24-10,Cameron>你在浪费这孩子两个小时的时间
<24-10,Cameron>You'd be wasting two hoursof the kid's time.

<24-11,House>这是无法原谅的深刻的道德错误吗?
<24-11,House>Is that deeplyand unforgivably morally wrong?

623
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,290
<24-11,House>不是

624

<24-11,House>因为这不是在浪费他的时间
<24-11,House>Because it's nota waste of his time.

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,690
<24-11,House>除非我们都错了
<24-11,House>Unless we're wrong.

<24-11,House>You're just afraidof being wrong.

<25-16,Cameron>在他的房间的衣柜后
<25-16,Cameron>In the bureauback in his regular room.

<26-1,House>set it down there.

701
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,190
<26-1,House>然后离开这.它有放射性
<26-1,House>Now get out of here.This thing is radioactive.

702
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,590
<26-2,Foreman>可能的辐射导致中枢神经系统症状
<26-2,Foreman>The chances of radiationcausing cns symptoms...

703
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,690
<26-4,House>可以把那个孩子叫做穿着含铅睡衣的人
<26-4,House>Call the boysin the lead pajamas.

704
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,490
<27-1,Foreman>浓度还没有高到引起中枢神经系统损伤
<27-1,Foreman>Emweren't high enough to causecentral nervous,system damage.

705
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,190
<27-2,Chase>它也许还没有引起中枢神经损伤
<27-2,Chase>It might not have causednerve damage,

706
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,790
<27-2,Chase>但毫无疑问它破坏了免疫系统
<27-2,Chase>but it definitely destroyed his immune system.

707
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,990
<27-3,House>还有引起肿瘤

708
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,990
<27-4,Cameron>我们还不知道

709
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,290
<27-4,Cameron>核磁共振没有显示任何证据
<27-4,Cameron>None of the mrisshowed anything.

710
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,490
<27-5,House>做正电子放射断层扫描
<27-5,House>Do a pet scan.

712
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,390
<28-1,Foreman>看上去不太妙
<28-1,Foreman>It's not gonna begood news.

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,890
<28-1,Foreman>对不起,坏消息

<28-2,Foreman>在工业上是用来探测矿井的
<28-2,Foreman>was from an industrial device used to test wells.

716
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,390
<28-2,Foreman>人们不应该乱丢放射性材料
<28-2,Foreman>People aren't supposed to justdump radioactive,material.

717
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,190
<28-3,Ken>但他们扔了
<28-3,Ken>But they do.

718
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,090
<28-3,Ken>那现在怎么办?
<28-3,Ken>So what now?I mean, what do you do?

719
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,690
<28-4,Foreman>任何人跟这个金属有过接触的
<28-4,Foreman>anyone who has had contact with the source

720
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,790
<28-4,Foreman>要马上接受放射系疾病的治疗

723
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,590
<28-6,Foreman>静脉注射
<28-6,Foreman>Transfusions.

724
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,090
<28-6,Foreman>我们会试着平衡电解质
<28-6,Foreman>And we try to get the fluidsand the electrolytes, balanced.

725
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,090
<28-6,Foreman>Carnel--他被辐射的更多
<28-6,Foreman>Carnell--he's hadmuch more exposure.

726
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,490
<28-6,Foreman>相当于70,000次x光胸透
<28-6,Foreman>The equivalentof about 70,000 chest x-rays.

<28-6,Foreman>His abilityto create white blood cells,has been completely destroyed.

728
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,590
<28-7,Ken>这就是他不能摆脱感染的原因
<28-7,Ken>That's why he can'tfight off this infection?

729
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,490
<28-8,Foreman>他需要骨髓移植术
<28-8,Foreman>He's gonna needa bone marrow transplant.

730
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,190
<28-8,Foreman>我们要再做一次正电子放射断层扫描
<28-8,Foreman>And we did another mri.

731
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,290
<28-9,Ken>他的脊柱里有很多血管瘤
<28-9,Ken>There's a cavernous angiomawithin his spinal cord.

732
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,790
<28-7,Ken>那是肿瘤
<28-7,Ken>It's a tumor.

733
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,190
<28-8,Foreman>这就是引起休克和中枢神经系统症状的原因了
<28-8,Foreman>That's what's been causingthe shocks ,and cns symptoms.

<28-10,Foreman>脊柱是一束束的纤维组成的,就像那种风筝线
<28-10,Foreman>The cord is made of strands put together,,sort of like a kite string.

736
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,590
<28-10,Foreman>手术要把这些一束束的纤维分开,然后切除肿瘤
<28-10,Foreman>The surgeon should be able to pull the strands ,apart and excise the tumor.

737
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:02,290
<28-10,Foreman>他这个手术的风险极高
<28-10,Foreman>Surgery on someone who's ashemopoetically,compromised as your sonis extremely risky.

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,290
<28-11,Ken>如果他不做手术的话,我是说...
<28-11,Ken>And,if you don't dothe surgery, I mean...

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,190
<28-12,Foreman>肿瘤将会停止他的呼吸
<28-12,Foreman>the tumor could causehis breathing to stop.

740
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,290
<28-12,Foreman>也许停止心跳
<28-12,Foreman>Possibly his heart as well.

741
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,690
<28-12,Foreman>你不知道要发生什么
<28-12,Foreman>There's no wayyou could have known.

746
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,190
