<1-20,Dad>House,Season 03 Episode 02

42
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,630
<2-1,Wilson>啊 满身臭汗不见了?
<2-1,Wilson>Where's the sweat and the B.O.?

43
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,360
<2-1,Wilson>你曾经那么喜欢,让我们沉浸在你的汗臭中
<2-1,Wilson>You've taken such pride in bathing,us all in your musk.

44
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,450
<2-2,House>在家冲凉了
<2-2,House>Showered at home.

45
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,430
<2-3,Cuddy>你还比平时早
<2-3,Cuddy>And yet you're earlier than usual.

46
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,750
<2-4,House>这算是心理治疗么?
<2-4,House>Is this an intervention?

47
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,310
<2-4,House>现在已经晚了 因为我已经戒了
<2-4,House>It's a little late,,since I'm not using drugs anymore.

48
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,470
<2-4,House>但是我对字母的瘾还没有戒
<2-4,House>I am,however,still hooked on phonics.

49
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,740
<2-5,Cuddy>如果你真的晨跑了 还在家冲凉的话,应该会比平时晚的
<2-5,Cuddy>If you did your morning run and showered at home,,you'd be later than usual.

50
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,410
<2-6,House>我冲凉的时候想你了
<2-6,House>Thought of you in the shower.

51
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,870
<2-6,House>你腿怎么样了?
<2-6,House>How's your leg?

52
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,630
<2-7,Cuddy>你好像喜欢用左腿
<2-7,Cuddy>You seem to be favoring your left side.

53
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,260
<2-8,House>我昨天把右边裤脚放长了,就这点区别
<2-8,House>I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday.Makes all the difference in the world.

54
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,200
<2-9,Wilson>- 你每天都爬楼梯,- 是不是要有法庭令你们才不烦我?
<2-9,Wilson>- You've taken the stairs every day.- Did I need a restraining order?

55
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,190
<2-11,Cuddy>康复过程中不锻炼的话,肌肉会萎缩
<2-11,Cuddy>You slack on your rehab,,the muscle will weaken.

56
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,010
<2-11,Cuddy>你的腿又会疼
<2-11,Cuddy>And your leg will hurt again.

57
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,030
<2-12,Wilson>看来k他命的治疗好像效果不佳
<2-12,Wilson>Looks like the ketamine treatment,might not stick.

58
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,540
<2-13,Cuddy>也许是我们让他情绪低落,因为我们对他说谎了
<2-13,Cuddy>Or maybe we've made him depressed,because we're lying to him.

59
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,040
<2-13,Cuddy>说他的病例诊断错了
<2-13,Cuddy>Telling him he got that case wrong.

60
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,280
<2-14,Wilson>我们没有伤害他,疼痛不是...
<2-14,Wilson>We didn't hurt him.The pain isn'T...

61
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,350
<2-15,Cuddy>他变消极了 不做运动了
<2-15,Cuddy>he gets depressed,he stops exercising.

62
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,580
<2-15,Cuddy>他不运动的话 肌肉会萎缩
<2-15,Cuddy>He stops exercising,the muscle atrophies.

63
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,320
<2-15,Cuddy>肌肉一萎缩 疼痛就开始了
<2-15,Cuddy>The muscle atrophies,the pain returns.

64
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,690
<2-16,Wilson>也许他停止运动是因为,他腿上的伤口真的很痛
<2-16,Wilson>Maybe he stopped exercising because,the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

65
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,190
<2-17,Cuddy>k他命的治疗没问题,现在他又要大吞止疼药了
<2-17,Cuddy>The ketamine could work perfectly and he would,still be back on his cane popping vicon again.

66
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,740
<2-17,Cuddy>不能告诉他
<2-17,Cuddy>You can't tell him.

67
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,680
<2-18,Wilson>纯属运气 没有医学根据...
<2-18,Wilson>He got lucky.There was no medical...

68
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,220
<2-19,Cuddy>他是对的
<2-19,Cuddy>he was right.

69
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,170
<2-20,Wilson>告诉他他是对的,等于纵容他的毛病
<2-20,Wilson>We tell him he was right,and we're,feeding his addiction.

70
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,620
<2-20,Wilson>没有了止疼药 他只剩下一项嗜好
<2-20,Wilson>Without vicodin,he's only got,one to focus on.

71
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,670
<2-21,Cuddy>猜病人的病症总好过服药过量
<2-21,Cuddy>Well,he's not gonna O.D.On puzzles.

72
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,980
<2-21,Cuddy>他自己的确没事
<2-21,Cuddy>No,it's not gonna hurt him.

73
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,920
<2-22,Wilson>他可能会害死病人
<2-22,Wilson>But he could just as easily have,killed that patient.

74
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,380
<2-22,Wilson>我们有一个微小的机会,让House回归理性
<2-22,Wilson>We have a tiny window of time here where,house may be healthy enough to change.

75
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,840
<2-22,Wilson>从刚才他跛行的样子来看,这个机会正在逝去
<2-22,Wilson>And based on that limp,the window's closing fast.

76
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,330
<2-23,Chase>小孩是试管婴儿 接种过疫苗
<2-23,Chase>Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization,pregnancy.Had all his vaccinations.

77
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,200
<2-23,Chase>3岁时右手尺骨骨折,5岁出水痘
<2-23,Chase>Fractured his right ulna at age three,,chicken pox at age fivE...

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
<2-24,House>感情上有没有创伤?
<2-24,House>did he ever get his feelings hurt?

79
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,540
<2-24,House>这我也要知道
<2-24,House>I'll need to know that too.

80
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,300
<2-25,Foreman>你回来以后还一分未得,我们至少想确认...
<2-25,Foreman>You are 0 for 1 since you came back.We just wanna make sure...

81
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,790
<2-26,Cameron>直肠出血还有外星人绑架的幻觉,很可能是性虐待症状
<2-26,Cameron>rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies,,most likely sexual abuse.

82
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,270
<2-26,Cameron>插入导致流血 精神创伤导致幻想
<2-26,Cameron>Penetration causes the bleed,,trauma causes the fantasy.

83
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,860
<2-27,Foreman>急诊做过检查,未发现撕裂 精液和阴毛
<2-27,Foreman>E.R. Ran a rape kit,found no evidence,of tearing,semen,or pubic hairs.

84
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,000
<2-28,Chase>应该和孩子谈谈
<2-28,Chase>I think we should talk to the kid.

85
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,340
<2-28,Chase>为什么?
<2-28,Chase>Why?

86
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,220
<2-29,House>难道他说的会是真话?
<2-29,House>In case he's telling the truth?

87
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,020
<2-29,House>你信这些的 对不对?
<2-29,House>You're a believer,aren't you?

88
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,090
<2-30,Chase>我只是没那么自大,毕竟有500亿个星系
<2-30,Chase>I'm just not arrogant enough to think,that of the 50 billion galaxies,

89
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,510
<2-30,Chase>每个星系有1000亿个恒星,宇宙间有几亿亿个行星
<2-30,Chase>100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million,billion planets in the universe,

90
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,270
<2-30,Chase>我们不会是唯一的生命
<2-30,Chase>that we're the only ones with life.

91
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,240
<2-30,Chase>不会
<2-30,Chase>No.

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,150
<2-31,House>不过我们是唯一一种,喜欢往后庭里插东西的生物
<2-31,House>But I'm guessing we're the only ones who,like shoving things through our backdoors.

93
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,070
<2-32,Foreman>研究表明神经问题和出血紊乱有关联
<2-32,Foreman>There is new research indicating a link between,neurological problems and bleeding disorders.

94
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,900
<2-33,House>是啊 特别是当病人有神经症状时
<2-33,House>Perfect.Especially if there wereneurological problems.

95
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,160
<2-34,Foreman>外星人绑架幻觉还不是神经症状?
<2-34,Foreman>What part of hallucinating an alien,abduction isn't neurological?

96
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,820
<2-35,House>不是幻觉
<2-35,House>It wasn't a hallucination.

97
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,970
<2-35,House>什么?
<2-35,House>What?

98
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,400
<2-36,Chase>- 你认为孩子真的遭绑架?,- 是做噩梦
<2-36,Chase>- You think the kid...- is having nightmares.

99
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,370
<2-37,House>噩梦不是病状,只表明小孩需要和妈妈睡
<2-37,House>Nightmares aren'ta symptom of anything,other than wanting to sleep with mommy.

100
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,340
<2-37,House>现在只剩下一个症状,流血的屁屁
<2-37,House>Which just leaves uswith one symptom,,the bloody tuchus.

101
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,650
<2-37,House>消化道疾病或出血性疾病可以解释
<2-37,House>Which can easily be explained by a G.I.Problemor a bleeding disorder.

102
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,990
<2-37,House>做血凝检查 PT/PTT(凝血酶原),还有出血时间
<2-37,House>Check his coags with a pt,ptt,and bleeding time.

103
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,670
<2-37,House>上下消化道都要做内镜
<2-37,House>Prep him for endoscopiesfrom above and below.

104
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,040
<3-1,Chase>要在你胳膊上轻轻扎一下
<3-1,Chase>Gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm,okay?

105
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,320
<3-1,Chase>然后看你要多长时间停止流血
<3-1,Chase>Then I'm gonna time how longit,takes for you to stop bleeding.

106
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,870
<3-1,Chase>有点点疼 你转过头去
<3-1,Chase>This is gonnasting a little,,so you might want tolook the other way.

107
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,670
<3-2,Clancy>窗户是锁着的吗?
<3-2,Clancy>Are those windows locked?

108
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,000
<3-3,Chase>这些窗户根本打不开,只是放进阳光
<3-3,Chase>Those windowsdon't even open.They're just hereto let sunshine in.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,230
<3-4,Clancy>好 因为他们知道我在这里
<3-4,Clancy>Good.'Cause they know I'm here.

110
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,600
<3-4,Clancy>clancy...
<3-4,Clancy>Clancy

111
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,520
<3-5,Mom>别跟医生胡说
<3-5,Mom>don't bother the doctorwith this stuff.

112
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,970
<3-6,Chase>没事的 他们怎么知道你在哪?
<3-6,Chase>No,it's okay.How do they know you're here?

113
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,730
<3-7,Clancy>他们在我脖子里装了芯片,可以追踪我
<3-7,Clancy>They put a chip in my neck,so they cankeep track of me.

114
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,120
<3-7,Clancy>我能感觉到
<3-7,Clancy>I can feel it back there.

115
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,800
<3-8,Mom>Clancy 你知道那里什么也没有
<3-8,Mom>Clancy,you knowthere is nothing back there.

116
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
<3-9,Clancy>有的
<3-9,Clancy>There is.

117
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,370
<3-10,Chase>我看看 向前倾
<3-10,Chase>Let me see.Lean forwards.

118
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,210
<3-11,Clancy>还装了别的东西,放在这两根肋骨中间
<3-11,Clancy>And they havethis other thing.And they put it...in between these two ribs.

119
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,950
<3-11,Clancy>一直在这边
<3-11,Clancy>Always on this side.

120
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,940
<3-11,Clancy>然后这东西在我身体里移动 很疼
<3-11,Clancy>And then they move itaround my insides.It hurts.

121
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,810
<3-12,Chase>知道吗 Clancy?
<3-12,Chase>You know what,clancy?

122
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,400
<3-12,Chase>我可能找到芯片了
<3-12,Chase>I think I might havefound the chip back there.

123
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,310
<3-12,Chase>我可以取出来
<3-12,Chase>And I think I might be able to get it out.

124
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,650
<3-13,Clancy>- 真的,- 嗯
<3-13,Clancy>- Really?,- Mmm-hmm.

125
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,830
<3-14,Chase>好的 向前倾
<3-14,Chase>Okay,lean forwards.

126
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,820
<3-14,Chase>坐稳了不要动
<3-14,Chase>Now hold very still,okay?

127
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,580
<3-14,Chase>好了
<3-14,Chase>Got it.

128
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,680
<3-15,Clancy>我7岁 不是3岁
<3-15,Clancy>I'm seven...not three.

129
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,210
<3-15,Clancy>你只不过捏了一下我的脖子
<3-15,Clancy>All you didwas pinch my neck.

130
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,850
<3-16,Chase>不好意思
<3-16,Chase>Sorry.

131
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,880
<4-1,Chase>他的外星劫持的故事,详细的程度...
<4-1,Chase>His alien abduction story,,the level of detail is...

132
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,360
<4-1,Chase>我不知道他从哪里听来的
<4-1,Chase>I don't knowwhere he gets it from.

133
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,700
<4-1,Chase>他父母说他不看科幻片,不看漫画书
<4-1,Chase>The parents sayhe doesn't watch sci-fi,,he doesn't read comic books.

134
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,320
<4-2,House>好极了,你做了医学上的事情没有?
<4-2,House>Great.You do any of thatmedical stuff we talked about?

135
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,330
<4-3,Foreman>上下消化道的内镜都没发现问题
<4-3,Foreman>Upper d lower endoscopieswere clean.

136
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,070
<4-4,House>那么 就只是一种出血性疾病
<4-4,House>So,it's a simplebleeding disorder.

137
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,950
<4-5,Chase>不 血液测试全都正常,他的血液在六分钟内凝结
<4-5,Chase>No. Blood testswere all normal.And he clotted insix minutes.

138
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,940
<4-6,House>这么说 是简单的出血性疾病,你的测试做错了
<4-6,House>So it's a simplebleeding disorder,and you screwed upthe test.

139
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,670
<4-7,Chase>我没有做错
<4-7,Chase>I didn't screw upthe test.

140
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,310
<4-7,Chase>那么 这就是一个U.F.O.
<4-7,Chase>So it's a U.F.O.

141
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,590
<4-8,House>不明出血孔
<4-8,House>Unidentified flowing orifice.

142
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,720
<4-8,House>或者你检查出错,或者我的分析出错
<4-8,House>Either youscrewed up the test or,i screwed upmy analysis of this case.

143
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,520
<4-8,House>如果是你搞砸了 我不用负责
<4-8,House>If you screwed up,I don't have,to cry myself to sleep.

144
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,230
<4-8,House>是简单的出血性疾病,Foreman 重做测试
<4-8,House>It's a simplebleeding disorder.Foreman,redo the test.

145
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,020
<4-9,Chase>我怎么可能会搞砸一个,简单的出血时间试验?
<4-9,Chase>How could I screw up a simplebleeding time test?

146
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,270
<4-10,Foreman>也许当时你被劫持了
<4-10,Foreman>Maybe you were abductedand lost time.

147
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,350
<5-1,Foreman>这个孩子有出血性疾病
<5-1,Foreman>Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

148
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,840
<5-2,House>你确定?
<5-2,House>You're sure?

149
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,560
<5-3,Foreman>流血25分钟 最后还是我止的血
<5-3,Foreman>I had to stopthe bleeding myself after 25 minutes.

150
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,360
<6-1,House>所以 你是说Chase出错了
<6-1,House>So you're sayingchase did screw up.

151
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,170
<6-2,Chase>或者说Foreman出错了
<6-2,Chase>Or foreman screwed up.

152
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,650
<6-3,Foreman>长针指示分钟  也许你搞混了
<6-3,Foreman>Big hand points to minutes.Maybe you got itmixed up.

153
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,860
<6-4,House>噢 被鄙视了
<6-4,House>Oh,snap.

154
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,470
<6-4,House>Foreman在跟你打嘴仗呢,在文化上你可是大大的劣势 Chase,(playing dozens是黑人强项)
<6-4,House>Foreman's playin'the dozens.You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here,chase.

155
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,420
<6-4,House>花几分钟来想一个聪明的反击
<6-4,House>Take a couple minutesto think of a witty retort.

156
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,400
<6-5,Cameron>我们出血时间试验结果相互矛盾
<6-5,Cameron>So we have contradictingbleeding time tests.

157
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,590
<6-5,Cameron>如果我们在试验室检测他的凝血因子,我们就可以确定谁是对的
<6-5,Cameron>If we run labsto check his clotting factors,,we can confirmwhich one's right.

158
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,070
<6-6,House>测试 好主意
<6-6,House>Yeah,testing.Nice idea.

159
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,690
<6-6,House>比瞎猜哪个医生不合格好多了
<6-6,House>Way better than trying to guess,which doctor's incompetent.

160
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,630
<6-6,House>而且写在病历上也好看些
<6-6,House>Looks betterin the paperwork too.

161
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,640
<6-7,Chase>嘿 Foreman 你妈妈好肥
<6-7,Chase>Hey,foreman,your mama's so fat,

162
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,790
<6-7,Chase>她的呼机响起来的时候,人们都以为要倒车
<6-7,Chase>when her beeper goes off,,people thinkshe's backing up.

163
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,970
<6-7,Chase>Clancy在哪里?
<6-7,Chase>Where's clancy?

164
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,870
<6-7,Chase>他睡着了,他...
<6-7,Chase>He's asleep.He'S...

165
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,400
<6-7,Chase>house!
<6-7,Chase>House!

166
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,020
<8-1,Chase>Clancy不见了
<8-1,Chase>Clancy's gone missing.

167
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,710
<8-2,House>哦,不!
<8-2,House>Oh,no!

168
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,420
<8-2,House>你去人马座α星搜寻,Foreman去塔图音(星战地名)
<8-2,House>You take alpha centauri,,foreman can look on tatooine,

169
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,510
<8-2,House>Cameron在星系间设卡堵截
<8-2,House>and cameron can set,upan intergalactic checkpoint.

170
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,690
<8-2,House>祈祷一下他还没有进入超光速状态
<8-2,House>Let's pray he hasn'tgone into hyperdrive.

171
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,260
<8-2,House>那样就永远抓不到了
<8-2,House>We'll never catch him.

172
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,150
<9-1,Chase>Clancy?
<9-1,Chase>Clancy?

173
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,280
<9-2,Clancy>我得到没有窗户的地方,那样我可以把芯片取出来 像你说的那样
<9-2,Clancy>I had to gowhere there are no windows,so I could getthe chip out like you said.

174
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,050
<9-3,Chase>上帝啊
<9-3,Chase>GoD.

175
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,490
<9-4,Clancy>- 我可以感觉的到 就是拿不出来,- Clancy 停下来!
<9-4,Clancy>- I can feel it,I just can't grab it.- Clancy,stop!

176
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,750
<9-5,Chase>没有什么芯片
<9-5,Chase>There is no chip.

177
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,380
<9-5,Chase>我们会把你洗干净,然后把你送回房间
<9-5,Chase>We're gonna clean you upand,we're gonna go back to your room.

178
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,020
<9-5,Chase>你不能这样子做
<9-5,Chase>You can't do thingslike this.

179
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,690
<9-6,House>你的父母--
<9-6,House>Your parents--

180
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
<9-6,House>这东西可能不是地球上的
<9-6,House>Said it might noteven be terrestrial.

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,330
<9-7,Chase>真的?
<9-7,Chase>Really?

182
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,670
<9-8,House>不是 你个笨蛋 这是钛
<9-8,House>No,you idiot,it's titanium.

183
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,870
<9-8,House>比如因为手术植入的销子
<9-8,House>Like from a surgical pin.

184
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,190
<9-8,House>比如说这孩子四年前钉入断臂
<9-8,House>Like the kind the kidhad inserted,into his broken armfour years ago.

185
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,410
<9-8,House>不错的病史
<9-8,House>Nice medical history.

186
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,200
<9-9,Chase>那个销子在那之后六个月就被移除了
<9-9,Chase>That pin was removedsix months after--

187
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,800
<9-10,House>有一小块在移除过程中断掉了
<9-10,House>so a little piece broke offduring removal.

188
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,280
<9-11,Chase>钛被用来建造核潜艇,不会就这么断掉
<9-11,Chase>Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.Pieces don't just break off.

189
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,250
<9-12,House>告诉这家伙库尔斯克的事
<9-12,House>Tell that to guyson the kursk.

190
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,630
<9-13,Chase>那它到底怎么从他的手臂,转移到他的脖子后面
<9-13,Chase>And how exactly did it getfrom,his arm to the back of his neck?

191
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,450
<9-14,Foreman>身体排斥任何的外物
<9-14,Foreman>Body attacksany foreign object.

192
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,330
<9-14,Foreman>炎症反应会使销子进入血管,碎片搭了个便车
<9-14,Foreman>Inflammatory reactioncould erode,it into a vein,fragment gets a free ride.

193
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,930
<9-15,Chase>也许会到肺里面,而不是颈部
<9-15,Chase>To his lungs,maybe.Not his neck.

194
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,980
<9-16,House>对 外星人的芯片更说得通
<9-16,House>Yeah,an alien chipmakes more sense.

195
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,470
<9-16,House>奇怪的是你没有搞砸
<9-16,House>The real mystery is that you,didn'tactually screw up.

196
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,930
<9-17,Cameron>你还好吧?
<9-17,Cameron>You okay?

197
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,670
<9-17,Cameron>没事 绊倒了
<9-17,Cameron>Fine.Tripped.

198
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,000
<9-18,House>孩子在他的脖子后面挖了个洞,却没有因流血过多致死
<9-18,House>Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck...and apparentlydidn't bleed to death.

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,310
<9-18,House>这才是奇怪的
<9-18,House>Now,that's weird.

200
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,050
<9-19,Foreman>他的血液自己凝固了?
<9-19,Foreman>He clotted on his own?

201
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,470
<9-20,House>显然是的
<9-20,House>Sure did.

202
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,450
<9-20,House>所以开始没有出血性疾病,然后有了 现在又没有了
<9-20,House>So first there wasno bleeding disorder,,then there was,now there is not again.

203
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,720
<9-21,Cameron>这不可能
<9-21,Cameron>Which is impossible.

204
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,470
<9-22,Chase>或者说是Foreman搞砸了,三个测试中有两个和我的结论一致
<9-22,Chase>Or foreman screwed up.Two out of three testsagree with my findings.

205
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,980
<9-23,House>算我们运气 第四个检查就见分晓了
<9-23,House>Well,lucky for us,,the fourth test will be the charm.

206
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,020
<10-1,Mom>你们还要割他?
<10-1,Mom>So you're just gonnakeep cutting him?

207
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,670
<10-1,Mom>直到什么时候?
<10-1,Mom>Until what?

208
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,340
<10-2,Foreman>这个测试不一样
<10-2,Foreman>This test is different.

209
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,540
<10-2,Foreman>我们抽取一些血样,看看是否有凝血因子不足或者缺失
<10-2,Foreman>We draw some blood and see if,any clotting factorsare low or missing.

210
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,170
<10-3,Dad>但是为什么其他的测试没能够--
<10-3,Dad>But whyhaven't the other tests--

211
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,650
<10-4,Chase>我们得到三个不一致的结果,肯定其中有一个是错的
<10-4,Chase>we've got three resultsthat haven't,been consistent.One of themmust be wrong.

212
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,290
<10-5,Foreman>或者其中两个
<10-5,Foreman>Or two of them.

213
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,650
<10-6,Mom>有没有可能问题不是出在他的血液?
<10-6,Mom>Is it possible the problemisn't his blood?

214
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,010
<10-6,Mom>只是心理上的问题
<10-6,Mom>It's just psychological.

215
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,970
<10-6,Mom>我是说 他几乎杀死了自己
<10-6,Mom>I mean,he almost killed himself.

216
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,960
<10-7,Chase>他不是想要伤害自己
<10-7,Chase>He wasn't tryingto hurt himself.

217
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,260
<10-7,Chase>不...
<10-7,Chase>No...

218
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,350
<10-8,Mom>他只是在找一个外星跟踪装置
<10-8,Mom>he was just looking for an alien tracking device.

219
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,860
<10-9,Cameron>我有时间再接一个病人
<10-9,Cameron>I have timefor one more.

220
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,630
<10-10,Brenda>你跑到这里加班 情有可原
<10-10,Brenda>Don't blame youfor spending extra time down here.

221
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,240
<10-10,Brenda>听说楼上的一个跛子行为艺术家回来了
<10-10,Brenda>Heard the artistformerly known,as gimp is back upstairs.

222
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,130
<10-10,Brenda>哦,Cuddy医生要了那个病例
<10-10,Brenda>Oh,dr.Cuddywants that one.

223
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,100
<10-11,Cameron>她很忙 我来接手了
<10-11,Cameron>She's busy.I'll take it.

224
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,700
<10-11,Cameron>哦 天哪 你是...
<10-11,Cameron>Oh,my god.You're...

225
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,610
<10-11,Cameron>怎么会...
<10-11,Cameron>how...

226
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,410
<10-12,Richard>你好了
<10-12,Richard>you're okay.

227
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,270
<10-12,Richard>我们见过么?
<10-12,Richard>Have we met?

228
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,950
<10-13,Cameron>我是你其中一个医生
<10-13,Cameron>I was one of your doctors.

229

<10-15,Cameron>这太让人惊讶了
<10-15,Cameron>This is amazing.

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,610
<10-16,Richard>很惊讶你不知道
<10-16,Richard>Surprised you didn't know.

235
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,890
<10-17,Cameron>我怎么会知道?
<10-17,Cameron>How would I know?

<10-21,Cameron>我想也许你可以...
<10-21,Cameron>And I was hoping that maybe...

<10-24,Richard>嗨
<10-24,Richard>Hi.

246
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,240
<10-25,Cameron>这完全不道德
<10-25,Cameron>It's completely unethical.

247
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
<10-26,Cuddy>- 他对待病人不顾后果,- 他是正确的
<10-26,Cuddy>- He was recklesswith a patient.- He was right.

248
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,760
<10-28,Cuddy>但是他不知道这些,他需要至少谦卑一点点
<10-28,Cuddy>But he didn't know that.He needs at leastsome glimmer of humility.

249
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,470
<10-29,Cameron>为什么他需要这么做?,因为其他人是这样的?
<10-29,Cameron>Why doeshe need that?,Because other peoplehave that?

250
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,830
<10-29,Cameron>他为什么需要像其他人一样?
<10-29,Cameron>Why does he need to belike other people?

251
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,810
<10-30,Cuddy>他需要更多的考虑后果
<10-30,Cuddy>He needs to beless reckless.

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,150
<10-31,Cameron>你成功了
<10-31,Cameron>Well,you did it.

253
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,650
<10-31,Cameron>他心不在焉,不求甚解 他很痛苦
<10-31,Cameron>He's dismissing symptoms,,looking for easy solutions.He's in pain.

254
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,330
<10-32,Cuddy>- 多痛?,- 为什么问?
<10-32,Cuddy>- How much pain?,- Why?

255
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,110
<10-33,Cameron>你知道这会影响到他 是么?
<10-33,Cameron>You know this isaffecting him,don't you?

256
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,690
<10-34,Cuddy>告诉他他解决了上一个病例,不会对他有任何帮助
<10-34,Cuddy>Telling him that hegot his last case,right won't do anything to help him.

257
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,050
<10-36,Cuddy>- 这会减轻他的抑郁,- 这可能不会对他的腿有帮助
<10-36,Cuddy>- It'll make himless depressed.- Which might nothelp his leg.

258
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,970
<10-37,Cameron>但是你说不准的
<10-37,Cameron>But you don't know.

259
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,410
<10-38,Cuddy>就让我对他的丘脑做一个PET扫描,看看是不是感知到疼痛
<10-38,Cuddy>Just let merun a pet scan on his parietal,thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.

260
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,540
<10-38,Cuddy>如果是的 K他命不会再起效果,而他就面临一个很大的消沉
<10-38,Cuddy>If it is,the ketamineisn't working,anymore and he's headed fora huge crash.

261
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,780
<10-38,Cuddy>如果不是 腿痛就是我的错误造成的,我会告诉他事实的
<10-38,Cuddy>If it's not,the leg pain is my,fault and I willtell him the truth.

262
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,620
<11-1,Chase>太紧么?
<11-1,Chase>Too tight?

263
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,700
<11-2,Clancy>我父母认为我疯了
<11-2,Clancy>My parentsthink I'm crazy.

<11-3,Chase>他们只是为你担心 就只是这样
<11-3,Chase>They're justworried about you,that's all.

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,100
<11-4,Clancy>我不是怪人
<11-4,Clancy>I'm not weird.

267
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,290
<11-4,Clancy>只是怪事老是发生在我身上
<11-4,Clancy>It's just that weird,thingskeep happening to me.

268
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,760
<11-5,Chase>轻轻一下
<11-5,Chase>Slight pinch.

269
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,360
<11-6,Clancy>如果你让我好转,外星人就不会来找我了吧
<11-6,Clancy>If you make me better,do you think,the alienswill leave me alone?

270
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,100
<11-7,Chase>我想他们不会打扰你很长时间了
<11-7,Chase>I don't thinkthey're gonna be,bothering you for much longer.

271
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,090
<11-8,Clancy>- 你又撒谎了?,- 没有
<11-8,Clancy>- You lying again?,- No.

272
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,930
<11-9,Chase>我们找出病因,一切都会没事的
<11-9,Chase>We figure this out,everything's gonna be okay.

273
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,340
<11-9,Chase>你还清醒么?
<11-9,Chase>You still with us?

<11-10,Mom>- 发生了什么?,- 到外面等
<11-10,Mom>- What is happening?,- Wait outside.

276
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,170
<11-11,Chase>给他输氧,开始静脉点滴硝普钠
<11-11,Chase>Get him oxygen.Start him on an iv drip of sodium nitroprusside.

277
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,730
<11-11,Chase>让他们出去!
<11-11,Chase>Get them outside!

278
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,390
<12-1,Chase>他现在在重症监护病房,收缩压在170mmHg左右波动
<12-1,Chase>He's in icu.Systolic is hoveringaround 170.

279
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,020
<12-1,Chase>我下了医嘱 要缓慢降压,不能冒险 会造成器官供血不足
<12-1,Chase>I left instructionsto lower it slowly so,we don't riskhypoperfusing his organs.

280
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,690
<12-2,House>保持这么高的血压,会有中风 心梗和失明的危险
<12-2,House>The trade-off being thatleaving his blood pressure,that high risks stroke,M.I.And blindness.

281
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,640
<12-3,Chase>我广开言路的
<12-3,Chase>I'm open to suggestions.

282
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,360
<12-4,House>解决病例
<12-4,House>Solve the case.

283
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,290
<12-5,Chase>- 肾脏可以用来解释...- 肾脏没有问题
<12-5,Chase>- Kidneys could explain...- kidneys are clean.

284
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,080
<12-6,House>告诉我他是一个变异的人种
<12-6,House>Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.

285
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,850
<12-7,Foreman>是出血性疾病,clancy的血友病检测阳性
<12-7,Foreman>It is a bleeding disorder.Clancy tested positive for von willebrand'S.

286
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,830
<12-7,Foreman>我没有搞砸
<12-7,Foreman>I didn't screw up.

287
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,520
<12-8,Chase>他怎么可能三次里面两次,靠自身凝血止住出血
<12-8,Chase>How could he clot on his owntwo,out of three times?

288
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,890
<12-9,Cameron>- 也许他作弊了,- 是啊
<12-9,Cameron>- Maybe he cheated.- right.

289
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,440
<12-10,Chase>孩子总是在出血时间试验上作弊
<12-10,Chase>Kids always cheat ontheir bleeding time tests.

290
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,470
<12-11,House>她是在打比喻,她试着在模仿我
<12-11,House>she was being metaphorical.She's tryingto sound like me.

291
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,350
<12-11,House>我不知道你的意思是什么,但是我大概知道你葫芦里卖的是什么药
<12-11,House>I have no ideawhat you meant,,but I could smellwhat the rock was cooking.

292
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,930
<12-12,Cameron>我是说他现在血液可以凝结,而且他处在高血压危象中
<12-12,Cameron>I meanthe's clotting right now,and he's inhypertensive crisis.

293
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,550
<12-12,Cameron>也许这两者有联系
<12-12,Cameron>Maybe the two e related.

294
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,070
<12-12,Cameron>可能另外两次他血液凝结的时候,是处于高血压中
<12-12,Cameron>What if he was hypertensive the,other two times that he clotted?

295
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,110
<12-13,House>高血压危象可以激发凝血因子
<12-13,House>Hypertensive crisiscan activate clotting factors.

296
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,650
<12-13,House>如果von willebrands因子减少,理论上可以促进凝血
<12-13,House>Someone low onvon willebrands,could theoretically clot.

297
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,520
<12-14,Chase>而第一次Clancy凝血的时候,他都在激动的讲述他的外星劫持
<12-14,Chase>And the first timeclancy clotted,he was all,worked uprecounting his alien abduction.

298
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,220
<12-14,Chase>很可能会血压升高
<12-14,Chase>He could have easilybeen hypertensive.

299
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,530
<12-15,House>如果要我把脖子里的芯片取出,我也会变激动的
<12-15,House>I know I get worked up when I cut,microchip trackingimplants out of my neck.

300
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,850
<12-16,Cameron>在我听起来像是作弊
<12-16,Cameron>Sounds like a cheat to me.

301
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,810
<12-17,House>我们知道
<12-17,House>Yeah,we get it.

302
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,860
<12-17,House>多次高血压危象的七岁男孩,他的鉴别诊断是什么
<12-17,House>Okay,what's the differentialfor seven-year-old,boys suffering multiplehypertensive crises?

303
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,050
<13-1,Chase>我们认为问题是在你们儿子的心脏上
<13-1,Chase>We think the problemis in your son's heart.

304
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,010
<13-1,Chase>我们得做一个经食道超声检查
<13-1,Chase>We need to do a procedurecalled,a transesophegeal echo.

305
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,980
<13-2,Dad>好的 这可以治好他的心脏?
<13-2,Dad>Okay,and that willfix his heart?

306
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,990
<13-3,Chase>这可以告诉我们问题出在何处
<13-3,Chase>That will tell uswhere the problem is.

307
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,130
<13-3,Chase>希望如此
<13-3,Chase>Hopefully.

308
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,010
<13-3,Chase>然后我们可以治好他
<13-3,Chase>Then we can fix him.

309
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,840
<13-3,Chase>听着...
<13-3,Chase>Listen...

310
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,780
<13-3,Chase>这不是我的职责 但是...
<13-3,Chase>this isn't reallypart of my job,but...

311
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,210
<13-3,Chase>他担心你们认为他疯了
<13-3,Chase>he's worried that you thinkhe's crazy.

312
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,520
<13-4,Mom>难道没疯么?
<13-4,Mom>Well,isn't he?

313
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,000
<13-5,Chase>还有非常多其他的的解释
<13-5,Chase>There are stillplenty of other,explanations for what's going on.

314
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,660
<13-5,Chase>重要的是他知道你们相信他
<13-5,Chase>It's important he knowsyou believe in him.

315
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,790
<13-5,Chase>即使你们不相信
<13-5,Chase>Even if you don'T.

316
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,440
<14-1,Foreman>没有问题,心脏不是问题所在
<14-1,Foreman>it's clean.His heartisn't the problem.

317
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,960
<14-1,Foreman>为什么我的办公室,就没有高清屏幕?
<14-1,Foreman>Why don't I have a hi defin my office?

<14-4,Cameron>- There are nostructural defects.- Valves are intact.

320
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,700
<14-5,House>象素点这么小 怎么辨认组织?
<14-5,House>Tissue characterizationis impossible,when the pixelsare the size of legos.

321
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,260
<14-5,House>看 这才像话!
<14-5,House>See,this iswhat I'm talking about.

322

<15-3,Chase>问题一定出在别处
<15-3,Chase>The problem's got to be somewhere else.

<16-7,House>- 要激光笔干嘛?,- 为什么不可以?
<16-7,House>- We don't havea laser pointer.- Well,why not?

335
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,390

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,400
<16-8,Chase>你发现心律不齐
<16-8,Chase>So you foundan arrhythmia.

339
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,860
<16-9,House>不是心律不齐 是根本没心率
<16-9,House>That's not an arrhythmia.That's a no-rhythmia.

340
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,680
<16-9,House>心肌细胞会收缩,这些根本没动
<16-9,House>Myocytes contract.These aren't movingat all.

341
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,690
<16-9,House>把它们切下来
<16-9,House>Go get methose myocytes.

342
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,890
<16-9,House>我要在办公室对它们训话
<16-9,House>I want to talk to themin my office.

343
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,120
<17-1,Cuddy>孩子怎么样?
<17-1,Cuddy>How's the kid doing?

344
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,940
<17-2,House>心脏几乎爆炸
<17-2,House>Heart nearly exploded.

345
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,010
<17-2,House>但还在跳动
<17-2,House>Still beating,though.

346
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,830
<17-2,House>至少大多数
<17-2,House>Most of it anyway.

347
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,910
<17-2,House>搞什么年龄限制 简直多此一举
<17-2,House>Why do they botherputting age,restrictions on these things

348
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,620
<17-2,House>总要点一下 "我已满18"
<17-2,House>when all you have to do is click"yes,I am 18"?

349
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,310
<17-2,House>17岁的也知道怎么做
<17-2,House>Even a 17-year-oldcan figure that out.

350
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,640
<17-3,Cuddy>你的腿怎么了?
<17-3,Cuddy>What's going onwith the leg?

351
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,920
<17-4,House>先告诉我你的胸怎么了
<17-4,House>First tell me what's going onwith the boobs.

352
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,870
<17-5,Cuddy>- 如果你感到疼痛,- 它们好似更挺了
<17-5,Cuddy>- If you're feeling pain...- they're firmer.

353
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,440
<17-6,House>因为有钢丝!
<17-6,House>It's called an underwire.

354
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
<17-7,Cuddy>我要对你的大脑做PET扫描
<17-7,Cuddy>I wanna geta pet scan of your brain.

355
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,150
<17-8,House>我想是荷尔蒙作用
<17-8,House>I think it's hormones.

356
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,640
<17-9,Cuddy>如果丘脑部没有异常
<17-9,Cuddy>As long as there'sno increased,activity in the thalamus--

357
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,690
<17-10,House>要我说简直可以加入乳品行业
<17-10,House>looks to melike those puppies are,going intothe dairy business.

358
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,630
<17-11,Cuddy>那么疼痛是好事
<17-11,Cuddy>Then the pain can be good.

359
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,140
<17-11,Cuddy>可能是肌肉再生
<17-11,Cuddy>It could be muscleregenerating.

360
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,590
<17-11,Cuddy>你锻炼 肌肉会酸痛,疼痛不代表K他命治疗失效
<17-11,Cuddy>After you work out,you get sore.Pain doesn't meanthe ketamine failed.

361
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,020
<17-12,House>也许我应该恭喜你,孩子爹是谁?
<17-12,House>Guess I should be sayingmazel tov.Who gets to pass outthe cigars?

362
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,600
<17-12,House>我没怀孕!
<17-12,House>I'm not pregnant.

363
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,230
<17-13,Cuddy>我要对你的大脑做PET扫描
<17-13,Cuddy>I need to geta pet scan of your brain.

364
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,650
<17-14,House>男孩女孩? 想好名字没有?
<17-14,House>Boy or girl?,You got a name picked out?

365
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,460
<17-16,House>- 我没怀孕,- 我的腿不疼
<17-16,House>- I'm not pregnant.- My leg doesn't hurt.

366
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,400
<17-17,Cuddy>- 你在逃避,- 不 我没有
<17-17,Cuddy>- You're in denial.- No,I'm not!

367
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,050
<17-18,House>好吧 算你赢
<17-18,House>Oh,you got me.

368
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,150
<17-18,House>如果我的腿在恶化
<17-18,House>If I thought thatmy leg was deteriorating,

369
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,230
<17-18,House>你以为我不会采取措施吗?
<17-18,House>don't you think I'd want totake,steps to prevent that?

370
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,150
<17-19,Cuddy>好吧
<17-19,Cuddy>Okay.

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,710
<17-20,House>要走了
<17-20,House>Gotta go.

372
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,680
<17-20,House>哈
<17-20,House>Ha.

373
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,230
<17-20,House>这是Clancy的DNA
<17-20,House>Here's clancy's dna.

374
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,980
<17-21,Chase>那是从心脏病灶活检取得的DNA
<17-21,Chase>And here's the dnafrom that piece,of his heart we just biopsied.

375
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,470
<17-22,House>不可能
<17-22,House>That is impossible.

376
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,020
<17-22,House>再做一次
<17-22,House>Run it again.

377
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,700
<17-23,Foreman>已经重复过
<17-23,Foreman>We already did.

378
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,540
<17-23,Foreman>重复两遍
<17-23,Foreman>And once moreafter that.

379
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,570
<17-24,Cameron>心肌细胞的DNA和其它部位的不一致
<17-24,Cameron>The genesfrom clancy's myocytes,don't match the genesfrom the rest of his body.

380
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,570
<17-25,Chase>异型DNA
<17-25,Chase>Alien dna.

381
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,690
<17-26,House>谁看科幻片的给点提示
<17-26,House>Anybody watch any x-files that,inspired an explanation?

382
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,250
<17-27,Foreman>DNA有可能变异
<17-27,Foreman>there are waysdna can become mutated.

383
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,940
<17-27,Foreman>如果暴露在强紫外线下
<17-27,Foreman>Extreme uv radiation.

384
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,180
<17-28,House>要有那么强的阳光,他的皮肤会变成健康的古铜色
<17-28,House>That much sun,he'd be dying with,a healthy bronze glow.

385
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,530
<17-29,Cameron>亚硝酸或者溴化乙锭
<17-29,Cameron>Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.

386
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,780
<17-30,House>他爸爸原先是性虐狂,现在成化学家了
<17-30,House>First daddy was a rapist,now he's a chemist.

387
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,150
<17-31,Chase>多种真菌能导致DNA变异
<17-31,Chase>various species of fungus have,been proven mutagenic.

388
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,580
<17-32,House>除非他狂吃芹菜,要么他住在印尼 或者两者皆有
<17-32,House>Not unless the kid'sbeen eating barrels,of celery or livingin indonesia or both.

389
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,580
<17-34,House>- 你的腿又疼了,- 这种问题有用么?
<17-34,House>- Is your leg hurting?,- Is that question helping?

390
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,720
<17-35,Cameron>- 你站歪了,- 你坐着
<17-35,Cameron>- You're leaning.- You're sitting.

391
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,540
<17-37,Cameron>- 你在单脚站,- 我头疼
<17-37,Cameron>- You're evading.- My head's hurting.

392
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,770
<17-38,House>请给我一个合适的
<17-38,House>Please,someone give mea plausible,

393
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,810
<17-38,House>不涉及外星生物的解释,关于孩子的异型DNA
<17-38,House>terrestrial explanationfor,this kid's alien dna.

394
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,120
<17-39,Foreman>我们可以到他家寻找毒物,真菌或者辐射源
<17-39,Foreman>We could search his homefor toxins,,fungals,and radiation.

395
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,900
<17-40,Chase>管他是什么导致的
<17-40,Chase>Who cares what caused it?

396
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,450
<17-40,Chase>小孩喉咙感染链球菌,我们会治好他
<17-40,Chase>A kid comes in with a strep,,we don't conduct a search to see

397
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,800
<17-40,Chase>而不是去研究哪个同学传染给他
<17-40,Chase>which classmatehe got it from,we cure it.

398
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,450
<17-40,Chase>知道有东西在他体内 那就切掉
<17-40,Chase>We know he's got this inside him.Let's get a scalpeland cut it out.

399
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,510
<17-41,Cameron>在哪儿切?  也许不仅在心脏
<17-41,Cameron>Where do we cut?,Chances are it's notjust in his heart.

400
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,020
<17-42,Foreman>发现心脏的毛病是我们走运
<17-42,Foreman>we got luckywith the heart.

401
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,550
<17-42,Foreman>肌细胞会收缩 所以,能看出那些细胞没有动
<17-42,Foreman>Myocytes contract,we could see,that these weren't working.

402
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,700
<17-42,Foreman>别的地方有毛病怎么发现?
<17-42,Foreman>I don't know how the hellwe're,gonna find it anywhere else.

403
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,180
<17-43,Cameron>我们在带有不正常DNA的心肌上取样,然后标记它们怎么样?
<17-43,Cameron>What if we takethe heart cells,with the bad dnaand we tag them?

404
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,350
<17-44,House>能打个比方吗?
<17-44,House>Can you phrase thatin the form of a metaphor?

405
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,220
<17-45,Cameron>和我们寻找肿瘤是一个办法
<17-45,Cameron>It's the same waywe search for cancer.

406
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,650
<17-45,Cameron>异常DNA会在细胞表面,产生独特的蛋白质
<17-45,Cameron>The bad dna creates a unique protein,on the surface of the affected cells.

407
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,350
<17-45,Cameron>我们再合成一种,只能识别那种蛋白质的抗体
<17-45,Cameron>We create an antibodythat recognizes,only that protein.

408
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,160
<17-45,Cameron>然后向他体内注入大量这样的抗体,那些相应的细胞就会...
<17-45,Cameron>We flush it throughout his system,and the similar cells light up like...

409
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,210
<17-45,Cameron>像灯泡一样亮起来
<17-45,Cameron>lightbulbs.

410
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,000
<17-46,House>好 就这么干了
<17-46,House>Okay.Let's do that.

411
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,090
<18-1,Cameron>你们得告诉他
<18-1,Cameron>You have to tell him.

412
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,160
<18-2,Cuddy>- 他说他一点也不疼,- 他在骗你们
<18-2,Cuddy>- He said he wasn'tin any pain.- He's lying.

413
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,550
<18-4,Wilson>那是当然
<18-4,Wilson>Of course he's lying.

414
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,060
<18-5,Cuddy>得订一个新计划
<18-5,Cuddy>We need another plan.

415
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,470
<18-6,Wilson>别那么说
<18-6,Wilson>Don't talk about itthat way.

416
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,760
<18-7,Cuddy>别怎么说?
<18-7,Cuddy>What way?

417
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,860
<18-8,Wilson>计划 听起来就像,我们在对他耍什么阴谋诡计
<18-8,Wilson>Plan.Sounds likewe're conspiring against him.

418
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,860
<18-9,Cameron>- 我要去告诉他,- 你不能说
<18-9,Cameron>- I'm gonna tell him.- No,you're not.

419
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,710
<18-11,Cameron>那就赶紧订一个巧妙的计划
<18-11,Cameron>Then come upwith a cunning plan and fast.

420
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,790
<18-12,Cuddy>她一定也不像她想象的那样讨人喜欢
<18-12,Cuddy>She's not nearly as delightfulas,she thinks she is.

421
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,360
<19-1,Clancy>这机器是干嘛的?
<19-1,Clancy>What's this machine do?

422
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,310
<19-2,Chase>它制造出好多噪音
<19-2,Chase>It makes a lot of noise.

423
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,140
<19-2,Chase>同时帮我们看看你到底出啥问题了
<19-2,Chase>And it's gonna help usfigure out,what's wrong with you.

424
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,410
<19-3,Foreman>你认为 House 走错了一步?
<19-3,Foreman>You think househas lost a step?

425
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,200
<19-3,Foreman>他没事
<19-3,Foreman>He's fine.

426
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,890
<19-4,Cameron>在那 股骨骨髓中有一团受侵袭的细胞
<19-4,Cameron>There,a clump of affected cellsin,the bone marrow of the femur.

427
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,750
<19-4,Cameron>解释了为什么有断断续续的出血紊乱
<19-4,Cameron>Explains the intermittentbleeding disorder.

428
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,220
<19-5,Foreman>如果House不比我们强,我不必屈服于他的折磨
<19-5,Foreman>'Cause I don't need tosubject myself,to house's tortureif there's no upside.

429
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,520
<19-6,Cameron>我说了 他没问题
<19-6,Cameron>I'm telling you,he's fine.

430
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,350
<19-6,Cameron>我们还遗漏了其他受侵袭的心肌细胞
<19-6,Cameron>We missed some affected cells in his heart.

431
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,760
<19-6,Cameron>这解释了他持续的高血压问题
<19-6,Cameron>Explains the continuinghypertensive issues.

432
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,680
<19-7,Foreman>你说他的上一个病例打击了House,怎么你现在突然...
<19-7,Foreman>You said the last casereally threw him.And now suddenly...

433
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,020
<19-8,Cameron>我说错了
<19-8,Cameron>I was wrong.

434
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,160
<19-9,Foreman>所以你改变主意了
<19-9,Foreman>So you changedyour mind.

435
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,670
<19-9,Foreman>为什么?
<19-9,Foreman>Why?

436
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,580
<19-9,Foreman>他在这个病例上的,所有天才想法都是你的
<19-9,Foreman>His brilliant ideason this case,have all been yours.

437
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,540
<19-10,Cameron>他为什么需要带眼镜?
<19-10,Cameron>There's the reason for him needing glasS.

438
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,790
<19-10,Cameron>很明显这是一种病症,说明他的病很早就...
<19-10,Cameron>Apparently it's a symptom.Means the condition predates--

439
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,710
<19-11,Foreman>没原因的话你是不会改变主意的
<19-11,Foreman>you don't change your mindwithout a reason.

440
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,360
<19-11,Foreman>你知道什么了?
<19-11,Foreman>What do you know?

441
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,580
<19-11,Foreman>House...
<19-11,Foreman>House...

442
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,010
<19-12,Cameron>在上个病例里没有错
<19-12,Cameron>didn't blow the last case.

443
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,480
<19-12,Cameron>Cuddy用House的建议治好了那人
<19-12,Cameron>Cuddy cured the guyusing house's idea.

444
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
<19-12,Cameron>但Cuddy和 Wilson想教他学会谦虚
<19-12,Cameron>Cuddy and wilsonare trying to,teach him some humility.

445
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,860
<19-12,Cameron>扫描完了 三个病灶,但是没有一个在大脑中
<19-12,Cameron>Scan is complete.Three hot spots,but nothing in his brain.

446
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,300
<19-12,Cameron>House 原来的理论是对的
<19-12,Cameron>House's original theorywas right.

447
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,920
<19-12,Cameron>不是神经方面的问题
<19-12,Cameron>It is not neurological.

448
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,470
<20-1,Dad>以后他还能走路吗?
<20-1,Dad>is he gonna be able to walk?

449
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,980
<20-2,Chase>恢复后他的腿应该还是有功能的
<20-2,Chase>his leg should be functional after some rehab.

450
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,380
<20-3,Mom>有功能? 什么意思?
<20-3,Mom>Functional?,What does that mean?

451
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,650
<20-3,Mom>他能走 但是不能跑?,他会瘸吗?
<20-3,Mom>He's be able to walkbut not run?,He'll have a limp?

452
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,240
<20-4,Chase>如果一切顺利的话 他能走也能跑
<20-4,Chase>If everything goes well,he'll walk,he'll run.

453
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,940
<20-4,Chase>甚至会比现在更强壮
<20-4,Chase>He'll probably beeven stronger than he is now.

454
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,410
<20-4,Chase>当他被麻醉后 我们打开他的腿
<20-4,Chase>Whwhen we close him up,we'll move,over to his other leg.

455
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,740
<20-4,Chase>把一根导管从股动脉插进去直到心脏
<20-4,Chase>Snake a catheter up through the femoral,artery and into his heart.

456
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,200
<20-4,Chase>当异常细胞被移走后,正常组织就可以行使功能
<20-4,Chase>Once the affected areas are removed,,his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.

457
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,790
<20-4,Chase>他也不该再会有血压方面的问题了
<20-4,Chase>He should have no more problemswith,his blood pressure.

458
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,300
<20-4,Chase>当我们确定那些区域已经清除干净后,就会进行最后的程序
<20-4,Chase>After confirmingthose areas are clear,,we'll startthe final procedure.

459
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,250
<20-4,Chase>我将向瞳孔中插入一根针,把视网膜上的那些异常细胞清除掉
<20-4,Chase>I'm gonna insert a needlethrough the pupil,and get rid of theabnormal cells in the retina.

460
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,290
<21-1,Chase>把右眼闭上
<21-1,Chase>Close your right eye.

461
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,290
<21-1,Chase>能看到我的脸吗?
<21-1,Chase>Can you see my face?

462
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,330
<21-2,Clancy>能 很清楚
<21-2,Clancy>Yeah.It's clear.

463
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,800
<21-3,Chase>你可以把你的眼镜扔掉了,一切搞掂
<21-3,Chase>You can throw awayyour glasses.We got it all.

464
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,010
<21-3,Chase>睡会儿吧
<21-3,Chase>Get some sleep.

465
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
<21-3,Chase>明天你就回家了
<21-3,Chase>You're going home tomorrow.

466
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,040
<21-4,Clancy>谢谢你
<21-4,Clancy>Thank you.

467
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,300
<22-1,Wilson>想出去跑跑吗?
<22-1,Wilson>You wannago for a run?

468
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,910
<22-2,House>你想干啥?
<22-2,House>What do you want?

469
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,290
<22-3,Wilson>我想你没事跑跑
<22-3,Wilson>I want you to run.

470
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,960
<22-4,House>你什么时候变成一个促进者了?
<22-4,House>When did youbecome an enabler?

471
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,300
<22-5,Wilson>我想敦促你多运动运动
<22-5,Wilson>I'm enabling youto exercise.

472
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,100
<22-5,Wilson>Vicodin(止痛药)阻止了疼痛,你挺过了你的恢复期
<22-5,Wilson>Vicodin blocks the pain,,you get through your rehab.

473
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,200
<22-5,Wilson>肌肉力量增强 疼痛减少
<22-5,Wilson>Muscle strength increases,and pain decreases.

474
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,530
<22-6,House>我可不想靠止痛片来过日子
<22-6,House>I'd rather not becomedependent on,pain pills to get through my day.

475
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,320
<22-7,Wilson>你和其他病人真是太像了
<22-7,Wilson>You're just likeany other patient.

476
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,690
<22-7,Wilson>装作不知道不会使你快乐
<22-7,Wilson>Running away from knowledgethat,won't make you happy.

477
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,230
<22-8,House>我就像个撇大条的小猪一样快乐
<22-8,House>I'm as happyas a pig in poop.

478
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,440
<22-9,Wilson>你害怕K他命的治疗效果会逐渐消失
<22-9,Wilson>You're scared the ketaminetreatment's,wearing off.

479
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,370
<22-9,Wilson>那只是一个...
<22-9,Wilson>That it was just A...

480
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,420
<22-9,Wilson>通向美好生活的一个痛苦窗口
<22-9,Wilson>torturous windowto the good life.

481
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,610
<22-10,House>是哪一部分大条难道你不知道吗?
<22-10,House>What part of poopdidn't you understand?

482
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,570
<22-11,Wilson>为什么你如此肯定那不是肌肉酸痛?
<22-11,Wilson>How can you be so sureit isn't,just a sore muscle?

483
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,110
<22-11,Wilson>因为这是我的腿
<22-11,Wilson>It's my leg.

484
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,510
<22-12,House>我们认识彼此很久了
<22-12,House>We've known each othera long time.

485
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,050
<22-13,Wilson>你并不总是对的 House
<22-13,Wilson>You're not always right,house.

486
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,430
<22-13,Wilson>你近来已有证明
<22-13,Wilson>You've proven that lately.

487
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,370
<23-1,Mom>- 他怎么了?,- 他癫痫发作了
<23-1,Mom>- What's happening to him?,- He's seizing.

488
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,230
<23-3,Dad>- 给我氯硝安定,- 我以为你们都治好了!
<23-3,Dad>- I need clonazepam.- I thought you got it all!

489
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,410
<23-4,Chase>好 继续朝我吼,那样孩子就能治好了
<23-4,Chase>Yeah,yell at me.That'll fix the kid.

490
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,610
<23-4,Chase>显然我们遗漏了某些外来的组织,还有一些在他的体内
<23-4,Chase>bviously we missedsome foreign tissue.There's somethingstill in him.

491
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,370
<24-1,Cameron>幻觉的发作意味着颞前叶出了问题
<24-1,Cameron>The hallucinationsand seizures,indicate problemsin the temporal lobe.

492
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,010
<24-2,Foreman>对不起 House 这是个神经上的问题
<24-2,Foreman>Sorry,house,it is neurological.

493
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,920
<24-2,Foreman>看起来你又错了一次
<24-2,Foreman>Looks likeyou were wrong,again.

494
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,510
<24-3,Chase>我们什么也没漏掉
<24-3,Chase>We didn't miss anythinG.

495
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,590
<24-3,Chase>大脑的扫描一点问题也没有
<24-3,Chase>The brain scanwas completely clean.

496
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,700
<24-4,House>我们的标记物一定没有穿透血脑屏障
<24-4,House>Our tag must not have penetratedthe,blood brain barrier.

497
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,070
<24-4,House>这次不要走静脉了,直接进大脑
<24-4,House>Don't use an iv this time,,get it right into the brain.

498
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,760
<24-4,House>没有细胞亮起来
<24-4,House>no cells are lighting up.

499
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,950
<25-1,Cameron>他的大脑没问题
<25-1,Cameron>His brain is clean.

500
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,020
<25-1,Cameron>不是神经问题
<25-1,Cameron>It is not neurological.

501
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,190
<26-1,Foreman>他的症状是神经性质的
<26-1,Foreman>His symptomsare neurological.

502
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,230
<26-1,Foreman>肯定是由神经引起的
<26-1,Foreman>His conditionhas to be neurological.

503
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,960
<26-2,Cameron>扫描了两次都没问题
<26-2,Cameron>His scan was clean twice.

504
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,760
<26-2,Cameron>不在大脑里
<26-2,Cameron>It's not there.

505
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,460
<26-3,House>会不会它就在那里 而只是扫描不出来呢?
<26-3,House>What if it is there,,but didn't show up on the scan?

506
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,900
<26-3,House>会不会标记物在大脑里没用了呢?
<26-3,House>What if the tagjust doesn't work,in his brain?

507
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,560
<26-3,House>大脑细胞的结构是不同的,他们表达不同的蛋白质
<26-3,House>Brain cellsare structurally different.They express a different protein.

508
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,160
<26-4,Chase>那我们怎样才能发现它?
<26-4,Chase>So how do we find it?

509
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,340
<26-5,Cameron>我们去哪?
<26-5,Cameron>Where are we going?

510
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,130
<26-6,House>我去思考
<26-6,House>I am going to think.

511
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,090
<27-1,House>把那孩子送回家
<27-1,House>Send the kid home.

512
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,850
<27-2,Cameron>你是什么意思?
<27-2,Cameron>What do you mean?

513
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,910
<27-3,House>确保他的血压正常 把他送回家
<27-3,House>Make sure his blood pressureis,stabilized and send him home.

514
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,950
<27-4,Chase>就像什么事都没发生一样?
<27-4,Chase>Like nothing ever happened?

515
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,150
<27-4,Chase>我们治好了他的出血紊乱
<27-4,Chase>We curedhis bleeding disorder

516
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,380
<27-5,House>清除了所有我们能发现的被损坏细胞
<27-5,House>and removed all the damagedcells we could find.

517
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,960
<27-6,Chase>我们并不知道我们治好了什么,这才一天
<27-6,Chase>We don't knowthat we fixed anything.It's only been a day.

518
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,490
<27-6,Chase>也许这些症状就会像,出血紊乱一样间歇发作
<27-6,Chase>Maybe these symptoms come and go,like the blood disorder.

519
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,660
<27-7,House>更有可能他其余的症状仅仅只是
<27-7,House>It's more probablethat his remaining symptoms are

520
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,190
<27-7,House>一个恶梦
<27-7,House>just a nightmare.

521
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,510
<27-8,Foreman>可他产生了惊厥
<27-8,Foreman>He had a convulsion.

522
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,890
<27-8,Foreman>也许是癫痫 也许是心理疾病
<27-8,Foreman>Maybe epilepsy,maybe psychological.

523
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,280
<27-9,House>也许什么都不是
<27-9,House>Maybe nothing.

524
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,880
<27-9,House>如果孩子又病了 会给我们,新的线索 我们再次调查
<27-9,House>If the kid gets sick again,that'll give us,another clue and we'llstart searching again.

525
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,660
<27-9,House>如果没有 那就没事了
<27-9,House>If he doesn't,it doesn't matter.

526
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,230
<27-9,House>送他回家吧
<27-9,House>Send him home.

527
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,820
<27-9,House>House!
<27-9,House>House!

528
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,860
<28-1,Cuddy>你就这么放弃这个孩子了
<28-1,Cuddy>You're just giving upon this kid?

529
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,540
<28-2,House>你得知道什么时候该停手
<28-2,House>You gotta knowwhen to stop.

530
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,280
<28-3,Cuddy>可你不会停手
<28-3,Cuddy>You don't stop.

531
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,350
<28-3,Cuddy>你从不会停手,你会一直坚持下去直到做出一些
<28-3,Cuddy>You never stop,you just keep on,going until you come up

532
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,640
<28-3,Cuddy>常常是正确的疯狂事情
<28-3,Cuddy>with something so insane that,it's usually right.

533
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,990
<28-4,House>除了上个病例
<28-4,House>Except on my last case.

534
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,580
<28-5,Cuddy>别装可怜
<28-5,Cuddy>Don't be pathetic.

535
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,510
<28-4,House>忘了上个病例吧
<28-4,House>Just forgetthe last case.

536
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,820
<28-5,Cuddy>这孩子明显有些不对头
<28-5,Cuddy>This kid obviouslyhas something wrong with him.

537
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,230
<28-6,House>什么时候你对我的病人,有如此强硬的主张了?
<28-6,House>When did you developsuch strong,opinions about my patients?

538
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,660
<28-6,House>上星期你还确信我的病人没病
<28-6,House>Last week you were convinced that,my patient wasn't sick.

539
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,260
<28-6,House>现在你又确信这个有病
<28-6,House>Now you're convincedthis one is.

540
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,100
<28-7,Cuddy>因为这是一个小男孩
<28-7,Cuddy>This oneis a young boy.

541
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,860
<28-7,Cuddy>他爸妈都绝望了
<28-7,Cuddy>His parents are desperate.

542
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,100
<28-7,Cuddy>只需回到你的团队,多花一点时间...
<28-7,Cuddy>Just get togetherwith your team,,spend a few extra hours...

543
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,530
<28-8,House>好吧 我想我们可以切除他的左腿
<28-8,House>well,I guess we couldamputate his left leg.

544
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,190
<28-8,House>在那里发现最多,还要把受侵袭的眼球摘掉
<28-8,House>It's wherewe found most of it.Maybe we,should just removehis affected eye completely.

545
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,850
<28-9,Cuddy>如果你相信那养对他好...
<28-9,Cuddy>If you have reason to believethat,that might help...

546
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,730
<28-10,House>我不会去切他的身体
<28-10,House>I'm not gonna startlopping off body parts.

547
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,290
<28-10,House>但是很有意思 你给我开了绿灯
<28-10,House>But it's interesting that yougive,me the green light.

548
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,330
<28-11,Cuddy>我只是想你有所作为
<28-11,Cuddy>I just want youto do something.

549
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,240
<28-12,House>这一个星期来你的支持已经过头了
<28-12,House>You've been overly supportivethis,entire week.

550
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,610
<28-12,House>要么是受到荷尔蒙,要么是负罪感的驱使
<28-12,House>Well,either you're hormonal or you're,guilt-ridden.

551
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,640
<28-12,House>当然对于怀孕来说,受到荷尔蒙影响还早了些
<28-12,House>And it's too earlyin the pregnancy,for this to be hormonal.

552
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,100
<28-14,House>- 我没有怀孕,- 那你做错什么了?
<28-14,House>- I'm not pregnant.- Then what did you do wrong?

553
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,580
<28-14,House>他确实有阿狄森氏病
<28-14,House>He had addison'S.

554
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,250
<28-15,Cuddy>你的上个病人 你是对的
<28-15,Cuddy>Your last patient.You were right.

555
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,460
<28-15,Cuddy>我给他打了一针可的松,然后他就像 Rip Van Winkle 一样醒来,(美国短篇小说，其主人公一觉睡了20年)
<28-15,Cuddy>I gave him one shot of cortisoland,he work up like rip van winkle.

556
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,710
<28-16,House>噢 你妈妈碰到麻烦了
<28-16,House>Oh,your mommy'sin such trouble.

557
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,550
<28-16,House>她是个骗子
<28-16,House>She's such a liar.

558
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,740
<28-16,House>这就是你为啥没有老爸,为啥她不得不...
<28-16,House>That's why youdon't have a daddy.That's why she had to...

559
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,910
<29-1,House>一个人怎么可能...
<29-1,House>how does one person...

560
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,010
<29-1,House>带着两套不同的 DNA?
<29-1,House>end up withtwo different sets of dna?

561
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,300
<29-3,House>- 我们已经谈过了,- 我们的假设不对
<29-3,House>- We've been through this.- Our assumptions are faulty.

562
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,790
<29-4,Chase>我们已经确认有两套 DNA,序列测了不止一次
<29-4,Chase>We've confirmedtwo different sets of dna.We re-ran the sequence.

563
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,170
<29-5,House>我没说实验室搞错了,我是说我们的假设错了
<29-5,House>I didn't say the lab workwas faulty,,I said our assumptionswere faulty.

564
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,280
<29-5,House>我们假设他是一个人
<29-5,House>We assumedhe's a person.

565
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,160
<29-6,Foreman>当然了 外星人不仅仅拜访了他,还把他给换了
<29-6,Foreman>Of course.The aliensdidn't just visit him,,they replaced him.

566
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,440
<29-7,House>你真笨
<29-7,House>You're being silly.

567
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,290
<29-7,House>如果他不是一个人 而是两个人?
<29-7,House>What if he's not a person?,What if he's two persons?

568
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,400
<29-9,House>- 我不懂你的比喻,- 没有比喻
<29-9,House>- I'm not gettingthe metaphor.- No metaphor.

569
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,020
<29-9,House>Chase说他妈妈曾接受过人工授精 对吗?
<29-9,House>Chase said the mom used in vitro,fertilization,right?

570
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,420
<29-10,Chase>是的 他们无法受孕
<29-10,Chase>Yeah,they had troubleconceiving.

571
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,680
<29-11,House>孩子一直没问题,直到他被植入了某些东西
<29-11,House>Kid was right all along.He was implanted with something.

572
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,540
<29-11,House>回到他小时候 我是说,很小的时候 比如只有12个细胞时
<29-11,House>Back when he was young.I mean,really young.Like 12 cells young.

573
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,490
<29-11,House>体外培养增加了双胞胎的可能性
<29-11,House>In vitro increasesthe likelihood of twinning.

574
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,920
<29-12,Cameron>可是他没有孪生兄弟
<29-12,Cameron>But he doesn't havea twin.

575
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,360
<29-13,House>别绕远了...
<29-13,House>Not walking around...

576
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,760
<29-13,House>但人工授精费用是2万5千美金
<29-13,House>but in vitro fertilization costs,around 25 grand a pop.

577
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,320
<29-13,House>所以要移植2到6个胚胎,以使物有所值
<29-13,House>So doctors implant two to six embryos,to make sure you get your money's worth.

578
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,090
<29-13,House>问题是 并不总有足够的卧室,给这些小宝贝们住
<29-13,House>The problem is,there's not always,enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.

579
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,330
<29-13,House>所以两兄弟就不得不分享一个空间,却没有上下铺
<29-13,House>Two brothers get stuck sharing,,but there's no bunk beds.

580
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,960
<29-13,House>所以他们就抱在一起取暖,而且再也不会分开
<29-13,House>So they cuddle up to keep warm,and they never untangle.

581
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,610
<29-13,House>他是合二为一
<29-13,House>He's two people in one.

582
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,040
<29-13,House>这就叫嵌合体,(Chimera 希腊神话中的合体怪物)
<29-13,House>It's called chimerism.

583
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,730
<30-1,House>不幸的是 他兄弟...
<30-1,House>Unfortunately,his brother'S...

584
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,640
<30-1,House>像是一个坏的替身
<30-1,House>like a bad doubles partner.

585
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,400
<30-1,House>那家伙只是占据空间 拦在路上
<30-1,House>The guy just takes up space,gets in the way.

586
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,790
<30-1,House>Clancy的身体认为能将他轻松干掉
<30-1,House>Clancy's body thinks he's gonnaput,away the easy winners,

587
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,170
<30-1,House>但他兄弟一直发挥出色
<30-1,House>his brother just keepsswatting,the balls into the net.

588
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,300
<30-1,House>我们得把他从球场上拽下来了
<30-1,House>We gotta get himoff the court.

589
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,540
<30-2,Mom>你能找出他大脑中的坏细胞?,能还是不能?
<30-2,Mom>So does that meanthat you can find,the bad cellsin his brain or not?

590
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,680
<30-3,House>好吧 不用比喻形式也可以
<30-3,House>Sure,abandon the metaphor.Fine.

591
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,470
<30-3,House>Clancy 和他兄弟想得不一样,因为他也在思考
<30-3,House>Clancy thinks differentlythan his brother...because he thinks.

592
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,290
<30-3,House>如果我们诱导一个外星人诱拐行动...
<30-3,House>If we inducean alien abduction...

593
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,990
<30-4,Dad>等等 你到底在说什么?
<30-4,Dad>wait,what the hellare you talking about?

594
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,910
<30-5,House>你儿子的脑中一直有外来DNA
<30-5,House>The foreign dnahas got to be in the,portionof your son's brain

595
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,170
<30-5,House>所以他相信自己被诱拐了
<30-5,House>that makes him believe that he's being abducted.

596
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,900
<30-5,House>用电极刺激这些神经元,就能哄骗你儿子的大脑产生幻觉
<30-5,House>If we stimulate those neuronswith an electric,probe,we can trick your son's braininto hallucinating.

597
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,830
<30-5,House>你儿子的神经元就会亮起来,而他兄弟的细胞会继续保持黑暗
<30-5,House>Your son's neurons will light up,,and his brother's cellswill remain dark.

598
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,380
<30-5,House>那就是我们要切除的部分
<30-5,House>Those are the oneswe cut out.

599
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,440
<30-6,Mom>你是在说一个脑外科手术
<30-6,Mom>You're talking aboutbrain surgery.

600
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,770
<30-6,Mom>我说的是一个很酷的脑外科手术
<30-6,Mom>I'm talking aboutreally cool brain surgery.

601
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,560
<30-7,House>你的一个儿子会死
<30-7,House>One of your sons will die.

602
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,690
<30-7,House>但是个子高的那个,再也不会有人烦他
<30-7,House>But the taller one won't beso annoying anymore.

603
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,900
<31-1,Clancy>这么说我有一个孪生兄弟?
<31-1,Clancy>So I have a twin?

604
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,240
<31-2,Chase>不一定
<31-2,Chase>Not really.

605
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,610
<31-2,Chase>卡片上有什么?
<31-2,Chase>What's on the card?

606
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,800
<31-3,Clancy>电灯泡
<31-3,Clancy>Light bulb.

607
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,400
<31-4,House>让我们从10开始
<31-4,House>Start us out at ten.

608
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,630
<31-5,Clancy>我没有动
<31-5,Clancy>I'm not doing that.

609
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,390
<31-6,House>是我做的 孩子 对不起
<31-6,House>It was all me,kid.Sorry.

610
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,790
<31-7,Foreman>你在活动区域
<31-7,Foreman>You're in motor function.

611
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,210
<31-7,Foreman>试着往后退2厘米
<31-7,Foreman>Try two centimeters back.

612
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,300
<31-8,Clancy>他住在我身体里
<31-8,Clancy>He lives inside me.

613
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,680
<31-9,Chase>差不多
<31-9,Chase>Sort of.

614
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,910
<31-10,Clancy>好痒 别挠我的脚了
<31-10,Clancy>That tickles.Stop tickling my feet.

615
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,070
<31-11,Foreman>你到了感知区域 再近点
<31-11,Foreman>You're in sensory.Getting closer.

616
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,990
<31-12,Chase>- 这张上你看到了什么?,- 月亮和星星
<31-12,Chase>- What do you seeon this one?,- Moon and stars.

617
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,660
<31-12,Chase>那么...
<31-12,Chase>So...

618
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,670
<31-13,Clancy>我是不是很奇怪?
<31-13,Clancy>I am kind of weird?

619
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,800
<31-14,Chase>我们都很奇怪
<31-14,Chase>We're all kind of weird.

620
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,960
<31-15,Clancy>不!
<31-15,Clancy>No!

621
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,150
<31-17,Foreman>- Clancy?,- 有状况
<31-17,Foreman>- Clancy?,- We got something.

622

<31-18,Chase>- 你看到什么了?,- 光
<31-18,Chase>- What do you see?,- The light.

623
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,860
<31-19,Clancy>他们来了 我想
<31-19,Clancy>Here they come.I think.

624
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,980
<31-20,Foreman>脑电波显示轻度幻觉
<31-20,Foreman>Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.

625
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,270
<31-21,House>- 神经元亮起来了,- 那些暗点呢?
<31-21,House>- Neurons are lighting up.- Any dark spots?

626
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,030
<31-22,Foreman>- 区域太模糊了,- 幻觉还不够强烈
<31-22,Foreman>- area's too fuzzy.- Hallucinationisn't strong enough.

627
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,770
<31-23,House>提高刺激强度
<31-23,House>Turn up the juice.

628
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,730
<31-24,Chase>他的血压已经160/110了,再高的话...
<31-24,Chase>His blood pressure's alreadyat 160 over 110.Any higher and...

629
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,900
<31-25,House>变傻瓜总比没命好
<31-25,House>riding the short bus is betterthan not breathing.

630
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,680
<31-25,House>加到100
<31-25,House>Take us to 100.

631
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,650
<31-26,Foreman>区域还是太模糊了,无法区别
<31-26,Foreman>Area's still too fuzzy to make,any kind of distinction.

632
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,940
<31-27,House>再加高
<31-27,House>Crank it up higher.

633
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
<31-28,Chase>你已经超过预设的最大值了
<31-28,Chase>You've already exceededthe pre-set maximum.

634
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,440
<31-28,Chase>再加下去大脑就要被毁了
<31-28,Chase>Next step's brain damage.

635
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,450
<31-29,House>他们要抓走你,他们正穿过围墙
<31-29,House>They're gonna get you.They're comingthrough the walls.

636
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,760
<31-29,House>他们要抓走你 折磨你
<31-29,House>They're gonna take you,torture you.

637
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,360
<31-29,House>你再也看不到你爸妈了
<31-29,House>You'll never see your parents again.

638
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,830
<31-29,House>Clancy 能听到我说话吗?
<31-29,House>Clancy,can you hear me?

639
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,710
<31-30,Clancy>Clancy?
<31-30,Clancy>Clancy?

640
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,740
<31-30,Clancy>你抓到他们了
<31-30,Clancy>You got them.

641

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,970
<31-33,Chase>一切再次恢复正常
<31-33,Chase>Everything's gonnabe normal again.

645
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,840
<32-1,House>你相信Cuddy会耍我吗?
<32-1,House>You believe what cuddytried to pull?

646
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,300
<32-2,Wilson>又怎么了?
<32-2,Wilson>What now?

647
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,370
<32-3,House>她骗了我
<32-3,House>She lied to me.

648
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,940
<32-3,House>她利用我的诊断治好了我的病人,然后她撒了谎
<32-3,House>She cured my patientwith my diagnos,,then she lied about it.

649
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,900
<32-4,Wilson>听起来可不像她
<32-4,Wilson>That doesn'tsound like her.

650
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,140
<32-4,Wilson>没错
<32-4,Wilson>You're right.

651
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,870
<32-5,House>但是像你
<32-5,House>Does soundlike you,though.

652
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,020
<32-6,Wilson>Cuddy到底跟你说了什么?
<32-6,Wilson>What exactlydid cuddy tell you?

653
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,730
<32-7,House>和你现在的身体语言所告诉我的一样
<32-7,House>Nothing thatyour body language,isn't telling me right now.

654
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,530
<32-7,House>计划是怎样的?
<32-7,House>So what was the plan?

655
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,050
<32-7,House>由于无法治好一个病人,而变得如此谦逊...
<32-7,House>I'd feel so humbled by missing a case...

656
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,150
<32-7,House>重新评估我的整个生活,领悟真和善 变成 Cameron?
<32-7,House>that I'd re-evaluatemy entire life,question,the natureof truth and goodness,and become cameron?

657
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,970
<32-8,Wilson>差不多是那样的
<32-8,Wilson>Something like that.

658
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,660
<32-8,Wilson>如果我们告诉你真相
<32-8,Wilson>More that if we told you the truth,

659
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,300
<32-8,Wilson>你解决了一个病例,却不基于任何医学证据
<32-8,Wilson>that you'd solved a casebased on,absolutely no medical proof,

660
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,420
<32-8,Wilson>你会认为自己是上帝的
<32-8,Wilson>you'd think you were god.

661
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,550
<32-8,Wilson>我担心你的翅膀会融化,(希腊神话英雄Icarus)
<32-8,Wilson>And I was worriedyour wings would melt.

662
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,680
<32-9,House>上帝不会瘸的
<32-9,House>God doesn't limp.
