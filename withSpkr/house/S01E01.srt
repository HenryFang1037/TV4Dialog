1
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,500
<1-1,Melanie>怎么迟到啦
<1-1,Melanie>Why are you late?

2
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,460
<1-2,Rebecca>你是不会喜欢我的答案
<1-2,Rebecca>You're not going to like the answer.

3
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,980
<1-3,Melanie>我早就知道了
<1-3,Melanie>I already know the answer.

4
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,890
<1-4,Rebecca>我没赶上公车
<1-4,Rebecca>I missed the bus.

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,590
<1-5,Melanie>那当然咯
<1-5,Melanie>I don't doubt it.

6
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,400
<1-5,Melanie>布莱家附近没有公车站
<1-5,Melanie>No bus stops near Brad's.

7
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,700
<1-5,Melanie>你在他家过夜  闹钟没响
<1-5,Melanie>You spent the night, the alarm didn't work

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,400
<1-5,Melanie>响了也当没听见
<1-5,Melanie>or maybe it did.

9
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,560
<1-6,Rebecca>我没有跟他上床
<1-6,Rebecca>I didn't sleep with him.

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,900
<1-7,Melanie>美女  事情才没这么简单
<1-7,Melanie>Girl, either there's something

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,900
<1-8,Rebecca>只不过是没赶上公车
<1-8,Rebecca>I missed the bus!

12
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,940
<1-9,Melanie>要么是你有问题
<1-9,Melanie>There's something either very wrong with you

13
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,410
<1-9,Melanie>要么是他有问题
<1-9,Melanie>or something very wrong with him.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,840
<1-10,Rebecca>他没有问题
<1-10,Rebecca>There's nothing wrong with him.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,820
<1-12,Rebecca>马琳  我得走了
<1-12,Rebecca>Melanie, I gotta go.

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,010
<1-13,Melanie>你在忽悠我的  对吧
<1-13,Melanie>You're lying, aren't you?

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,820
<1-14,Rebecca>我才不会忽悠你
<1-14,Rebecca>I wouldn't lie to you.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,410
<1-14,Rebecca>早上好呀  小朋友们
<1-14,Rebecca>Good morning, guys!

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,920
<1-15,Class>早上好  丽贝卡老师
<1-15,Class>Good morning, Miss Rebecca!

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,750
<1-16,Rebecca>-大家都到齐了吗  -是的
<1-16,Rebecca>- Everybody's in their seats? - Yes.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,900
<1-16,Rebecca>好的
<1-16,Rebecca>Okay.

22
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,160
<1-16,Rebecca>仙蒂
<1-16,Rebecca>Sydney,

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,790
<1-18,Rebecca>告诉大家你这个周末都干什么啦
<1-18,Rebecca>why don't you tell us what you did this weekend?

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,040
<1-18,Rebecca>来吧  仙蒂
<1-18,Rebecca>Come on, Sydney.

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,130
<1-18,Rebecca>你可不是个害羞的孩子哦
<1-18,Rebecca>We know you're not shy.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,890
<1-19,Sidney>为什么总让我们说
<1-19,Sidney>How come we always have to tell you what we did,

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,660
<1-19,Sidney>而你却从来不说呢
<1-19,Sidney>and you never tell us what you did?

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,440
<1-19,Sidney>好吧
<1-19,Sidney>Okay.

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,600
<1-21,Rebecca>我这个周末过的棒极了
<1-21,Rebecca>I had a really great weekend.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,780
<1-21,Rebecca>但你们不可以告诉马琳老师哦  好吗
<1-21,Rebecca>But you can't tell Miss Melanie, okay?

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,700
<1-22,Sidney>你做什么啦
<1-22,Sidney>What did you do?

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,300
<1-23,Rebecca>我交了个新朋友
<1-23,Rebecca>I made a new friend.

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,330
<1-23,Rebecca>交新朋友总是很开心的  对吗
<1-23,Rebecca>It's so much fun to make new friends, isn't it?

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,850
<1-24,Class>是呀  是呀
<1-24,Class>Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,820
<1-25,Girl 2>告诉你爸妈你那位新朋友了吗
<1-25,Girl 2>Did you tell your mom and dad about your new friend?

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,060
<1-26,Rebecca>当然咯
<1-26,Rebecca>Absolutely.

37
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,150
<1-26,Rebecca>任何事都不可以瞒着爸妈
<1-26,Rebecca>You should never keep anything from your parents.

38
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,360
<1-26,Rebecca>我说完我的...
<1-26,Rebecca>And I told mine

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,790
<1-30,Class>C-A- L-
<1-30,Class>C-A- L-

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,220
<1-31,Class>H-E   The
<1-31,Class>H-E, The!

41
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,160
<1-33,Boy>我们认识那个字  The
<1-33,Boy>We know that word. "The."

43
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,310
<1-33,Boy>女性  29岁
<1-33,Boy>Twenty-nine-year old female.

44
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,930
<1-34,Wilson>在一个月前首次癫痫发作
<1-34,Wilson>First seizure one month ago.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,290
<1-34,Wilson>失去语言能力  只能像婴儿一样嘟囔
<1-34,Wilson>Lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby.

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,700
<1-34,Wilson>阶段性智力退化
<1-34,Wilson>Progressive deterioration of mental status.

47
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,430
<1-38,Wilson>看见没
<1-38,Wilson>You see that?

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,700
<1-35,House>就因为这拐杖  大家都把我当病人
<1-35,House>They all assume I'm a patient because of this cane.

49
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,890
<1-36,Wilson>那就像我们一样穿上白大褂
<1-36,Wilson>So put on a white coat like the rest of us.

50
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,710
<1-37,House>我更不想让人知道我是医生
<1-37,House>I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.

51
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,710
<1-38,Wilson>难怪你会让上面这么头疼
<1-38,Wilson>You see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude?

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,710
<1-39,House>没有人会要一个有病的医生
<1-39,House>People don't want a sick doctor.

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,410
<1-40,Wilson>当然咯  我也不要健康的病人
<1-40,Wilson>That's fair enough. I don't like healthy patients.

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,710
<1-40,Wilson>这名二十九岁女病人
<1-40,Wilson>The 29-year old female

55
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,980
<1-41,House>就喜欢她不会说话
<1-41,House>The one who can't talk? I like that part.

56
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,050
<1-42,Wilson>她是我的表妹
<1-42,Wilson>She's my cousin.

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,660
<1-43,House>你表妹肯定不会喜欢我的诊断
<1-43,House>And your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis.

58
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,560
<1-43,House>我也不会
<1-43,House>I wouldn't either.

59
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,130
<1-43,House>得的是脑瘤  命不久矣  无聊透顶
<1-43,House>Brain tumor. She's going to die. Boring.

60
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,970
<1-44,Wilson>你这位诊断专家还真是名不虚传
<1-44,Wilson>No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician.

61
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,930
<1-44,Wilson>闭着眼睛就能作诊断
<1-44,Wilson>You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,560
<1-45,House>你才是肿瘤专家
<1-45,House>You're the oncologist.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,240
<1-45,House>我不过是个小小的传染病医生
<1-45,House>I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.

64
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,240
<1-46,Wilson>那是  你不过是个赤脚郎中
<1-46,Wilson>Yes. Just a simple country doctor.

65
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,740
<1-46,Wilson>她这年龄患脑瘤可能性很小
<1-46,Wilson>Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.

66
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,010
<1-47,House>她才二十九岁  患什么都不太可能
<1-47,House>She's 29. Whatever she's got is highly unlikely.

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,010
<1-48,Wilson>三种最常见脑瘤的蛋白标记都呈阴性
<1-48,Wilson>The protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,780
<1-49,House>那是保健室
<1-49,House>That's an H.M.O. Lab.

69
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,280
<1-49,House>跟高中实验室一样烂
<1-49,House>Might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.

70
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,090
<1-50,Wilson>没有家族病史
<1-50,Wilson>No family history.

71
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,090
<1-51,House>你叔不是死于癌症的吗
<1-51,House>I thought your uncle died of cancer.

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
<1-52,Wilson>另一边的表妹  没有环境致病因素
<1-52,Wilson>Other side. No environmental factors.

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,930
<1-53,House>你不知道而已
<1-53,House>That you know of.

74
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,890
<1-54,Wilson>且对放疗没反应
<1-54,Wilson>And she's not responding to radiation treatment.

75
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,430
<1-55,House>说这么半天没说到一个重点
<1-55,House>None of which is even close to dispositive.

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,790
<1-55,House>仅让我产生一个疑问
<1-55,House>All it does is raise one question:

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,300
<1-55,House>你表妹竟然去保健室看病
<1-55,House>Your cousin goes to an H.M.O.?

78
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,570
<1-56,Wilson>拜托  干嘛把乐趣都留给验尸官呢
<1-56,Wilson>Come on. Why leave all the fun for the coroner?

79
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,520
<1-56,Wilson>如果不找些事情给他们做
<1-56,Wilson>What's the point of putting together a team

80
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,910
<1-56,Wilson>那还要他们来干嘛
<1-56,Wilson>if you're not gonna use them?

81
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,500
<1-56,Wilson>你手下有三位能力超群的医生
<1-56,Wilson>You've got three overqualified doctors

82
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,240
<1-56,Wilson>成天百无聊赖
<1-56,Wilson>working for you, getting bored.

83
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,780
<2-1,Foreman>是脑损
<2-1,Foreman>It's a lesion.

84
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,240
<2-2,House>在地图上
<2-2,House>And the big green thing

85
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,810
<2-2,House>碧蓝中的一点鲜绿
<2-2,House>in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map...

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,910
<2-2,House>是小岛
<2-2,House>is an island.

87
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,950
<2-2,House>还以为你要语出惊人呢
<2-2,House>I was hoping for something a bit more creative.

88
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,690
<2-3,Foreman>作诊断前不是该先了解病人吗
<2-3,Foreman>Shouldn't we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing?

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,660
<2-4,House>-她是医生吗  -不是  可是
<2-4,House>- Is she a doctor? - No, but-

90
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,550
<2-6,House>所有人都撒谎
<2-6,House>Everybody lies.

91
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,990
<2-7,Cameron>豪斯医生从不和病人打交道
<2-7,Cameron>Dr. House doesn't like dealing with patients.

92
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,000
<2-8,Foreman>治疗病人不正是我们做医生的原因吗
<2-8,Foreman>Isn't treating patients why we became doctors?

93
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,000
<2-9,House>你错了  治疗疾病才是我们做医生的原因
<2-9,House>No. Treating illnesses is why we became doctors.

94
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,810
<2-9,House>治疗病人是让医生痛苦不堪的原因
<2-9,House>Treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.

95
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,190
<2-10,Foreman>所以  你从医学治疗中除去人性
<2-10,Foreman>So you're trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine?

96
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,570
<2-11,House>只要不和他们接触
<2-11,House>If we don't talk to them,

97
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,440
<2-11,House>他们就无法撒谎
<2-11,House>they can't lie to us,

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,900
<2-11,House>我们也不必对他们撒谎
<2-11,House>and we can't lie to them.

99
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,610
<2-11,House>人性总被高估
<2-11,House>Humanity's overrated.

100
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
<2-11,House>这不是肿瘤
<2-11,House>I don't think it's a tumor.

101
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,060
<2-12,Foreman>在医学院第一年就知道
<2-12,Foreman>First year medical school

102
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,280
<2-12,Foreman>听到马蹄声  要想到马而不是斑马
<2-12,Foreman>if you hear hoofbeats, you think horses, not zebras.

103
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,180
<2-12,Foreman>你还停留在大学一年级吗
<2-12,Foreman>Are you in first year medical school?

104
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,690
<2-13,House>不是  首先造影扫描没有异常
<2-13,House>No. First of all, there's nothing on the CAT scan.

105
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,690
<2-13,House>第二  倘若这真是一匹马
<2-13,House>Second of all, if this is a horse,

106
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,430
<2-13,House>任何庸医都能诊断出来
<2-13,House>then her kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis,

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,820
<2-13,House>她也不会来了
<2-13,House>and it never gets near this office.

108
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,990
<2-13,House>伙计们  开始鉴别诊断啊
<2-13,House>Differential diagnosis, people.

109
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,670
<2-13,House>若非肿瘤  还有什么可能
<2-13,House>If it's not a tumor, what are the suspects?

110
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,970
<2-13,House>她怎么会不能说话
<2-13,House>Why couldn't she talk?

111
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,440
<2-14,Chase>动脉瘤  中风或是其他缺血性综合征
<2-14,Chase>Aneurysm, stroke or some other ischemic syndrome.

112
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,500
<2-15,House>-做核磁共振成像  -是克雅病
<2-15,House>- Get her a contrast M.R.I. - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

113
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,240
<2-17,Chase>-疯牛病  -疯斑马病
<2-17,Chase>- Mad cow? - Mad zebra.

114
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,010
<2-19,Foreman>韦尼克脑病
<2-19,Foreman>Wernicke's encephalopathy.

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,750
<2-20,House>不对  血液中硫胺水平正常
<2-20,House>No. Blood thiamine level was normal.

116
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,320
<2-21,Foreman>那破烂保健室搞砸了所有血检
<2-21,Foreman>The lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood tests.

117
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,020
<2-21,Foreman>人们闯祸都想尽办法掩饰
<2-21,Foreman>I assume it's a corollary if"people lie" that "people screw up."

118
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,960
<2-22,House>重做血测
<2-22,House>Redraw the blood tests

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,390
<2-22,House>尽快安排核磁共振成像
<2-22,House>and get her scheduled for that contrast M.R.I. ASAP.

120
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,800
<2-22,House>看看这到底是什么斑马
<2-22,House>Let's find out what kind of zebra we're treating here.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,880
<2-22,House>放射科  请呼叫
<2-22,House>Radiology, please call the page.

122
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,140
<2-22,House>放射科  请呼叫
<2-22,House>Radiology, please call the page.

123
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,580
<3-1,Cuddy>我二十分钟前就在办公室等你
<3-1,Cuddy>I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.

124
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,120
<3-2,House>真的吗  那就怪了
<3-2,House>Really? Well, that's odd

125
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
<3-2,House>我二十分钟前压根就没想去你办公室
<3-2,House>because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.

126
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,830
<3-3,Cuddy>你以为我们没什么可谈吗
<3-3,Cuddy>You think we have nothing to talk about?

127
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,720
<3-4,House>正是如此  想不出要跟你说什么
<3-4,House>No. I just can't think of anything I'd be interested in.

128
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,030
<3-5,Cuddy>-我是你的衣食父母  -我是终身职位
<3-5,Cuddy>- I sign your paychecks. - I have tenure.

129
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,030
<3-6,House>想抢我的拐杖不让我走吗
<3-6,House>Are you gonna grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?

130
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,030
<3-7,Cuddy>我才不跟你一般见识
<3-7,Cuddy>That would be juvenile.

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,640
<3-8,Cuddy>如果你玩忽职守我还是可以解雇你
<3-8,Cuddy>I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,470
<3-9,House>我每天按时上下班
<3-9,House>I'm here from 9:00 to 5:00.

133
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,380
<3-10,Cuddy>-你基本没有工作量  -经济不景气啊
<3-10,Cuddy>- Your billings are practically nonexistent. - Rough year.

134
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,750
<3-12,Cuddy>你无视会诊
<3-12,Cuddy>You ignore requests for consults.

135
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,340
<3-13,House>我回了  打错电话而已
<3-13,House>I call back. Sometimes I misdial.

136
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,760
<3-14,Cuddy>你已经落下六年的门诊任务
<3-14,Cuddy>You're six years behind on your obligations to the clinic.

137
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,890
<3-15,House>看吧  早说过咱俩无话可谈
<3-15,House>See? I was right. This doesn't interest me.

138
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,360
<3-16,Cuddy>六年  每年三周
<3-16,Cuddy>Six years times three weeks

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,150
<3-16,Cuddy>你欠下四个月的门诊时间
<3-16,Cuddy>you owe me better than four months.

140
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,650
<3-17,House>五点了  该回家了
<3-17,House>It's 5:00. I'm going home.

141
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,170
<3-18,Cuddy>回家干嘛
<3-18,Cuddy>To what?

142
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,220
<3-19,House>行啊你
<3-19,House>Nice.

143
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,340
<3-20,Cuddy>我至今仍没有解雇你的唯一理由
<3-20,Cuddy>Look, Dr. House, the only reason why I don't fire you...

144
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,340
<3-20,Cuddy>就是你的声誉对医院还有价值
<3-20,Cuddy>is because your reputation is still worth something to this hospital.

145
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,080
<3-21,House>很好  在不解雇我这一方面
<3-21,House>Excellent. We have a point of agreement

146
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,850
<3-21,House>咱总算达成共识
<3-21,House>you're not gonna fire me.

147
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,590
<3-22,Cuddy>如果你继续懒散下去
<3-22,Cuddy>Your reputation won't last

148
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,060
<3-22,Cuddy>你那名声会化为乌有
<3-22,Cuddy>if you don't do your job.

149
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,850
<3-22,Cuddy>门诊也是工作的一部分
<3-22,Cuddy>The clinic is part of your job.

150
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,290
<3-22,Cuddy>我希望你能尽职
<3-22,Cuddy>I want you to do your job.

151
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,450
<3-23,House>伟大的"哲人"贾斯汀曾说过
<3-23,House>But, as the philosophers Jagger once said,

152
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,460
<3-23,House>"世事并不总遂人愿"
<3-23,House>"You can't always get what you want."

153
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,280
<4-1,Rebecca>你不是我的医生  你是豪斯医生吗
<4-1,Rebecca>You're not my doctor. Are you Dr. House?

154
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,470
<4-2,Chase>幸亏不是  我是奇斯医生
<4-2,Chase>Thankfully, no. I'm Dr. Chase.

155
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,480
<4-3,Cameron>豪斯医生是诊断部门的负责人
<4-3,Cameron>Dr. House is the head of diagnostic medicine.

156
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,290
<4-3,Cameron>他事务繁忙
<4-3,Cameron>He's very busy,

157
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,850
<4-3,Cameron>但他对你的病例尤其上心
<4-3,Cameron>but he has taken a keen interest in your case.

158
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,120
<5-1,Foreman>我们将对比剂注入静脉
<5-1,Foreman>We inject gadolinium into a vein.

159
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,160
<5-1,Foreman>它会自由遍布大脑
<5-1,Foreman>It distributes itself throughout your brain

160
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
<5-1,Foreman>做磁共振成像造影剂
<5-1,Foreman>and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imager.

161
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,870
<5-2,Cameron>总之  要把你的大脑变成圣诞树
<5-2,Cameron>Basically, whatever's in your head lights up like a Christmas tree.

162
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,730
<5-3,Foreman>-可能会感觉头晕  -卡梅隆医生
<5-3,Foreman>- It might make you feel a little light-headed. - Dr. Cameron.

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,400
<5-4,Nurse>抱歉  打断一下  出问题了
<5-4,Nurse>I'm sorry. I have to stop you. There is a problem.

164
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,300
<6-1,House>你竟敢没收我的权限
<6-1,House>You pulled my authorization!

165
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,440
<6-2,Cuddy>没错  这么激动干嘛
<6-2,Cuddy>Yes. Why are you yelling?

166
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,900
<6-3,House>没有核磁共振成像  影像检查和实验检测
<6-3,House>No M.R.I.'s, no imaging studies, no labs.

167
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,610
<6-4,Cuddy>你还不能打长途电话
<6-4,Cuddy>You also can't make long distance phone calls.

168
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,410
<6-5,House>真想炒我就冲我来
<6-5,House>If you're going to fire me, have the guts to face me.

169
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,280
<6-6,Cuddy>你还不能用复印机  你还在嚷嚷啊
<6-6,Cuddy>Or photocopies. You're still yelling.

170
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,220
<6-7,House>我很生气  你竟拿病人生命开玩笑
<6-7,House>I'm angry! You're risking a patient's life.

171
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,350
<6-8,Cuddy>这两件事没关系吧
<6-8,Cuddy>I assume those are two separate points.

172
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,850
<6-9,House>你不尊重我  让我难堪
<6-9,House>You showed me disrespect. You embarrassed me.

173
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,460
<6-9,House>我还在这一天  你就没有权利...
<6-9,House>And as long as I work here, you have no legal-

174
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,460
<6-10,Cuddy>你是想吓唬我吗
<6-10,Cuddy>Is the yelling designed to scare me?

175
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,080
<6-10,Cuddy>我到现在还不知道该怕些什么
<6-10,Cuddy>Because I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to be scared of.

176
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,970
<6-10,Cuddy>还要接着嚷吗  一点都不吓人
<6-10,Cuddy>More yelling? That's not scary.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,990
<6-10,Cuddy>如果说你要打我  那才可怕
<6-10,Cuddy>That you're going to hurt me? That's scary.

178
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,340
<6-10,Cuddy>可我跑得绝对比你快
<6-10,Cuddy>But I'm pretty sure I can outrun you.

179
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,350
<6-11,Cuddy>还是你那位"哲人"贾斯汀说得对
<6-11,Cuddy>Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted-Jagger.

180
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,250
<6-11,Cuddy>"世事并不总遂人愿"
<6-11,Cuddy>And you're right, you can't always get what you want.

181
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,670
<6-11,Cuddy>但事实上  "倘若努力"
<6-11,Cuddy>But as it turns out, "If you try sometimes,

182
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,220
<6-11,Cuddy>"总能得到自己想要的"
<6-11,Cuddy>you get what you need."

183
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,260
<6-12,House>就是说  你想让我治疗病人
<6-12,House>So, because you want me to treat patients,

184
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,350
<6-12,House>却要反其道而行吗
<6-12,House>you're not letting me treat patients?

185
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,660
<6-13,Cuddy>我要的是  你做好本职工作
<6-13,Cuddy>I need you to do your job.

186
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,370
<6-14,House>做核磁共振  她投降了
<6-14,House>Do the M.R.I. She folded.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,980
<6-14,House>我每周得做四小时门诊
<6-14,House>I've got to do four hours a week in this clinic

188
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,470
<6-14,House>直到补回我所落下任务
<6-14,House>until I make up the time I've missed.

189
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
<6-14,House>整整两千零五十四个小时
<6-14,House>2054. I'll be caught up in 2054.

190
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,620
<6-14,House>你最好深爱着你这表妹
<6-14,House>You better love this cousin a whole lot.

191
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,400
<6-15,Cameron>好的  丽贝卡
<6-15,Cameron>All right, Rebecca,

192
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,790
<6-15,Cameron>你可能感觉幽闭
<6-15,Cameron>I know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there,

193
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,090
<6-15,Cameron>但请别乱动
<6-15,Cameron>but we need you to remain still.

194
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,700
<6-16,Chase>好的  开始了
<6-16,Chase>Okay, we're going to begin.

195
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,780
<6-17,Rebecca>我不舒服
<6-17,Rebecca>I don't feel so good.

196
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,440
<6-18,Chase>没关系  放松点
<6-18,Chase>It's all right. Just try to relax.

197
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,810
<6-19,Cameron>丽贝卡
<6-19,Cameron>Rebecca?

198
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,920
<6-19,Cameron>丽贝卡
<6-19,Cameron>Rebecca?

199
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,310
<6-19,Cameron>丽贝卡
<6-19,Cameron>Rebecca?

200
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,710
<6-20,Chase>-把她弄出来  -可能只是睡着了
<6-20,Chase>- Get her out of there. - Oh, she probably fell asleep.

201
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,110
<6-21,Cameron>-她累了  -三十秒前她还有幽闭恐惧
<6-21,Cameron>- She's exhausted. - She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago.

202
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,060
<6-21,Cameron>她不是睡着  快把她弄出来
<6-21,Cameron>She's not sleeping. We gotta get her out of there.

203
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,110
<6-22,Chase>还有一分钟就好了
<6-22,Chase>It'll just be another minute.

204
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,680
<6-23,Cameron>如果是对比剂过敏  马上会没命
<6-23,Cameron>If she's having an allergic reaction to the gadolinium, she'll be dead in two minutes.

205
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,140
<6-24,Foreman>-托住颈部  -好的
<6-24,Foreman>- Hold her neck.  - All right.

206
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,840
<6-25,Cameron>面色苍白
<6-25,Cameron>Oh, she's ashen.

207
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,320
<6-26,Foreman>呼吸停止了  肾上腺素  0.5毫克
<6-26,Foreman>She's not breathing.  Epi, .5.

208
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,170
<6-26,Foreman>加油
<6-26,Foreman>Come on.

209
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,290
<6-27,Cameron>机械通气不行
<6-27,Cameron>I can't ventilate.

210
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,720
<6-28,Foreman>水肿太严重
<6-28,Foreman>Too much edema.

211
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,790
<6-28,Foreman>-气管切开器械包  -来了
<6-28,Foreman>- Where's the surgical airway kit?  - Yep. Coming.

212
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,030
<6-30,Chase>厉害
<6-30,Chase>Good call.

213
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,890
<7-1,Chase>今天晚些时候会把插管取出
<7-1,Chase>We'll get that tube out of your throat later today.

214
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,850
<7-2,Cameron>现在先好好休息
<7-2,Cameron>Just get some rest for now, okay?

215
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,800
<7-3,House>早说了  不能相信任何人
<7-3,House>Told you.  You can't trust people.

216
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,570
<7-4,Cameron>她可能知道自己对比剂过敏
<7-4,Cameron>She probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium.

217
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,700
<7-4,Cameron>发现是个让人帮她开喉的好方法
<7-4,Cameron>Figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.

218
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,640
<7-5,House>不能做脑部扫描  只好靠千言万语了
<7-5,House>Can't get a picture. Gonna have to get a thousand words.

219
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,240
<7-6,Foreman>你真想让我们跟病人聊天  套病史吗
<7-6,Foreman>You actually want me to talk to the patient, get a history?

220
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,450
<7-7,House>需要了解
<7-7,House>We need to know

221
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,650
<7-7,House>触发炎症反应的遗传和环境因素
<7-7,House>if there's some genetic or environmental cause that's triggering an inflammatory response.

222
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,650
<7-8,Foreman>你不是说所有人都撒谎吗
<7-8,Foreman>I thought everybody lied.

223
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
<7-9,House>真相恰恰始于谎言
<7-9,House>Truth begins in lies.

224
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,980
<7-9,House>好好想想吧
<7-9,House>Think about it.

225
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,490
<7-10,Foreman>他又在胡言乱语  对吧
<7-10,Foreman>That doesn't mean anything, does it?

226

<7-11,House>下午12:52
<7-11,House>12:52 p.m.

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,840
<7-11,House>有线电视在哪
<7-11,House>Do you have cable TV here somewhere?

229
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,840
<7-11,House>《总院故事》八分钟后开始
<7-11,House>General Hospital starts in eight minutes.

230
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,840
<7-12,Cuddy>没电视  但有病人
<7-12,Cuddy>No TV, but we've got patients.

231
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,710
<7-13,House>你就不能自己去发阿司匹林吗
<7-13,House>Can't you give out the aspirin yourself?

232
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,600
<7-13,House>把书面工作交给我
<7-13,House>I'll do paperwork.

233
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,860
<7-14,Cuddy>我保证第一个病例就很有意思
<7-14,Cuddy>I made sure your first case was an interesting one.

234
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,580
<7-15,House>咳嗽好不起来
<7-15,House>Cough just won't go away?

235
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,720
<7-15,House>鼻涕的颜色古怪
<7-15,House>Runny nose looks a funny color?

236
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,650
<7-16,Cuddy>病人背部痉挛
<7-16,Cuddy>Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.

237
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,740
<7-17,House>听起来像新英格兰医学杂志上的病例
<7-17,House>Oh? I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.

238
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,550
<7-18,Cuddy>病人是橙色的
<7-18,Cuddy>Patient is orange.

239
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,970
<7-20,Cuddy>-颜色吗  -不是  我说水果
<7-20,Cuddy>- The color? -No, the fruit.

240
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,950
<7-21,House>你是说黄色  那是黄疸
<7-21,House>You mean yellow. It's jaundice.

241
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,140
<7-22,Cuddy>是橙色
<7-22,Cuddy>I mean orange.

242
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,020
<7-23,House>好吧  橙到什么份上  大概只是...
<7-23,House>Well, how orange? It's probably

243
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,060
<7-24,Cuddy>一号诊室
<7-24,Cuddy>Exam room one.

244
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,880
<7-24,Cuddy>卡恩医生  请到儿科
<7-24,Cuddy>Dr. Kahn, you're needed in pediatrics.

245
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,690
<8-1,Orange Guy>我打高尔夫时  球鞋卡住了
<8-1,Orange Guy>I was playing golf and my cleats got stuck.

246
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,450
<8-1,Orange Guy>有点疼  不过我没停
<8-1,Orange Guy>It hurt a little, but I kept playing.

247
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,900
<8-1,Orange Guy>第二天早上  我疼得站不起来
<8-1,Orange Guy>The next morning, I could barely stand up.

248
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,510
<8-1,Orange Guy>你在笑  说明我病情不重
<8-1,Orange Guy>Well, you're smiling, so I take it that means this isn't serious.

249
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,350
<8-2,Orange Guy>那是什么  你干吗
<8-2,Orange Guy>What's that? What are you doing?

250
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,420
<8-3,House>止痛药
<8-3,House>Painkillers.

251
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,250
<8-4,Orange Guy>因为你的腿
<8-4,Orange Guy>Oh, for you. For your leg.

252
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,410
<8-5,House>错了  是因为药片嚼起来香
<8-5,House>No, 'cause they're yummy.

253
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,680
<8-5,House>想来一片吗  能让你的背舒服点
<8-5,House>You want one? Make your back feel better.

254
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,560
<8-6,House>不幸的是  你的问题远比表象严重
<8-6,House>Unfortunately, you have a deeper problem.

255
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,680
<8-6,House>你老婆有外遇
<8-6,House>Your wife is having an affair.

256
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,810
<8-7,Orange Guy>-什么  -你都变橘子啦  蠢人
<8-7,Orange Guy>- What? - You're orange, you moron.

257
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,660
<8-8,House>你没注意到是一回事
<8-8,House>It's one thing for you not to notice,

258
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,460
<8-8,House>要是连你老婆都不知道自己老公变色了
<8-8,House>but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed colors,

259
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,890
<8-8,House>说明她就没拿正眼看你
<8-8,House>she's just not paying attention.

260
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,790
<8-8,House>顺便问你一句
<8-8,House>By the way,

261
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,800
<8-8,House>你是不是狂吃胡萝卜和维生素药丸
<8-8,House>do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and megadose vitamins?

262
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,340
<8-9,House>胡罗卜让你变黄   烟酸让你变红
<8-9,House>Carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red.

263
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,400
<8-9,House>不信的话自己拿调色盘试试
<8-9,House>Find some finger paint and do the math.

264
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,410
<8-9,House>再找个好律师
<8-9,House>And get a good lawyer.

265
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,550
<9-1,House>深呼吸
<9-1,House>Deep breath.

266
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,040
<9-2,Little boy>好冰啊
<9-2,Little boy>It's cold.

267
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,220
<9-3,House>他一直在用气雾吸入器吗
<9-3,House>He's been using his inhaler?

268
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,630
<9-4,Mother>最近几天没有  他才十岁
<9-4,Mother>Not in the past few days. He's, um, only 10.

269
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,860
<9-4,Mother>不想给孩子用太多强效药
<9-4,Mother>I worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently.

270
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,930
<9-5,Little boy>你的腿怎么了
<9-5,Little boy>What happened to your leg?

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,990
<9-6,House>我想医生也考虑过药物强度
<9-6,House>Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine too.

272
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,370
<9-6,House>权衡过呼吸停止和用药危险的利弊
<9-6,House>She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing.

273
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,680
<9-6,House>氧气对于青春期前的青少年尤为重要
<9-6,House>Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years.

274
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,110
<9-6,House>你说对吗
<9-6,House>Don't you think?

275
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,590
<9-6,House>好吧  我想是没人告诉过你哮喘是什么
<9-6,House>Okay, I'm gonna assume nobody has ever told you what asthma is.

276
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,060
<9-6,House>或者别人说的时候  你心不在焉
<9-6,House>Or if they have, you had other things on your mind.

277
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,710
<9-6,House>你孩子气管里的细胞被刺激
<9-6,House>A stimulant triggers cells in your child's airways...

278
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,690
<9-6,House>分泌出的物质导致气管发炎并收缩
<9-6,House>to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract.

279
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,900
<9-6,House>黏液分泌增加  细胞层开始脱落
<9-6,House>Mucus production increases, the cell lining starts to shed.

280
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,720
<9-6,House>但类固醇
<9-6,House>But the steroids

281
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,460
<9-6,House>类固醇终止炎症反应
<9-6,House>The steroids stop the inflammation.

282
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,860
<9-7,Mother>类似情况发生次数越多
<9-7,Mother>The more often this happens-

283
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,570
<9-7,Mother>然后呢   类似情况发生越多  会怎样
<9-7,Mother>What? The more often this happens, what?

284
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,520
<9-8,House>算了  你要是不信类固醇
<9-8,House>Forget it. If you don't trust steroids,

285
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,040
<9-8,House>也没必要信医生
<9-8,House>you shouldn't trust doctors.

286
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,400
<10-1,Rebecca>我母亲四年前去世
<10-1,Rebecca>My mother passed away four years ago.

287
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,350
<10-1,Rebecca>她得了心脏病
<10-1,Rebecca>She had a heart attack,

288
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,760
<10-1,Rebecca>我父亲在工地上弄伤背
<10-1,Rebecca>and my father broke his back doing construction-

289
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,460
<10-2,Cameron>是豪斯  紧急状况  对不起
<10-2,Cameron>It's House. It's urgent. I'm sorry.

290
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,330
<10-3,Cameron>你就不能敲门吗
<10-3,Cameron>You couldn't have knocked?

291
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,650
<10-4,House>类固醇  用类固醇  大剂量强的松
<10-4,House>Steroids. Give her steroids. High doses of prednisone.

292
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,000
<10-5,Foreman>你在寻找证据支持脑血管炎的诊断
<10-5,Foreman>You're looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis?

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,330
<10-6,Cameron>脑血管炎极其罕见  尤其在她这年纪
<10-6,Cameron>Inflammation of blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare, especially for someone her age.

294
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,160
<10-7,House>肿瘤同样罕见  红细胞沉降率升高
<10-7,House>So is a tumor. Her sed rate is elevated.

295
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,910
<10-8,Foreman>少幅上升而已
<10-8,Foreman>Mildly.

296
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,050
<10-9,Cameron>或许说明很多问题  或者无关紧要
<10-9,Cameron>That could mean anything. Or nothing.

297
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,660
<10-10,House>对  我知道不该断定这是血管炎
<10-10,House>Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitis.

298
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,160
<10-10,House>除非  有这可能性
<10-10,House>Except that it could be.

299
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,740
<10-10,House>倘若是脑血管炎  症状完全符合
<10-10,House>If the blood vessels are inflamed, that's gonna look exactly like

300
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,610
<10-10,House>还有核磁共振结果
<10-10,House>what we saw on the M.R.I. From Trenton County,

301
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,310
<10-11,Cameron>颅内压会导致神经学症状
<10-11,Cameron>and the pressure is gonna cause neurological symptoms.

302
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,340
<10-11,Cameron>没有活检  不能妄下诊断
<10-11,Cameron>We can't diagnose that without a biopsy.

303
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,240
<10-12,House>当然可以
<10-12,House>Yes, we can.

304
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,100
<10-12,House>开始治疗
<10-12,House>We treat her.

305
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,650
<10-12,House>情况好转  则证明我们是对的
<10-12,House>If she gets better, we know we're right.

306
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,380
<10-14,House>-要是错了呢  -那就有新发现
<10-14,House>- And if we're wrong? - Then we learn something else.

307
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,740
<11-1,Rebecca>为什么用类固醇
<11-1,Rebecca>Why steroids?

308
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,800
<11-2,Chase>只是治疗的一部分
<11-2,Chase>Just part of your treatment.

309
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,430
<11-2,Chase>没什么人来看你
<11-2,Chase>You haven't had many visitors.

310
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,260
<11-3,Rebecca>-没有男友吗  -才约会过三次
<11-3,Rebecca>- No boyfriend? - Three dates.

311
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,420
<11-3,Rebecca>换成他从早吐到晚  我也不愿来
<11-3,Rebecca>I wouldn't have stood by him if he were vomiting all day.

312
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,050
<11-4,Chase>同事呢  总有好朋友吧
<11-4,Chase>What about work? You must have friends from work.

313
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,240
<11-5,Rebecca>我喜欢的人都只有五岁
<11-5,Rebecca>Pretty much everybody I like is five years old.

314
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,160
<11-5,Rebecca>护士说不做放疗了
<11-5,Rebecca>The nurse said you're stopping my radiation.

315
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,070
<11-6,Chase>我们在尝试不同的治疗
<11-6,Chase>We're just trying some alternative medication.

316
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,660
<11-6,Chase>你家是哪里的
<11-6,Chase>So where's your family from then?

317
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,510
<11-7,Rebecca>类固醇和放疗毫不相干
<11-7,Rebecca>Steroids aren't an alternative to radiation.

318
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,770
<11-8,Chase>现在还无法确诊
<11-8,Chase>The tests weren't really conclusive.

319
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,780
<11-9,Cameron>我们在针对血管炎治疗
<11-9,Cameron>We're treating you for vasculitis.

320
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,840
<11-9,Cameron>是一种脑部血管炎症
<11-9,Cameron>It's the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain.

321
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,350
<11-10,Rebecca>不是肿瘤吗
<11-10,Rebecca>It's not a tumor?

322
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,810
<11-10,Rebecca>我得的不是肿瘤
<11-10,Rebecca>I don't have a tumor?

323
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,490
<12-1,Chase>你不该告诉她的  那不过是猜测
<12-1,Chase>You shouldn't have told her the truth. It's a long shot guess.

324
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,600
<12-2,Cameron>如果豪斯是对的  没关系
<12-2,Cameron>If House is right, no harm.

325
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,030
<12-2,Cameron>如果他错了  我给了一个濒死之人几天希望
<12-2,Cameron>If he's wrong, I've given a dying woman a couple days' hope.

326
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,090
<12-3,Chase>虚无的希望
<12-3,Chase>False hope.

327
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,720
<12-4,Cameron>如果可以的话  我也愿意给真的
<12-4,Cameron>If there was any other type available, I would have given her that.

328
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,030
<13-3,Sidney>你干嘛闻比利的裤子
<13-3,Sidney>Why are you smelling Billy's pants?

329
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,950
<13-4,Foreman>-我没有  -你是在闻啊
<13-4,Foreman>- I'm not. - Looked like you were.

330
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,380
<13-5,Sidney>我在闻地板
<13-5,Sidney>I was smelling the floor.

331
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,550
<13-6,Foreman>这里有宠物吗
<13-6,Foreman>Do you have any pets in this class?

332
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,360
<13-7,Sidney>没  以前有过一只沙鼠
<13-7,Sidney>No. But we used to have a gerbil,

333
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,720
<13-7,Sidney>不过被卡利的书压死了
<13-7,Sidney>but Carly L. dropped a book on it.

334
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,660
<13-8,Foreman>真不小心
<13-8,Foreman>Careless.

335
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,670
<13-9,Sidney>你想要闻闻它吗
<13-9,Sidney>Do you need to smell it?

336
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,610
<13-10,Foreman>不用  我找的是霉菌
<13-10,Foreman>No. I'm smelling for mold.

337
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,940
<13-9,Sidney>不用闻那个
<13-9,Sidney>I don't need to smell it.

338
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,620
<13-11,Sidney>你还可以闻闻我们的鹦鹉
<13-11,Sidney>You could smell our parrot.

339
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,980
<13-12,Foreman>你不是说这里没宠物了吗
<13-12,Foreman>You said you didn't have any pets in this class.

340
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,870
<13-13,Sidney>可鹦鹉是鸟啊
<13-13,Sidney>A parrot is a bird.

341
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,950
<14-2,House>听着  杰克逊不是孩子他爹
<14-2,House>Listen, Jackson's not the father-

342
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,800
<14-1,Foreman>鹦鹉是鹦鹉热的主要传染源
<14-1,Foreman>Parrots are the primary source of psittacosis.

343
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,080
<14-2,House>和鹦鹉没有关系
<14-2,House>It's not the parrot.

344
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,600
<14-3,Foreman>鹦鹉热解释了神经问题和神经学并发症
<14-3,Foreman>And psittacosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications.

345
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,880
<14-4,House>-一个班里多少学生  -二十个
<14-4,House>- How many kids were in the class? - Twenty.

346
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,530
<14-6,House>-几个病假在家  -没有  不过
<14-6,House>- How many are home sick? - None, but-

347
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,460
<14-7,Foreman>没人生病  你觉得五岁小孩
<14-7,Foreman>None. But you figured that five-year-olds

348
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,830
<14-8,House>会比老师更懂得清理小鸟卫生吗
<14-8,House>are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher?

349
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,450
<14-9,Foreman>-去她家查过了吗  -她住在特伦顿
<14-9,Foreman>- Have you been through her home? - She lives in Trenton.

350
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,650
<14-9,Foreman>我明天问她拿钥匙
<14-9,Foreman>I can go up to her room tomorrow morning, ask her for the key.

351
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,950
<14-10,House>警察突击犯罪现场  会先问过嫌犯吗
<14-10,House>Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?

352
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,170
<14-11,Foreman>那不是犯罪现场
<14-11,Foreman>It's not a crime scene.

353
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,610
<14-12,House>据我所知  她在地下室偷造冰毒
<14-12,House>As far as I know, she's running a meth lab out of her basement.

354
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,030
<14-13,Foreman>她是个幼儿园老师
<14-13,Foreman>She's a kindergarten teacher.

355
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,570
<14-14,House>要是我是幼儿园学生  我也信她
<14-14,House>And if I were a kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly.

356
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,310
<14-14,House>好吧  举个例子
<14-14,House>Okay. I'll give you a "for instance."

357
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,670
<14-14,House>那边  给你做三明治的太太
<14-14,House>The lady back there... who made your egg salad sandwich-

358
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,720
<14-14,House>有注意到她眼神呆滞吗
<14-14,House>Her eyes look glassy. Did you notice that?

359
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,370
<14-14,House>医院规定  生病不可上班
<14-14,House>Now, hospital policy is to stay home if you're sick.

360
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,250
<14-14,House>但倘若你连每小时八块的事都干
<14-14,House>But if you're making $8.00 an hour,

361
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,300
<14-14,House>那么你一定很缺这八块钱
<14-14,House>then you kind of need the $8.00 an hour, right?

362
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,640
<14-14,House>还有  洗手间里的牌子上写着
<14-14,House>And the sign in the bathroom says

363
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,220
<14-14,House>雇员如厕后必须洗手
<14-14,House>that employees must wash after using the facilities,

364
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,330
<14-14,House>但我想  用袖子擦鼻涕的人
<14-14,House>but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve

365
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,750
<14-14,House>也不会讲究卫生
<14-14,House>isn't hyperconcerned about sanitary conditions.

366
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,770
<14-14,House>我现在问你  我还吃她做的东西吗
<14-14,House>So what do you think- should I trust her?

367
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,820
<14-14,House>我要你去她家查污染源  垃圾  用药
<14-14,House>I want you to check the patient's home for contaminants, garbage, medication.

368
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,060
<14-15,Foreman>我才不会擅闯民宅呢
<14-15,Foreman>I can't just break into someone's house.

369
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,810
<14-16,House>你当年不也干过这档子事吗
<14-16,House>Isn't that how you got into the Felkers' home?

370
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,690
<14-16,House>我知道了
<14-16,House>Yeah, I know.

371
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,130
<14-16,House>虽说法庭记录是保密的
<14-16,House>Court records are sealed.

372
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,150
<14-16,House>你才十六岁  这事的确不光彩
<14-16,House>You were 16. It was a stupid mistake.

373
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,330
<14-16,House>而你那体育老师又是个大嘴巴
<14-16,House>But your old gym teacher has a big mouth.

374
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,750
<14-16,House>该写信谢谢他
<14-16,House>Should write a thank-you note.

375
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,700
<14-17,Foreman>我还该谢他
<14-17,Foreman>I should thank him?

376
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,820
<14-18,House>我总会用到个懂得小偷小摸的人
<14-18,House>I needed somebody around here with street smarts.

377
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,830
<14-18,House>得知道什么时候被人摆布  也知道如何摆布别人
<14-18,House>Okay? Who knows when they're being conned, knows how to con.

378
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,260
<14-19,Foreman>我该告你去
<14-19,Foreman>I should sue you.

379
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,130
<14-20,House>你才不会告自己的衣食父母
<14-20,House>Pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring.

380
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,510
<14-21,Foreman>要是你因为我不违法
<14-21,Foreman>But I'm pretty sure I can sue

381
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,550
<14-21,Foreman>而解雇我的话  我绝对会告你
<14-21,Foreman>if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's house.

382
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,510
<15-1,House>做研究呢  人类太奇妙了
<15-1,House>Doing research. People are fascinating, aren't they?

383
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,060
<15-2,Cuddy>为什么给阿德用类固醇
<15-2,Cuddy>Why are you giving Adler steroids?

384
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
<15-2,Cuddy>因为她是我的病人
<15-2,Cuddy>Because she's my patient.

385
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,260
<15-3,House>用药不正是治疗的一部分嘛
<15-3,House>That's what you do with patients- you give them medicine.

386
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,260
<15-4,Cuddy>你不能单凭猜测用药
<15-4,Cuddy>You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses.

387
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,190
<15-4,Cuddy>只有塔斯克基和门格勒才这么做
<15-4,Cuddy>At least we don't since Tuskegee and Mengele.

388
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,960
<15-5,House>你竟然把我说成纳粹医生  行啊
<15-5,House>You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.

389
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,500
<15-6,Cuddy>我现在就停药
<15-6,Cuddy>I'm stopping the treatment.

390
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,540
<15-8,Cuddy>-她是我的病人  -这是我的医院
<15-8,Cuddy>- She's my patient. - It's my hospital.

391
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,560
<15-9,House>我没让病情恶化
<15-9,House>I did not get her sick.

392
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,070
<15-9,House>我没拿她做实验
<15-9,House>She is not an experiment.

393
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,320
<15-9,House>我做的是合理的猜测
<15-9,House>I have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her.

394
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,180
<15-10,Cuddy>但缺乏证依据
<15-10,Cuddy>With no proof.

395
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,970
<15-11,House>从来就没有依据
<15-11,House>There's never any proof.

396
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,410
<15-11,House>同样的症状  一百医生会有一百种诊断
<15-11,House>Five different doctors come up with five different diagnoses based on the same evidence.

397
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,930
<15-12,Cuddy>可你连一个症状都没有
<15-12,Cuddy>You don't have any evidence.

398
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,610
<15-12,Cuddy>没有人能什么事都知道
<15-12,Cuddy>And nobody knows anything, huh?

399
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,260
<15-12,Cuddy>那你凭什么就知道自己是对的
<15-12,Cuddy>Then how is it you always think you're right?

400
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,330
<15-13,House>我只知道反其道而行是错的
<15-13,House>I don't. I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption.

401
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,250
<15-13,House>为什么你那么如此惧怕错误
<15-13,House>And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?

402
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,710
<15-14,Cuddy>因为我是医生  掌握的是人命
<15-14,Cuddy>Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes, people die.

403
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,890
<15-15,House>别这样
<15-15,House>Oh, come on.

404
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,090
<15-16,House>过去人们可尊重瘸子了
<15-16,House>People used to have more respect for cripples, you know.

405
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,430
<15-16,House>其实没有
<15-16,House>They didn't really.

406
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,500
<16-1,Rebecca>-感觉怎么样  -好多了  谢谢
<16-1,Rebecca>- So how you feeling? - Much better, thanks.

407
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,460
<16-1,Rebecca>你是豪斯医生吗  我还以为他是男的
<16-1,Rebecca>Are you Dr. House? I thought he was a he, but-

408
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,900
<16-1,Rebecca>不是我
<16-1,Rebecca>No.

409
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,470
<16-2,Cuddy>慢慢吃  别吃太多
<16-2,Cuddy>Don't eat too much, too fast.

410
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,070
<16-3,Rebecca>替我谢谢他
<16-3,Rebecca>Thank him for me.

411
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,190
<16-4,Cuddy>好的
<16-4,Cuddy>Right.

412
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,710
<16-5,House>老大  是不是还要我中止治疗呢
<16-5,House>Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?

413
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,640
<16-6,Cuddy>走狗屎运罢了
<16-6,Cuddy>You got lucky.

414
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,620
<16-7,House>很酷吧
<16-7,House>Cool, huh?

415
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,750
<17-1,Wilson>好的  再来一次
<17-1,Wilson>Okay, once again.

416
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,570
<17-2,Wilson>很好
<17-2,Wilson>Good.

417
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,480
<17-3,Rebecca>我什么时候才能见见豪斯医生啊
<17-3,Rebecca>Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?

418
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,380
<17-4,Wilson>你可能会在电影院或大巴撞见他
<17-4,Wilson>Well, you might run into him at the movies or on the bus.

419
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,730
<17-5,Rebecca>他是个好人吗
<17-5,Rebecca>Is he a good man?

420
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,970
<17-6,Wilson>他是个好医生
<17-6,Wilson>He's a good doctor.

421
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,290
<17-7,Rebecca>不能医德兼修的吗
<17-7,Rebecca>Can you be one without the other?

422
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,360
<17-7,Rebecca>医生不是都很关心病人的吗
<17-7,Rebecca>Don't you have to care about people?

423
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,860
<17-8,Wilson>关心的确能成为行医的动力
<17-8,Wilson>Caring is a good motivator.

424
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,590
<17-8,Wilson>但有别的东西更吸引他
<17-8,Wilson>He's found something else.

425
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,070
<17-8,Wilson>两边都感觉到了吗
<17-8,Wilson>Feel this, both sides?

426
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,560
<17-12,Wilson>用力  使劲  很好
<17-12,Wilson>Okay, squeeze. Harder. All right.

427
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,660
<17-13,Rebecca>他是你的朋友  对吧
<17-13,Rebecca>He's your friend, huh?

428
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,740
<17-14,Wilson>是的
<17-14,Wilson>Yeah.

429
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,150
<17-15,Rebecca>他关心你吗
<17-15,Rebecca>Does he care about you?

430
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,240
<17-16,Wilson>-我想是吧  -你感觉不到吗
<17-16,Wilson>- I think so. - You don't know?

431
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,030
<17-18,Wilson>正如豪斯常说的  所有人都撒谎
<17-18,Wilson>As Dr. House likes to say, "Everybody lies."

432
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,140
<17-19,Rebecca>关键不在乎说什么  而在于做什么
<17-19,Rebecca>It's not what people say. It's what they do.

433
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,120
<17-20,Wilson>没错  他关心我
<17-20,Wilson>Yeah. He cares about me.

434
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,520
<17-21,Rebecca>我看不见了
<17-21,Rebecca>I can't see.

435
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,530
<17-21,Rebecca>我看不...见了
<17-21,Rebecca>I can't... see.

436
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,850
<17-22,Wilson>紧急呼叫
<17-22,Wilson>A little help in here!

437
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,930
<17-23,Foreman>你现在会感到胸部疼痛
<17-23,Foreman>Your chest will be sore for a while.

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,370
<17-23,Foreman>必需用除颤仪才能让你恢复心跳
<17-23,Foreman>We needed to shock you to get your heart going.

439
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,350
<17-23,Foreman>你能把卡片按时间顺序排列吗
<17-23,Foreman>Okay, can you arrange these to tell a story?

440
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,930
<18-1,Foreman>她做不到
<18-1,Foreman>She couldn't put them in order.

441
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,100
<18-2,Chase>会不会是发病时大脑缺氧造成的
<18-2,Chase>Could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?

442
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,320
<18-3,Foreman>不对  五分钟后她做相同测试
<18-3,Foreman>No. I gave her the same test five minutes later.

443
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,550
<18-3,Foreman>完成的不错
<18-3,Foreman>She did just fine.

444
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,280
<18-3,Foreman>同语言能力一样  精神状态呈间歇变化
<18-3,Foreman>The altered mental status is intermittent, just like the verbal skills.

445
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,810
<18-4,Cameron>现在怎样
<18-4,Cameron>So what now?

446
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,920
<18-5,Foreman>从最近的症状来看
<18-5,Foreman>Given the latest symptoms,

447
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,980
<18-5,Foreman>脑干已受影响
<18-5,Foreman>it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem.

448
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,090
<18-5,Foreman>很快  她将失去行走能力
<18-5,Foreman>Soon, she won't be able to walk.

449
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,960
<18-5,Foreman>并伴有永久性失明
<18-5,Foreman>She'll go blind permanently, and

450
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,500
<18-5,Foreman>随后呼吸中枢衰竭
<18-5,Foreman>then the respiratory center will fail.

451
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,140
<18-6,House>我们还剩多长时间
<18-6,House>How long do we have?

452
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,050
<18-7,Foreman>如果是肿瘤  还有一两个月
<18-7,Foreman>If it's a tumor, we're talking a month or two.

453
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,380
<18-7,Foreman>感染的话  就几周
<18-7,Foreman>If it's infectious, a few weeks.

454
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,610
<18-7,Foreman>如果是血管
<18-7,Foreman>If it's vascular,

455
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,920
<18-7,Foreman>那就只剩一周左右
<18-7,Foreman>that'll probably be fastest of all. Maybe a week.

456
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,380
<18-8,House>停止所有的治疗
<18-8,House>We're gonna stop all treatment.

457
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,070
<18-9,Foreman>我仍认为是肿瘤
<18-9,Foreman>I still think it's a tumor.

458
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,210
<18-9,Foreman>我们应该继续采用放疗
<18-9,Foreman>I think we should go back to the radiation.

459
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,170
<18-10,Chase>放疗根本不起效果
<18-10,Chase>She didn't respond to the radiation.

460
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,250
<18-11,Foreman>可能放疗效果在
<18-11,Foreman>Well, maybe we didn't see the effect

461
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,250
<18-11,Foreman>施用类固醇后才显现出来
<18-11,Foreman>until after we started steroids.

462
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,360
<18-11,Foreman>不是肿瘤
<18-11,Foreman>No, it's not a tumor.

463
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,560
<18-12,House>类固醇起到某种作用  只是不知道是什么
<18-12,House>Those steroids did something. I just don't know what.

464
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,040
<18-13,Foreman>难道我们就这样睁睁看着她死去吗
<18-13,Foreman>So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?

465
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,800
<18-13,Foreman>没错  我们就看着她死去
<18-13,Foreman>Yeah, we're gonna watch her die.

466
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,200
<18-14,House>更确切地说  是要看她死得有多快
<18-14,House>Specifically, we're gonna watch how fast she's dying.

467
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,130
<18-14,House>你也说过每种病死亡时间都不同
<18-14,House>You just told us- each diagnosis has its own time frame.

468
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,450
<18-14,House>看她什么时候死  就知道她得的是什么病
<18-14,House>When we see how fast it's killing her, we'll know what it is.

469
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,010
<18-15,Cameron>到那时我们就无能为力了
<18-15,Cameron>And by then, maybe there's nothing we can do about it.

470
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,210
<18-16,Foreman>我们一定还能做些什么
<18-16,Foreman>There's got to be something we can do.

471
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,240
<18-16,Foreman>总不能眼睁睁看着她死掉
<18-16,Foreman>Something better than watching her die.

472
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,450
<18-17,House>我就没有办法了
<18-17,House>Well, I got nothing.

473
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,380
<18-17,House>你有吗
<18-17,House>How about you?

474
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,080
<19-1,Foreman>混蛋
<19-1,Foreman>Bastard.

475
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,250
<19-1,Foreman>对了  卡梅隆  我想借你几小时
<19-1,Foreman>Oh, Cameron. I need you for a couple of hours.

476
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,290
<19-2,Cameron>什么事
<19-2,Cameron>What's up?

477
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,220
<19-3,Foreman>擅自闯入别人家时
<19-3,Foreman>When you break into someone's house,

478
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,550
<19-3,Foreman>-最好带个白人女性  -是阿德家吗
<19-3,Foreman>- it's better to have a white chick with you. - Adler's house?

479
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,940
<19-4,Cameron>为什么不问她拿钥匙
<19-4,Cameron>Why don't we just ask her for her keys?

480
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,180
<19-5,Foreman>据说她在地下室偷造冰毒
<19-5,Foreman>For all we know, she'll be running a meth lab out of her basement.

481
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,190
<19-5,Foreman>我常常犯困
<19-5,Foreman>I'm tired a lot.

482
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,830
<20-1,Guy>还有别的病症
<20-1,Guy>Any other reason why you

483
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,180
<20-2,House>让你认为自己患有慢性疲劳综合症吗
<20-2,House>think you might have chronic fatigue syndrome?

484
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,100
<20-3,Guy>容易犯困不正是疲劳症吗
<20-3,Guy>It's kind of the definition, isn't it?

485
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,500
<20-4,House>更可能是衰老
<20-4,House>It's kind of the definition of getting older.

486
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,000
<20-5,Guy>上个月有过几次头痛  还有低烧
<20-5,Guy>I had a couple headaches last month, a mild fever.

487
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,900
<20-5,Guy>有时失眠  难以集中注意力
<20-5,Guy>Sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.

488
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,160
<20-6,House>显然你没上网查过这个病之前都好好的
<20-6,House>Apparently not while researching this stuff on the Internet.

489
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,770
<20-7,Guy>另一个可能是纤维肌炎
<20-7,Guy>I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia.

490
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,530
<20-8,House>绝妙的诊断
<20-8,House>Excellent diagnosis.

491
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,240
<20-9,Guy>有药可治吗
<20-9,Guy>Is there anything for that?

492
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,680
<20-10,House>你别说  还真有
<20-10,House>You know, I think there just might be.

493
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,430
<20-11,House>给我36维科丁  再帮我兑一块钱
<20-11,House>I need 36 Vicodin and change for a dollar.

494
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,190
<20-11,House>送到二号病室
<20-11,House>Exam room two.

495
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,300
<21-1,Cameron>豪斯痛恨矫揉造作
<21-1,Cameron>House doesn't believe in pretense.

496
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,350
<21-1,Cameron>他认为人生苦短
<21-1,Cameron>Figures life's too short and too painful.

497
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,630
<21-1,Cameron>所以他总是有话直说
<21-1,Cameron>So he just says what he thinks.

498
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,930
<21-2,Foreman>垃圾没什么特别的
<21-2,Foreman>Nothing interesting in the garbage.

499
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
<21-2,Foreman>"有话直说"
<21-2,Foreman>"I say what I think" is

500
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,630
<21-2,Foreman>换句话说就是  "他是混蛋"
<21-2,Foreman>just another way of saying "I'm an assho"-

501
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,280
<21-3,Cameron>如果想证明你的医术高明
<21-3,Cameron>Well, if you wanted to be judged for your medical prowess only,

502
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,970
<21-3,Cameron>那咱就不用擅闯民宅了
<21-3,Cameron>maybe you shouldn't have broken into someone's home.

503
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,890
<21-4,Foreman>当时我才十六岁
<21-4,Foreman>I was 16.

504
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,000
<21-4,Foreman>不知道有没有寄生虫
<21-4,Foreman>Don't know about ticks,

505
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,670
<21-4,Foreman>但她家狗肯定有跳蚤
<21-4,Foreman>but her dog's definitely got fleas.

506
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,250
<21-5,Cameron>我十七岁时私闯民宅  但没留下案底
<21-5,Cameron>I managed to make it to 17 without a criminal record.

507
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,220
<21-5,Cameron>是吗
<21-5,Cameron>Yeah?

508
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,060
<21-6,Foreman>那你肯定不在我那区长大的
<21-6,Foreman>Well, you obviously didn't grow up in my neighborhood.

509
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,120
<21-7,Cameron>那是  你偷面包
<21-7,Cameron>That's right. You stole a loaf

510
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,680
<21-7,Cameron>是给你家里人吃的  对吧
<21-7,Cameron>of bread to feed your starving family. Right?

511
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,510
<21-7,Cameron>你总这样偷吃人家东西的吗
<21-7,Cameron>You always eat during break-ins?

512
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,990
<21-8,Foreman>还要我像对待她家DVD机
<21-8,Foreman>Am I supposed to respect their

513
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,600
<21-8,Foreman>那样小心地对待她家食物啊
<21-8,Foreman>food more than I respect their DVD players?

514
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,870
<21-8,Foreman>-要吃点吗  -不了
<21-8,Foreman>- You want some? - No.

515
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,860
<21-10,Foreman>你要等她死后才吃东西啊
<21-10,Foreman>You gonna go hungry until she dies?

516
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,560
<21-11,Cameron>-才不是  -知道吗
<21-11,Cameron>- No. - You know what?

517
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,610
<21-12,Foreman>黑人经受几个世纪奴隶制折磨
<21-12,Foreman>After centuries of slavery,

518
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,950
<21-12,Foreman>还有几十年的民权斗争
<21-12,Foreman>decades of civil rights marches...

519
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,470
<21-12,Foreman>而我仍然过着修道士的生活
<21-12,Foreman>and, more significantly, living like a monk,

520
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,550
<21-12,Foreman>各科成绩都从没低过四分
<21-12,Foreman>never getting less than a 4.0 G.P.A.,

521
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,610
<21-12,Foreman>却靠擅闯民宅得到一份好工作
<21-12,Foreman>you don't think it's kind of disgusting I get

522
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,960
<21-12,Foreman>换做是你  不会觉得恶心吗
<21-12,Foreman>one of the top jobs in the country because I'm a delinquent?

523
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,500
<21-12,Foreman>等我吃完了  再看看地毯下面有什么
<21-12,Foreman>We'll eat, then we'll tear up the carpet.

524
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,530
<21-13,Cameron>你是霍普金斯大学毕业的吗
<21-13,Cameron>You went to Hopkins, right?

525
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,680
<21-14,Foreman>对
<21-14,Foreman>Yep.

526
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,980
<21-15,Cameron>那你的学校比我的好
<21-15,Cameron>So you went to a better school than I did.

527
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,200
<21-15,Cameron>成绩也比我的好
<21-15,Cameron>You got better grades than I did.

528
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,960
<21-16,Foreman>那你是怎么会被录用的
<21-16,Foreman>So how did you get the job?

529
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,690
<21-16,Foreman>该不会你在酒吧捅过什么人吧
<21-16,Foreman>You stab a guy in a bar fight?

530
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,590
<22-1,Foreman>什么都找不到
<22-1,Foreman>Nothing.

531
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,210
<22-2,House>不是肿瘤  病情恶化速度太快
<22-2,House>It's not a tumor. She's getting worse too fast.

532
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,900
<22-3,Wilson>-她都站不起来了  -没有毒品或药物吗
<22-3,Wilson>- She can't stand up. - No toxins? No medications?

533
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,650
<22-4,Foreman>找不到能解释她病症的东西
<22-4,Foreman>Nothing that would explain these symptoms.

534
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,550
<22-5,Wilson>有家族性的神经疾病吗
<22-5,Wilson>Family history of neurological problems?

535
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,850
<22-6,Foreman>光从她家内衣抽屉  我看不出家族病史
<22-6,Foreman>Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.

536
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,410
<22-7,House>你说"找不到能解释她病症的东西"
<22-7,House>You said "Nothing that would explain these symptoms."

537
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,040
<22-7,House>那你找到的都是些什么
<22-7,House>What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?

538
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,470
<22-8,Foreman>威尔森医生是骗你的
<22-8,Foreman>Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses.

539
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,330
<22-8,Foreman>阿德不是他表妹
<22-8,Foreman>Adler's not his cousin.

540
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,780
<22-9,Wilson>荒唐  你可以去问她啊
<22-9,Wilson>That's ridiculous. You can ask her yourself.

541
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,750
<22-9,Wilson>-能回到...  -她根本就不是犹太人
<22-9,Wilson>- Can we get ba... - She's not Jewish.

542
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,460
<22-11,Wilson>蕾切·阿德不是犹太人吗
<22-11,Wilson>Rachel Adler's not Jewish?

543
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,340
<22-12,Foreman>在她公寓找到了火腿
<22-12,Foreman>I had ham at her apartment.

544
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,930
<22-13,Wilson>福曼医生  很多犹太人有非犹太的亲戚
<22-13,Wilson>Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews have non-Jewish relatives,

545
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,440
<22-13,Wilson>很多犹太人也不吃犹太洁食
<22-13,Wilson>and most of us don't keep kosher.

546
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,720
<22-13,Wilson>高中生不懂犹太习俗还能原谅
<22-13,Wilson>I can see getting through high school

547
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,080
<22-13,Wilson>可你是堂堂医学院的毕业生
<22-13,Wilson>without learning a thing about Jews, but medical school?

548
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,640
<22-14,Foreman>即便她是犹太人
<22-14,Foreman>Okay, maybe she's Jewish,

549
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,000
<22-14,Foreman>她也绝不会是你表妹
<22-14,Foreman>But she's definitely not your cousin.

550
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,360
<22-15,Wilson>是吗  你这是...
<22-15,Wilson>Really? This guy is-

551
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,090
<22-16,Foreman>你甚至不知道她叫什么
<22-16,Foreman>You don't even know her name.

552
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,420
<22-16,Foreman>你叫她蕾切  可她分明叫丽贝卡
<22-16,Foreman>You called her Rachel. Her name is Rebecca.

553
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,540
<22-17,Wilson>没错  她是叫丽贝卡
<22-17,Wilson>Yes. Yes, her name is Rebecca.

554
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,890
<22-17,Wilson>小名是蕾切
<22-17,Wilson>I-I call her Rachel.

555
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,030
<22-18,House>-你这白痴  -听我说  他...
<22-18,House>- You idiot! - Listen, he's-

556
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,900
<22-19,Wilson>没说你  说他
<22-19,Wilson>Not you. Him.

557
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,430
<22-20,House>你刚说你什么也没有找到
<22-20,House>You said you didn't find anything.

558
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,040
<22-21,Foreman>我找到的东西都...
<22-21,Foreman>Everything I found was in my

559
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,420
<22-22,House>-你找到火腿了  -那又怎样
<22-22,House>- You found ham. - So?

560
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,070
<22-24,House>找到火腿就是说有猪肉
<22-24,House>Where there's ham, there's pork.

561
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,160
<22-24,House>有猪肉  就说明可能是脑囊尾蚴病
<22-24,House>Where there's pork, there's neurocysticercosis.

562
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,950
<22-25,Chase>绦虫  你是说她大脑里有猪肉绦虫
<22-25,Chase>Tapeworm? You think she's got a worm in her brain?

563
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,760
<22-25,Chase>完全吻合
<22-25,Chase>It fits.

564
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
<22-26,House>可以在大脑里寄生好几年
<22-26,House>Could have been living there for years. Never occurred to me that-

565
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,250
<22-27,Cameron>每天数百万的人都在食用火腿
<22-27,Cameron>Millions of people eat ham every day.

566
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,280
<22-27,Cameron>这个可能性微乎其微
<22-27,Cameron>It's quite a leap to think that's she's got a tapeworm.

567
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,510
<22-28,House>神经专家  脑囊尾蚴病患者
<22-28,House>Okay, Mr. Neurologist, what happens

568
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,510
<22-28,House>施用类固醇后  会出现什么反应
<22-28,House>when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?

569
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
<22-29,Foreman>病情稍作好转后  急转直下
<22-29,Foreman>They- They get a little better, and-and then they get worse.

570
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,810
<22-30,Wilson>跟丽贝卡·阿德一样
<22-30,Wilson>Just like Rebecca Adler did.

571
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,620
<22-31,House>典型病例  如果烹调猪肉时间不够
<22-31,House>In a typical case, if you don't cook pork well enough,

572
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,190
<22-31,House>绦虫幼体会进入消化系统
<22-31,House>you digest live tapeworm larvae.

573
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,210
<22-31,House>它们身体长有小钩
<22-31,House>They've got these little hooks,

574
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,570
<22-31,House>能吸附在肠壁上
<22-31,House>they grab onto your bowel,

575
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,460
<22-31,House>寄生  成长  繁殖
<22-31,House>they live, they grow up, they reproduce.

576
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,050
<22-32,Chase>怎么会繁殖  病灶只有一个
<22-32,Chase>Reproduce? There's only one lesion,

577
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,410
<22-32,Chase>且绝不在肠内
<22-32,Chase>and it's nowhere near her bowel.

578
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,730
<22-33,House>因为这并非典型病例
<22-33,House>That's because this is not a typical case.

579
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,730
<22-33,House>绦虫一天内能产下两万到三万只卵
<22-33,House>Tapeworm can produce 20,000 to 30,000 eggs a day.

580
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,200
<22-33,House>-知道卵都去哪了吗  -排出体外
<22-33,House>- Guess where they go?  - Out.

581
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,980
<22-35,House>总有漏网之鱼
<22-35,House>Not all of them.

582
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,270
<22-35,House>与幼虫不同
<22-35,House>Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right

583
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,420
<22-35,House>虫卵能穿过肠壁到血液
<22-35,House>through the walls of the intestines into the bloodstream.

584
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,020
<22-35,House>-血液通向哪里呢  -全身各处
<22-35,House>- And where does the bloodstream go? - Everywhere.

585
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,580
<22-38,Foreman>只要虫卵健康
<22-38,Foreman>As long as it's healthy,

586
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,760
<22-37,House>免疫系统不会产生排斥
<22-37,House>the immune system doesn't even know it's there.

587
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,010
<22-37,House>寄生虫通过分泌特殊物质逃过免疫监测
<22-37,House>The worm builds a wall, uses secretions to

588
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,180
<22-37,House>并控制体液流动
<22-37,House>shut down the body's immune response and control fluid flow.

589
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,440
<22-37,House>整个过程配合得天衣无缝
<22-37,House>It's really very beautiful.

590
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,100
<22-38,Foreman>只要绦虫健康她就安全  怎么办
<22-38,Foreman>As long as it's healthy. So what do we do?

591
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,500
<22-38,Foreman>叫兽医将这寄生虫治好吗
<22-38,Foreman>Call a vet, nurse the little guy back to health?

592
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,310
<22-39,House>太迟了  它已经快死了
<22-39,House>It's too late for that. It's dying.

593
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,170
<22-39,House>如果它死掉  寄生虫就不能
<22-39,House>And as it dies, this parasite

594
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,970
<22-39,House>抵御宿主的免疫系统监测
<22-39,House>loses the ability to control the host's defenses.

595
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,840
<22-39,House>这时免疫系统重新恢复免疫  吞噬蠕虫
<22-39,House>The immune system wakes up, attacks the worm,

596
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,460
<22-39,House>一切都开始沸腾
<22-39,House>and everything starts to swell.

597
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,370
<22-39,House>对大脑是严重的伤害
<22-39,House>And that is very bad for the brain.

598
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,650
<22-40,Wilson>但也不能排除其他可能性
<22-40,Wilson>It could still be a hundred other things.

599
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,300
<22-40,Wilson>嗜伊红血球数量正常
<22-40,Wilson>The eosinophil count was normal.

600
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,410
<22-41,Chase>数量不正常的病例只占的30%
<22-41,Chase>It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.

601
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,830
<22-42,Wilson>这说明不了什么
<22-42,Wilson>Proving nothing.

602
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,070
<22-43,House>到现在你还不懂吗
<22-43,House>No, no, no, no. It...don't you see?

603
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,920
<22-43,House>这与病情相符  解释了一切
<22-43,House>It fits. It's perfect. It explains everything.

604
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,180
<22-44,Wilson>却证明不了什么
<22-44,Wilson>But it proves nothing.

605
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,790
<22-45,House>-我能通过治疗来证明  -你不行
<22-45,House>- I can prove it by treating it. - No, you can't.

606
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,360
<22-46,Wilson>刚才和她谈过了  她不愿再接受任何治疗
<22-46,Wilson>I was just with her.She doesn't want any more treatments.

607
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,600
<22-46,Wilson>也不愿再去做任何检验  只想回家等死
<22-46,Wilson>She doesn't want any more experiments.She wants to go home and die.

608
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,640
<22-47,House>请你出去一下好吗
<22-47,House>Would you excuse us, please?

609
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,520
<22-48,House>我是豪斯医生
<22-48,House>I'm Dr. House.

610
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,260
<22-49,Rebecca>很高兴见到你
<22-49,Rebecca>It's good to meet you.

611
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,620
<22-50,House>你这个白痴
<22-50,House>You're being an idiot.

612
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,650
<22-50,House>你的大脑里有绦虫
<22-50,House>You have a tapeworm in your brain.

613
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,570
<22-50,House>情况不妙
<22-50,House>It's not pleasant,

614
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,140
<22-50,House>如果不做治疗  你活不过这周末
<22-50,House>but if we don't do anything,you'll be dead by the weekend.

615
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,220
<22-51,Rebecca>你看到虫子了吗
<22-51,Rebecca>Have you actually seen the worm?

616
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,900
<22-52,House>等你康复  就拿我的文凭给你看
<22-52,House>When you're all better,I'll show you my diplomas.

617
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,650
<22-53,Rebecca>你之前还认为我得的是血管炎呢
<22-53,Rebecca>You were sure I had vasculitis too.

618
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,630
<22-53,Rebecca>现在我无法走路  还穿上尿布
<22-53,Rebecca>Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a diaper.

619
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,840
<22-53,Rebecca>这个治疗能又能让我怎样
<22-53,Rebecca>What's this treatment gonna do for me?

620
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,830
<22-54,House>现在说的不仅是治疗  而是治愈
<22-54,House>I'm not talking about a treatment.I'm talking about a cure.

621
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,700
<22-54,House>可能我错了  你宁可去死
<22-54,House>But because I might be wrong,you want to die.

622
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,540
<22-55,Rebecca>你是怎么瘸的
<22-55,Rebecca>What made you a cripple?

623
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,980
<22-56,House>我得了血管梗塞
<22-56,House>I had an infarction.

624
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,180
<22-57,Rebecca>是心脏病吗
<22-57,Rebecca>A heart attack?

625
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,640
<22-58,House>是由于血流受阻而引起的疾病
<22-58,House>It's what happens when blood flow is obstructed.

626
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,780
<22-57,Rebecca>梗塞在心脏就是心脏病
<22-57,Rebecca>If it's in the heart,it's a heart attack.

627
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,590
<22-58,House>在肺部是肺动脉栓塞
<22-58,House>If it's in the lungs, it's a pulmonary embolism.

628
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,390
<22-58,House>在脑部是脑中风  我的血栓在大腿肌肉
<22-58,House>If it's in the brain, it's a stroke.I had it in my thigh muscles.

629
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,640
<22-59,Rebecca>他们都无计可施了吗
<22-59,Rebecca>Wasn't there something they could do?

630
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,660
<22-60,House>如果他们诊断正确  方法还有很多
<22-60,House>There was plenty they could do,if they'd made the right diagnosis.

631
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,170
<22-60,House>但疼痛是唯一症状
<22-60,House>But the only symptom was pain.

632
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,520
<22-60,House>极少数人出现肌坏死
<22-60,House>Not many people get to experience muscle death.

633
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,010
<22-61,Rebecca>你想过死吗
<22-61,Rebecca>Did you think you were dying?

634
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,470
<22-62,House>本想一死了之
<22-62,House>I hoped I was dying.

635
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,250
<22-63,Rebecca>所以现在你躲在办公室里  不见病人
<22-63,Rebecca>So you hide in your office,refuse to see patients...

636
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,760
<22-63,Rebecca>因为你讨厌人们的眼光
<22-63,Rebecca>because you don't like the way people look at you.

637
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,000
<22-63,Rebecca>感觉被命运玩弄
<22-63,Rebecca>You feel cheated by life,

638
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,970
<22-63,Rebecca>所以要报复这个世界
<22-63,Rebecca>so now you're gonna get even with the world.

639
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,470
<22-63,Rebecca>但你却让我与病魔抗争
<22-63,Rebecca>But you want me to fight this.

640
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,550
<22-63,Rebecca>为什么
<22-63,Rebecca>Why?

641
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,470
<22-63,Rebecca>凭什么你觉得我比你好
<22-63,Rebecca>What makes you think I'm so much better than you?

642
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,720
<22-64,House>怎么了  你害怕会变成我吗
<22-64,House>What, you're scared you'll turn into me?

643
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,190
<22-65,Rebecca>我只想死得有尊严
<22-65,Rebecca>I just want to die with a little dignity.

644
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,970
<22-66,House>根本就没这回事
<22-66,House>There's no such thing.

645
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,390
<22-66,House>我们的身体都会崩溃
<22-66,House>Our bodies break down.

646
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,850
<22-66,House>有的人在九十岁
<22-66,House>Sometimes when we're 90.

647
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,990
<22-66,House>有的人在出生以前
<22-66,House>Sometimes before we're even born.

648
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,860
<22-66,House>生命就是这样
<22-66,House>But it always happens,

649
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,560
<22-66,House>毫无尊严可言
<22-66,House>and there's never any dignity in it.

650
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,510
<22-66,House>我不管你能不能走路  看东西
<22-66,House>I don't care if you can walk,see,

651
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,690
<22-66,House>擦自己屁股
<22-66,House>wipe your own ass.

652
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,530
<22-66,House>生命永远都是丑陋的  永远都是
<22-66,House>It's always ugly. Always.

653
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,160
<22-66,House>只能带着尊严活着  不能带着尊严去死
<22-66,House>We can live with dignity.We can't die with it.

654
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,170
<23-1,House>还是不接受治疗
<23-1,House>No treatment.

655
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,980
<23-2,Foreman>也许可以申请一份法院令
<23-2,Foreman>Maybe we can get a court order,uh,

656
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,740
<23-2,Foreman>否决她的愿望
<23-2,Foreman>override her wishes,

657
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,810
<23-2,Foreman>说她没有作决定的能力
<23-2,Foreman>claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision.

658
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,140
<23-3,House>但她可以
<23-3,House>But she does.

659
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,000
<23-4,Cameron>不过我们可以说
<23-4,Cameron>But we could claim that

660
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,850
<23-4,Cameron>疾病使她精神错乱  对吧
<23-4,Cameron>the illness made her mentally incompetent, right?

661
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,740
<23-5,Foreman>-这样就皆大欢喜  -别费力气了
<23-5,Foreman>- A pretty common result.  - That didn't happen here.

662
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,060
<23-6,House>他不会这么做的
<23-6,House>He's not gonna do it.

663
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,330
<23-7,Wilson>对豪斯来说她已经不只是单纯的病例
<23-7,Wilson>She's notjust a file to him anymore.

664
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,680
<23-7,Wilson>他尊重她
<23-7,Wilson>He respects her.

665
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,650
<23-8,Cameron>尊重她  你就让她去死吗
<23-8,Cameron>So because you respect her,you're going to let her die?

666
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,050
<23-9,House>我已经作出诊断  没我什么事了
<23-9,House>I solved the case.My work is done.

667
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,210
<23-10,House>病人总是要证明
<23-10,House>Patients always want proof.

668
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,510
<23-10,House>我们又不是造汽车的
<23-10,House>We're not making cars here.

669
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,090
<23-10,House>才不会提供担保
<23-10,House>We don't give guarantees.

670
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,940
<23-11,Chase>我想我们能证明
<23-11,Chase>I think we can prove it's a worm.

671
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,810
<23-11,Chase>非入侵性检查  绝对安全
<23-11,Chase>It's noninvasive. It's safe.

672
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,720
<23-11,Chase>我也不太确定  但是
<23-11,Chase>I'm not completely sure, but...

673
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,070
<23-12,House>得  得  你到底想说什么
<23-12,House>Yeah, yeah, yeah.What's the damn idea?

674
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,860
<23-13,Chase>你在X光片中见过虫子吗
<23-13,Chase>Have you ever seen a worm under an X-ray?

675
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,760
<23-13,Chase>一种常规  古老  无对比度
<23-13,Chase>A regular, old, no-contrast,

676
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,330
<23-13,Chase>上百年科技的X光片
<23-13,Chase>hundred-year-old-technology X-ray?

677
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,700
<23-13,Chase>虫子的X光片看起来像是猎枪子弹
<23-13,Chase>They light up like shotgun pellets,

678
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,920
<23-13,Chase>跟核磁共振成像一样
<23-13,Chase>just like on a contrast M.R.I.

679
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,830
<23-14,Foreman>可我们已做过CT透视
<23-14,Foreman>Which is the same thing as a CT scan,

680
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,490
<23-14,Foreman>什么都看不见
<23-14,Foreman>which we did, which proved nothing.

681
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,570
<23-15,House>虫胞密度和脑脊髓液密度相近
<23-15,House>The worm's cyst is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid.

682
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,820
<23-15,House>所以在大脑中找不到绦虫
<23-15,House>We're not gonna see anything in her head.

683
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,030
<23-15,House>可奇斯说对了
<23-15,House>But Chase is right.

684
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,710
<23-15,House>他是对的  可以做X光
<23-15,House>He's right. We should X-ray her.

685
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,720
<23-15,House>可这次不是大脑  而是她的腿
<23-15,House>But we don't X-ray her brain. We X-ray her leg.

686
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,310
<23-15,House>虫子喜欢大腿肌
<23-15,House>Worms love thigh muscle.

687
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,750
<23-15,House>如果她的大脑里有虫子
<23-15,House>If she's got one in her head,

688
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,600
<23-15,House>大腿中肯定也有
<23-15,House>I guarantee you there's one in her leg.

689
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,540
<24-1,Chase>别动  丽贝卡
<24-1,Chase>Hold still, Rebecca.

690
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,780
<24-1,Chase>这里
<24-1,Chase>This here...

691
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,830
<25-1,Chase>是一只幼虫
<25-1,Chase>is a worm larva.

692
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,600
<25-2,Rebecca>我腿里有虫子  就是说大脑里也有吗
<25-2,Rebecca>So, if it's in my leg,it's in my brain?

693
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,540
<25-3,Chase>你不是想要证明吗
<25-3,Chase>Are you looking for a guarantee?

694
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,050
<25-3,Chase>这就是  它可能已经在那住六年了
<25-3,Chase>It's there.Probably been there six to ten years.

695
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,870
<25-4,Rebecca>-还有更多吗  -很有可能
<25-4,Rebecca>- Do I have more?  - Probably.

696
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,110
<25-5,Chase>这是个好消息
<25-5,Chase>It's good news.

697
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,040
<25-6,Rebecca>-现在该怎么办  -让你好起来
<25-6,Rebecca>- What do we do now?  - Now we get you better.

698
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,090
<25-7,Chase>阿苯达唑
<25-7,Chase>Albendazole.

699
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,370
<25-8,Rebecca>就两片药
<25-8,Rebecca>Two pills?

700
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,580
<25-9,Chase>是的  每天饭后  持续服用一个月
<25-9,Chase>Yeah. Every day,for at least a month, with a meal.

701
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,060
<25-8,Rebecca>-就两片药吗  -没错
<25-8,Rebecca>- Two pills?  - Yeah.

702
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,340
<25-11,Chase>可能出现的不良反应有
<25-11,Chase>Possible side effects include

703
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,180
<25-11,Chase>腹痛  呕吐  头痛  眩晕  发烧
<25-11,Chase>abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, dizziness, fever...

704
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,900
<25-11,Chase>还有脱发
<25-11,Chase>and hair loss.

705
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,760
<25-11,Chase>即使你出现以上所有不良反应
<25-11,Chase>We'll probably make you keep taking the pills

706
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,420
<25-11,Chase>还是要坚持吃药
<25-11,Chase>even if you get every one of those.

707
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,730
<26-1,Cameron>你为什么雇我
<26-1,Cameron>Why did you hire me?

708
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,220
<26-2,House>这重要吗
<26-2,House>Does it matter?

709
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,160
<26-3,Cameron>很难为不尊重自己的人工作
<26-3,Cameron>Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you.

710
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,620
<26-5,Cameron>-为什么  -这是你的口头禅吗
<26-5,Cameron>- Why?  - Is that rhetorical?

711
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,790
<26-6,House>不是  只是奇怪你会不知道答案
<26-6,House>No. It just seems that way 'cause you can't think of an answer.

712
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,650
<26-6,House>你真的在乎我的想法吗
<26-6,House>Does it make a difference what I think?

713
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,540
<26-6,House>我是个混蛋
<26-6,House>I'm a jerk.

714
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,750
<26-6,House>重要的是你自己的想法
<26-6,House>The only thing that matters is what you think.

715
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,440
<26-6,House>你能胜任这份工作吗
<26-6,House>Can you do the job?

716
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
<26-7,Cameron>你雇福曼  是因为他有少年犯罪史
<26-7,Cameron>You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.

717
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,170
<26-7,Cameron>才不是
<26-7,Cameron>No.

718
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,130
<26-8,House>这不是种族问题
<26-8,House>It wasn't a racial thing.

719
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,440
<26-7,Cameron>我看到的不是个黑人
<26-7,Cameron>I didn't see a black guy.

720
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,870
<26-8,House>而是一名医生
<26-8,House>I just saw a doctor...

721
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,870
<26-7,Cameron>兼有少年犯罪史
<26-7,Cameron>with a juvenile record.

722
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,490
<26-8,House>我雇奇斯  因为他爹老烦我
<26-8,House>I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call.

723
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,470
<26-8,House>我雇你
<26-8,House>I hired you...

724
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,170
<26-8,House>因为你美艳动人
<26-8,House>because you are extremely pretty.

725
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,000
<26-9,Cameron>你竟然只图我的美色
<26-9,Cameron>You hired me to get into my pants?

726
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,210
<26-10,House>你这么奇怪干嘛
<26-10,House>I can't believe that that would shock you.

727
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,850
<26-10,House>我可没这么说
<26-10,House>It's also not what I said.

728
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,890
<26-10,House>错了  我雇你  是因为你养眼
<26-10,House>No, I hired you because you look good.

729
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,270
<26-10,House>就像门廊里的花瓶
<26-10,House>It's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby.

730
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,450
<26-11,Cameron>我是我们班里的尖子
<26-11,Cameron>I was in the top of my class.

731
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,460
<26-12,House>但并非名列前茅
<26-12,House>But not the top.

732
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,000
<26-13,Cameron>我还在梅奥诊所做过实习医生
<26-13,Cameron>I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.

733
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,850
<26-14,House>没错  你的确在众求职者中促类拔萃
<26-14,House>Yeah. You were a very good applicant.

734
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,980
<26-15,Cameron>但并非最好的
<26-15,Cameron>But not the best.

735
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,560
<26-16,House>这让你很沮丧吗  真的
<26-16,House>Would that upset you? Really?

736
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,250
<26-16,House>我雇你是  看在你的天生丽质
<26-16,House>To think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty

737
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,460
<26-16,House>而非天资聪颖  所以你很不快吗
<26-16,House>instead of some genetic gift of intelligence?

738
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,100
<26-17,Cameron>我是几经辛苦才得到这份工作的
<26-17,Cameron>I worked very hard to get where I am.

739
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,410
<26-17,Cameron>但你不需要
<26-17,Cameron>But you didn't have to.

740
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,670
<26-18,House>人们总是选择用最小努力
<26-18,House>People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards

741
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,360
<26-18,House>换取最大的回报
<26-18,House>for the least amount of effort.

742
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,060
<26-18,House>这是人之常情
<26-18,House>That's a law of nature,

743
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,400
<26-18,House>而你却反其道而行
<26-18,House>and you defied it.

744
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,890
<26-18,House>这才是我看中你的原因
<26-18,House>That's why I hired you.

745
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,460
<26-18,House>你大可以嫁给一个富翁  或者做名模
<26-18,House>You could have married rich. You could have been a model.

746
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,820
<26-18,House>你只要稍微卖弄姿色
<26-18,House>You could havejust shown up and

747
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,860
<26-18,House>就能得到想要的东西
<26-18,House>people would have given you stuff.

748
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,940
<26-18,House>很多东西
<26-18,House>Lots of stuff.

749
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,970
<26-18,House>可你却没有  你抛开自己容貌上的优势
<26-18,House>But you didn't. You worked your stunning little ass off.

750
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,910
<26-19,Cameron>我是不是该感到荣幸啊
<26-19,Cameron>Am I supposed to be flattered?

751
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,860
<26-20,House>美女不会进医学院
<26-20,House>Gorgeous women do not go to medical school...

752
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,480
<26-20,House>除非美丽的外表下藏着一颗受伤的心
<26-20,House>unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful.

753
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,990
<26-20,House>你被家人虐待过吗
<26-20,House>Were you abused by a family member?

754
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,690
<26-22,House>-没有  -被强奸过吗
<26-22,House>- No.  - Sexually assaulted?

755
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,640
<26-23,Cameron>没有
<26-23,Cameron>No!

756
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,820
<26-24,House>反正你的心是受伤的  对吧
<26-24,House>But you are damaged, aren't you?

757
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,570
<26-25,Cameron>我得走了
<26-25,Cameron>I have to go.

758
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,230
<27-1,Orange guy>我跟踪她
<27-1,Orange guy>I followed her.

759
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,970
<27-1,Orange guy>我脑子里满是那医生的话
<27-1,Orange guy>I couldn't stop thinking about what that doctor said.

760
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,910
<27-2,Cuddy>告诉过你别听他的  他是个白痴
<27-2,Cuddy>I told you not to listen to him.He's an idiot.

761
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,980
<27-3,Orange guy>我变橙色了
<27-3,Orange guy>I was orange!

762
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,290
<27-4,Cuddy>我不想知道你发现了什么
<27-4,Cuddy>I don't want to know what you found out.

763
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,170
<27-5,Orange guy>你不关心吗
<27-5,Orange guy>You don't care?

764
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,730
<27-6,Cuddy>我只是你的医生
<27-6,Cuddy>I'm your doctor.

765
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,310
<27-6,Cuddy>我很感激你为我以及医院做的一切
<27-6,Cuddy>You've been good to me and good to this hospital.

766
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,480
<27-6,Cuddy>我当然关心
<27-6,Cuddy>Of course I care.

767
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,790
<27-6,Cuddy>但是我不知该如何收场
<27-6,Cuddy>But I don't see how this conversation can end well for me.

768
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,660
<27-6,Cuddy>不管你的老婆有没有外遇
<27-6,Cuddy>Neither your wife is having an affair,or she's not having an affair,

769
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,820
<27-6,Cuddy>你来我这都是想要我开除他
<27-6,Cuddy>and you have come here because you rightly think I should fire him.

770
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,710
<27-6,Cuddy>可是我做不到  即便你花钱
<27-6,Cuddy>But I can't.Even if it costs me your money.

771
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,160
<27-6,Cuddy>这个混蛋是我们最好的医生
<27-6,Cuddy>The son of a bitch is the best doctor we have.

772
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,280
<28-1,Chase>感觉好些了吗
<28-1,Chase>Feeling any better?

773
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,520
<28-2,Rebecca>挺好的
<28-2,Rebecca>I can't complain.

774
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,230
<28-3,Chase>你知道的  医院里有明文规定
<28-3,Chase>As you know, the hospital has certain rules.

775
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,370
<28-3,Chase>而我们喜欢无视那些规定
<28-3,Chase>And as you also know, we tend to ignore them.

776
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,750
<28-3,Chase>但是这的确有些明目张胆
<28-3,Chase>But I think this one's gonna be a little obvious

777
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,440
<28-3,Chase>除非你帮忙
<28-3,Chase>unless we get your help.

778
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,070
<28-4,Cameron>如果谁问起
<28-4,Cameron>If anyone asks,

779
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,110
<28-4,Cameron>你就说你有十一个女儿和五个儿子
<28-4,Cameron>you have 11 daughters and five sons.

780
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,150
<28-6,Class>看是谁来了
<28-6,Class>Hi! Look who's here!

781
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,420
<28-7,Rebecca>我想死你们了
<28-7,Rebecca>It's so good to see you guys.I missed you.

782
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,760
<28-8,Rebecca>是给我的吗
<28-8,Rebecca>Is this for me?

783
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,530
<28-8,Rebecca>太漂亮了

<28-9,Rebecca>我想当面感谢豪斯医生
<28-9,Rebecca>I wanted to thank Dr. House,

786
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,850
<28-9,Rebecca>但他没再来看我了
<28-9,Rebecca>but he never visited again.

787
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,940
<28-10,Cameron>他治好了你  你却没有治好他
<28-10,Cameron>He cured you. You didn't cure him.

788
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,530
<28-11,Rebecca>好吧  我要亲亲你们每一个人
<28-11,Rebecca>Okay, I want a hug and a kiss

789
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,620
<28-11,Rebecca>快上来吧
<28-11,Rebecca>from every single one of you! Get up here right now!

00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,870
<29-1,Male Dr on mini TV>-那里  -夹住了
