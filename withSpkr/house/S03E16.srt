00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,270
<2-1,WILSON>太奇妙了
<2-1,WILSON>That's amazing.

31
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,370
<2-2,HOUSE>才不是
<2-2,HOUSE>No, it's not.

32
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,150
<2-3,WILSON>不是?
<2-3,WILSON>It's not?

33
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,440
<2-4,HOUSE>我能用鼻子吹口琴,从小孩儿耳朵里掏出硬币...
<2-4,HOUSE>I can play the harmonica with my nose, make a penny come out of a child's ear--

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,540
<2-4,HOUSE>或者从别的孔也行...
<2-4,HOUSE>or any other orifice, for that matter--

35
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,210
<2-4,HOUSE>还有 在某种条件下,同时让两个女人迷恋我
<2-4,HOUSE>and, given the right circumstances,,can bring two women to simultaneous ecstasy.

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,940
<2-5,WILSON>这条件就是指 她们两人协商好,从你同一张信用卡里扣钱
<2-5,WILSON>The right circumstances being their agreement,to bill you on the same credit card.

37
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,210
<2-6,HOUSE>而我绝对做不到,梦见一个素未谋面的人
<2-6,HOUSE>And what I absolutely cannot do is dream about,someone I've never seen before.

38
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,540
<2-7,WILSON>你理解不了 可不代表不可能发生
<2-7,WILSON>Well, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it can't happen.

39
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,920
<2-8,HOUSE>不可能发生就是不可能!
<2-8,HOUSE>True...it can't happen because it can't happen!

40
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,120
<2-9,WILSON>也许你梦到的并不是特定的他
<2-9,WILSON>Well, maybe you didn't dream about this guy specifically.

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,820
<2-10,HOUSE>是啊 一个长得和他一摸一样的家伙
<2-10,HOUSE>Right, just some other guy who looks exactly like him.

42
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,110
<2-11,WILSON>不 你想象了一个普通海军陆战员
<2-11,WILSON>No, you imagined some generic marine,

43
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,790
<2-11,WILSON>你看见照片后 把他的脸代入了进去
<2-11,WILSON>then you placed his face in the dream after you saw the picture.

44
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,480
<2-11,WILSON>Sort of a coincidence mixed with a little d閖vu.
<2-11,WILSON>一点巧合加一点似曾相识

45
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,930
<2-12,HOUSE>他从来没有来过这家医院
<2-12,HOUSE>there's no record of him ever coming into the clinic.

46
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,830
<2-12,HOUSE>我肯定以前在别的地方见过他
<2-12,HOUSE>So I must have seen him before somewhere else.

47
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,960
<2-13,WILSON>你们当童子军的时候认识的
<2-13,WILSON>Fine, you've known him since cub scouts.

48
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,270
<2-13,WILSON>有意思的问题不是做梦的内容 而是缘由
<2-13,WILSON>A more interesting question isn't what you dreamed, but why?

49
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,780
<2-13,WILSON>我猜你要不就是渴望和你爸爸重归于好...
<2-13,WILSON>I'm guessing you're longing for either a renewed relationship with your dad...

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,680
<2-13,WILSON>要不就是想发展一段同志新关系
<2-13,WILSON>or a new relationship with one of the village people.

51
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,680
<2-14,HOUSE>他是海军 而不是海军陆战队的
<2-14,HOUSE>He was in the navy, not the marines.

52
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,840
<2-15,WILSON>我以为你爸爸是海军陆战队的
<2-15,WILSON>I thought your dad was in the marines.

53
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,360
<2-16,HOUSE>村民乐团的一员,(男子同志演唱团 "在海军"为其名曲)
<2-16,HOUSE>The guy in the village people.

54
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,100
<2-17,WILSON>事实上 只有唱"在海军"时 他才是海军
<2-17,WILSON>Actually, he's only in the navy when they sing in the navy.

55
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,230
<2-17,WILSON>其余的时间 他只是杂役兵
<2-17,WILSON>The rest of the time, he's just in generic fatigues.

56
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,790
<2-17,WILSON>干吗?
<2-17,WILSON>What?

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,330
<2-17,WILSON>你挑起来的话题
<2-17,WILSON>You brought it up.

58
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,570
<2-17,WILSON>你没冲水
<2-17,WILSON>You didn't flush.

59
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,470
<2-18,HOUSE>我没尿出来
<2-18,HOUSE>I didn't pee.

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,690
<3-1,HOUSE>间歇性皮疹 以及咽喉痛

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,590
<3-1,HOUSE>他自己觉得患了海湾战争综合症
<3-1,HOUSE>Thinks he has gulf war syndrome.

64
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,950
<3-2,CAMERON>他怎么来这里,却不去VA(退伍军人管理局)?
<3-2,CAMERON>Why is he here instead of the va?

65
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,970
<3-3,HOUSE>因为Cuddy不想给他的有钱老舅口交
<3-3,HOUSE>Because he has a rich uncle cuddy's trying to avoid fellating

66
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,620
<3-3,HOUSE>他老舅不相信VA的"没有毛病"的诊断
<3-3,HOUSE>who doesn't buy the va's diagnosis of "nothing's wrongatosis.

67
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,830
<3-3,HOUSE>VA是对的
<3-3,HOUSE>" The va's right.

68
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,570
<3-4,FOREMAN>没什么海湾战争综合症
<3-4,FOREMAN>There's no such thing as gulf war syndrome,

69
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,980
<3-4,FOREMAN>尤其是在从没参加过海湾战争的人身上
<3-4,FOREMAN>especially in veterans who've never served in the gulf war.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,440
<3-5,CHASE>两场战争 一个地方
<3-5,CHASE>Different war, same place.

71
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,110
<3-5,CHASE>1990年在那儿的 还是在那儿
<3-5,CHASE>Whatever was there in 1990 is still there.

72
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,780
<3-6,FOREMAN>那里的东西能让你进棺材
<3-6,FOREMAN>What's there can send you home in a pine box,

73
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,530
<3-6,FOREMAN>但不可能让你回家三个月之后生病
<3-6,FOREMAN>but it can't get you sick three months after you've gotten home.

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,240
<3-7,CHASE>那成千上万的士兵都是在捏造症状?
<3-7,CHASE>What, so thousands of soldiers are lying about their symptoms?

75
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,560
<3-8,FOREMAN>你派七十万人去夏威夷度假,也会有人病着回家
<3-8,FOREMAN>You send 700,000 people on vacation to hawaii,,some are gonna come back sick.

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,050
<3-8,FOREMAN>不代表那是潜水呼吸管引起的
<3-8,FOREMAN>Doesn't mean it was caused by snorkeling.

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,130
<3-9,CAMERON>他是对的 研究表面不论是否参加过海湾战争
<3-9,CAMERON>He's right.The studies all show the same pattern of symptoms in veterans

78
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,560
<3-9,CAMERON>那些退伍军人的症状都是一样的
<3-9,CAMERON>who were sent to the gulf and those who weren'T.

79
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,870
<3-10,FOREMAN>就这样了 你信她却不信我?
<3-10,FOREMAN>That's it?You believe her but not me?

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,830
<3-11,HOUSE>坚持你自己的意见 Chase
<3-11,HOUSE>Stick to your guns, chase.

81
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,430
<3-11,HOUSE>光因为没有一个统一症状不代表
<3-11,HOUSE>Just 'cause there isn't a single unifying symptom doesn't mean

82
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,840
<3-11,HOUSE>没有问题
<3-11,HOUSE>there isn't something going on.

83
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,330
<3-11,HOUSE>可能对每个人的影响都不一样
<3-11,HOUSE>It could just affect everyone differently.

84
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,580
<3-12,CHASE>你认为这家伙有海湾战争综合症?
<3-12,CHASE>You think this guy has gulf war syndrome?

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,810
<3-13,HOUSE>当然不是
<3-13,HOUSE>'Course not.

86
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,320
<3-13,HOUSE>他很抑郁 他想得到残疾证明
<3-13,HOUSE>He's depressed, and he's looking for a disability check.

87
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,460
<3-13,HOUSE>最可能的情况是因为他明白了
<3-13,HOUSE>Most likely because he's just realized that knowing

88
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,460
<3-13,HOUSE>能用六种语言求爱和用眼窝开啤酒
<3-13,HOUSE>how to barter for sex in six languages and open a beer bottle

89

<3-13,HOUSE>算不上什么可炫耀的本事
<3-13,HOUSE>with your eye socket are not the most marketable skillS.

90
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,500
<3-14,FOREMAN>你为什么接这件病例?
<3-14,FOREMAN>why'd you take this ca?

91
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,530
<3-15,HOUSE>因为一个优秀的科学家不断地自疑
<3-15,HOUSE>Because a good scientist continually questions his own theories and assumptions.

92
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,870
<3-16,CAMERON>Cuddy逼他的
<3-16,CAMERON>Cuddy's maki him.

<3-17,HOUSE>every city he's ever lived in, and...whether he's ever been on tv.

99
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,880
<3-18,CAMERON>上电视?
<3-18,CAMERON>Tv?

100
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,950
<3-19,HOUSE>可能是神经学上的问题
<3-19,HOUSE>Problem could be nrological.

<4-1,JOHN>It's usually the worst on my palms and the bottoms of my feet.

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,010
<4-1,JOHN>到处长满黑点
<4-1,JOHN>I get these black dots all over.

104

<4-5,JOHN>我知道皮疹和乌青的区别
<4-5,JOHN>I know the difference between a rash and a bruise.

108
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,970
<4-6,CAMERON>有时候那要比你想象的难辨别
<4-6,CAMERON>sometimes it's harder than you realize to distinguish between the two.

109
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,450
<4-6,CAMERON>很明显你健身
<4-6,CAMERON>You obviously exercise.

110
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,180
<4-7,JOHN>我的问题不是健身引起的
<4-7,JOHN>My problems aren't caused by my workouts.

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,550
<4-8,FOREMAN>但你的确健身 从你的样子看来,练得还很勤
<4-8,FOREMAN>But you do work out, and by the look of you, pretty strenuously.

112
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,660
<4-8,FOREMAN>通常那样的人是不会
<4-8,FOREMAN>That's not usually the case with patients

113
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,210
<4-8,FOREMAN>抱怨慢性疲劳和关节疼痛的
<4-8,FOREMAN>whose principal complaint is chronic fatigue and joint pain.

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,770
<4-9,JOHN>我在海军陆战队服役12年
<4-9,JOHN>I was in the marines for 12 years.

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,990
<4-9,JOHN>我已经习惯每天健身
<4-9,JOHN>I'm used to doing pt every day.

116
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,740
<4-9,JOHN>我能忍受疼痛 不代表我不疼
<4-9,JOHN>Just because I can push through the pain doesn't mean it's not there.

117
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,650
<4-10,CHASE>听着 我们不是不相信你
<4-10,CHASE>listen, we're not saying we don't believe you.

118
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,160
<4-11,JOHN>幸亏不是如此
<4-11,JOHN>The hell you aren'T.

119
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,880
<4-12,CHASE>只是要查清楚具体问题
<4-12,CHASE>We just need to be specific about what exactly the problems are.

120
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,250
<4-13,JOHN>我每晚睡十个小时 但还是一直觉得累
<4-13,JOHN>I sleep ten hours a night, but I feel tired all the time.

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,340
<4-13,JOHN>我不断咳嗽 长皮疹 喉咙痛
<4-13,JOHN>I constantly get coughs, rashes, sore throats.

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,610
<4-13,JOHN>我膝盖和臀部关节疼得像有人往里灌沙
<4-13,JOHN>My knees and hips feel like someone poured sand in my joints.

123
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,860
<4-13,JOHN>我腿上有奇怪的麻刺感
<4-13,JOHN>I get these weird tingling sensations in my legs.

124
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
<4-13,JOHN>有时候 会发冷
<4-13,JOHN>Sometimes, they're cold.

125
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,840
<4-13,JOHN>有时候 又似乎血液都在沸腾
<4-13,JOHN>Other times, feels like my blood is boiling.

126
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,420
<4-13,JOHN>够具体了吗?
<4-13,JOHN>Specific enough?

127
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,100
<4-13,JOHN>看着 我不管你们叫它什么...
<4-13,JOHN>Look, I don't care what you guys call it--

128
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,160
<4-13,JOHN>海湾战争综合症 伊拉克热,还是干脆未知怪病一号
<4-13,JOHN>gulf war syndrome, iraq fever, or just crappy sickness X.

129
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,830
<4-13,JOHN>我只想有人能找出问题来,然后治好它
<4-13,JOHN>I just want someoneto figure out what it is so they can cure it.

130
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,310
<5-1,CAMERON>除了关节处的假象疼痛
<5-1,CAMERON>Except for the supposed pain in his joints,

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,980
<5-1,CAMERON>剩余症状没有一个目前是明显的
<5-1,CAMERON>none of the other symptoms he's complaining about are currently evident.

132
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,110
<5-2,FOREMAN>除了他健身后饮水过多 造成缺钾
<5-2,FOREMAN>Besides low potassium probably caused by him over hydrating after working out,

133
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,450
<5-2,FOREMAN>他的血液检查都正常
<5-2,FOREMAN>his blood work's all normal.

134
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,060
<5-3,CHASE>缺钾也肯可能是他被派往伊拉克前
<5-3,CHASE>Low potassium could also probably be caused by the experiments or vaccines in

135
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,810
<5-3,CHASE>注射的抗生化武器疫苗导致的
<5-3,CHASE>anti-chemical warfare pills he was given before he deployed to iraq.

136
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,720
<5-3,CHASE>更不用提那国家遍地都是
<5-3,CHASE>Not to mention the fact that whole country's littered with

137
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,520
<5-3,CHASE>上百吨的放射性贫铀弹碎片
<5-3,CHASE>hundreds of tons of radioactive shrapnel from depleted uranium munitions.

138
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,970
<5-4,FOREMAN>你在法国上的医学院?

140
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,800
<5-4,FOREMAN>而且他在两年前注射疫苗
<5-4,FOREMAN>And he was given the vaccines and meds two years ago

141
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,450
<5-4,FOREMAN>而且没有过敏或者副作用
<5-4,FOREMAN>without any allergic or adverse reaction.

142
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,620
<5-5,HOUSE>他当过模特吗?
<5-5,HOUSE>Has he ever done any modeling?

143
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,460
<5-6,CHASE>我们忘了问
<5-6,CHASE>We forgot to ask.

144
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,460
<5-6,CHASE>应该把他的尿液送到列斯特大学去
<5-6,CHASE>We should send his urine to the university of leicester.

145
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,750
<5-6,CHASE>那里有位教授开发了,更精确的铀检测技术
<5-6,CHASE>There's a professor there who's developed,a more advanced screening technique for uranium.

146
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,810
<5-7,FOREMAN>如果含量低到我们检测不到的话
<5-7,FOREMAN>If the levels are too low for us to detect,

147
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,210
<5-7,FOREMAN>那么也不会造成什么伤害
<5-7,FOREMAN>they're way too low to cause any damage.

148
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,820
<5-7,FOREMAN>你去哪里?
<5-7,FOREMAN>Where you goin'?

149

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,030
<5-8,HOUSE>你们有发现关于他上电视,或者其他媒体的情况吗?
<5-8,HOUSE>Did you find out about any television or other media exposure?

151
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,350
<5-9,CAMERON>你真的在意 还是你想浪费医院资源
<5-9,CAMERON>do you really care? Or are you just trying to waste hospital resources

152
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,720
<5-9,CAMERON>来报复Cuddy逼你接这个病例?
<5-9,CAMERON>to get back at cuddy for making you take the case?

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,420
<5-10,HOUSE>我当然在意
<5-10,HOUSE>Of course I care.

154
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,620
<5-10,HOUSE>这么说太没良心了
<5-10,HOUSE>What a horrible thing to say.

155
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,380
<5-10,HOUSE>上lexisnexis数据库搜索一下,找一份他的信用记录
<5-10,HOUSE>Do a lexisnexis search.Get a copy of his credit report.

156
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,480
<5-11,FOREMAN>在给他吃根香蕉 (补充钾),让他出院转去看心理医生 之前或之后?
<5-11,FOREMAN>Before or after we tell him to eat a banana and discharge him with a psych referral?

157
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,650
<5-12,HOUSE>我说之前
<5-12,HOUSE>I say before.

158
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,550
<5-12,HOUSE>在两者之间 给他做个多导睡眠图
<5-12,HOUSE>And I say in-between,give him a polysomnogram.

159
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,980
<5-12,HOUSE>睡眠呼吸暂停症会导致慢性疲劳和妄想症
<5-12,HOUSE>Sleep apnea can cause chronic fatigue and paranoia.

160
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,750
<5-12,HOUSE>找找他去哪儿夏令营
<5-12,HOUSE>Find out where he went to summer camp.

161
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,960
<5-13,CAMERON>你没事吧?
<5-13,CAMERON>Are you okay?

162
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,450
<5-14,HOUSE>没事 早上咖啡喝太多了
<5-14,HOUSE>Yeah, it's just a little too much coffee this morning.

163
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,580
<5-15,CAMERON>我们刚才...是送你去厕所吗?
<5-15,CAMERON>Were we...walking you to the bathroom?

164
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,690
<5-16,HOUSE>希望如此
<5-16,HOUSE>I wish.

165
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,990
<5-16,HOUSE>Wilson刚才在里面
<5-16,HOUSE>Wilson was just in there.

<5-16,HOUSE>These guys know what I'm talking about.

167
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,140
<6-1,CAMERON>那是他第三轮快速眼动了 他的呼吸完全正常
<6-1,CAMERON>that's his third rem cycle, and his breathing's completely normal.

168
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,330
<6-1,CAMERON>他的睡眠没有任何问题
<6-1,CAMERON>There's obviously nothing wrong with his sleep pattern.

169
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,200
<6-2,CHASE>不过不是铀 那就肯定是其它某种毒素
<6-2,CHASE>if it's not uranium, it's gotta be some other sort of toxin.

170
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,620
<6-3,CAMERON>或者根本没毛病
<6-3,CAMERON>Or nothing at all.

171
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,060
<6-3,CAMERON>你是真希望他有问题,还是只希望Foreman是错的?
<6-3,CAMERON>You really thinkthere's something wrong,,or do you just want foreman to be wrong?

172
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,460
<6-4,CHASE>都是
<6-4,CHASE>Both.

173
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,990
<6-5,CAMERON>好吧 不是他的睡眠问题
<6-5,CAMERON>Well, it's not his sleep pattern.

174
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,090
<6-5,CAMERON>如果你真认为是毒素 明早做个肝脏活检
<6-5,CAMERON>If you really think it's a toxin, you can do a liver biopsy in the morning.

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,500
<6-6,CHASE>我们不能走
<6-6,CHASE>We can't leave.

176
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,310
<6-6,CHASE>如果不监控整个过程,House不会接受出来的结果
<6-6,CHASE>If we don't monitor the whole test, house won't accept the results.

177
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,450
<6-6,CHASE>他就会让我们重做一遍
<6-6,CHASE>He'll just make us do it over.

178
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,720
<6-7,CAMERON>完全正常的多导睡眠图,不需要两个医生来监控
<6-7,CAMERON>It doesn't take two doctors to monitor,what's clearly gonna bea normal polysomnogram.

179
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,180
<6-8,CHASE>哦 那你是想让我留守?
<6-8,CHASE>Oh, so you want me to stay?

180
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,680
<6-9,CAMERON>是你觉得有问题的啊
<6-9,CAMERON>You're the one who thought there was something wrong.

181
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,640
<6-10,CHASE>我从没说过是睡眠失调
<6-10,CHASE>I never said it wasa sleep disorder.

182
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,480
<6-11,CAMERON>你要掷硬币决定?
<6-11,CAMERON>You wanna flip for it?

183
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,960
<6-12,CHASE>走吧走吧
<6-12,CHASE>Just go.

184
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,830
<6-12,CHASE>哦 拜托
<6-12,CHASE>Oh, come on.

185
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,380
<6-13,CAMERON>别闹小孩子脾气
<6-13,CAMERON>Don't be a baby.

186
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,360
<6-13,CAMERON>好吧 我也留下
<6-13,CAMERON>Fine. I'll stay.

187
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,830
<6-13,CAMERON>你知道我们可以做点什么
<6-13,CAMERON>You know what we could do.

188
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,990
<6-15,CAMERON>- 这里?,- 为什么不行?
<6-15,CAMERON>- Here?,- Why not?

189
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,270
<6-15,CAMERON>周围都是有床的空房间
<6-15,CAMERON>We're surrounded by empty rooms with beds in them.

190
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,680
<6-16,CHASE>是啊 还有摄像头呢
<6-16,CHASE>Yeah, and video cameras too.

191
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,460
<6-17,CAMERON>关掉就行
<6-17,CAMERON>So we turn 'em off.

192
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,480
<6-18,CHASE>就怕House或者Foreman进来看见我们
<6-18,CHASE>That's all I need is house or foreman walking in on us.

193
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,920
<6-19,CAMERON>钥匙在我们这儿
<6-19,CAMERON>We have the keys.

<6-19,CAMERON>No.

195
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,630
<6-20,CHASE>他醒过来怎么办?
<6-20,CHASE>What if he wakes up?

196
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,990
<6-20,CHASE>好吧
<6-20,CHASE>All right.

197
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,950
<6-21,CAMERON>随你便
<6-21,CAMERON>Suit yourself.

198

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,750
<9-1,HOUSE>怎么?
<9-1,HOUSE>What?

212
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,390
<9-2,CHASE>你关于"没有毛病"的判断是错的
<9-2,CHASE>you were wrong about the "nothing's wrongatosis.

213
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,230
<9-2,CHASE>你可以假装疲劳和关节疼痛
<9-2,CHASE>" You can fake fatigue and joint paint,

214
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,180
<9-2,CHASE>但是你装不了嘴里的细菌性阴道炎
<9-2,CHASE>but you can't fake bacterial vaginosis in your mouth.

215
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,960
<9-3,HOUSE>他的嘴都碰过哪儿?
<9-3,HOUSE>where's his mouth been?

<9-4,CAMERON>他说一年多没给别人口交过了
<9-4,CAMERON>Says he hasn't performed oral sex on anyone in over a year.

<9-5,HOUSE>Selfish bastard.

218
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,870
<9-6,FOREMAN>再没有和别人在一起,自从女朋友甩了他
<9-6,FOREMAN>Because he hasn't been with anyone since his last girlfriend dumped him

219
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,910
<9-6,FOREMAN>因为他第二次被派往伊拉克
<9-6,FOREMAN>and after he deployed to iraq the second time.

220
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,940
<9-7,HOUSE>自私的娘们!
<9-7,HOUSE>Selfish bitch!

<9-8,CHASE>可以排除艾滋病 糖尿病等所有内分泌失调疾病
<9-8,CHASE>We've ruled out hiv, diabetes, and any other endocrine abnormality.

222
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,030
<9-9,CAMERON>可能是自身免疫 干燥症减少唾液分泌
<9-9,CAMERON>Could be autoimmune; sjoegren's decreases salivary flow,

<9-9,CAMERON>creates a hospitable home for bacteria.

224
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,690
<9-10,CHASE>不是 他眼睛和输泪管都正常
<9-10,CHASE>No, his eyes and tear ducts are fine.

225
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,760
<9-11,HOUSE>他上一个女朋友是谁?
<9-11,HOUSE>Who was his last girlfriend?

226
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,140
<9-12,FOREMAN>我们会...马上去查的
<9-12,FOREMAN>yeah, we'll...get right on that.

227
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,630
<9-12,FOREMAN>慢性疲劳 关节疼痛,以及机会性感染说明是癌症
<9-12,FOREMAN>Chronic fatigue, joint pain, and opportunistic infection spells cancer.

228
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,020
<9-12,FOREMAN>可能是淋巴癌
<9-12,FOREMAN>Probably lymphoma.

229
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,240
<9-12,FOREMAN>我们应该活检他的扁桃体和下颌下淋巴结
<9-12,FOREMAN>We should biopsy his tonsillar and submandibular lymph nodes.

230
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,540
<9-13,HOUSE>是癌症
<9-13,HOUSE>Right about cancer.

231
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,280
<9-13,HOUSE>但不是淋巴癌
<9-13,HOUSE>Wrong about lymphoma.

232
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,070
<9-13,HOUSE>除非他的淋巴结是浮肿的
<9-13,HOUSE>Unless you're simply hiding the fact that his lymph nodes are swollen.

233
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,460
<9-13,HOUSE>让Wilson活检他的唾液腺
<9-13,HOUSE>Get wilson to biopsy his salivary glands.

234
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,210
<9-13,HOUSE>他有腮腺癌
<9-13,HOUSE>He's got parotid cancer.

235
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,630
<9-13,HOUSE>然后查出他到底泡过谁
<9-13,HOUSE>And see if you can get to the truth about who he's been dating.

236
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,310
<9-13,HOUSE>海军陆战队员不可能一整年"兵不刃血"
<9-13,HOUSE>No way a marine goes a year without getting some blood on his bayonet.

237
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,800
<9-14,CHASE>不是性病
<9-14,CHASE>It's not an std.

238
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,750
<9-15,HOUSE>- 你刚说...,- 做就是了
<9-15,HOUSE>- You just said-,- just do it.

239
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,540
<10-1,WILSON>抗生素至少能减轻感染
<10-1,WILSON>the antibiotics should at least relieve the infection,

240
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,990
<10-1,WILSON>也能减少你嘴里的味道
<10-1,WILSON>also reduce the odor and taste in your mouth.

241
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,410
<10-2,JOHN>不够快
<10-2,JOHN>Not soon enough.

242
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,400
<10-2,JOHN>好吧
<10-2,JOHN>All right.

243
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,640
<10-3,WILSON>你会有点灼痛感
<10-3,WILSON>You're gonna feel a little burn.

244
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,210
<10-4,JOHN>要知道 我从来没沾过
<10-4,JOHN>You know,I never even dipped.

245
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,110
<10-4,JOHN>嚼烟草 我们那里除我之外每个人都嚼
<10-4,JOHN>Chewing tobacco. Practically everyone in my unit did but me.

246
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,790
<10-4,JOHN>我很惧怕癌症
<10-4,JOHN>I was so paranoid about cancer.

247
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,270
<10-5,WILSON>如果是腮腺癌,早期诊断出来 还是可以治愈的
<10-5,WILSON>Well, if it's parotid cancer, it's very treatable if diagnosed early.

248
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,000
<10-6,JOHN>我妈妈得癌症
<10-6,JOHN>My mom had cancer.

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,100
<10-6,JOHN>所以我知道早期诊断,是指在有严重症状之前
<10-6,JOHN>Which is why I know that diagnosing cancer early means,before there's any serious symptoms.

250
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,310
<10-6,JOHN>这尝起来绝对像严重的症状
<10-6,JOHN>Certainly tastes like a pretty serious symptom, you know?

251
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,510
<10-7,WILSON>检查之后会知道更多
<10-7,WILSON>We'll know more after the test.

252
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,540
<11-1,CAMERON>如果他是想浪费时间来和Cuddy捣乱
<11-1,CAMERON>if he was just trying to mess with cuddy for wasting his time,

253
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,520
<11-1,CAMERON>那从病人显现症状开始就该停了
<11-1,CAMERON>this would have stopped as soon as the patient started exhibiting actual symptoms.

254
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,980
<11-2,CHASE>问题是 为什么他要浪费时间?
<11-2,CHASE>So the question is, why is he wasting our time?

255
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,630
<11-3,CAMERON>或者他是在浪费时间吗?
<11-3,CAMERON>Or is he wasting our time?

256
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,820
<11-4,CHASE>你觉得他要这家伙的信用记录,有医学上的理由吗?
<11-4,CHASE>You think he's got a medical reason for asking for the guy's credit report?

257
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,590
<11-4,CHASE>我不觉得
<11-4,CHASE>I don'T.

258
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,050
<11-5,FOREMAN>那家伙醒来的时候你们俩去哪儿了?
<11-5,FOREMAN>Where were you twowhen the guy woke up?

259
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,320
<11-6,CHASE>呃 我们只是...出去一会儿
<11-6,CHASE>Uh, we just-- stepped out for a second.

260
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,090
<11-7,FOREMAN>去干吗?
<11-7,FOREMAN>To do what?

261
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,720
<11-8,CHASE>去...冲咖啡
<11-8,CHASE>To...get a coffee.

262
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,240
<11-8,CHASE>我们熬了一整晚
<11-8,CHASE>We'd been up most of the night.

263
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,260
<11-9,CAMERON>他只是要确认我们有完整记录
<11-9,CAMERON>He's just pushing to make sure we have a complete history.

264
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,570
<11-9,CAMERON>若不就是我们漏了什么,应该已经有答案
<11-9,CAMERON>Obviously, we're missing something, or we'd have the answer.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
<11-10,FOREMAN>你回来的时候手上没咖啡
<11-10,FOREMAN>You didn't have any coffee when you came back.

266
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,710
<11-10,FOREMAN>好吧好吧
<11-10,FOREMAN>All right, already.

267
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,810
<11-11,CAMERON>我们承认 被你发现了
<11-11,CAMERON>We confess, you caught us.

268
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,760
<11-11,CAMERON>我们溜到一个实验房间里去做爱了
<11-11,CAMERON>We snuck into one of the sleep lab rooms to have sex.

269
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
<11-11,CAMERON>不该在工作时做那样的事 我们很抱歉
<11-11,CAMERON>We shouldn't have done it while we were supposed to be working, and we're sorry.

270
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,650
<11-11,CAMERON>可以继续了吗?
<11-11,CAMERON>Now can we move on?

271
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,730
<11-12,FOREMAN>在你干Chase之前 House会干Wilson
<11-12,FOREMAN>House'll do wilson before you do chase.

272
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,190
<11-13,CAMERON>不 在我上Chase之前,你会上了House以及Wilson
<11-13,CAMERON>No, you would do house and wilson before i do chase.

273
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,220
<11-13,CAMERON>可以回到工作来了吗?
<11-13,CAMERON>Now can we get back to work?

274
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,450
<11-14,CHASE>她有上过我的
<11-14,CHASE>She did me once.

275
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,480
<11-15,FOREMAN>她那时磕药了!
<11-15,FOREMAN>She was stoned!

276
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,000
<12-1,WILSON>活检不是决定性的
<12-1,WILSON>Biopsy's inconclusive.

277
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,220
<12-1,WILSON>在附加血检结果出来之前,我会做个涎管X线片
<12-1,WILSON>I'm gonna do a sialogram while we wait for the results,from the additional blood work.

278
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,340
<12-2,HOUSE>不用急
<12-2,HOUSE>No hurry.

279
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,150
<12-2,HOUSE>也许到了这个境况 我们什么也做不了
<12-2,HOUSE>Probably nothing we can do at this point anyway.

280
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,730
<12-3,WILSON>只要癌细胞没有扩散
<12-3,WILSON>As long as the cancer hasn't spread.

281
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,620
<12-4,HOUSE>他的口水都是臭的
<12-4,HOUSE>He's spitting stink.

282
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,390
<12-4,HOUSE>你应该多关注下活人
<12-4,HOUSE>You should focus on the living.

283
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,880
<12-4,HOUSE>我需要一张处方
<12-4,HOUSE>I need a prescription.

284
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,290
<12-5,WILSON>我刚给你写过处方
<12-5,WILSON>I just wrote you a prescription.

285
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,380
<12-6,HOUSE>那是维克丁的
<12-6,HOUSE>For vicodin.

286
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,200
<12-6,HOUSE>我需要阿呋唑嗪(治疗前列腺增生)
<12-6,HOUSE>I need alfuzosin.

287
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,060
<12-7,WILSON>不 你不需要
<12-7,WILSON>No, you don'T.

288
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,290
<12-7,WILSON>你想出来 在哪里碰到海军陆战队员了吗?
<12-7,WILSON>Have you figured out where you met your marine?

289
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,300
<12-7,WILSON>什么?
<12-7,WILSON>What?

290
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,080
<12-8,HOUSE>哦 那个
<12-8,HOUSE>Oh, that.

291
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,770
<12-8,HOUSE>没怎么想
<12-8,HOUSE>Haven't really thought about it.

292
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,140
<12-10,HOUSE>我尿不出来
<12-10,HOUSE>I can't pee.

293
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,690
<12-9,WILSON>你记不住他 对吧?
<12-9,WILSON>You can't remember him, can you?

294
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,090
<12-10,HOUSE>我尿不出来
<12-10,HOUSE>I can't pee.

295
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,940
<12-11,WILSON>那就别吃维克丁了
<12-11,WILSON>So stop taking the vicodin.

296
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,200
<12-12,HOUSE>我既想尿尿又不想疼痛
<12-12,HOUSE>I wanna pee and not be in pain.

297
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,010
<12-13,WILSON>你为什么不去睡觉?
<12-13,WILSON>Why don't you go to sleep?

298
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,270
<12-14,HOUSE>我睡觉的时候不会尿尿
<12-14,HOUSE>I don't pee when I'm asleep.

299
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,640
<12-15,WILSON>也许他会再度进入你梦乡 给你个地址
<12-15,WILSON>Maybe you'll dream about him again. Maybe he'll give you an address.

300
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,980
<12-16,HOUSE>我已经三天没撒尿了
<12-16,HOUSE>I haven't peed in three days.

301
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,020
<12-17,WILSON>我读到过 大脑在快速眼动期解决问题
<12-17,WILSON>I read that rem sleep is the brain's way of working out problems.

302
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,040
<12-18,HOUSE>受益匪浅
<12-18,HOUSE>Very useful.

303
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,850
<12-18,HOUSE>听到我说的话了吗?
<12-18,HOUSE>Did you hear what I just said?

304
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,210
<12-19,WILSON>是的 你撒谎,为了避免谈及你着魔了
<12-19,WILSON>Yeah, you lied because you want to avoid talking about your obsession.

305
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,460
<12-20,HOUSE>我没有着魔
<12-20,HOUSE>I'm not obsessing.

306
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,880
<12-21,WILSON>为什么不直接问他呢?
<12-21,WILSON>Why don't you just ask him?

307
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,610
<12-22,HOUSE>我三天没撒尿了!
<12-22,HOUSE>I haven't peed in three days!

308
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
<12-23,WILSON>那你都死了
<12-23,WILSON>You'd be dead.

309
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,600
<12-24,HOUSE>我没算间歇性滴出来的尿液
<12-24,HOUSE>I'm not counting intermittent drips.

310
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,020
<12-25,WILSON>你会痛苦不堪
<12-25,WILSON>You'd be in agony.

311
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,960
<12-26,HOUSE>昨天4点前后我已经痛苦不堪过了
<12-26,HOUSE>I passed agony yesterday around 4:00.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,810
<13-1,FOREMAN>他的母亲 兄弟 叔父和密友都确认
<13-1,FOREMAN>His mother, brother, uncle, and best friend all confirm

313
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,010
<13-1,FOREMAN>他一年多没约会了
<13-1,FOREMAN>he hasn't had a date in over a year.

314
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,950
<13-1,FOREMAN>说明这不是性病
<13-1,FOREMAN>Which means it's not an std.

315
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,880
<13-1,FOREMAN>如果发现跟医学有关的问题 传呼我
<13-1,FOREMAN>If you come up with something medically relevant, page me.

316
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,800
<13-2,CAMERON>你让我怎么跟他说呢 实话实说?
<13-2,CAMERON>What did you want me to tell him, the truth?

317
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,480
<13-3,CHASE>不 也犯不着让他信服
<13-3,CHASE>No.You didn't haveto be so convincing.

318
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,410
<13-4,CAMERON>别担心 我会补偿给你的
<13-4,CAMERON>Don't worry.I'll make it up to you.

319
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,650
<13-5,CHASE>这事已经控制不住了
<13-5,CHASE>This is getting out of control.

320
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,260
<13-6,CAMERON>别板着脸
<13-6,CAMERON>Don't pout.

321
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,450
<13-7,CHASE>病人受到感染醒来时,我们正在翻云覆雨
<13-7,CHASE>Our patient woke up with an infection while we were getting our rocks off.

322
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,010
<13-8,CAMERON>你想停下吗?
<13-8,CAMERON>Do you want to stop?

323
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,280
<13-8,CAMERON>不
<13-8,CAMERON>No.

324
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,010
<13-9,CHASE>但我不想被人抓到
<13-9,CHASE>But, uh, I don't want to get caught either.

325
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,380
<13-10,CAMERON>你以为我想?
<13-10,CAMERON>You think I do?

326
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,170
<13-11,CHASE>在睡眠研究实验室里,你明显是故意不肯压低嗓门
<13-11,CHASE>You certainly didn't go out of your way to keep the volume down,when we were in the sleep lab.

327
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,770
<13-12,CAMERON>我控制不住
<13-12,CAMERON>I couldn't help that.

328
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,580
<13-12,CAMERON>我为什么希望被人抓到呢?
<13-12,CAMERON>Why would i wanna get caught?

329
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,650
<13-13,CHASE>也许想引起House的醋意
<13-13,CHASE>Maybe you wanna give house a reason to be jealous.

330
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,020
<13-14,CAMERON>我对House没感觉了
<13-14,CAMERON>I'm over house.

331
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,680
<13-14,CAMERON>这不过是简单的性
<13-14,CAMERON>All this is is uncomplicated sex.

332
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,500
<13-14,CAMERON>别小题大做
<13-14,CAMERON>Don't try to make it more than that.

333
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,130
<13-15,CHASE>我再不会在工作时偷欢了
<13-15,CHASE>I'm not doing it at work anymore.

334
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,740
<13-15,CHASE>很好
<13-15,CHASE>Fine.

335
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,970
<13-16,CAMERON>去吃午饭吗?
<13-16,CAMERON>Wanna go grab some lunch?

336
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,560
<14-1,WOMAN>我认为口服避孕药应该是上策

384
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,450
<16-3,WILSON>如果药没起效 也许你得使用导尿管
<16-3,WILSON>If the pills didn't work, you may need a catheter.

385
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,820
<16-4,HOUSE>你来不是为了跟我谈我的尿
<16-4,HOUSE>You didn't come here to talk to me about my pee.

386
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,870
<16-4,HOUSE>发生什么事了?
<16-4,HOUSE>What's going on?

387
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,000
<16-5,WILSON>好吧 他得了癌
<16-5,WILSON>He's got cancer, all right.

388
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,970
<16-5,WILSON>但不在他的唾腺里
<16-5,WILSON>But it's not in his salivary glands.

389
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,040
<16-5,WILSON>而是在他大脑里
<16-5,WILSON>It's in his brain.

390
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,540
<16-5,WILSON>情况很糟
<16-5,WILSON>And it's bad.

391
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,360
<16-5,WILSON>至少有六个瘤 也许更多
<16-5,WILSON>At least six tumors, maybe more.

392
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,000
<16-5,WILSON>他丧失了听力
<16-5,WILSON>He lost his hearing.

393
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,580
<16-5,WILSON>很可能下一步就是丧失视力
<16-5,WILSON>His sight's probably next.

394
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,150
<16-6,HOUSE>死亡多半紧随其后
<16-6,HOUSE>Death is probably next.

395
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,320
<17-1,HOUSE>他不可能一星期就长出这么多瘤
<17-1,HOUSE>no way he could have grown all these in a week.

396
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,270
<17-1,HOUSE>就是新长的
<17-1,HOUSE>they can't be older.

397
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,130
<17-2,FOREMAN>退伍军人医院不可能一点没查出来
<17-2,FOREMAN>The va couldn't have missed all these.

398
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,670
<17-3,WILSON>也许不是没查出来 而是搞混淆了
<17-3,WILSON>Maybe they didn't miss them, just mixed 'em up.

399
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,650
<17-3,WILSON>将他的片子跟其他病人的搞混了
<17-3,WILSON>Switched his films with another patient's by mistake.

400
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,350
<17-4,HOUSE>也许 意味着某个可怜的傻瓜,在退伍军人医院 脑瓜被平白无故切开
<17-4,HOUSE>Maybe. But it means some poor sap's getting,his melon sliced at the va for no reason.

401
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,440
<17-5,WILSON>而这个可怜的中士周末就会死
<17-5,WILSON>And this poor sergeant's gonna be dead by the end of the week.

<17-11,CHASE>Where he's lived, who he's dated.

410
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,050
<17-11,CHASE>除了忘记提他父亲有过胫骨骨裂
<17-11,CHASE>Besides forgetting to mention his dad's shin splits,

<17-12,WILSON>你让他们对你的梦进行调查?
<17-12,WILSON>You have them researching your dream?

<17-14,CAMERON>你梦见了病人?
<17-14,CAMERON>You had a dream about a patient?

416

<17-15,WILSON>this poor guy's brain is riddled with tumors,,and you're checking his credit report?

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,570
<17-18,HOUSE>他不是你的病人
<17-18,HOUSE>He's not your patient.

421

422
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,320
<17-19,WILSON>也许你会梦见治疗晚期脑癌的灵丹妙药
<17-19,WILSON>Maybe you'll dream the cure to late-stage brain cancer.

423
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,900
<18-1,CUDDY>他怎么样?
<18-1,CUDDY>How is he?

427
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,690
<18-4,HOUSE>问题是为什么?
<18-4,HOUSE>The question is why?

428
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,840
<18-4,HOUSE>唯一的解释是退伍军人医院搞砸了
<18-4,HOUSE>The only explanation is that the va hospital screwed up.

429
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,870
<18-5,CUDDY>绝对没有搞混 我让他们重新检查过
<18-5,CUDDY>There was definitely no mix-up. I had them recheck.

430
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,040
<18-6,HOUSE>是啊 政府机构又何须撒谎,掩盖致命误诊?
<18-6,HOUSE>Yes. Why would a government agency lie to cover up a mistake that might have

431
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,400
<18-6,HOUSE>反正在过去两年就想要他的命了
<18-6,HOUSE>caused the death of a guy they'd been trying to kill for the last two years anyway?

432
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,490
<18-7,CUDDY>他们没撒谎
<18-7,CUDDY>They didn't lie.

433
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,440
<18-7,CUDDY>你刚吞了两片维柯丁?
<18-7,CUDDY>Did you just take two vicodin?

434
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,810
<18-8,HOUSE>没有 这是抗抑郁药
<18-8,HOUSE>No.It was an antidepressant.

435
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,630
<18-8,HOUSE>我一见到你进屋 就得服两片
<18-8,HOUSE>I was told to take two every time you walked into the room.

436
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,680
<18-9,CUDDY>退伍军人医院对他做的大脑扫描图
<18-9,CUDDY>The va scan of his brain.

437
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,580
<18-9,CUDDY>没有肿瘤
<18-9,CUDDY>No tumors.

438
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,490
<18-10,HOUSE>是的 这显然证明某人脑袋里没长瘤
<18-10,HOUSE>Yes, this is proof positive that someone didn't have tumors in their brain.

439
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,790
<18-11,CUDDY>看到他左眼眶下的亮点没?
<18-11,CUDDY>You see that bright spot below his left orbit?

440
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,450
<18-11,CUDDY>这是20年前植入你的病人体内的钛夾
<18-11,CUDDY>That is a titanium pin your patient had inserted 20 years ago.

441
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,250
<18-11,CUDDY>除非你相信退伍军人医院,不小心把扫描图跟另一个人的搞混了
<18-11,CUDDY>Unless you think the va happened to mix up his scans

442
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,340
<18-11,CUDDY>那个人有一模一样的钛夾,否则他们就没搞错
<18-11,CUDDY>with someone who had the exact same pin, they didn't screw up.

443
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,260
<19-1,CAMERON>你呼我们?
<19-1,CAMERON>You paged us?

444
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,870
<19-2,HOUSE>为什么不照我说的,把他的尿样送去莱斯特大学呢?
<19-2,HOUSE>Why didn't you send his urineto leicester like I told you?

445
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,220
<19-3,CHASE>因为你说了别送
<19-3,CHASE>Because you told me not to.

446
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,890
<19-4,HOUSE>为什么你偏挑那一刻听我的话?
<19-4,HOUSE>Why did you choose that moment to listen to me?

447
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,940
<19-5,CHASE>你觉得他的瘤跟贫铀有关?
<19-5,CHASE>You think depleted uranium might have something to do with his tumors?

448
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,370
<19-6,HOUSE>只有辐射才能让瘤长得那么快
<19-6,HOUSE>Radiation's the only thing that would make tumors grow that fast.

449
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,090
<19-7,CAMERON>大量的辐射
<19-7,CAMERON>High doses of radiation.

450
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,190
<19-7,CAMERON>即便他拿贫铀弹当早餐
<19-7,CAMERON>Even if he ate depleted uranium bullets for breakfast,

451
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,060
<19-7,CAMERON>他吸收的辐射也不如
<19-7,CAMERON>he still would have been exposed to less radiation than

452
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,470
<19-7,CAMERON>我们过去两天给他的多
<19-7,CAMERON>we've given him in the last two days.

453
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,120
<19-8,HOUSE>不管怎样 送去吧
<19-8,HOUSE>Do it anyway.

454
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,650
<19-8,HOUSE>你则去把他叔叔叫回来
<19-8,HOUSE>And you,call his uncle back.

455
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,520
<19-8,HOUSE>看他是否带他侄子去过,医院举办的晚会或筹款活动
<19-8,HOUSE>Find out if he ever brought his nephew to any hospital parties or fundraisers.

456
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,710
<19-9,CAMERON>不 除非你给我个理由
<19-9,CAMERON>No.Not until you give me a reason.

457
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,330
<19-10,HOUSE>因为...我是你老板
<19-10,HOUSE>Because...I'm your boss.

458
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,630
<19-11,CAMERON>合理的理由
<19-11,CAMERON>A rational reason.

459
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,770
<19-11,CAMERON>或至少承认你没理由
<19-11,CAMERON>Or at least admit that you don't have one.

460
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,070
<19-12,HOUSE>我的膀胱胀满了 我可不怕把这当理由
<19-12,HOUSE>I've got a full bladder, and I'm not afraid to use it.

461
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,060
<19-13,CAMERON>但显然你害怕发现,你无法合理解释的事
<19-13,CAMERON>But you are, apparently, afraid of discovering something,you can't rationally explain.

462
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,430
<19-14,HOUSE>闭嘴!
<19-14,HOUSE>Shut up!

463
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,750
<19-14,HOUSE>照吩咐的去做
<19-14,HOUSE>Do what you're told.

464
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,790
<19-14,HOUSE>Cuddy和Wilson也许不用听我的话,但你不听也得听
<19-14,HOUSE>Cuddy and wilson may not have to listen to me, but you do.

465
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,050
<19-15,CAMERON>这到底是怎么回事?
<19-15,CAMERON>What the hell was that all about?

466
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,150
<19-16,CHASE>我不在乎
<19-16,CHASE>I don't care.

467
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,170
<19-16,CHASE>也觉得没必要去问他八个私人问题
<19-16,CHASE>Which is why I didn't feel the need to ask him eight personal questions.

468
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,570
<19-17,CAMERON>我对他已经没感觉了
<19-17,CAMERON>I'm over him.

469
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,010
<19-18,CHASE>不过是在观察
<19-18,CHASE>Just making an observation.

470
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,010
<20-1,WILSON>好吧 时刻准备了
<20-1,WILSON>all right, ready whenever you are.

471
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,170
<20-2,FOREMAN>准备好了
<20-2,FOREMAN>I'm ready.

472
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,860
<20-2,FOREMAN>等等
<20-2,FOREMAN>Wait a minute.

473
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,950
<20-2,FOREMAN>放大
<20-2,FOREMAN>Zoom in.

474
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,990
<20-2,FOREMAN>我看不到 你肯定坐标没错?
<20-2,FOREMAN>I don't see it. You sure you got the right coordinates?

475
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,760
<20-3,WILSON>是的 位置正确
<20-3,WILSON>Yeah, she's in the right place.

476
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,390
<20-3,WILSON>Z轴上沿ac-pc线向上移10毫米
<20-3,WILSON>Go 10 millimeters above the ac-pc line on the z access.

477
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,310
<20-4,NURSE>Z轴往ac-pc线上移10毫米
<20-4,NURSE>ten mil above ac-pc on Z.

478
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,790
<20-5,FOREMAN>它不见了
<20-5,FOREMAN>It's not there anymore.

479
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,420
<20-6,WILSON>你肯定机架角设定得正确?
<20-6,WILSON>Are you sure you got the gantry angle right?

480
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,180
<20-7,NURSE>是的 我肯定
<20-7,NURSE>Yeah, I'm sure.

481
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,730
<20-8,FOREMAN>瘤不见了
<20-8,FOREMAN>It's not there.

482
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,370
<21-1,FOREMAN>消失了
<21-1,FOREMAN>It disappeared.

483
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,300
<21-2,CUDDY>六个瘤不会莫名其妙就消失
<21-2,CUDDY>Six tumors don't just disappear.

484
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,360
<21-3,HOUSE>除非本来就没有
<21-3,HOUSE>Unless they were never there to begin with.

485
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,080
<21-4,CUDDY>退伍军人医院没搞砸
<21-4,CUDDY>The va didn't screw up.

486
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,500
<21-5,HOUSE>也许是别人
<21-5,HOUSE>Maybe someone else did.

487
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,220
<21-5,HOUSE>也许是"自以为是"医生
<21-5,HOUSE>Maybe it was dr.Self-righteous.

488
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,930
<21-6,WILSON>我看到了瘤
<21-6,WILSON>I saw the tumors.

489
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,000
<21-6,WILSON>也没有搞混
<21-6,WILSON>There was no mix-up.

490
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,310
<21-7,CUDDY>也许是手术室的便携式光谱仪出问题了
<21-7,CUDDY>maybe there's something wrong with the portable imagerin the O.R.

491
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,010
<21-8,FOREMAN>让脑组织纤毫毕现
<21-8,FOREMAN>something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail

492
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,960
<21-8,FOREMAN>而对赘生性组织视若无物?
<21-8,FOREMAN>but completely miss neoplastic tissue?

493
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,840
<21-9,HOUSE>那么一开始就没有瘤
<21-9,HOUSE>Then they were never tumors to begin with.

494
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,240
<21-10,WILSON>我告诉你了 我看到...
<21-10,WILSON>I told you, I saw--

495
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,110
<21-11,HOUSE>我知道 你看到了形似瘤的物质
<21-11,HOUSE>I know, you saw something that looked like tumors.

496
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,610
<21-11,HOUSE>我们都看到了 我们看错了
<21-11,HOUSE>We all did. We were all wrong.

497
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,820
<21-11,HOUSE>也许他没得癌症
<21-11,HOUSE>Well, maybe he doesn't have cancer.

498
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,450
<21-11,HOUSE>也许是他的脑部感染引发了多发性脓疡
<21-11,HOUSE>Maybe he has a brain infection that's causing multiple abscesses.

499
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,880
<21-12,CUDDY>然后奇迹般的自愈了
<21-12,CUDDY>That miraculously healed.

500
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,450
<21-13,HOUSE>不 是被抗生素治好的,治他口腔细菌性阴道炎的
<21-13,HOUSE>No, they were healed by the antibiotics,we're giving him for the vaginosisin his mouth.

501
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,780
<21-14,CUDDY>要是感染的话 怎么血液检查没发现
<21-14,CUDDY>If it's an infection, why didn't it show up in his blood work?

502
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,600
<21-15,HOUSE>我也不知道 到现在为止
<21-15,HOUSE>I don't know. Yet.

503
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,360
<21-16,NURSE>Wilson医生 有麻烦了
<21-16,NURSE>Dr.Wilson, we have a problem.

504
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,250
<21-17,JOHN>你们都干什么了!
<21-17,JOHN>what did you do?!

505
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,540
<21-19,JOHN>我的腿没知觉了!
<21-19,JOHN>I can't feel my legs!

506
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,070
<21-19,JOHN>我的腿没知觉了!
<21-19,JOHN>I can't feel my legs!

507
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,850
<21-17,JOHN>你们做了什么?
<21-17,JOHN>What'd you guys do?

508
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,800
<21-18,WILSON>John 镇静点 我们还没做手术
<21-18,WILSON>John, calm down. We didn't even operate.

509
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,570
<21-18,WILSON>会不会是麻醉药的残余作用--
<21-18,WILSON>Could it be a residual effect of--

510
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,150
<21-19,JOHN>我的腿动不了了
<21-19,JOHN>I can't move my legs!

511
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,240
<21-20,NURSE>不是麻醉药的作用
<21-20,NURSE>it's not the anesthesia.

512
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,400
<21-21,HOUSE>John 我们会搞清楚你的病情
<21-21,HOUSE>John, john, we're gonna figure out what's wrong with you.

513
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,580
<21-21,HOUSE>首先要知道一件事--
<21-21,HOUSE>First we need to know one thing--

514
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,290
<21-21,HOUSE>你有没有拍过色情片?
<21-21,HOUSE>have you ever appeared in any pornos?

515
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,390
<22-1,HOUSE>慢性疲劳 喉咙痛,皮疹 散发恶臭的嘴
<22-1,HOUSE>Chronic Fatique, sore throats, rashes, putrid Discharge mouth

516
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:06,910
<22-1,HOUSE>脑部多处脓肿 听力丧失,最后很重要的一点 下肢瘫痪
<22-1,HOUSE>Mult abscesses in the brain, Hearing loss,lower limb paralysis.

517
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,710
<22-1,HOUSE>真是给了我们很多提示
<22-1,HOUSE>This certainly gives us plenty of clues

518
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,220
<22-2,CAMERON>可能是某种感染
<22-2,CAMERON>It could be sort of infection

519
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,600
<22-3,HOUSE>迅速改善大脑病情,却恶化了他的耳朵和腿?
<22-3,HOUSE>some improving his brain and getting worse his ears and legs.

520
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,850
<22-4,WILSON>可能是感染加癌症,新生瘤会抑制免疫系统 引发其他症状
<22-4,WILSON>Could be infection and cancer. the neoplastic syndrome could depress the immune system and cause the  other syptomes

521
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,880
<22-5,HOUSE>你的理论是基于生物活检的阴性结果?
<22-5,HOUSE>Mmm. You're basing your theory on negative biopsy and****world

522
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,740
<22-5,HOUSE>还有一开始就不存在的肿瘤
<22-5,HOUSE>Tumors never there to begin with

523
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,800
<22-6,WILSON>那你的理论难道基于他最喜欢的餐馆?
<22-6,WILSON>and what are you gonna base your theory on--his favorite restaurants?

524
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,350
<22-7,CHASE>被我说对了
<22-7,CHASE>I was right.

525
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,660
<22-7,CHASE>他正随尿排出废铀
<22-7,CHASE>He's excreting depleted uranium in his urine.

526
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,780
<22-7,CHASE>应该开始静脉注射等渗的碳酸氢钠
<22-7,CHASE>We should start him on an iv infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate.

527
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,650
<22-8,HOUSE>- 不是废铀,- 是你要求--
<22-8,HOUSE>- It's not depleted uranium.,- You're the one--

528
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,640
<22-10,HOUSE>是在我们考虑癌症时要求做这个检查,现在不考虑癌症了
<22-10,HOUSE>who asked for the test when we were thinking cancer. We no longer are.

529
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,080
<22-11,CHASE>废铀不仅会引起细胞变异
<22-11,CHASE>Depleted uranium doesn't just cause cells to mutate.

530
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,370
<22-11,CHASE>也能导致细胞死亡
<22-11,CHASE>It can cause cell death as well.

531
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,110
<22-12,HOUSE>不会导致脊髓细胞死亡
<22-12,HOUSE>Not spinal cord cells.

532
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,690
<22-12,HOUSE>除非剂量大到先杀死所有其它细胞
<22-12,HOUSE>At least, not until the dose is high enough to kill all his other cells first.

533
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,250
<22-13,FOREMAN>所以你的意思是尿中的放射性铀是无关的
<22-13,FOREMAN>So you're saying the radioactive uranium in his urine is irrelevant.

534
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,540
<22-13,FOREMAN>太阳是放射性的
<22-13,FOREMAN>The sun's radioactive.

535
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,580
<22-14,HOUSE>地球是放射性的
<22-14,HOUSE>The earth is radioactive.

536
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,890
<22-14,HOUSE>这个医院也充满了放射
<22-14,HOUSE>This hospital is filled with radiation.

537
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,760
<22-14,HOUSE>问题不在于哪里 而是多大剂量
<22-14,HOUSE>The issue is not where it is but how much there is and

538
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,300
<22-14,HOUSE>以及在某人的脊髓上能造成多大伤害
<22-14,HOUSE>what damage that amount could cause in someone's spinal cord.

539
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,460
<22-14,HOUSE>我已经清楚声明了---
<22-14,HOUSE>And as I already stated quite clearly--

540
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,860
<22-15,WILSON>明白了 我们都是傻瓜
<22-15,WILSON>got it. We're all idiots.

541
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,750
<22-15,WILSON>你的理论是什么?
<22-15,WILSON>What's your theory?

542
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,440
<22-16,HOUSE>- 给我你的钥匙,- 为什么?
<22-16,HOUSE>- Gimme your keys.,- Why?

543
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,010
<22-17,WILSON>你试过膀胱胀大还骑摩托车吗?
<22-17,WILSON>You ever tried riding a motorcycle with a distended bladder?

544
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,590
<22-18,HOUSE>继续用抗生素
<22-18,HOUSE>Keep him on antibiotics.

545
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,880
<22-18,HOUSE>每小时检查他的听力和瘫痪情况
<22-18,HOUSE>Check his hearing and paralysis every hour.

546
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,740
<22-19,FOREMAN>所以你想我们什么都不做
<22-19,FOREMAN>so you basically want us to do nothing.

547
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,540
<22-20,HOUSE>不 基本上 我想什么都不做
<22-20,HOUSE>No, I basically wanna do nothing.

548
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,600
<22-20,HOUSE>我要你们继续给他用抗生素,每小时检查听力和瘫痪情况
<22-20,HOUSE>I want you to keep him on antibiotics and check his hearing and paralysis every hour.

549
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,690
<22-21,WILSON>等一下 你不能现在回家
<22-21,WILSON>wait, you can't go home now.

550
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,780
<22-22,HOUSE>事实上 我现在得回家
<22-22,HOUSE>Actually, I have to go home now.

551
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,980
<22-22,HOUSE>我两天前就该睡了
<22-22,HOUSE>It's two days past my bedtime.

552
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,760
<22-23,WILSON>House 他需要你帮助
<22-23,WILSON>House, he needs your help.

553
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,290
<22-24,HOUSE>而我需要睡眠
<22-24,HOUSE>And I need sleep.

554
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,330
<22-24,HOUSE>这就是大脑解决难题的方法
<22-24,HOUSE>Hey, it's the brain's way of working out problems

555
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,050
<22-24,HOUSE>当头脑清醒时解决不了时 你说的
<22-24,HOUSE>that the conscious mind can't solve during the day, remember?

556
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,320
<22-24,HOUSE>现在呢?
<22-24,HOUSE>Now?

557
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,430
<23-1,JOHN>不 没感觉
<23-1,JOHN>No. Nothing.

558
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,460
<23-1,JOHN>我要死了 是吗?
<23-1,JOHN>I'm gonna die, aren't I?

559
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,370
<23-1,JOHN>我们正在竭尽所能
<23-1,JOHN>we're doing all we can.

560
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,040
<23-2,FOREMAN>不 我们没有
<23-2,FOREMAN>no, we're not.

561
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,830
<23-2,FOREMAN>我们应该采用你提议的铀中毒的治疗
<23-2,FOREMAN>We should start treatment for the uranium toxicity like you said.

562
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,620
<23-4,FOREMAN>但是House--不在这儿
<23-4,FOREMAN>But house--isn't here.

563
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,950
<23-5,CHASE>如果House想参与这个病例--
<23-5,CHASE>if house wanted to be involved in the case--

564
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,880
<23-6,CAMERON>如果他想用这种治疗方案
<23-6,CAMERON>If he wanted us to start this treatment,

565
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,040
<23-6,CAMERON>你上次提起时 他就会让我们用了
<23-6,CAMERON>he would have told us to do it the last time you brought it up.

566
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,320
<23-7,FOREMAN>你有更好的主意?
<23-7,FOREMAN>You have a better idea?

567
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,410
<23-8,CAMERON>没有
<23-8,CAMERON>No.

568
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,720
<23-9,FOREMAN>那我们就用Chase的
<23-9,FOREMAN>Then we're going with chase'S.

569
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,410
<23-9,FOREMAN>我们有个主意
<23-9,FOREMAN>We have an idea.

570
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,550
<24-1,FOREMAN>告诉他别让管子缠在一起
<24-1,FOREMAN>tell him not to get the lines tangled.

571
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,070
<24-1,FOREMAN>滴注速度很慢 这条管子不能有纠结
<24-1,FOREMAN>The infusion is slow. We can't have any kinks in the line.

572
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,070
<24-2,CHASE>我也上过医学学校
<24-2,CHASE>I went to medical school too.

573
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,020
<24-1,FOREMAN>别让管子缠在一起
<24-1,FOREMAN>Don't tangle the lines!

574
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,150
<24-3,FOREMAN>把你的胳膊放在身上 就放胸前
<24-3,FOREMAN>Keep your arms on your body, above your heart.

575
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,040
<24-4,JOHN>我的胃没知觉了
<24-4,JOHN>I can't feel my stomach!

576
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,820
<24-4,JOHN>我感觉不到那个
<24-4,JOHN>I don't feel that.

577
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,200
<24-4,JOHN>我什么都感觉不到
<24-4,JOHN>I don't feel anything!

578
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,700
<24-4,JOHN>瘫痪在向上延伸
<24-4,JOHN>Paralysis is ascending.

579
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,250
<24-5,FOREMAN>如果继续下去 我们就要用呼吸机了
<24-5,FOREMAN>If it keeps going, we're gonna need a respirator.

580
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,740
<24-6,JOHN>什么 你们在说什么?
<24-6,JOHN>What? What are you saying?

581
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,500
<24-7,CHASE>你能呼吸吗?
<24-7,CHASE>Can you breathe?

582
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,830
<24-7,CHASE>呼吸困难吗?
<24-7,CHASE>Trouble breathing?

583
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,160
<24-8,JOHN>不 还没有
<24-8,JOHN>No.Not yet.

584
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,600
<24-8,JOHN>--在新泽西公园路91号出口发生车祸...
<24-8,JOHN>--Accident on the garden state parkway south bound at exit 91...

585
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,560
<25-1,HOUSE>情况如何?
<25-1,HOUSE>so, where were we?

586
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,470
<25-2,FOREMAN>昨晚睡得好吗?
<25-2,FOREMAN>You have a nice night?

587
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,490
<25-2,FOREMAN>不好
<25-2,FOREMAN>No.

588
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,180
<25-2,FOREMAN>瘫痪在向上延伸
<25-2,FOREMAN>The paralysis is ascending.

589
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,640
<26-1,CAMERON>上次检查 已经接近横隔膜了
<26-1,CAMERON>The last check, it was nearly to his diaphragm.

590
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,730
<26-2,HOUSE>告诉我们一些事情
<26-2,HOUSE>tells us something.

591
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,900
<26-3,FOREMAN>说明病情恶化了
<26-3,FOREMAN>means it's getting worse.

592
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,370
<26-4,HOUSE>恶化也是提示
<26-4,HOUSE>Worse is something.

593
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,160
<26-5,CHASE>说明不是铀引起
<26-5,CHASE>Also tells us it's not the uranium.

594
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,260
<26-6,HOUSE>我们有考虑过铀吗?
<26-6,HOUSE>Did we think it was?

595
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,070
<26-7,FOREMAN>我们用了碳酸钠让他排出废铀
<26-7,FOREMAN>We started him on sodium bicarb to try to flush the uranium out of his system.

596
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,390
<26-8,HOUSE>好极了 现在他情况恶化也不能提示什么
<26-8,HOUSE>Great. Now the fact that he's getting worse tells us nothing.

597
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,890
<26-8,HOUSE>从没考虑过是铀
<26-8,HOUSE>Never thought it was uranium.

598
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,130
<26-8,HOUSE>就我们所知 排铀治疗是让他--
<26-8,HOUSE>For all we know, the uranium treatment is what's making him--

599
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,310
<26-9,FOREMAN>碳酸钠滴注不会引起这作用--
<26-9,FOREMAN>a sodium bicarb infusion wouldn't have any effect on--

600
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,940
<26-10,HOUSE>引起什么?
<26-10,HOUSE>on what?

601
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,410
<26-10,HOUSE>很难说没有影响
<26-10,HOUSE>Kind of hard to say what it wouldn't have an effect on

602
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,260
<26-10,HOUSE>如果连原始病因是什么都不知道
<26-10,HOUSE>if you've no idea what's there to affect.

603
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,250
<26-11,FOREMAN>我们总得做点什么
<26-11,FOREMAN>We had to do something.

604
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,280
<26-12,HOUSE>下次...试点会有用的办法
<26-12,HOUSE>Well, next time...go with something that has a chance of working.

605
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,670
<26-13,CAMERON>比如?
<26-13,CAMERON>Like what?

606
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,680
<26-13,CAMERON>在家里温暖舒适的床上,你想出什么高明的主意了吗?
<26-13,CAMERON>You come up with some brilliant idea while,you're warm and cozy in your bed at home?

607
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,840
<26-14,HOUSE>我们需要更多信息
<26-14,HOUSE>We need more information.

608
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,260
<26-15,FOREMAN>你到底还要多少信息?
<26-15,FOREMAN>How much more information could you possibly want?

609
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,310
<26-15,FOREMAN>我们有从他曾祖父辈开始的家族病史
<26-15,FOREMAN>We have a medical history going all the way back to his great-grandparents.

610
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,620
<26-15,FOREMAN>- 非医疗史从,- 这还不够
<26-15,FOREMAN>- A non-medical history going-,- it's not enough.

611
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,810
<26-17,CHASE>我们能得到的就这些了
<26-17,CHASE>It's all we're gonna get.

612
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,570
<26-18,HOUSE>想打赌吗?
<26-18,HOUSE>Wanna bet?

613
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,070
<27-1,CUDDY>谁批准碳酸钠滴注的?
<27-1,CUDDY>Who approved a sodium bicarb infusion?

614
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,160
<27-2,HOUSE>别看我 我在家里床上呢
<27-2,HOUSE>Don't look at me. I was home in bed.

615
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,210
<27-3,CHASE>出什么事了?
<27-3,CHASE>What's wrong?

616
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,250
<27-4,CUDDY>他昏迷了
<27-4,CUDDY>he's unconscious.

617
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,590
<27-4,CUDDY>他的皮肤没有颜色,血压和红细胞比容迅速下降
<27-4,CUDDY>His skin has lost all color, and his bp and hematocrit are plunging.

618
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,910
<27-5,FOREMAN>- 他不过是用了碳酸钠--,- 他正在出血
<27-5,FOREMAN>- he was only on the sodium bicarb-,- he's bleeding out.

619
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,040
<27-7,CAMERON>他不可能在出血 床上没有血
<27-7,CAMERON>He can't be bleeding out. There's no blood in the bed.

620
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,140
<27-8,HOUSE>好吧 他是内出血
<27-8,HOUSE>Fine, he's bleeding in.

621
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,880
<27-9,CHASE>没有瘀伤或内出血的迹象
<27-9,CHASE>There's no sign of bruising or internal hemorrhaging.

622
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,600
<27-10,FOREMAN>瘫痪一定已经到了横隔膜
<27-10,FOREMAN>paralysis must have reached his diaphragm.

623
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,120
<27-11,HOUSE>无法给血液供氧
<27-11,HOUSE>He's not able to oxygenate his blood.

624
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,260
<27-11,HOUSE>无法给血液供氧是因为他已经快没血了
<27-11,HOUSE>He's not able to oxygenate his blood because he doesn't have any left.

625
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,690
<27-13,HOUSE>没有证据--,这是唯一能解释--
<27-13,HOUSE>there's no evidence-- it's the only thing that would explain--

626
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,910
<27-14,CAMERON>没有理由失血的
<27-14,CAMERON>there's no reason for blood loss.

627
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,240
<27-14,CAMERON>一定有原因
<27-14,CAMERON>There has to be a reason.

628
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,680
<27-15,HOUSE>他需要输血 给我4单位的O阴性血 马上
<27-15,HOUSE>He needs a transfusion. Get me 4 units of o negative.Stat!

629
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,610
<27-15,HOUSE>抬起他的脚
<27-15,HOUSE>Let's elevate his feet.

630
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,840
<27-16,CUDDY>他不需要输血
<27-16,CUDDY>He doesn't need a transfusion.

631
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,490
<27-17,HOUSE>没人问你的意见
<27-17,HOUSE>Nobody asked you.

632
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,820
<27-17,HOUSE>事实上 你怎么会在这儿?
<27-17,HOUSE>In fact, why are you even here?

633
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,790
<27-18,CUDDY>很显然 因为你需要我帮忙
<27-18,CUDDY>Because, obviously, you need my help.

634
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,900
<27-19,HOUSE>出去
<27-19,HOUSE>Get out.

635
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,930
<27-20,CHASE>House 他的血显然没有消失-
<27-20,CHASE>House, his blood obviously didn't just vanish into--

636
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,430
<27-22,CHASE>见鬼 这是什么东西?
<27-22,CHASE>what the hell is this?

637
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,280
<27-21,HOUSE>肯定有人弄洒了什么
<27-21,HOUSE>Somebody must have spilled something.

638
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,430
<27-21,HOUSE>来个人给我4单位...
<27-21,HOUSE>Somebody else should be getting me 4 units...

639
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,050
<27-22,CHASE>到底是什么?
<27-22,CHASE>what the hell is that?

640
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,560
<27-23,HOUSE>有个裂缝的导尿管收集袋
<27-23,HOUSE>It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it--

641
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,150
<27-22,CHASE>它看起来像什么?
<27-22,CHASE>what the hell does it look like?

642
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,930
<27-23,HOUSE>什么?
<27-23,HOUSE>What?

643
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,600

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,300
<27-24,HOUSE>没人帮我拿血
<27-24,HOUSE>No one's getting me blood.

645
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,460
<27-24,HOUSE>为什么没人帮我拿血?
<27-24,HOUSE>Why isn't anybody getting me blood?

646
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,950
<27-25,FOREMAN>你流鼻血了
<27-25,FOREMAN>You're bleeding.

<27-29,HOUSE>No, you're not.

651
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,060
<27-29,HOUSE>一定有原因
<27-29,HOUSE>There's a reason.

652
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,620
<27-29,HOUSE>一定有
<27-29,HOUSE>There has to be.

653
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,600
<27-29,HOUSE>新泽西公园路发生事故
<27-29,HOUSE>Incident on the garden state parkway...

654
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,950
<28-1,HOUSE>情况怎样?
<28-1,HOUSE>so.Where were we?

655
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,790
<28-2,FOREMAN>昨晚睡得好吗?
<28-2,FOREMAN>You have a nice night?

<28-3,HOUSE>是 不错 谢谢关心
<28-3,HOUSE>Yes, I did, thank you.

657
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,480
<28-3,HOUSE>我猜比我们的病人好很多,他的血压和红血球比容在迅速下降
<28-3,HOUSE>I'm guessing better than our patient,,probably due to his bpand hematocrit plunging.

658
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,410
<28-3,HOUSE>你怎么会知道?
<28-3,HOUSE>How'd you know?

659
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,470
<28-3,HOUSE>答案一直都摆在我们面前,就像鼻子在脸上那样明显
<28-3,HOUSE>the answer was staring right at us the whole time,,as plain as the nose on our faces.

660
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,090
<29-1,HOUSE>或者他脸上的鼻子
<29-1,HOUSE>Or the nose on his face.

661
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,090
<29-2,JOHN>发生什么事了 他说什么?
<29-2,JOHN>What's going on? What'd he say?

662
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,230
<29-3,HOUSE>没有鼻毛 有灼烧疤痕
<29-3,HOUSE>No hairs, and cauterization scars.

663
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,300
<29-4,CHASE>这意味着?
<29-4,CHASE>Which means?

664
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,050
<29-5,HOUSE>他灼烧过这里
<29-5,HOUSE>He had it cauterized.

665
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,760
<29-6,CAMERON>你怎么能知道这个?
<29-6,CAMERON>How could you know that?

666
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,090
<29-7,HOUSE>因为这样才合理
<29-7,HOUSE>Just makes sense.

667
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,690
<29-7,HOUSE>他和祖父一样小时候鼻子常出血,毫无疑问 灼烧是为了阻止这个
<29-7,HOUSE>Undoubtedly done to stop the same childhood nosebleeds,that plagued his grandfather.

668
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,870
<29-7,HOUSE>毫无疑问 他们有遗传性,出血性毛细血管扩张症
<29-7,HOUSE>Undoubtedly, because they were both born with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

669
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,770
<29-8,JOHN>他在说什么?
<29-8,JOHN>What's he saying?

670
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,050
<29-9,HOUSE>我在说你有遗传病 损害你的毛细血管
<29-9,HOUSE>I'm saying you've got a genetic disease that's destroying your capillaries.

671
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,670
<29-10,CAMERON>他们家以前从来没人被诊断出这病?
<29-10,CAMERON>that no one in his family's ever been diagnosed with before?

672
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,160
<29-11,HOUSE>一点不奇怪 通常一开始症状是--
<29-11,HOUSE>Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms--

673
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,650
<29-11,HOUSE>皮疹和鼻子出血--
<29-11,HOUSE>skin rashes and nose bleeds--

674

<29-11,HOUSE>经常被视作小创伤或干燥天气的结果
<29-11,HOUSE>are often written off as the result or minor trauma or dry weather.

675
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,260
<29-11,HOUSE>但也可能是因为动脉静脉融合在一起
<29-11,HOUSE>But they can also be the result of his arteries and veins merging together.

676
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,010
<29-11,HOUSE>他很显然有动静脉畸形
<29-11,HOUSE>He obviously has avms.

677
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,020
<29-11,HOUSE>脊柱旁边的动静脉畸形引起瘫痪
<29-11,HOUSE>Avm near the spine caused the paralysis.

678
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,050
<29-11,HOUSE>肺上的动静脉畸形阻止了血液被过滤
<29-11,HOUSE>Avm in his lungs prevented his blood from being filtered.

679
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,940
<29-11,HOUSE>没过滤的血引起关节痛 疲劳,口腔和脑子里的感染
<29-11,HOUSE>Dirty blood caused the joint pain, fatigue,,and the infections in his mouth and brain.

680
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,520
<29-11,HOUSE>只要几个手术没什么不能清除的
<29-11,HOUSE>Nothing that a few surgeries won't clear up.

681
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,330
<29-11,HOUSE>对前面提到的都做血管造影
<29-11,HOUSE>Get mr angiograms of the aforementioned.

682
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,850
<29-11,HOUSE>海军陆战队没有隐瞒任何事 他隐瞒了
<29-11,HOUSE>The marines weren't hiding anything. He was.

683
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,820
<29-11,HOUSE>至少忘了提及他用止血棉
<29-11,HOUSE>Or at least he forgot to mention his bloody tissue issue.

684
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,780
<29-11,HOUSE>发生什么了?
<29-11,HOUSE>What's going on?

685
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,760
<29-11,HOUSE>他说了什么?
<29-11,HOUSE>What'd he say?

686
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,940
<30-1,WILSON>看起来病例解决了 你的其它问题也好了
<30-1,WILSON>oh, looks like solving the case solved your other problem.

687
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,360
<30-2,HOUSE>没什么灵药比得上幸福
<30-2,HOUSE>There is no medicine like happiness.

688
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,290
<30-2,HOUSE>或许还有欢笑
<30-2,HOUSE>Except maybe laughter.

689
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,610
<30-2,HOUSE>或者把橡胶管子推挤进尿道
<30-2,HOUSE>Or rubber tubes shoved up your urethra.

690
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,160
<30-3,WILSON>你给自己插了尿管?
<30-3,WILSON>You cathed yourself?

691
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,470
<30-4,HOUSE>除了刚开始的9到10英寸,实际上插管也没有那么糟糕
<30-4,HOUSE>It's actually not that bad after the first, I don't know, nine or ten inches.

692
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,820
<30-4,HOUSE>插管缓解了痉挛
<30-4,HOUSE>Cath relieved the spasm.

693
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,380
<30-4,HOUSE>我健康如初了
<30-4,HOUSE>I'm as good as new.

694
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,450
<30-5,WILSON>当然 只不过是一次小小的痉挛
<30-5,WILSON>Of course. Just a minor spasmin a muscle you've been using multiple times

695
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,490
<30-5,WILSON>在一块你45年来 每天用好几次的肌肉上
<30-5,WILSON>a day without any problem for the past 45 years.

696
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,890
<30-5,WILSON>不是过度使用止痛药的严重副作用
<30-5,WILSON>Not a major side effect caused by the over-use of a particular narcotic pain killer.

697
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,570
<30-6,HOUSE>是 我也这么想
<30-6,HOUSE>Yeah, that was my thought too.

698
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,160
<30-7,WILSON>仍不予考虑减少使用某种药片的剂量
<30-7,WILSON>So...no reason to think about cutting back on your use of that particular pilL.

699
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,690
<30-7,WILSON>感谢上帝
<30-7,WILSON>Thank god.

700
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,760
<30-8,HOUSE>事实上 是正常的三倍剂量
<30-8,HOUSE>Actually, it was a triple dose of the good stuff that allowed me

701
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,480
<30-8,HOUSE>才能让我睡一会觉 解决病例
<30-8,HOUSE>to finally get some sleep and solve the case.

702
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,900
<30-8,HOUSE>药片让我美梦成真
<30-8,HOUSE>Pills made all my dreams come true.

703
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,490
<30-9,WILSON>你真是在睡觉时得到答案的?
<30-9,WILSON>You really got the answers in your sleep?

704
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,460
<30-10,HOUSE>一个在睡觉时 另一个在冲澡时
<30-10,HOUSE>Got one in my sleep. The other one I got in the shower.

705
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,310
<31-1,HOUSE>我一直在想你
<31-1,HOUSE>I've been thinking about you.

706
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,200
<31-1,HOUSE>你撒谎了
<31-1,HOUSE>You lied.

707
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
<31-2,CUDDY>我没有
<31-2,CUDDY>I didn't lie.

708
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,560
<31-2,CUDDY>我只是选择不分享无关的事情
<31-2,CUDDY>I simply chose not to share completely irrelevant facts.

709
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,800
<31-3,HOUSE>比如你撒谎这种事
<31-3,HOUSE>Like the fact that you lied.

710
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,520
<31-3,HOUSE>怪不得我没法对上他的脸
<31-3,HOUSE>No wonder I couldn't place his face.

711
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,090
<31-3,HOUSE>在舞池里你都快把他的脸吞了
<31-3,HOUSE>You were practically swallowing it on the dance floor.

712
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,390
<31-4,CUDDY>我没有
<31-4,CUDDY>I was not.

713
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,020
<31-5,HOUSE>谈谈那个酷叔叔吧
<31-5,HOUSE>Talk about the cool uncle.

714
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,480
<31-5,HOUSE>他捐了钱 侄子可以尝甜头
<31-5,HOUSE>He donates the money, and the nephew gets the write-off.

715
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,060
<31-5,HOUSE>所谓甜头 是指他把你的脚踝搁在
<31-5,HOUSE>And, of course, by write-off, I mean he gets to put your ankles--

716
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,650
<31-6,CUDDY>这恰恰是为什么,我不提两年前的那次约会
<31-6,CUDDY>this is exactly why I didn't mention our one date over two years ago.

717
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,490
<31-7,HOUSE>因为我的T恤
<31-7,HOUSE>Because of my t-shirt.

718
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,240
<31-8,CUDDY>因为你是个讨厌的混蛋
<31-8,CUDDY>Because you are an obnoxious ass.

719
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,080
<31-8,CUDDY>因为你会用所有时间--
<31-8,CUDDY>Because you would have spent the whole time--

720
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,210
<31-9,HOUSE>真够聪明的
<31-9,HOUSE>that's very smart.

721
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,550
<31-9,HOUSE>因为这样 我就会全神贯注于病人
<31-9,HOUSE>'Cause this way, I spent my whole time completely focused on the patient.

722
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,900
<31-10,CUDDY>你怎么会记得他?
<31-10,CUDDY>How did you even remember him?

723
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,970
<31-10,CUDDY>我们在那个聚会上只出现了十分钟
<31-10,CUDDY>We were only at that party for, like, ten minutes.

724
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,720
<31-11,HOUSE>这是新的医疗计划吗?
<31-11,HOUSE>Is this some new health plan?

725
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,470
<31-11,HOUSE>为院长你服务 就能得到一年的免费医疗?
<31-11,HOUSE>You service the dean of medicine, and you get free health care for a year?

726
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,390
<31-11,HOUSE>你在笑什么?
<31-11,HOUSE>Why are you smiling?

727
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,990
<31-12,CUDDY>你记得他 是因为他和我交往过
<31-12,CUDDY>You remembered him because he made out with me.

728
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,740
<31-13,HOUSE>我认面孔很在行
<31-13,HOUSE>I'm good with faces.

729
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,550
<31-13,HOUSE>那么 这个计划 对别人开放吗?
<31-13,HOUSE>So, this plan, is it open to anyone?

730
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,510
<31-13,HOUSE>有没有定额自付?
<31-13,HOUSE>Is there a co-pay?

731
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,100
<31-14,CUDDY>你认脸一塌糊涂
<31-14,CUDDY>You're lousy with faces.

732
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,320
<31-15,HOUSE>别把这事扯到我身上
<31-15,HOUSE>Don't make this about me.

733
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,340
<31-15,HOUSE>这是你的耻辱
<31-15,HOUSE>This is your humiliation.

734
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,130
<31-15,HOUSE>私人房间的费用是多少?
<31-15,HOUSE>So how much for private room coverage?

735
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,310
<31-16,CUDDY>别再对我念念不忘
<31-16,CUDDY>Get over me.

736
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,630
<31-17,HOUSE>得了吧 你雇我--
<31-17,HOUSE>Gimme a break.You hired me--

737
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,480
<31-18,CUDDY>因为你是一个,连血库都不愿意雇用的好医生
<31-18,CUDDY>'cause you're a good doctor who couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank,

738
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,940
<31-18,CUDDY>所以我捡了便宜
<31-18,CUDDY>so i got you cheap.

739
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,570
<31-19,HOUSE>你肯给所有我要的
<31-19,HOUSE>You gave me everything I asked for,

740
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,620
<31-19,HOUSE>是因为有一天晚上 我给你所有--
<31-19,HOUSE>because one night I gave you everything you--

741
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,880
<31-20,CUDDY>别以为我没看就盯着我的臀部
<31-20,CUDDY>stop staring at my ass when you think I'm not looking,

742
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,640
<31-20,CUDDY>刚好出现在我约会的餐馆
<31-20,CUDDY>showing up at restaurants where I happen to be on a date,

743
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,570
<31-20,CUDDY>冲澡时幻想我
<31-20,CUDDY>and fantasizing about me in the shower.

744
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,560
<31-20,CUDDY>船早就开走了 House
<31-20,CUDDY>That ship sailed long ago, house.

745
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,080
<31-20,CUDDY>放手吧
<31-20,CUDDY>Get over it.

746
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,480
<31-21,HOUSE>如果船指的还是你的臀部
<31-21,HOUSE>If you're still referring to your ass,

747
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,080
<31-21,HOUSE>我觉得 "巨型油轮开走了",会是更准确的比喻
<31-21,HOUSE>I think "that super-tanker sailed" would be the more precise metaphor.

748
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,080
<32-1,HOUSE>不好意思 我在找个大的垃圾桶
<32-1,HOUSE>sorry. I was lookingfor an extra-large trash can.

<32-2,CHASE>Since when does he clean anything up?
