<1-1,Ben>好了  姑娘小伙们
<1-1,Ben>Ok, boys and girls.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,860
<1-1,Ben>猜猜古怪班尼现在要做什么动物了
<1-1,Ben>Guess what kind of animal Wacky Benny is making now?

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,270
<1-1,Ben>它有一个大头
<1-1,Ben>It gets a big head.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,120
<1-2,Red Headed Boy>是死掉的动物吧
<1-2,Red Headed Boy>Is it a dead animal?

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,780
<1-2,Red Headed Boy>我想还是别让他再出丑了
<1-2,Red Headed Boy>I say we put him out of his misery

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,450
<1-2,Red Headed Boy>把艾玛的蛋糕拿出来吧
<1-2,Red Headed Boy>and bring out Emma's cake.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,230
<1-3,Red Headed Boy>他也是刚入行不久
<1-3,Red Headed Boy>He's so new to this.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,240
<1-3,Red Headed Boy>如果把他轰下台  他怎么能从中受益呢
<1-3,Red Headed Boy>How's he gonna learn if we stop his act?

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,110
<1-3,Red Headed Boy>你真是个笨小丑
<1-3,Red Headed Boy>You're a sucky clown.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,980
<1-4,Ben>你真是个臭屁的观众
<1-4,Ben>And you're a super-duper audience.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,980
<1-5,Ben>这样做可不行了
<1-5,Ben>Hey, that is not okay.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,560
<1-5,Ben>别碰我儿子
<1-5,Ben>Hey, keep your hands off my son.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,250
<1-6,Ben>你告诉他先别碰我
<1-6,Ben>Tell him to keep his hand off me.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,860
<1-7,Ben>我的四肢动不了了
<1-7,Ben>I can't move my arm or leg.

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,780
<1-7,Ben>总监：
<1-7,Ben>zlean

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,440
<2-1,Taub>一名完全健康的青少年怎么会突然轻微中风呢
<2-1,Taub>So how does a completely healthy teenager have a mini-stroke?

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,010
<2-2,Park>脑部CT扫描和脑血管造影的结果均正常
<2-2,Park>Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,260
<2-2,Park>凝血参数也正常
<2-2,Park>Clotting parameters are normal.

37
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,260
<2-3,House>你们没看见他衬衣上有一处褶皱
<2-3,House>You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt.

38
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,340
<2-3,House>我以为咱们是要先诊断这个中年小丑呢
<2-3,House>Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.

39
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,890
<2-4,Taub>估计是安全带勒的
<2-4,Taub>It's probably from my seat belt.

40
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,430
<2-5,House>褶皱的纹理毫无规律
<2-5,House>Wrinkle pattern's too varied.

41
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,330
<2-5,House>看上去像是被什么人推了或是抓了一下
<2-5,House>It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,330
<2-6,Taub>或者是纸尿裤袋子弄的
<2-6,Taub>Probably from the diaper bag.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,770
<2-6,Taub>如果病人有毒瘾
<2-6,Taub>If the patient's using drugs,

44
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,830
<2-6,Taub>可卡因可能引起他大脑中的动脉痉挛
<2-6,Taub>cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
<2-7,House>毒性检测显示他没有吸毒
<2-7,House>The tox screen was clean.

46
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,470
<2-7,House>我猜是被你劈腿的前女友抓的
<2-7,House>I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on,

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,680
<2-7,House>而不是陪你劈腿的前妻
<2-7,House>not the ex-wife you cheated with.

48
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,180
<2-7,House>如果后者要对你动手
<2-7,House>If the latter was prone to violence,

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,880
<2-7,House>你早就被打得满地找牙了
<2-7,House>you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,230
<2-8,Taub>有没有搞错
<2-8,Taub>Seriously?

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,470
<2-8,Taub>除了我没人想聊聊病人的情况吗
<2-8,Taub>No one else wants to talk about the patient?

52
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,120
<2-8,Taub>崭新的办公室家具  还是肉色主题
<2-8,Taub>New office furniture. Meaty topic.

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,660
<2-9,Chase>前妻的赔率是多少
<2-9,Chase>What's the action on the ex-wife?

54
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,240
<2-10,Taub>是瑞秋的男友菲尔干的
<2-10,Taub>It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.

55
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,710
<2-10,Taub>他的公司把他调回波特兰了
<2-10,Taub>His company's moving him back to Portland.

56
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,870
<2-10,Taub>他想让我调整我照看孩子的时间
<2-10,Taub>He wants me to change my visitation order

57
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,290
<2-10,Taub>好让瑞秋和我女儿
<2-10,Taub>so he can ask Rachel and my daughter to

58
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,650
<2-10,Taub>搬到西边和他一起住
<2-10,Taub>move out west with him.

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,970
<2-10,Taub>我们越吵越厉害
<2-10,Taub>Things got a little heated.

60
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,960
<2-11,Taub>病人被打中要害
<2-11,Taub>The patient was punched in the groin.

61
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,040
<2-11,Taub>会不会引起大量交感神经释放冲动
<2-11,Taub>Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,650
<2-12,House>颈动脉超声正常
<2-12,House>Carotid duplex is normal.

63
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,800
<2-12,House>谁更合适当这个父亲呢
<2-12,House>Who's better qualified to be the Daddy?

64
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,820
<2-12,House>是那个只提供了一半DNA的家伙
<2-12,House>The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool

65
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,450
<2-12,House>还是日夜守护在她身边
<2-12,House>or the guy who's gonna be there day and night

66
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,820
<2-12,House>向她教授类似不要在离婚后
<2-12,House>to pass on important values

67
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,020
<2-12,House>把妈妈肚子搞大这类人生道理的家伙呢
<2-12,House>like not shtupping Mommy after the divorce?

68
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,660
<2-13,Taub>我才是她的父亲
<2-13,Taub>I am her Daddy.

69
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,660
<2-13,Taub>她必须留在这
<2-13,Taub>She's staying here.

70
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,830
<2-14,Park>豪斯说得有道理
<2-14,Park>House has a point.

71
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,730
<2-14,Park>每周轮着陪孩子  能让你感觉好受些
<2-14,Park>A couple nights a week with each kid may make you feel better.

72
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,670
<2-14,Park>但取代不了时时刻刻陪伴在旁的父母啊
<2-14,Park>Doesn't replace two 'round-the-clock parents.

73
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,650
<2-15,Chase>不管是不是时刻在一起
<2-15,Chase>'Round-the-clock or not,

74
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,040
<2-15,Chase>为人父母都是项无法完成的工作
<2-15,Chase>parenting's an impossible job.

75
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,630
<2-15,Chase>反正都会搞砸的
<2-15,Chase>No way not to mess it up.

76
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,190
<2-15,Chase>陶博干嘛不去趟这浑水呢
<2-15,Chase>Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it?

77
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,010
<2-16,Taub>-谢谢你  -有道理
<2-16,Taub>- Thank you. - Makes sense.

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,840
<2-17,House>朴克的虎妈狼爸着实让人难以忍受
<2-17,House>Park's tiger Mom and Dad were so insufferable.

79
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,110
<2-17,House>她得用小时计算父母的爱
<2-17,House>She has to measure their affection in hours.

80
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,520
<2-17,House>奇斯那只顾事业的父亲和酗酒的母亲也一样
<2-17,House>Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom were so indifferent.

81
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,980
<2-17,House>只会让他相信父母都靠不住
<2-17,House>He has to believe it's a wash.

82
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,190
<2-17,House>到你了
<2-17,House>Your turn.

83
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,590
<2-17,House>你不负责任的双亲是怎么
<2-17,House>What did your screwed-up parents do

84
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,760
<2-17,House>扭曲你对为人父母的看法的
<2-17,House>to screw up your view of parenting?

85
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,990
<2-18,Adams>他们是负责任的好父母
<2-18,Adams>They were good parents.

86
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,310
<2-19,House>这是矛盾的
<2-19,House>That's an oxymoron.

87
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,640
<2-19,House>奇斯说的对
<2-19,House>Chase is right.

88
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,580
<2-19,House>所有父母都会毁了自己的孩子
<2-19,House>All parents screw up all children.

89
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,770
<2-19,House>他现在还在走神  但这就没关系了
<2-19,House>He's also dreamy, but it's not relevant now.

90
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,670
<2-19,House>这么说所有父母都在毁掉自己的孩子
<2-19,House>So all parents screw up all children,

91
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,930
<2-20,Taub>但在我自己抚养女儿和让她离开之间
<2-20,Taub>but it makes some huge difference

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
<2-20,Taub>就有天壤之别了吗
<2-20,Taub>if I keep my daughter here or let her move?

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,970
<3-1,Janey>心内膜炎
<3-1,Janey>Endocarditis.

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,540
<2-20,Taub>他大脑中有一片赘生物
<2-20,Taub>Flipped a piece of vegetation into his brain,

95
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,570
<2-20,Taub>有可能在血管造影前就破碎了
<2-20,Taub>which could have broken up before the angiogram.

96
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,660
<2-21,House>用经食道心脏超声来确认一下
<2-21,House>Transesophageal echo to confirm.

97
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
<2-21,House>你最好还是放她走
<2-21,House>Screwed up is your best case.

98
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,420
<2-21,House>夹在风情万种的工作狂父亲
<2-21,House>Bouncing between a philandering workaholic Dad

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,950
<2-21,House>和被劈腿后十分痛苦的母亲中间
<2-21,House>and an embittered, sexually betrayed Mom,

100
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,460
<2-21,House>她会让你俩成为糟糕父母的领军人物
<2-21,House>it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.

101
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,860
<3-1,Janey>心内膜炎可以治愈吗
<3-1,Janey>Is endocarditis treatable?

102
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,500
<3-1,Janey>没问题
<3-1,Janey>Very.

103
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,200
<3-2,Chase>用超声能看出他心脏瓣膜上是否长有异物
<3-2,Chase>The echo will show us any growths on his heart valve.

104
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,050
<3-2,Chase>一般情况下吃吃药就可以了
<3-2,Chase>Most likely meds will be enough.

105
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,260
<3-2,Chase>都不用动手术
<3-2,Chase>He won't even need surgery.

106
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,970
<3-3,Janey>他的表演事业才刚起步
<3-3,Janey>He's just taken up performing

107
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,140
<3-3,Janey>他现在压力挺大的
<3-3,Janey>and it's very stressful for him.

108
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,970
<3-3,Janey>会不会是这个原因
<3-3,Janey>Could that have caused this?

109
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,070
<3-4,Ben>没什么压力  我很开心
<3-4,Ben>It's not stressful. I have fun.

110
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,310
<3-5,Taub>压力可能没什么关系
<3-5,Taub>Stress wouldn't be relevant,

111
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,020
<3-5,Taub>但能引起他肾上腺素升高的因素
<3-5,Taub>but anything that increases his adrenalin

112
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,110
<3-5,Taub>倒是会让他的情况更糟
<3-5,Taub>could have made it worse.

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
<3-6,Janey>也许我们能给你找一个新爱好
<3-6,Janey>Maybe we find you a new hobby,

114
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,560
<3-6,Janey>你更擅长的爱好
<3-6,Janey>one you're a little better at.

115
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,600
<3-7,Ben>我会越演越好的  而且那不只是个爱好
<3-7,Ben>I'm gonna get better at it, and it's not a hobby.

116
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,740
<3-7,Ben>我想到马戏团去当职业小丑
<3-7,Ben>I-I think I want to get a job working as a circus clown,

117
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,940
<3-7,Ben>为别人带来欢乐
<3-7,Ben>making people laugh.

118
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,410
<3-8,Janey>本  我想这可不是个好主意
<3-8,Janey>Ben, I-I don't think that's a good idea.

119
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,890
<3-9,Ben>我爸就会认为这挺好的
<3-9,Ben>It was good enough for my Dad.

120
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,680
<3-10,Chase>你是...
<3-10,Chase>You're a, uh--

121
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,870
<3-11,Janey>不是他  他是指他的生父
<3-11,Janey>No, his biological father.

122
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,060
<3-12,Ron>他的病会不会跟他生父的黑色素瘤有关呢
<3-12,Ron>Could his Dad's melanoma be a factor here?

123
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,660
<3-13,Taub>应该也没关系
<3-13,Taub>That wouldn't be related.

124
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,100
<3-14,Janey>本  你根本不了解他
<3-14,Janey>Ben, you barely knew him.

125
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,060
<3-14,Janey>你是个很聪明的孩子
<3-14,Janey>You're such a smart kid.

126
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,680
<3-14,Janey>你的志向可以更远大一些
<3-14,Janey>You could aim a lot higher

127
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,680
<3-14,Janey>而不是在脸上涂油彩  扔水瓶子
<3-14,Janey>than face paint and seltzer bottles.

128
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,980
<4-1,Clinic Patient Monroe>我需要治疗我的二型糖尿病
<4-1,Clinic Patient Monroe>I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.

129
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,920
<4-2,House>你刚才那句话没有一点是真的
<4-2,House>There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.

130
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,830
<4-3,Monroe>我的体重在增加  时常感到疲劳
<4-3,Monroe>I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue,

131
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,030
<4-3,Monroe>还爱发呆
<4-3,Monroe>and sluggishness.

132
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,950
<4-4,House>体重下降才是糖尿病的症状
<4-4,House>Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes.

133
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,530
<4-4,House>疲劳是因为
<4-4,House>Fatigue is a symptom

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,500
<4-4,House>你总以为自己得了你没有得的病
<4-4,House>of thinking you have a disease you don't actually have,

135
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,740
<4-4,House>而发呆是由疲劳引起的
<4-4,House>and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.

136
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,140
<4-5,Monroe>我需要注射胰岛素  我知道的
<4-5,Monroe>I need insulin. I know it.

137
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,440
<4-6,House>虽然我特别想把你血糖
<4-6,House>Much as I'd like to kill you

138
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,410
<4-6,House>降到危险值  杀了你
<4-6,House>by dangerously lowering your blood sugar,

139
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,280
<4-6,House>但谋杀会让我失去假释
<4-6,House>murder violates my parole.

140
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,260
<4-7,Monroe>这血检结果是一周前的
<4-7,Monroe>That bloodwork is week's old.

141
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,210
<4-7,Monroe>再给我检测一下
<4-7,Monroe>Test me again.

142
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,120
<4-8,House>我就是血检  结果就是你没有糖尿病
<4-8,House>I am the test. The test is negative.

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
<4-8,House>结果还说你是个讨厌鬼
<4-8,House>The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass.

144
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,130
<4-8,House>最后这句骂你的话是告诉你该离开了
<4-8,House>That last insult was your cue to leave.

145
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,950
<4-9,Monroe>给我做血检
<4-9,Monroe>Test me.

146
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,200
<4-10,House>好吧  在这等着
<4-10,House>Fine. Wait right here.

147
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,520
<4-11,Monroe>谢谢你
<4-11,Monroe>Thank you.

148
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,790
<4-12,House>睡眠研究
<4-12,House>Sleep study.

149
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,430
<4-12,House>请保证他在接下来的八个小时内不受打扰
<4-12,House>Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.

150
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,170
<4-13,Wilson>我们得谈谈周六晚上的事
<4-13,Wilson>We need to talk about Saturday night.

151
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,100
<4-14,House>不行  不行  不行
<4-14,House>No, no, no, no, no.

152
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,450
<4-14,House>历史学家才要谈周六晚上的事呢  不是我们
<4-14,House>Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us.

153
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,550
<4-14,House>在那个传奇之夜
<4-14,House>The legendary night on

154
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,350
<4-14,House>我们将看桑托斯打碎卢比奥的下巴
<4-14,House>which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw

155
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,220
<4-14,House>你还会输给我意义重大的五十块
<4-14,House>and you epically pay me $50.

156
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,470
<4-15,Wilson>我有个机会能去现场看
<4-15,Wilson>I have a chance to really watch it.

157
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,030
<4-15,Wilson>我的一位病人有两张票  他自己用不成
<4-15,Wilson>A patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use,

158
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,670
<4-15,Wilson>而你只能待在家里或是办公室里
<4-15,Wilson>and obviously you're under house and office arrest.

159
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,240
<4-15,Wilson>我只是想确认下你不会介意
<4-15,Wilson>I just wanted to make sure you were cool

160
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,600
<4-15,Wilson>我独自去大西洋城
<4-15,Wilson>if I go to Atlantic city without you.

161
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,340
<4-16,House>不介意  谢啦
<4-16,House>Uh, no, thanks.

162
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,040
<4-16,House>恐怕我得拒绝
<4-16,House>I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,800
<4-16,House>你要我别和你共度周六夜晚的邀请了
<4-16,House>your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you.

164
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,610
<4-17,Wilson>座位可就在拳击台底下
<4-17,Wilson>These are ringside seats.

165
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,140
<4-18,House>摄像机也在拳击台底下
<4-18,House>Cameras are ringside too.

166
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,620
<4-18,House>如果你愿意  我也可以把汗  口水还有血
<4-18,House>If you want, I could sweat and spit

167
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,480
<4-18,House>时不时的往你身上洒
<4-18,House>and bleed on you from time to time.

168
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,700
<4-19,Wilson>如果可以  我一定带你去
<4-19,Wilson>I'd take you if I could.

169
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,700
<4-20,House>只要咱俩中有人能去  我就会去
<4-20,House>Well, I'd take me if either of us could.

170
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,270
<4-20,House>我还真是处于两难的境地啊
<4-20,House>See what a tough spot I'm in?

171
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,110
<4-21,Wilson>我要去看那场比赛
<4-21,Wilson>I'm going to that fight.

172
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,530
<4-22,House>好吧  另一张票给我
<4-22,House>All right, I'll take the other ticket.

173
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,520
<4-22,House>让我来操心怎么去的问题
<4-22,House>Let me worry about logistics.

174
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,290
<5-1,Chase>病人的心脏瓣膜正常
<5-1,Chase>Patient's heart valves are normal.

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,060
<5-1,Chase>不是心内膜炎
<5-1,Chase>It's not endocarditis.

176
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,490
<5-1,Chase>但他心包膜增厚  说不通啊
<5-1,Chase>But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.

177
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,820
<5-2,House>他心脏有问题
<5-2,House>He has a heart problem

178
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,810
<5-2,House>但却不是导致短暂性脑缺血发作的原因
<5-2,House>but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.

179
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,220
<5-3,Adams>梅毒性血管炎可能导致短暂性脑缺血发作
<5-3,Adams>Syphilitic vasculitis would explain the T.I.A.

180
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,820
<5-3,Adams>和心包膜炎
<5-3,Adams>and the pericardial inflammation.

181
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,060
<5-4,Park>梅毒测试呈阴性
<5-4,Park>Syph test was negative.

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,060
<5-4,Park>此外  这个孩子从来没有过性行为
<5-4,Park>Plus, the kid's never been sexually active.

183
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,830
<5-5,House>这个  我从他的病例
<5-5,House>Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart

184
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,300
<5-5,House>"生日小丑"那一栏就知道了
<5-5,House>that says "Birthday clown."

185
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,270
<5-6,Taub>他的生父是马戏团小丑
<5-6,Taub>His late father was a circus clown.

186
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,580
<5-7,Chase>组织胞浆菌病
<5-7,Chase>Histoplasmosis?

187
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,100
<5-8,House>他没有免疫系统缺陷
<5-8,House>He's not immuno-compromised.

188
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,940
<5-8,House>我想你将这无关紧要的一点提出来
<5-8,House>And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,040
<5-8,House>是因为他对父亲盲目的敬意打动了你
<5-8,House>because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute

190
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,520
<5-8,House>觉得你也理应把女儿留在新泽西
<5-8,House>and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,580
<5-9,Adams>如果他免疫系统过于活跃呢
<5-9,Adams>What if he has a heightened immune system?

192
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,260
<5-10,Taub>我提到这一点是因为
<5-10,Taub>I mentioned it because...

193
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,170
<5-11,House>慢慢来  不着急
<5-11,House>Take your time.

194
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,060
<5-11,House>我们先继续讨论医学
<5-11,House>We'll continue with the medicine.

195
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,560
<5-12,Adams>干燥综合症可能导致慢性心包炎
<5-12,Adams>Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis

197
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,490
<5-12,Adams>及脑动脉炎
<5-12,Adams>and cerebral arteritis.

198
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,750
<5-13,House>就是干燥综合症
<5-13,House>Sjogren's it is.

199
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,570
<5-13,House>用静脉注射免疫抑制剂进行治疗
<5-13,House>IV immunosuppressants to treat.

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,560
<5-13,House>有要补充的吗
<5-13,House>Anything?

201
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,960
<6-1,Taub>这会使你的免疫系统恢复正常
<6-1,Taub>This will calm your immune system.

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,000
<6-1,Taub>这周内你就可以出院了
<6-1,Taub>Should be out of here within the week.

203
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,860
<6-2,Ben>我妈妈听到了一定很高兴
<6-2,Ben>My mom will be happy to hear that.

204
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,670
<6-2,Ben>我得到个实习机会  三周后开始
<6-2,Ben>I've got an internship that starts in three weeks.

205
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,930
<6-3,Taub>我想应该不是在马戏团吧
<6-3,Taub>I take it it's not at a place with a big top.

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,660
<6-4,Ben>是在我继父的律师事务所
<6-4,Ben>It's at my stepdad's law office.

207
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,240
<6-4,Ben>我知道我还不擅长扮演小丑
<6-4,Ben>I know I'm not any good at being a clown yet,

208
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,570
<6-4,Ben>但当我听到他们的笑声
<6-4,Ben>but when I do get a laugh

209
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,000
<6-4,Ben>看到孩子们眼里闪着喜悦  我很开心
<6-4,Ben>and see those kids' eyes light up,

210
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,370
<6-4,Ben>我还是孩子时  爸爸给我的就是这种感觉
<6-4,Ben>that's how my Dad made me feel when I was a kid.

211
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,930
<6-5,Taub>你得坚持这一点
<6-5,Taub>You need to hang on to that.

212
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,270
<6-6,Ben>我妈妈说他是个很有爱心的父亲
<6-6,Ben>My mom says he was a loving father

213
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,500
<6-6,Ben>但一直很穷  到处进行表演
<6-6,Ben>but always broke and always on the road.

214
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,720
<6-6,Ben>这样维持生计太傻了
<6-6,Ben>It's just a stupid way to make a living.

215
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,710
<6-7,Taub>你才十六岁  有大把的时间可以去赚钱
<6-7,Taub>You're 16. Plenty of time to make money.

216
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,950
<6-7,Taub>想和你的父亲建立心灵的联系
<6-7,Taub>Wanting to build a connection with your dad

217
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,450
<6-7,Taub>将他带给你的快乐传递下去
<6-7,Taub>and pass on some of the joy that he gave you,

218
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,860
<6-7,Taub>这想法一点都不傻
<6-7,Taub>that's not stupid at all.

219
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,360
<6-8,Taub>我来吧
<6-8,Taub>I got it.

220
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,160
<6-9,Ben>这  这是药物治疗导致的吗
<6-9,Ben>Is, uh, is this because of the medication?

221
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
<6-9,Ben>这正常吗
<6-9,Ben>Is it normal?

222
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,180
<6-10,Taub>不正常  不是干燥综合症
<6-10,Taub>It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.

223
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,780
<7-1,Taub>短暂性脑缺血发作  心包膜增厚
<7-1,Taub>T.I.A., thickened pericardium,

224
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,770
<7-1,Taub>现在他的鼻子和嘴巴都在流血
<7-1,Taub>and now he's bleeding from his nose and mouth.

225
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,300
<7-2,Taub>你抱着她干什么
<7-2,Taub>What are you doing with her?

226
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,600
<7-2,Taub>她
<7-2,Taub>"Her"?

227
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
<7-3,House>话说这个小开心果有名字吧
<7-3,House>Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.

228
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,900
<7-4,Taub>这是苏菲
<7-4,Taub>It's Sophie.

229
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,840
<7-5,Chase>你的两个孩子都叫
<7-5,Chase>Both your kids are named--

230
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,920
<7-6,Taub>她是苏菲  另外一个是苏菲娅
<7-6,Taub>She's Sophie. The other one's Sophia.

231
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,790
<7-6,Taub>差别很大的
<7-6,Taub>It's different enough.

232
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,080
<7-7,Adams>它们确实有两个截然不同的衍生词
<7-7,Adams>They actually have two completely different derivations.

233
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,960
<7-7,Adams>实际上没有
<7-7,Adams>No, they don't.

234
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,990
<7-8,Taub>我现在没有心情争论
<7-8,Taub>I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.

235
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,990
<7-8,Taub>她怎么在这里
<7-8,Taub>Why is she here?

236
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,160
<7-9,House>露比带她来的
<7-9,House>Ruby dropped her off.

237
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,870
<7-9,House>她看起来有些担心
<7-9,House>Seemed pretty upset.

238
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,630
<7-9,House>显然有人忘记了今晚轮到爸爸带孩子
<7-9,House>Apparently someone forgot that it was Daddy's night.

239
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,870
<7-9,House>直到我说我会让你早点下班
<7-9,House>She wasn't even gonna leave her

240
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,230
<7-9,House>她才肯把孩子放这里
<7-9,House>until I said that I was letting you off early.

241
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,740
<7-10,Taub>妈的  我才回到团队
<7-10,Taub>Damn it. I just started back on the team.

242
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,970
<7-10,Taub>我的日程安排一团乱
<7-10,Taub>My schedule's a mess.

243
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,670
<7-11,Park>如果你的孩子们也是原因之一
<7-11,Park>If your own kids are a scheduling item,

244
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,710
<7-11,Park>你或许该让其中之一离开
<7-11,Park>maybe you should let one of them move.

245
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,610
<7-12,Taub>病人血小板数量很低
<7-12,Taub>Patient has low platelets.

246
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,150
<7-12,Taub>我觉得可能是弥散性血管内凝血
<7-12,Taub>makes me think D.I.C.

247
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,150
<7-13,House>看来她不赞成啊
<7-13,House>She doesn't seem to like that idea.

248
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,290
<7-13,House>你说的对哦
<7-13,House>You're right.

249
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,140
<7-13,House>他的血液涂片中没有裂红细胞
<7-13,House>He has no schistocytes in his smear.

250
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,370
<7-14,Park>他的红细胞数也很低
<7-14,Park>He also has a low red count.

251
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,750
<7-14,Park>会不会是腹膜后出血
<7-14,Park>What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?

252
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,210
<7-15,Chase>胁腹部并没出现血斑
<7-15,Chase>No Grey-Turner's sign.

253
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,880
<7-16,House>她没有我抱她的时候开心哦
<7-16,House>She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her.

254
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,590
<7-16,House>可能她喜欢我的声音
<7-16,House>Maybe she likes the sound of my voice,

255
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,610
<7-16,House>好奇怪啊  我和她没有血缘关系啊
<7-16,House>which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her.

256
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,210
<7-16,House>难道她分不清谁是亲生父亲
<7-16,House>Could it be she doesn't know the difference?

257
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,810
<7-17,Taub>你果然是孩子太多了
<7-17,Taub>So many children of your own.

258
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,120
<7-17,Taub>难怪对我和我宝宝的关系
<7-17,Taub>No wonder you have such insight

259
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,540
<7-17,Taub>有如此深刻的见解
<7-17,Taub>into my relationship with my babies.

260
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,310
<7-17,Taub>有道理
<7-17,Taub>Good point.

261
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,760
<7-18,House>我怎么能理解你呢
<7-18,House>How could I comprehend that

262
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,420
<7-18,House>可悲的给她们起一样的名字
<7-18,House>you're too despised to keep them from having the same name,

263
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,160
<7-18,House>压力太大记不住自己的日程
<7-18,House>too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar,

264
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,580
<7-18,House>都到这个地步了  还死要面子不承认
<7-18,House>and too vain to admit that at this stage,

265
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,490
<7-18,House>你对两个孩子来说都无关紧要
<7-18,House>you don't matter to either baby.

266
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,940
<7-19,Adams>白细胞数量低意味着感染
<7-19,Adams>Low white count suggests infection.

267
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,370
<7-20,House>如果你们都说对了呢
<7-20,House>What if you're all right?

268
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,960
<7-20,House>血小板低加上红细胞低加上白细胞低等于
<7-20,House>Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals--

269
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,290
<7-21,Chase>再生障碍性贫血
<7-21,Chase>Aplastic anemia.

270
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,260
<7-22,House>这孩子需要骨髓移植
<7-22,House>Kid needs a bone marrow transplant.

271
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,200
<7-22,House>除了亚当斯外  其他人
<7-22,House>Everyone except Adams,

272
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,770
<7-22,House>给他输入血小板  直到找到匹配的骨髓
<7-22,House>transfuse his platelets till you find a match.

273
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,050
<7-23,House>你上大学比别人晚了一个学期
<7-23,House>You started college a semester late

274
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,790
<7-23,House>因为你高中毕业晚了一个学期
<7-23,House>because you left high school a semester late

275
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,200
<7-23,House>因为高三时  你有五门不合格
<7-23,House>because you had five incompletes in your junior year.

276
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,230
<7-24,Adams>你想以我一个学期的不佳表现
<7-24,Adams>And you're offering one bad semester

277
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,900
<7-24,Adams>来证明我父母毁了我吗
<7-24,Adams>as proof that my parents screwed me up?

278
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,210
<7-25,House>在那之前学习马马虎虎  之后一直是优
<7-25,House>Did OK before that. Straight As after that.

279
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,900
<7-26,Adams>我那时处于叛逆期
<7-26,Adams>I went through a rebellious phase.

280
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,650
<7-27,House>不说我都知道
<7-27,House>Don't tell me.

281
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,700
<7-27,House>妈妈和爸爸吵得面红耳赤
<7-27,House>Mom and Dad were at each other's throats

282
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,230
<7-27,House>你以一塌糊涂的成绩来引起关注
<7-27,House>and the academic crisis was a cry for help.

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,980
<7-28,Adams>抱歉毁了你的世界观
<7-28,Adams>Sorry to mess with your world view,

284
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,840
<7-28,Adams>但我活得很好
<7-28,Adams>but I'm not messed up.

285
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,810
<7-28,Adams>我父母没有毁了我
<7-28,Adams>So my parents couldn't have messed me up.

286
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,810
<8-1,Chase>母亲的白细胞抗原只有3/6匹配
<8-1,Chase>Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.

287
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,790
<8-2,Park>祖母的匹配情况更糟糕
<8-2,Park>Maternal grandmother's worse than that.

288
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,900
<8-2,Park>你把孩子安置在哪里了
<8-2,Park>Where did you unload the baby?

289
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,510
<8-3,Taub>产科病房  闭嘴
<8-3,Taub>Maternity ward. Shut up.

290
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,300
<8-4,Adams>你应该意识到你正在印证豪斯的观点
<8-4,Adams>You realize you're making House's argument for him.

291
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,090
<8-5,Taub>你是指请日托照顾孩子的家长
<8-5,Taub>The part where he said any parent who uses day care

292
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,680
<8-5,Taub>该将孩子送到大陆另一边吗
<8-5,Taub>should ship their child across the country?

293
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,920
<8-6,Adams>不  是他说孩子不需要你的那部分
<8-6,Adams>No, the part where he said that baby doesn't need you.

294
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,100
<8-6,Adams>你每周只有一两天有权带孩子
<8-6,Adams>You've only got her a couple days a week

295
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,640
<8-6,Adams>而此期间绝大多时间孩子都和护士在一起
<8-6,Adams>and most of that's spent with a rotating cast of nurses.

296
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
<8-7,Chase>所以她老爸也喜欢围着护士转
<8-7,Chase>That's how Daddy likes to spend his time too.

297
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,630
<8-8,Taub>闭嘴
<8-8,Taub>Shut up.

298
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,050
<8-9,Adams>直系堂兄也不匹配
<8-9,Adams>First cousin's also a whiff.

299
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,280
<8-10,Park>亲属的测试结果都没戏
<8-10,Park>So much for genetics mattering.

300
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,130
<8-10,Park>我试试看骨髓登记库
<8-10,Park>I'll try the marrow registry.

301
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,930
<9-1,Taub>朴克医生正在查找骨髓库
<9-1,Taub>Dr. Park is searching the registry.

302
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,520
<9-1,Taub>在等待期间给他注射血小板
<9-1,Taub>Transfusing his platelets

303
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,450
<9-1,Taub>会帮他保持健康
<9-1,Taub>will keep him healthy while we wait.

304
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,910
<9-2,Chase>你确定父亲那边没有人了吗
<9-2,Chase>Are you sure there's no one on the father's side of the family?

305
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,480
<9-2,Chase>如果有人匹配的话  事情就会顺利很多
<9-2,Chase>If one of them's a match, that'd speed things up a lot.

306
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,760
<9-3,Janey>他父母早逝
<9-3,Janey>His parents died young.

307
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,090
<9-3,Janey>他是独子
<9-3,Janey>He was an only child.

308
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,040
<9-3,Janey>就我所知没有亲人在世
<9-3,Janey>There's no living relatives that I know of.

309
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,320
<9-4,Taub>很快会有对策的
<9-4,Taub>Something will turn up soon.

310
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,020
<9-5,Ron>很快是多快  他会落掉很多课程吗
<9-5,Ron>How soon is soon? Will he miss a lot of school?

311
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,220
<9-6,Ben>实际上我在想拿到高中毕业证就好了
<9-6,Ben>I'm actually thinking of just getting my GED.

312
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,300
<9-7,Janey>那你凭什么上所好的大学呢
<9-7,Janey>How do you expect to get into a good college?

313
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,600
<9-8,Ben>我会学习魔术和变戏法
<9-8,Ben>I'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling

314
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,560
<9-8,Ben>试着有所发展
<9-8,Ben>and try to make a go of this.

315
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
<9-9,Ron>本  只要你成绩好
<9-9,Ron>Ben, you keep your grades up,

316
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
<9-9,Ron>想干什么工作都可以
<9-9,Ron>you can do anything in the world.

317
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,590
<9-10,Ben>比如说  当无聊的办公室白领吗
<9-10,Ben>Like what? Work in some boring office?

318
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,450
<9-10,Ben>你认为我生父
<9-10,Ben>I mean, do you think my father

319
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,180
<9-10,Ben>会在这种工作上浪费时间吗
<9-10,Ben>would have done that for ten minutes?

320
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,150
<9-11,Janey>你不记得你父亲  你不知道
<9-11,Janey>You don't remember your father. You don't know...

321
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,830
<9-12,Ben>我想和他建立心灵上的联系
<9-12,Ben>I want to build a connection with him,

322
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,100
<9-12,Ben>将他给我带来的快乐传递下去
<9-12,Ben>pass on some of the...the joy that he gave me.

323
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,170
<9-12,Ben>我的背  好痛
<9-12,Ben>My, uh, my back hurts.

324
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,660
<9-13,Chase>他的血压在下降
<9-13,Chase>His BP is dropping.

325
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,250
<10-1,Man on Phone>我们认为负债问题应该都解决了
<10-1,Man on Phone>We think we've dealt with all the liability issues.

326
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,920
<10-2,Foreman>我在开会
<10-2,Foreman>I'm in a meeting.

327
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,670
<10-2,Foreman>对不起
<10-2,Foreman>Sorry.

328
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,080
<10-3,House>因为你呼叫了我  我不想让你久等
<10-3,House>Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting.

329
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,580
<10-4,Foreman>我是呼叫了你  接下来就和你谈
<10-4,Foreman>Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.

330
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,770
<10-5,House>没问题  我等着
<10-5,House>That's cool. I'll wait.

331
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,850
<10-6,Foreman>是个不错的开始
<10-6,Foreman>That's a good start.

332
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,880
<10-6,Foreman>我们逐条分析
<10-6,Foreman>Let's go through it point by point.

333
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,670
<10-6,Foreman>首先
<10-6,Foreman>First up...

334
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,650
<10-7,Foreman>我再打给你们
<10-7,Foreman>I'll call you back.

335
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,950
<10-8,Foreman>这是刚收到的
<10-8,Foreman>Just got this.

336
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,510
<10-8,Foreman>美国风湿病协会
<10-8,Foreman>The American Associate of Rheumatology

337
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,660
<10-8,Foreman>想让你周六九点在大西洋城做个演讲
<10-8,Foreman>wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday, in Atlantic City.

338
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,160
<10-8,Foreman>纽辛格医生最后时刻放了他们鸽子
<10-8,Foreman>Dr. Neusinger canceled on them at the last minute.

339
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,970
<10-9,House>我讨厌开会
<10-9,House>I hate conferences.

340
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,300
<10-10,Foreman>这次会议很隆重  而且又是黄金档的演讲
<10-10,Foreman>This is a big one, and it's the premium slot.

341
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,770
<10-10,Foreman>我想让你去
<10-10,Foreman>I'd like you to do it.

342
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,000
<10-10,Foreman>我会和你的假释官说明的
<10-10,Foreman>I'll clear it with your parole officer.

343
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,440
<10-10,Foreman>我要怎么回报你呢
<10-10,Foreman>What do I need to do for you?

344
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,830
<10-11,House>把我加倍的门诊时间减回去
<10-11,House>Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled

345
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,190
<10-11,House>把我减半的预算加回来
<10-11,House>and double the hooker budget that you recently halved.

346
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,490
<10-11,House>正如你所言  都是些小钱罢了
<10-11,House>I think you refer to it as petty cash.

347
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,420
<10-11,House>好的
<10-11,House>Fine.

348
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,470
<10-12,Foreman>只是有一点
<10-12,Foreman>Just one thing.

349
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,440
<10-12,Foreman>我会让他们把你的演讲安排在上午
<10-12,Foreman>I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning.

350
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,150
<10-12,Foreman>算是助人为乐吧
<10-12,Foreman>We're doing them a favor.

351
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,460
<10-12,Foreman>你何必在那里过夜呢
<10-12,Foreman>Why should you have to spend the night?

352
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
<10-13,House>你说黄金档应该是晚上九点吧
<10-13,House>You said that 9:00 was the premium slot.

353
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,800
<10-13,House>我的意思是  我干活总得干到位吧
<10-13,House>I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers.

354
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,330
<10-14,Foreman>到时候那地方会很混乱的
<10-14,Foreman>The place'll be a madhouse,

355
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,390
<10-14,Foreman>特别是因为
<10-14,Foreman>especially since it's two miles

356
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,970
<10-14,Foreman>那里离同时进行的卢比奥拳击赛只有两英里
<10-14,Foreman>from the Rubio Fight at the exact same time.

357
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,370
<10-14,Foreman>计划不错
<10-14,Foreman>Nice try.

358
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,050
<10-14,Foreman>你冒充纽辛格打电话去取消演讲
<10-14,Foreman>You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled,

359
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,960
<10-14,Foreman>然后又推荐你自己当候补
<10-14,Foreman>and suggested yourself as a replacement.

360
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,570
<10-14,Foreman>你去看比赛  就得进监狱
<10-14,Foreman>You go to that fight, you go to prison.

361
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,930
<10-15,House>进监狱真是多此一举
<10-15,House>But that'd be redundant,

362
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,280
<10-15,House>在这里就有个愤怒的黑人
<10-15,House>when I have an angry black guy

363
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,450
<10-15,House>伺机想要爆我菊花
<10-15,House>waiting for me to drop the soap right here.

364
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,280
<10-16,Foreman>你还是快去做那些加倍的门诊吧
<10-16,Foreman>Better go do some of those clinic hours I recently doubled.

365
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,500
<11-1,Monroe>给我做尿检
<11-1,Monroe>Test my urine.

366
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,320
<11-2,House>看来我的诊断有误
<11-2,House>Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.

367
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,790
<11-3,Monroe>是的  我得了糖尿病
<11-3,Monroe>Yeah. I have diabetes.

368
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,490
<11-4,House>不是糖尿病  但你也没得忧郁症
<11-4,House>No, but you're not a hypochondriac.

369
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,470
<11-4,House>否则在我否定糖尿病之后
<11-4,House>Or you would have imagined some new disease

370
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,130
<11-4,House>你又会想象出新的疾病
<11-4,House>after I shot down the first one.

371
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,420
<11-4,House>这是谁的尿样
<11-4,House>So whose urine is that?

372
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
<11-4,House>是你得糖尿病但没医疗保险的女朋友的
<11-4,House>Diabetic girlfriend without health insurance?

373
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,000
<11-5,Monroe>我没骗你  我是病了
<11-5,Monroe>It's not a scam. I'm sick.

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
<11-5,Monroe>我现在脚踝都肿了
<11-5,Monroe>Now I have swollen ankles.

375
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,050
<11-6,House>医学上这叫脚踝赘肉
<11-6,House>The medical term is cankles.

376
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,160
<11-6,House>是不是有哪个我不知道的
<11-6,House>Is there some black market in insulin

377
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,350
<11-6,House>贩卖胰岛素的黑市
<11-6,House>that I don't know about?

378
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,690
<11-7,Monroe>我这病是遗传的
<11-7,Monroe>It's in my genes.

379
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,560
<11-7,Monroe>我老爸五十岁时得了糖尿病
<11-7,Monroe>My old man got diabetes at 50.

380
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,120
<11-7,Monroe>我老哥也是在五十岁时发病的
<11-7,Monroe>My older brother got it at 50.

381
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,230
<11-7,Monroe>我刚好满五十
<11-7,Monroe>I just turned 50.

382
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,070
<11-8,House>别把糖尿病说得像块传家宝似的
<11-8,House>Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch.

383
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,080
<11-9,Monroe>和我父亲一样  我也有坐骨神经痛
<11-9,Monroe>I got sciatica, like my dad.

384
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,380
<11-9,Monroe>还有IV度痔疮
<11-9,Monroe>Class-four hemorrhoids, like him.

385
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,490
<11-9,Monroe>我得未雨绸缪
<11-9,Monroe>I need to get a jump on this thing.

386
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,140
<11-10,Chase>我们不得不中止输血
<11-10,Chase>We had to stop the transfusion.

387
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,120
<11-10,Chase>病人对捐献者的血小板过敏
<11-10,Chase>Patient's having an allergic reaction to donor platelets.

388
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,590
<11-11,Taub>母亲这边的亲属配型都不符
<11-11,Taub>No one in mom's family's a match,

389
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,760
<11-11,Taub>据她所知  父亲那边没有健在的亲属
<11-11,Taub>and as far as she knows, Dad has no living relatives.

390
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,250
<11-11,Taub>他死了好几年了
<11-11,Taub>It's been years since he died.

391
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,900
<11-12,House>如果孩子他爸死于黑色素瘤
<11-12,House>If the kid's Dad died young of melanoma,

392
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,250
<11-12,House>像她这样一个保护欲过强的母亲
<11-12,House>how come the overprotective mom

393
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,940
<11-12,House>怎么会不带儿子去看皮肤科呢
<11-12,House>never took him to a dermatologist?

394
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,770
<11-13,Monroe>你还给不给我做尿检了
<11-13,Monroe>Are you gonna test my urine or what?

395
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,310
<11-14,House>不是糖尿病
<11-14,House>Not diabetes.

396
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,090
<11-14,House>对血小板进行交叉配血
<11-14,House>Use cross-matched platelets.

397
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,670
<11-14,House>找些与他自身相近的血液给他输
<11-14,House>Try to find the patient some blood that's closer to his own.

398
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,290
<11-14,House>还要问清楚小丑一世的真实死因
<11-14,House>And get the real story on clown, senior's death.

399
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,870
<11-14,House>孩子他妈有所隐藏
<11-14,House>Mom's hiding something.

400
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,040
<11-14,House>很可能是和病因有关的信息
<11-14,House>It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.

401
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,790
<11-15,House>苹果汁
<11-15,House>Apple juice.

402
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,770
<11-15,House>简简单单升血糖
<11-15,House>Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.

403
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,540
<12-1,Taub>患黑色素瘤的家族史
<12-1,Taub>His family history of melanoma

404
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,400
<12-1,Taub>可能会改变他的细胞形态
<12-1,Taub>may have affected his cellular outlook.

405
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,710
<12-2,Chase>除非我们能获知
<12-2,Chase>If we had more data on

406
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,950
<12-2,Chase>他父亲患的是哪种黑色素瘤
<12-2,Chase>the exact type of melanoma his father had.

407
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,580
<12-3,Taub>否则  我们很难找到相符的骨髓配型
<12-3,Taub>Otherwise, we might not be able to find a marrow match.

408
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,490
<12-4,Janey>他没有得黑色素瘤
<12-4,Janey>He never had melanoma.

409
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,390
<12-5,Taub>那他怎么死的
<12-5,Taub>How did he die?

410
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,860
<12-6,Janey>他没死
<12-6,Janey>He didn't.

411
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,600
<12-6,Janey>他住在彭索金  换了个名字
<12-6,Janey>He lives in Pennsauken under a different name,

412
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,910
<12-6,Janey>现在叫米歇尔·戈登
<12-6,Janey>Mitchell Gordon.

413
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,560
<12-7,Ron>这事你怎么能瞒着我  瞒着本
<12-7,Ron>How could you keep this from me? From Ben?

414
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,160
<12-8,Janey>难道真的要让他知道
<12-8,Janey>He really needs to know

415
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,770
<12-8,Janey>他父亲只是他人生中一个过客
<12-8,Janey>his Dad just breezed in and out of his life,

416
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,240
<12-8,Janey>一直烂醉如泥而不负责任
<12-8,Janey>drunk and incoherent?

417
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,130
<12-8,Janey>我宁可让他对父亲抱有美好的回忆
<12-8,Janey>It's better to think the man's dead but decent.

418
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,680
<13-1,Wilson>你知道我得邀请别人去看卢比奥拳击赛
<13-1,Wilson>You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio Fight?

419
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,820
<13-2,House>不行  我才不管呢
<13-2,House>Nope. No realization whatsoever.

420
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,790
<13-3,Wilson>你脚上还绑着个追踪器呢
<13-3,Wilson>You have a Lojack on your leg.

421
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,810
<13-4,House>在付费电视上看比赛我很满足了
<13-4,House>I was happy watching the fight on pay-per-view.

422
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,150
<13-4,House>是你坚持要去大西洋城的
<13-4,House>You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.

423
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,960
<13-5,Wilson>你的生父是个规规矩矩的牧师
<13-5,Wilson>Your biological father was a decent, god-fearing minister.

424
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,370
<13-5,Wilson>你的养父是个铁石心肠的混蛋
<13-5,Wilson>The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.

425
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,530
<13-5,Wilson>我在揣测你为什么吃准了
<13-5,Wilson>I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced

426
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
<13-5,Wilson>亚当斯肯定受过父母的伤害
<13-5,Wilson>Adams has parentally inflicted damage.

427
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,540
<13-6,House>你在转移话题
<13-6,House>You're trying to deflect.

428
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,210
<13-7,Wilson>转移话题的是你
<13-7,Wilson>Now you are.

429
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,610
<13-7,Wilson>你强迫自己认为父母都会毁了他们的孩子
<13-7,Wilson>You have to believe that every parent screws up every child.

430
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,880
<13-7,Wilson>不然你就要承认你自己毁了美好的童年
<13-7,Wilson>Or you were screwed out of a decent childhood.

431
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,850
<13-8,House>我规规矩矩的牧师老爸
<13-8,House>My decent Daddy of the cloth

432
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,950
<13-8,House>找我的已婚老妈干些见不得人的勾当
<13-8,House>was also being indecent with my married Mom.

433
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,990
<13-8,House>他很可能还有别的孩子要带去游乐场
<13-8,House>He probably would have taken other kids to the playground.

434
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,570
<13-9,House>不是我的错  我家教不好
<13-9,House>It's not my fault. Bad parenting.

435
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,700
<14-1,Park>米歇尔·戈登
<14-1,Park>Mitchell Gordon?

436
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,400
<14-2,Mitchell>我已经信教了  你们走吧
<14-2,Mitchell>I've already got a religion. Go away.

437
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,620
<14-3,Taub>我们是医生
<14-3,Taub>We're doctors.

438
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,130
<14-3,Taub>你儿子本住院了  普林斯顿普雷斯波罗教学医院
<14-3,Taub>Your son Ben is in the hospital, at Princeton-Plainsboro.

439
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,420
<14-3,Taub>他病得很重
<14-3,Taub>He's very sick.

440
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,150
<14-4,Mitchell>我没有儿子  现在没有了
<14-4,Mitchell>Yeah, well, I don't have a son. Not anymore.

441
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,690
<14-5,Park>我们知道其中有些过结
<14-5,Park>We know there are some issues there,

442
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,480
<14-5,Park>但你的骨髓很可能能救他
<14-5,Park>but your bone marrow could cure him.

443
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,460
<14-6,Taub>离这两英里有家医院
<14-6,Taub>There's a hospital two miles from here.

444
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,730
<14-6,Taub>只需做个简单的检查
<14-6,Taub>It's a simple test.

445
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,830
<14-7,Mitchell>你说他在普林斯顿普雷斯波罗教学医院
<14-7,Mitchell>You said he was at Princeton-Plainsboro?

446
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,930
<14-8,Taub>他母亲认为在不同的医院
<14-8,Taub>His mother feels it's better

447
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,720
<14-8,Taub>做检查比较好
<14-8,Taub>to do the test at a different hospital.

448
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,840
<14-9,Mitchell>我就当没这个儿子吧
<14-9,Mitchell>Well, I guess I don't have a son anymore.

449
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,970
<15-1,Chase>豪斯是不会放弃的
<15-1,Chase>House isn't gonna give up.

450
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,010
<15-1,Chase>你就和他说说你父母吧  要么说个谎
<15-1,Chase>Just tell him about your parents or make up a lie.

451
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,440
<15-2,Adams>我不想说谎
<15-2,Adams>I don't want to lie.

452
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,780
<15-2,Adams>我不想证实他那个可笑的理论
<15-2,Adams>I don't want to validate his ridiculous theory.

453
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,270
<15-3,Chase>一点不可笑啊
<15-3,Chase>It's not ridiculous.

454
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,190
<15-3,Chase>即使完全出于善意  父母还是会伤害到子女
<15-3,Chase>Even the best-intentioned parents end up damaging their kids.

455
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,820
<15-4,Adams>你是个聪明成功的医生
<15-4,Adams>You're a smart, successful doctor.

456
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,340
<15-4,Adams>你哪里受到伤害了啊
<15-4,Adams>How much damage could you have?

457
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,920
<15-5,Chase>你知道我怎么会对医学感兴趣的吗
<15-5,Chase>Know how I got interested in medicine?

458
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,470
<15-5,Chase>我母亲喝醉的时候  没法照顾我
<15-5,Chase>When my mother drank, she couldn't handle me,

459
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,380
<15-5,Chase>就把我锁在父亲的书房里
<15-5,Chase>so she locked me in my father's study.

460
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,170
<15-5,Chase>我哭喊着  撞门  但无济于事
<15-5,Chase>Only so many hours you can cry and bang on the door

461
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,180
<15-5,Chase>几个小时后  我放弃了  找了些书来读
<15-5,Chase>before you give up, find something to read.

462
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,330
<15-5,Chase>我们的家庭在某方面都有缺陷
<15-5,Chase>We all have family dysfunction.

463
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,450
<15-5,Chase>这就是我们成功的原因
<15-5,Chase>That's why we're successful.

464
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,600
<15-5,Chase>为了弥补那个缺陷
<15-5,Chase>To fill that hole.

465
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,720
<15-6,Adams>我父母有很多钱
<15-6,Adams>My parents have a lot of money,

466
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,650
<15-6,Adams>但不是合法赚来的
<15-6,Adams>but they didn't make it legally.

467
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,460
<15-7,Chase>白领犯罪吗
<15-7,Chase>White-collar crime?

468
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,580
<15-8,Adams>是从纸牌游戏开始的
<15-8,Adams>It started with card games.

469
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,440
<15-8,Adams>高赌注的扑克
<15-8,Adams>High-stakes poker.

470
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,660
<15-8,Adams>后来我爸爸开始接触麻醉毒品
<15-8,Adams>Then my dad got into narcotics,

471
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,100
<15-8,Adams>起初只是卖  后来自己也开始用
<15-8,Adams>at first just selling but then using too,

472
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,150
<15-8,Adams>不然他也绝不会卷入贩卖奴隶的买卖
<15-8,Adams>or he never would have gotten into the slave trade.

473
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,280
<15-8,Adams>大部分是孩子  很容易塞进小箱子里
<15-8,Adams>Children mostly. Easier to pack in small crates.

474
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,180
<15-8,Adams>而且运费要便宜得多
<15-8,Adams>Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.

475
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,080
<15-9,House>连同事你都不信任
<15-9,House>Won't even trust a co-worker.

476
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,050
<15-9,House>你父母到底对你做了什么
<15-9,House>What did your parents do to you?

477
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,080
<16-1,Taub>你得亲自去见他了
<16-1,Taub>You have to go see him yourself.

478
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,120
<16-1,Taub>他都不愿意开第二次门
<16-1,Taub>He wouldn't even come to the door a second time.

479
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,970
<16-2,Janey>好吧  我开车去一趟
<16-2,Janey>Okay. I'll drive over there.

480
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,450
<16-3,Taub>是胸腔积液
<16-3,Taub>It's a pleural effusion.

481
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,750
<16-4,Park>他之前有过出血问题
<16-4,Park>He had a bleeding problem earlier.

482
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,010
<16-4,Park>一定是血液流进了肺
<16-4,Park>Must be bleeding into his lungs.

483
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,940
<16-5,Park>但是没有血
<16-5,Park>Except there's no blood.

484
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,000
<16-6,Janey>这说明了什么
<16-6,Janey>What does that mean?

485
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,670
<16-7,Park>说明你不用去了
<16-7,Park>It means you don't have to make that drive.

486
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,820
<16-7,Park>不是骨髓的问题
<16-7,Park>The problem isn't his marrow.

487
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,100
<16-7,Park>是肝脏
<16-7,Park>It's his liver.

488
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,000
<17-1,House>肝功能衰竭  解释了所有症状
<17-1,House>Liver failure. Explains everything.

489
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,500
<17-1,House>问题是  什么才能解释肝功能衰竭
<17-1,House>The question is, what explains the liver failure?

490
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,680
<17-2,Adams>不是感染
<17-2,Adams>It's not an infection.

491
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,740
<17-2,Adams>我们用了抗生素  但是他没有反应
<17-2,Adams>We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding.

492
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,000
<17-3,House>我很好奇  他妈妈为什么要
<17-3,House>More curiously, what explains the mom

493
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,020
<17-3,House>撒谎说他爸已经入土了
<17-3,House>lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?

494
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,200
<17-4,Park>这就是你打算去看拳击游戏的计划吗
<17-4,Park>This is how you plan to get to the boxing game?

495
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,720
<17-5,Chase>你没什么看她
<17-5,Chase>Why are you looking at her?

496
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,640
<17-6,House>因为我震惊了  我总得看点什么
<17-6,House>'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something.

497
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,960
<17-6,House>比赛  回合赛  争霸赛  竞赛  大赛  海伦娜
<17-6,House>Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena.

499
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,620
<17-6,House>几乎所有的词都能放在"拳击"后面
<17-6,House>Almost anything works after "Boxing,"

500
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,010
<17-6,House>除了"游戏"
<17-6,House>except the word "Game."

501
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,080
<17-7,Adams>你更大的问题在于
<17-7,Adams>Your bigger problem is,

502
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,460
<17-7,Adams>设计那玩意的人不是傻子
<17-7,Adams>people who design those things aren't idiots.

503
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,260
<17-9,House>你能相信她以前是在监狱工作的吗
<17-9,House>Can you believe she used to work in the can?

504
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,180
<17-9,House>没有东西是无坚不摧的
<17-9,House>Nothing is tamper-proof.

505
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,350
<17-10,Taub>是蛋白质合成的问题
<17-10,Taub>It's a synthetic problem.

506
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,900
<17-10,Taub>他的肝脏无法合成蛋白质
<17-10,Taub>His liver's not synthesizing proteins,

507
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,730
<17-10,Taub>导致体液渗漏出了血管
<17-10,Taub>so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels.

508
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
<17-10,Taub>还有  他妈妈就是个自私的混蛋
<17-10,Taub>And mom's a selfish jerk.

509
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,200
<17-10,Taub>她另攀高枝  嫁了律师
<17-10,Taub>She traded up, married a lawyer,

510
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,500
<17-10,Taub>想忘掉那个低贱的马戏团小丑
<17-10,Taub>wants to forget the lowly circus clown.

511
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,090
<17-11,House>你为父亲辩护是因为你觉得自己就是个混蛋
<17-11,House>You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk

512
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,430
<17-11,House>因为你在两个烤箱里烤面包
<17-11,House>for baking buns in two different ovens.

514
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,830
<17-11,House>你想要相信那虚无缥缈的生理联系
<17-11,House>You want to believe the mythical biological connection

515
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,840
<17-11,House>为你出轨找借口
<17-11,House>excuses being a man slut.

516
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,720
<17-11,House>不知怎的我开始质疑你的专业水准了
<17-11,House>I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise.

517
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,850
<17-11,House>你的确登了个分类广告
<17-11,House>You do have a classified ad

518
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,700
<17-11,House>现在手里还有一根铁棒子
<17-11,House>and a piece of metal.

519
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,940
<17-12,Workman>它是温控的  不能靠蛮力
<17-12,Workman>It's temperature that sets it off, not force.

520
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,130
<17-12,Workman>铆钉一撬开  我就把加热板塞进去
<17-12,Workman>The rivets go pop, I slide in the heating pad.

521
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,990
<17-12,Workman>毛毛雨啦
<17-12,Workman>Easy peasy.

522
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,340
<17-13,Chase>病人更像是有高氨血症的问题
<17-13,Chase>More likely the patient has a hyperammonemic problem.

523
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,890
<17-13,Chase>他的肝脏无法清理血液中的毒素
<17-13,Chase>His liver's not cleaning out his blood.

524
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,450
<17-13,Chase>累积的毒素导致了所有的问题
<17-13,Chase>The buildup of toxins is causing everything.

525
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,440
<17-14,Taub>我维护爸爸是因为他很惨
<17-14,Taub>I'm defending the dad because he got screwed.

526
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,240
<17-14,Taub>他失去儿子之后又失去了工作
<17-14,Taub>After he lost his son, he lost his job.

527
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,290
<17-14,Taub>反复出入戒毒所  放弃做小丑
<17-14,Taub>Been in and out of rehab, gave up clowning.

528
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,780
<17-14,Taub>没错  作为一个父亲  我同情他
<17-14,Taub>Yes, as a parent, I empathize.

529
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,950
<17-14,Taub>要我说我们该告诉那孩子
<17-14,Taub>I say we tell the kid.

530
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,550
<17-15,Park>他未成年  他妈妈是他的监护人
<17-15,Park>He's a minor, the mom's his guardian,

531
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,620
<17-15,Park>而且这跟医学也没关系
<17-15,Park>and it's not even medically relevant.

532
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,460
<17-16,Taub>她剥夺了十二年父子相处的时间
<17-16,Taub>She robbed them of 12 years together.

533
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,890
<17-17,House>或者她应该早点踹了他爸
<17-17,House>Or she ripped off the band-aid too late.

534
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,290
<17-17,House>她让她儿子确定自己是小丑的后代
<17-17,House>That memory that she let son of bozo establish

535
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,310
<17-17,House>导致他本可以在波兰过高品质的生活
<17-17,House>is making him chase his father's moronic profession

536
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,210
<17-17,House>结果却在追求一份他爸干的白痴工作
<17-17,House>when he could be living the high life in Portland.

537
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,650
<17-17,House>当然说波兰只是打个比方
<17-17,House>And I mean that metaphorically, of course.

538
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,300
<17-18,House>你是想给我秀下你酷炫牛X的应急手法吧
<17-18,House>This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.

539
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,190
<17-19,House>我明白为啥人们都不愿
<17-19,House>I see why employers are reluctant

540
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,250
<17-19,House>雇用以前是诈骗犯的人了
<17-19,House>to hire ex-cons.

541
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,500
<17-20,Adams>病人怎么办
<17-20,Adams>Well, what about the patient?

542
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,290
<17-20,Adams>到底是高氨血症还是蛋白合成不足
<17-20,Adams>Is the problem hyperammonemic or synthetic?

543
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,370
<17-21,Chase>不能两个都治
<17-21,Chase>Can't treat for both.

544
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,960
<17-21,Chase>一个需要血液透析  一个需要肝脏移植
<17-21,Chase>One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant,

545
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,780
<17-21,Chase>我们都找不到和那孩子匹配的骨髓
<17-21,Chase>and we couldn't even get the kid a marrow match.

546
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,080
<17-22,House>征得他妈妈的同意给他灌满蛋白质
<17-22,House>Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein.

547
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,810
<17-22,House>如果是蛋白质合成不足
<17-22,House>If it's a synthetic problem,

548
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,930
<17-22,House>液体会渗入他的胸腔  导致心力衰竭
<17-22,House>more fluid will leak into his chest and his heart will fail.

549
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,990
<17-22,House>如果是高氨血症
<17-22,House>If it's hyperammonemic,

550
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,530
<17-22,House>毒素会淹没他的身体  他会陷入昏迷
<17-22,House>toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma.

551
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,850
<17-23,Park>你是不是只喜欢有致死性风险的检查
<17-23,Park>Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?

552
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,950
<17-24,House>确实有又慢又没用的检查
<17-24,House>There are some slower, less conclusive tests,

553
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,970
<17-24,House>不过干嘛要冒那个风险呢
<17-24,House>but why take that risk?

554
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,450
<18-1,Man holding receiver>在这里
<18-1,Man holding receiver>In here.

555
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,850
<18-2,House>我的天  是水
<18-2,House>Oh, my God. The water.

556
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,770
<18-2,House>这完全是我的错
<18-2,House>This is completely my fault.

557
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,360
<18-2,House>这有很大的风险
<18-2,House>There are very serious risks,

558
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
<18-2,House>但如果我们不搞清楚他得的是什么病
<18-2,House>but if we don't figure out what he has,

559
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,850
<19-1,Taub>我们就无从下手治疗
<19-1,Taub>we can't treat him at all.

560
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,030
<19-2,Taub>我这么说也许有点过份
<19-2,Taub>I may be a little out of bounds here,

561
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,090
<19-2,Taub>但以防万一有什么并发症
<19-2,Taub>but in case there are complications,

562
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,290
<19-2,Taub>这也许是向你儿子坦白的好时机
<19-2,Taub>it might be a good time to come clean to your son,

563
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,520
<19-2,Taub>让他父亲来探望
<19-2,Taub>let his father visit.

564
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,910
<19-3,Janey>这是有"点"过份吗
<19-3,Janey>A little out of bounds?

565
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,050
<19-4,Taub>我不知道发生过什么  但人人都会犯错
<19-4,Taub>I don't know the history, but everyone makes mistakes.

566
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,670
<19-4,Taub>你儿子很崇拜他
<19-4,Taub>Your son worships him.

567
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,980
<19-5,Ron>医生说得对
<19-5,Ron>Doctor's right about that.

568
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,310
<19-6,Janey>是吗  他是什么时候开始崇拜的
<19-6,Janey>Oh, yeah? And when did he learn that?

569
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,480
<19-6,Janey>他鼓励本辍学的时候吗
<19-6,Janey>When he encouraged Ben to drop out of school?

570
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,180
<19-6,Janey>米歇尔不是本的父亲
<19-6,Janey>Mitchell is not Ben's father

571
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,230
<19-6,Janey>他只不过是个精子捐献者
<19-6,Janey>any more than a sperm donor would have been.

572
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,930
<19-6,Janey>豪斯医生
<19-6,Janey>Dr. House?

573
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,060
<20-1,House>除非你是个锁匠
<20-1,House>Unless you're a locksmith

574
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,350
<20-1,House>或者跟政府合作的电工  否则我很忙
<20-1,House>or an electrician with political contacts, I'm busy.

575
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,760
<20-1,House>我丈夫看过你的门诊
<20-1,House>My husband saw you in the clinic.

576
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,110
<20-2,House>想要治疗糖尿病
<20-2,House>Wants treatment for diabetes.

577
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,280
<20-2,House>对你们即将到来的离婚致哀
<20-2,House>My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.

578
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,150
<20-2,House>他不停的想象症状
<20-2,House>He keeps imagining symptoms,

579
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,010
<20-3,House>现在我不得不给他做那些恶心的降糖餐
<20-3,House>and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.

580
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,070
<20-3,House>既然我没打算给他做检查
<20-3,House>Since I have no intention of testing him,

581
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,080
<20-3,House>也没打算治疗他  或者给他做饭
<20-3,House>treating him, or cooking for him--

582
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,960
<20-3,House>你可以给我开个假的胰岛素处方吗
<20-3,House>Could you write me a fake prescription for insulin?

583
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,860
<20-4,House>假处方的好处就在于
<20-4,House>The advantage of fake prescriptions is,

584
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,990
<20-4,House>不用非得让真的医生开
<20-4,House>you don't have to be a real doctor to write one.

585
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,640
<20-4,House>告诉我注射什么在他大腿里是安全的就好
<20-4,House>Just tell me what's safe to inject in his thigh.

586
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,270
<20-4,House>他的症状就会消失
<20-4,House>His symptoms will go away

587
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,120
<18-1,Man holding receiver>然后我就可以告诉他他从来没得过糖尿病
<18-1,Man holding receiver>and then I can show him he was never sick.

588
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,010
<18-2,House>水行吗
<18-2,House>Water?

589
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,390
<20-5,House>想象的药不是我的专长
<20-5,House>Imaginary medicine is not my specialty.

590
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,050
<20-5,House>我确实有个想象的同事
<20-5,House>I do have an imaginary colleague

591
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,100
<20-5,House>刚刚想象的传呼了我一下
<20-5,House>who's just sent me an imaginary page.

592
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,280
<20-5,House>想象我有多抱歉
<20-5,House>Imagine how sorry I am.

593
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,030
<21-1,Chase>还在为刚才实验室的事生气吗
<21-1,Chase>Still mad about what happened in the lab?

594
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,170
<21-2,Adams>我没生气  我这是专业
<21-2,Adams>I'm not mad. I'm being professional.

595
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,190
<21-3,Chase>你说你挺好
<21-3,Chase>You claim you're not screwed up.

596
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,450
<21-3,Chase>你也许真的相信了
<21-3,Chase>You may even believe it.

597
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,350
<21-3,Chase>但是豪斯不信  我也不信
<21-3,Chase>But House doesn't and I don't,

598
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,300
<21-3,Chase>所以你可以等到
<21-3,Chase>so you can wait

599
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,660
<21-3,Chase>他在你爸妈的草坪上扎营
<21-3,Chase>till he camps out on your parents' lawn

600
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,900
<21-3,Chase>或者你可以承认你跟我们是一撮的
<21-3,Chase>or you can admit you don't live on some higher plane

601
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,200
<21-3,Chase>然后再谢我
<21-3,Chase>and thank me later.

602
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,140
<21-4,Ben>我的  我的眼睛感觉很奇怪
<21-4,Ben>My, uh, my eye feels weird.

603
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,190
<21-4,Ben>我怎么了
<21-4,Ben>What's happening to me?

604
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,000
<21-4,Ben>你看起来很疲倦
<21-4,Ben>You look tired.

605
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,730
<22-1,Taub>我讨厌人们这么说
<22-1,Taub>I hate it when people say that.

606
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,210
<22-2,Ruby>我知道  我看起来很糟
<22-2,Ruby>I know, I look bad.

607
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,250
<22-3,Taub>我以为你昨晚会早睡的
<22-3,Taub>I thought you were gonna go to bed early last night.

608
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,080
<22-4,Ruby>我白痴一般的跟我闺蜜们出去
<22-4,Ruby>Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends

609
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,170
<22-4,Ruby>假装我还有生活
<22-4,Ruby>to pretend I have a life,

610
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,660
<22-4,Ruby>当我只是在跟一群对"妈妈"没兴趣的
<22-4,Ruby>when all I did was flirt with guys

611
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,570
<22-4,Ruby>男生调情的时候
<22-4,Ruby>who'd have no interest in a mom,

612
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,890
<22-4,Ruby>想念我迫不及待想要摆脱的宝宝
<22-4,Ruby>miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of,

613
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,820
<22-4,Ruby>然后又被我妈大吼一通
<22-4,Ruby>and then get yelled at by my mom

614
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,780
<22-4,Ruby>就因为在外面待到太晚
<22-4,Ruby>for staying out too late.

615
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,480
<22-5,Taub>-你得有自己住的地方  -没错
<22-5,Taub>- You need your own place. - Yes.

616
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,000
<22-6,Ruby>我搬回家是因为我住的地方四季漏风
<22-6,Ruby>I moved back home because it was too drafty at the four seasons.

617
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,490
<22-7,Taub>那就回医院工作呗
<22-7,Taub>So go back to work at the hospital.

618
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,140
<22-8,Ruby>日托的开销比我当护士赚的多多了
<22-8,Ruby>Day care costs more than what I earned as a nurse.

619
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,410
<22-9,Taub>你没考虑过差一点的吗
<22-9,Taub>Have you considered sub-standard day care?

620
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,220
<22-9,Taub>要不你今晚就住在这
<22-9,Taub>Why don't you stay here tonight?

621
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,180
<22-9,Taub>我的意思是你可以睡客房
<22-9,Taub>No. I mean, in the guest room.

622
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,580
<22-9,Taub>我能继续照看孩子
<22-9,Taub>I'll watch the baby again,

623
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,770
<22-9,Taub>你也能睡个好觉
<22-9,Taub>and you can get a real night's sleep.

624
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,210
<22-10,Ruby>你愿意这么做吗
<22-10,Ruby>You'd do that?

625
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,720
<22-11,Taub>双赢嘛
<22-11,Taub>Win-win.

626
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,240
<22-11,Taub>妈妈睡个好觉
<22-11,Taub>Mommy gets a rest,

627
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,100
<22-11,Taub>爸爸跟他的小天使多处会
<22-11,Taub>daddy gets more time with his little angel.

628
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,030
<22-11,Taub>后面的衣橱里有毛巾
<22-11,Taub>There's some sweats in the closet in the back.

629
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,030
<22-12,Taub>幸运的小孩
<22-12,Taub>Lucky girl.

630
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,870
<22-12,Taub>又能和爸爸睡一起了
<22-12,Taub>Gets another sleepover with da-da.

631
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,580
<22-12,Taub>还是不一样的
<22-12,Taub>It makes a difference.

632
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,880
<22-12,Taub>不是吗
<22-12,Taub>Doesn't it?

633
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,580
<23-1,House>你昨晚没回传呼
<23-1,House>Didn't answer your page last night.

634
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,060
<23-2,Taub>不好意思  电池没电了
<23-2,Taub>Sorry. Battery died.

635
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,620
<23-3,Chase>我们给病人注射了类固醇
<23-3,Chase>We got the patient's eye back in place

636
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,240
<23-3,Chase>他的眼球复位了
<23-3,Chase>with steroid injections,

637
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,440
<23-3,Chase>不过眼球肿胀表明不是肝脏的问题
<23-3,Chase>But a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.

638
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,170
<23-4,House>他母亲在孩子的病越来越糟时
<23-4,House>And mom's determination to keep dad away,

639
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,420
<23-4,House>仍决定不让父亲插手此事
<23-4,House>even as her kid gets sicker and sicker,

640
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,520
<23-4,House>意味着她有更大的隐情
<23-4,House>means she's got more to hide.

641
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,130
<23-5,Taub>这与诊断无关
<23-5,Taub>It's not diagnostically relevant.

642
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,070
<23-5,Taub>我们就别管了
<23-5,Taub>Let's let it drop.

643
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,410
<23-6,House>你刚失去了我的支持
<23-6,House>You just lost my vote.

644
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,310
<23-6,House>你可是父母权益的疯狂拥护者
<23-6,House>You flip-flopped on parental rights.

645
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,810
<23-7,Taub>我已经尽力说服他母亲了
<23-7,Taub>I've been trying to persuade the mother,

646
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,820
<23-7,Taub>但那是她儿子  她做主
<23-7,Taub>but it's her son, so it's her call.

647
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,280
<23-8,House>你的想法变化很大
<23-8,House>Well, that's very evolved of you.

648
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,060
<23-8,House>这么巨大的思想转变可不常见
<23-8,House>Don't usually see darwinian changes over breakfast.

649
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,700
<23-8,House>你跟菲尔好好谈了下
<23-8,House>You made nice-nice with Phil, you decided that

650
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,600
<23-8,House>你觉得他能成为一名称职的父亲
<23-8,House>he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.

651
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,220
<23-9,Taub>我昨晚和苏菲在一起
<23-9,Taub>I had Sophie again last night

652
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,830
<23-9,Taub>露比睡在我家客房
<23-9,Taub>and Ruby slept in my guest room,

653
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,650
<23-9,Taub>这跟菲尔没半点关系
<23-9,Taub>which has nothing to do with Phil,

654
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,930
<23-9,Taub>他永远不会是我孩子的父亲
<23-9,Taub>who will never be a father to my children.

655
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,230
<23-10,Adams>血管神经性水肿有可能造成迅速肿胀
<23-10,Adams>Angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.

656
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,030
<23-11,House>我们在这聊正事呢
<23-11,House>Hey, we're having a conversation here.

657
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,760
<23-11,House>没有腹痛
<23-11,House>No abdominal pain.

658
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,160
<23-11,House>和露比与孩子在同一屋檐下
<23-11,House>So that must have been nice, having Ruby

659
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,530
<23-11,House>感觉一定很美好
<23-11,House>and the baby under one roof.

660
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,790
<23-12,Taub>没错  女儿在我家我感觉很好
<23-12,Taub>Yes, it was nice having my daughter in my home.

661
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,660
<23-12,Taub>这也是我希望她姐姐住在我家附近的原因
<23-12,Taub>That's why I would like her sister to live near my home.

662
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,530
<23-13,Park>全身性水肿
<23-13,Park>Anasarca?

663
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,280
<23-14,Chase>那样肿胀会随重力移动
<23-14,Chase>Swelling would have followed gravity.

664
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,610
<23-15,House>这样整个关于父母的讨论不是又回到原点了
<23-15,House>Isn't that getting this whole parenting thing ass backwards?

665
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,070
<23-15,House>你不是该搞明白为使孩子们过的更好
<23-15,House>Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice

666
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,600
<23-15,House>你需要付出的代价是什么吗
<23-15,House>to maximize their niceness?

667
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,700
<23-16,Taub>你觉得我的代价就该是从他们的生活中消失吗
<23-16,Taub>And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?

668
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,700
<23-17,House>只是其中一个而已
<23-17,House>Just one life,

669
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,760
<23-17,House>直到另一个的母亲找到比你更好的人
<23-17,House>until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.

670
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,580
<23-18,Park>进展如此迅速的局部肿胀
<23-18,Park>Swelling that fast and localized

671
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,230
<23-18,Park>一般来源于淋巴结
<23-18,Park>has to come from the lymph nodes.

672
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,430
<23-18,Park>博吉特淋巴瘤
<23-18,Park>Burkitt's lymphoma.

673
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,760
<23-19,House>肿胀
<23-19,House>Swelling.

674
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,560
<23-19,House>脚踝赘肉
<23-19,House>Cankles.

675
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,980
<23-20,Taub>那不是博吉特淋巴瘤的症状
<23-20,Taub>That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.

676
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,510
<23-20,Taub>-你是想说是... -就是博吉特淋巴瘤
<23-20,Taub>- Are you saying it's-- - It's Burkitt's.

677
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,800
<23-21,House>准备化疗
<23-21,House>Prep him for chemo.

678
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,830
<24-1,Wilson>我认为你应该允许豪斯去
<24-1,Wilson>I think you should give House permission

679
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,950
<24-1,Wilson>亚特兰大城
<24-1,Wilson>to go to Atlantic city.

680
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,760
<24-1,Wilson>我们会去风湿病学会议的
<24-1,Wilson>We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.

681
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,010
<24-1,Wilson>-各得其所  -不
<24-1,Wilson>- Everyone's covered. - No.

682
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,970
<24-3,Wilson>那家伙赢得了去看场拳击赛的权利
<24-3,Wilson>The guy has earned the right to go to one boxing match.

683
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,570
<24-3,Wilson>他应要完成了每件事
<24-3,Wilson>He's done everything you've asked--

684
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,460
<24-3,Wilson>组建了自己的科室
<24-3,Wilson>Funded and staffed his own department.

685
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,070
<24-3,Wilson>甚至连交通规则都没违反
<24-3,Wilson>Hasn't even broken as much as a traffic law.

686
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,260
<24-4,Foreman>你说的没错
<24-4,Foreman>You're right.

687
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,990
<24-5,Wilson>那你会让他去
<24-5,Wilson>So you'll let him go?

688
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
<24-5,Wilson>不
<24-5,Wilson>No.

689
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,480
<24-6,Foreman>我明白他为什么想去看那场比赛
<24-6,Foreman>I get why he wants to go to that fight.

690
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,630
<24-6,Foreman>我自己也想去
<24-6,Foreman>I'd love to go myself,

691
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,080
<24-6,Foreman>这也是我阻止他的原因
<24-6,Foreman>which is kind of why I have to stop him.

692
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,970
<24-6,Foreman>我的职责就是做个混蛋
<24-6,Foreman>My job is to be the jerk.

693
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,410
<24-6,Foreman>必须让豪斯相信我的权威在他之上
<24-6,Foreman>House has to believe that I have authority over him.

694
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,830
<24-7,Wilson>他就是没法任人指挥
<24-7,Wilson>He can't function under someone's thumb.

695
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,140
<24-8,Foreman>我明白  这意味着你也不能去
<24-8,Foreman>I know, which means you can't go either.

696
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,410
<24-8,Foreman>你的职责是做他的朋友
<24-8,Foreman>Your job is to be his friend,

697
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,240
<24-8,Foreman>呆在这陪着他
<24-8,Foreman>to stay here and sit with him

698
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,580
<24-8,Foreman>在电视前看那场比赛然后一起说我的坏话
<24-8,Foreman>and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.

699
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,120
<24-8,Foreman>如果我们都尽职尽责
<24-8,Foreman>If we both do our jobs,

700
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,800
<24-8,Foreman>我们可能真能让他安全度过假释期
<24-8,Foreman>we might actually get him through his parole.

701
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,840
<24-8,Foreman>你是对的
<24-8,Foreman>You're right.

702
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,680
<25-1,Rachel>不好意思我们在这出现
<25-1,Rachel>Sorry to show up like this.

703
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,540
<25-2,Taub>我还等着一群律师呢
<25-2,Taub>I was expecting a battery of lawyers.

704
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,620
<25-3,Rachel>没有律师
<25-3,Rachel>No lawyers.

705
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,420
<25-3,Rachel>菲尔有些话想跟你说
<25-3,Rachel>Phil had something that he would like to say,

706
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,380
<25-3,Rachel>我觉得他应该当面跟你说
<25-3,Rachel>so I thought that he should say it in person.

707
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,500
<25-4,Phil>直接跟你说要把瑞秋
<25-4,Phil>It was wrong of me to confront you

708
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,600
<25-4,Phil>带去波特兰是我的不对
<25-4,Phil>about taking Rachel to Portland.

709
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,440
<25-5,Taub>你不想搬去波特兰吗
<25-5,Taub>You don't want to move to Portland?

710
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,440
<25-6,Rachel>我当然想  不过这也关系到你女儿
<25-6,Rachel>Of course I do, but this is about your daughter too

711
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,920
<25-6,Rachel>没有你的支持我是不会做这样的事的
<25-6,Rachel>and I'm not gonna do something like this without your support.

712
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,090
<25-7,Taub>你们俩是想通过扮红脸和红脸
<25-7,Taub>So you guys are trying to manipulate me

713
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,290
<25-7,Taub>来操纵我的想法吗
<25-7,Taub>by playing good cop/good cop?

714
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,280
<25-8,Rachel>你就把我想得这么不堪吗
<25-8,Rachel>Is that how little you think of me?

715
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,120
<25-8,Rachel>很明显你又开始给豪斯卖命了
<25-8,Rachel>It's clear you're back working for house.

716
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,630
<25-8,Rachel>周末你来接苏菲时再见吧
<25-8,Rachel>I will see you this weekend when you pick up Sophie.

717
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,310
<25-9,Taub>苏菲娅
<25-9,Taub>Sophia.

718
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,040
<25-10,Rachel>我们已经开始叫她苏菲了
<25-10,Rachel>We actually started calling her Sophie.

719
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,400
<25-11,Phil>没错
<25-11,Phil>Yeah.

720
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,670
<25-12,Taub>很好
<25-12,Taub>Great.

721
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,740
<25-12,Taub>挺可爱的
<25-12,Taub>It's cute.

722
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,620
<26-1,House>脚踝
<26-1,House>Cankles.

723
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,080
<26-1,House>你给我的处方有什么问题吗
<26-1,House>Is there some problem with the prescription you gave me?

724
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,050
<26-2,Monroe>我很虚弱  我体重又涨了
<26-2,Monroe>I'm faint. I've been gaining more weight.

725
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,920
<26-2,Monroe>我觉得我需要更大剂量
<26-2,Monroe>I think I need a bigger dose.

726
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,820
<26-3,House>如果你把他的安慰剂剂量加倍他会淹死的
<26-3,House>If you double his placebo, he might drown.

727
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,830
<26-3,House>还有  你没告诉我你心率缓慢
<26-3,House>Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.

728
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,010
<26-4,Monroe>我的心率并不
<26-4,Monroe>My--my heart rate is not--

729
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,520
<26-5,House>-52  -医学术语就叫作缓慢
<26-5,House>- 52. - The technical term is slow.

730
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,960
<26-5,House>你吃的那些可怕的抗糖尿病餐
<26-5,House>Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat,

731
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,490
<26-5,House>是不是有小白菜
<26-5,House>do they contain bok choy?

732
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,100
<26-5,House>有一磅左右 每天都有
<26-5,House>A pound of it. Every day.

733
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,370
<26-6,House>小白菜含有硫代葡萄糖酸盐会抑制甲状腺功能
<26-6,House>Bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function

734
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,290
<26-6,House>从而引起你所有的症状
<26-6,House>and account for all your symptoms.

735
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,220
<26-7,Monroe>那么说不是糖尿病
<26-7,Monroe>So this isn't diabetes?

736
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,620
<26-8,House>真是个悲剧的讽刺
<26-8,House>You have a bad case of irony.

737
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,870
<26-8,House>你吃用来阻止你生病的食物
<26-8,House>The food that you're eating to stop making you sick

738
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,310
<26-8,House>反而让你得病了
<26-8,House>is making you sick.

739
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,470
<26-9,Monroe>也许我根本就没遗传我爸的基因
<26-9,Monroe>Hey, maybe I don't have my father's crummy genes after all.

740
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,640
<26-10,House>另一方面  没有你爸  你的肥胖
<26-10,House>On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough

741
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,280
<26-10,House>可能也足以使你患糖尿病
<26-10,House>to get diabetes even without him.

742
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,450
<27-1,Ben>真不敢相信我得了癌症
<27-1,Ben>I can't believe I have cancer.

743
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,560
<27-2,Park>我们发现的早  应该没事的
<27-2,Park>We caught it early. You should be okay.

744
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,690
<27-3,Ben>我可能会死  我还没去过什么地方干过什么呢
<27-3,Ben>I could die. I never went anywhere, did anything.

745
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,030
<27-3,Ben>如果我父亲还活着
<27-3,Ben>If my father had lived,

746
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,820
<27-3,Ben>一切都会不一样的
<27-3,Ben>everything would have been different.

747
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,140
<27-4,Taub>你母亲和继父都很爱你
<27-4,Taub>Your mom and stepdad love you.

748
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,840
<27-4,Taub>他们给了你一个很棒的家
<27-4,Taub>They've given you a great home.

749
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,020
<27-4,Taub>这很重要
<27-4,Taub>That counts for a lot.

750
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,660
<27-5,Park>他不行了  各器官都在衰竭
<27-5,Park>He's crashing. Everything's shutting down.

751
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,230
<27-5,Park>肾衰竭  肺衰竭  心脏衰竭
<27-5,Park>Renal failure, lung failure, heart failure,

752
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,310
<28-1,Chase>都发生在我们进行化疗之前
<28-1,Chase>all before we started chemo.

753
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,540
<28-2,Taub>博吉特淋巴瘤发展速度很快  但不会这么快
<28-2,Taub>Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving, but not this fast.

754
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,760
<28-3,House>别急  重症监护病房在拉丁语中等于慢慢来
<28-3,House>No rush. ICU stands for take your time in latin.

755
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,980
<28-4,Park>多重动脉瘤
<28-4,Park>Multiple aneurysms.

756
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,910
<28-5,House>那意味着短暂性脑缺血发作后的一切症状
<28-5,House>That would mean that every symptom after his T.I.A.

757
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,050
<28-5,House>不过是巧合
<28-5,House>Was a coincidence.

758
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,690
<28-6,Adams>胆固醇栓子
<28-6,Adams>Cholesterol Emboli?

759
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,190
<28-7,House>答对了  完全吻合  去查病历
<28-7,House>Bingo. Fits perfectly. Check the file.

760
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,430
<28-7,House>证实我们给他做了大型腹腔手术
<28-7,House>Confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him

761
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,810
<28-7,House>却又完全遗忘了
<28-7,House>and then completely forgot about it.

762
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,330
<28-8,Taub>豪斯
<28-8,Taub>House.

763
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
<28-10,Janey>你来这里做什么
<28-10,Janey>What the hell are you doing here?

764
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,850
<28-11,Mitchell>我被告知这可能是见儿子的最后机会
<28-11,Mitchell>I was told that this might be my last chance to see my son.

765
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,980
<28-12,Janey>你没有这个权力  这与你无关
<28-12,Janey>You had no right! This is none of your business!

766
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,210
<28-13,Taub>-不是我  -是我叫他来的
<28-13,Taub>- I didn't. - I called him.

767
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,480
<28-14,Ron>他是本心目中的英雄
<28-14,Ron>This man's Ben's hero.

768
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,100
<28-14,Ron>就让他们在一起待五分钟
<28-14,Ron>Let them spend five minutes together.

769
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,520
<28-15,Janey>不  都给我出去
<28-15,Janey>No! Get out of here!

770
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,510
<28-15,Janey>等等
<28-15,Janey>Wait.

771
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,840
<28-16,House>你性侵犯了自己的儿子
<28-16,House>You sexually molested your son.

772
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,590
<28-16,House>你走路的姿势
<28-16,House>Your walk.

773
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,090
<28-16,House>脊髓痨
<28-16,House>Tabes dorsalis.

774
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,550
<28-16,House>你的梅毒已经到了晚期
<28-16,House>You have late-stage syphilis,

775
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,550
<28-16,House>你在大约十二年前将梅毒传给我们的病人
<28-16,House>which you gave to our patient presumably 12 years ago,

776
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,070
<28-16,House>因此母亲才极力反对父子团圆
<28-16,House>which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.

777
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,620
<28-17,Mitchell>我不该来的
<28-17,Mitchell>I shouldn't be here.

778
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,950
<28-18,Taub>我们测验过梅毒  为阴性
<28-18,Taub>We tested him for syphilis. He was negative.

779
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
<28-18,Taub>十二年过后
<28-18,Taub>After 12 years,

780
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,410
<28-19,House>他体内的活性病菌已经销声匿迹
<28-19,House>the active infection would have died down

781
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,290
<28-19,House>只有部分存在于脑动脉
<28-19,House>everywhere except the arteries in his brain,

782
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,200
<28-19,House>顺便躲过了我们的测验
<28-19,House>where it could hide out from our tests.

783
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,890
<28-19,House>六岁小李刚
<28-19,House>But when that six-year-old heckler

784
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,630
<28-19,House>一拳打在他蛋蛋上
<28-19,House>punched him in his juggling pins,

785
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,830
<28-19,House>激起了他骨盆中处于休眠状态的病菌
<28-19,House>it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.

786
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,930
<28-19,House>我们给他用的免疫抑制剂让病菌得以肆虐
<28-19,House>The immunosuppressants we gave him sent it into overdrive.

787
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,530
<28-19,House>我们给他用的抗体
<28-19,House>The antibiotics we gave him

788
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,550
<28-19,House>其实已经开始消灭梅毒
<28-19,House>actually started destroying the syphilis.

789
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,910
<28-19,House>但它们如同火上泼水
<28-19,House>But like pouring water on a fire,

790
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,240
<28-19,House>激起一片有毒烟气尘埃
<28-19,House>that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash

791
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,570
<28-19,House>使得他的免疫系统过度补偿
<28-19,House>which made his immune system overcompensate.

792
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,910
<28-21,House>贝佐尔德-亚里施反射
<28-21,House>Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.

793
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,950
<28-20,Ron>这是真的吗
<28-20,Ron>Is this true?

794
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,180
<28-21,House>没错  真有贝佐尔德-亚里施反射这回事
<28-21,House>Yes, Jarisch-Herxheimer is real.

795
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,340
<28-21,House>听起来有点儿傻  不过...
<28-21,House>It sounds silly, but...

796
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,470
<28-21,House>哦  你说的是那个...  好吧
<28-21,House>Oh, you mean the--the--right.

797
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,860
<28-22,Janey>我在他的衣服上发现了痕迹
<28-22,Janey>I found stains on his clothes.

798
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,050
<28-22,Janey>他当时还不懂  也没有受到创伤的迹象
<28-22,Janey>He didn't understand and he didn't seem traumatized.

799
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,300
<28-22,Janey>我试图跟他说起这件事  可是不久之后他就不记得了
<28-22,Janey>I kept trying to talk to him, but before long, he'd forgotten,

800
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,590
<28-22,Janey>而且他看起来
<28-22,Janey>And he seemed--

801
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,400
<28-22,Janey>看起来很快乐  一切正常
<28-22,Janey>And he seemed happy and he seemed normal.

802
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,790
<28-23,House>所以你把父亲撵走
<28-23,House>So you made daddy go away

803
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,950
<28-23,House>编好理由让孩子永远不会去找他
<28-23,House>and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.

804
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,550
<28-24,Janey>我只是为了保护他
<28-24,Janey>I was just trying to protect him,

805
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,100
<28-24,Janey>像我一开始就应该做的那样
<28-24,Janey>like I should have done from the start.

806
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,440
<28-24,Janey>对不起
<28-24,Janey>Sorry.

807
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,450
<28-25,House>静脉注射盘尼西林和抗坏死抗体
<28-25,House>IV penicillin and anti-tnf antibodies,

808
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,960
<28-25,House>他会好起来的
<28-25,House>He'll be fine.

809
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,770
<28-25,House>被亲爹强奸这事除外
<28-25,House>Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.

810
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,100
<28-26,Adams>这事还没完
<28-26,Adams>We're not done.

811
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,890
<28-27,House>是还没完
<28-27,House>No, we are not.

812
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,560
<28-27,House>通知病人父亲的性伴侣
<28-27,House>Notify the dad's sexual partners.

813
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,760
<28-27,House>通知他的雇主  房东
<28-27,House>Notify his employer, his landlord.

814
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,990
<28-27,House>还有警察
<28-27,House>Notify the police.

815
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,240
<28-28,Adams>我指那孩子
<28-28,Adams>I meant the kid.

816
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,280
<28-28,Adams>难道我们不告诉他  他被侵犯了
<28-28,Adams>We're not gonna tell him he was molested?

817
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
<28-29,House>让他痛不欲生还是让你丢掉行医执照
<28-29,House>To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?

818
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,930
<28-30,Adams>告诉他真相
<28-30,Adams>To tell him the truth.

819
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,770
<28-30,Adams>他还是处子  怎么会得性病
<28-30,Adams>He's a virgin. How do we explain the STD?

820
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,070
<28-30,Adams>这是医学诊断  让家长见鬼去
<28-30,Adams>It's a medical diagnosis. Screw the parents.

821
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,000
<28-30,Adams>孩子是我们的病人
<28-30,Adams>The kid's our patient.

822
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,830
<28-31,House>我猜等那孩子醒过来
<28-31,House>I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make

823
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,920
<28-31,House>陶博要有个艰难抉择了
<28-31,House>when the kid wakes up.

824
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,160
<28-32,Taub>为什么是我的抉择
<28-32,Taub>Why is it my choice?

825
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,520
<28-33,House>因为你当爸爸了
<28-33,House>'cause you're a dad.

826
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,820
<28-33,House>我们其他人怎么会懂
<28-33,House>How could the rest of us possibly understand?

827
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,830
<29-1,Ben>我得了什么病
<29-1,Ben>What was-- what was wrong with me?

828
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,550
<29-2,Taub>是梅毒
<29-2,Taub>It's called syphilis.

829
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,480
<29-3,Ben>没有性生活也能得这病吗
<29-3,Ben>Uh, you--you can get that without having sex?

830
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,950
<30-1,Taub>我没告诉他
<30-1,Taub>I didn't tell him.

831
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,090
<30-1,Taub>你的心在说他需要知道
<30-1,Taub>Your heart said he needed to know.

832
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,940
<30-2,House>你的头脑清楚他不知道最好
<30-2,House>Your brain knew he's better off without it.

833
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,420
<30-2,House>随心所欲很容易
<30-2,House>Following your heart is easy.

834
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,070
<30-2,House>听从头脑的抉择很难
<30-2,House>Following your brain is tough.

835
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,340
<30-2,House>尤其是在任由低级器官
<30-2,House>Especially after years of following

836
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,120
<30-2,House>支配了那么多年之后
<30-2,House>that much smaller third organ.

837
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,000
<30-2,House>所以说天下的孩子都会被父母毁掉
<30-2,House>That's why all parents screw up all children.

838
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,350
<31-1,House>晚上好
<31-1,House>Evening.

839
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,440
<31-2,Adams>欲擒故纵  假作毫不关心
<31-2,Adams>Clever tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.

840
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,600
<31-3,House>这怎么会是欲擒故纵
<31-3,House>How could that possibly work as a tactic?

841
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,660
<31-3,House>事实是  我看到了你生命中不完整的地方
<31-3,House>The fact is, once I saw those incompletes,

842
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,160
<31-3,House>我知道你也被父母毁了
<31-3,House>I knew your parents screwed you up.

843
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,380
<31-3,House>细节不过是调味料而已
<31-3,House>The details are just gravy.

844
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,710
<31-4,Adams>你错了
<31-4,Adams>You're wrong.

845
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,920
<31-4,Adams>你有的证据只能证明其它事情的发生
<31-4,Adams>The only evidence you have is proof of something else.

846
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,140
<31-4,Adams>我离家出走过
<31-4,Adams>I ran away from home.

847
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,170
<31-5,House>因为你父母很差劲
<31-5,House>Because you had lousy parents.

848
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,320
<31-6,Adams>因为我的父母不差
<31-6,Adams>Because I didn't.

849
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,090
<31-6,Adams>我朋友们的父母不是离婚就是出轨
<31-6,Adams>All my friends' parents were divorced or having affairs

850
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,380
<31-6,Adams>要么就连自己孩子的生日都忘了
<31-6,Adams>or barely knew their kids' birthdays.

851
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,810
<31-7,House>你嫉妒他们的扭曲
<31-7,House>You envied their dysfunction?

852
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,680
<31-8,Adams>我当时以为  挫折给了他们深度
<31-8,Adams>I-I thought it made them deeper somehow.

853
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,380
<31-9,Adams>真是愚蠢
<31-9,Adams>It was stupid.

854
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,720
<31-9,Adams>我搭便车到曼哈顿
<31-9,Adams>I hitchhiked to Manhattan,

855
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,650
<31-9,Adams>和一个大我很多的男人同居
<31-9,Adams>moved in with an older guy.

856
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,070
<31-9,Adams>不到两个月  我就跑回家了
<31-9,Adams>In two months, I came running home.

857
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,910
<31-9,Adams>我父母几年后才从中恢复
<31-9,Adams>It took my parents years to get over it.

858
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,350
<31-10,House>自那之后你开始出类拔萃
<31-10,House>That's when you started to excel.

859
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,090
<31-10,House>你是为了补偿他们
<31-10,House>You were making it up to them.

860
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,550
<31-10,House>你的父母毁了你  原因就是他们没有毁你
<31-10,House>Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.

861
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
<31-11,Adams>我只是有一点点希望被毁
<31-11,Adams>How does briefly wishing I was screwed up

862
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,300
<31-11,Adams>也能算是毁了
<31-11,Adams>make me screwed up?

863
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,700
<31-12,House>被父母毁掉是普遍现象
<31-12,House>It's normal to be screwed up.

864
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,770
<31-12,House>连被毁都能浪漫化  才是毁得最严重的
<31-12,House>It's really screwed up to romanticize it.

865
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,480
<31-12,House>我猜这就是你要在囚犯中间工作的原因
<31-12,House>I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.

866
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,130
<31-13,Adams>这是我要跟你工作的原因
<31-13,Adams>It's why I wanted to work with you.

867
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,750
<31-14,House>我的确是欲擒故纵
<31-14,House>It was a tactic.

868
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,780
<32-1,Rachel>克里斯
<32-1,Rachel>Chris.

869
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,210
<32-2,Taub>我得跟你和菲尔谈谈
<32-2,Taub>I need to talk to you and Phil.

870
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,900
<32-3,Rachel>没出什么事吧
<32-3,Rachel>Is everything okay?

871
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,730
<32-3,Rachel>没有
<32-3,Rachel>Yeah.

872
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,160
<32-4,Taub>我不能让你们搬走
<32-4,Taub>I can't let you move.

873
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
<32-5,Rachel>你开车大老远过来
<32-5,Rachel>You drove all the way out here

874
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,890
<32-5,Rachel>就是为了重复你早就说的话
<32-5,Rachel>just to tell us what you already told us.

875
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,100
<32-6,Taub>抱歉
<32-6,Taub>I'm sorry.

876
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,750
<33-1,Wilson>豪斯
<33-1,Wilson>House, open up.

877
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,330
<33-1,Wilson>我不想错过开场
<33-1,Wilson>I don't want to miss the opening bell.

878
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,180
<33-1,Wilson>豪斯
<33-1,Wilson>House?
