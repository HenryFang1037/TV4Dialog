1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,670
<1-1,Stevie>等等 我们不该 这么做
<1-1,Stevie>Wait.Wait, we shouldn't-- we shouldn't be doing this.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,160
<1-2,Leah>你玩得不开心?
<1-2,Leah>What, you're not having fun?

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,720
<1-3,Stevie>不 只是
<1-3,Stevie>It's not that.It's just--

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,970
<1-4,Leah>更喜欢男生?
<1-4,Leah>rather be with the boys?

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,690
<1-5,Stevie>不
<1-5,Stevie>No.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,950
<1-6,Leah>那就来嘛
<1-6,Leah>Well, then, come on.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,060
<1-7,Cop>需要帮助么?
<1-7,Cop>You kids need any help?

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,450
<1-8,Leah>不 我们没事
<1-8,Leah>No.No, we're fine.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,760
<1-9,Cop>- 车子故障?,- 不是
<1-9,Cop>- Car trouble?,- no.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,240
<1-11,Cop>那你们为什么在这里?
<1-11,Cop>Then why are you here?

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,780
<1-12,Leah>只是说说话
<1-12,Leah>Um...we're just talking.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,320
<1-13,Cop>都是她在说吗?
<1-13,Cop>Does she do all the talking?

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,900
<1-14,Stevie>差不多
<1-14,Stevie>Uh, most of it.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,880
<1-15,Cop>我知道这回事
<1-15,Cop>I know what that's like.

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,540
<1-15,Cop>十分钟后 我再回来
<1-15,Cop>I'm gonna come back through here in ten minutes.

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,890
<1-15,Cop>要是你们还在这儿 我就通知家长
<1-15,Cop>And if you're still here,I'm gonna call your parents.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,430
<1-16,Stevie>谢谢你
<1-16,Stevie>Yes, sir.Thank you.

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,710
<1-17,Leah>到哪儿了?
<1-17,Leah>Now, where were we?

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,960
<1-18,Steve>我们得走了
<1-18,Steve>Uh, we were going.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,410
<1-19,Leah>9分钟后再走
<1-19,Leah>In nine minutes.

21
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,180
<1-19,Leah>等等
<1-19,Leah>Wait a minute.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,180
<1-19,Leah>Stevie 出什么事?
<1-19,Leah>Stevie? What's wrong?

23
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,520
<1-19,Leah>噢 老天!
<1-19,Leah>Oh, my god!

24
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,210
<1-19,Leah>救命 有人帮忙吗?
<1-19,Leah>Help!Someone help me!

25
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,300
<2-7,Cameron>第三季 第13集 "草垛寻针尖","Needle in a Haystack"
<2-7,Cameron>House Season 3 Episode 13,"Needle in a Haystack"

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,160
<2-8,Chase>"J.Whitner 医生"
<2-8,Chase>"J.Whitner.M.D"

27
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,170
<2-9,Cameron>"House 医生"
<2-9,Cameron>"House.M.D"

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,870
<2-1,Foreman>十六岁的病人呼吸停止
<2-1,Foreman>16-year-old with respiratory arrest.

29
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,940
<2-2,House>比小偷更可气的是残废小偷
<2-2,House>The only thing I hate more than a thief is a crippled thief.

30
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,880
<2-3,Foreman>我也这么想 无外伤,没有哮喘或过敏史
<2-3,Foreman>Yeah, me too.No sign of trauma.No history of asthma or allerg--

31
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,090
<2-4,House>- 到底谁是J.Whitner?,- 不知道
<2-4,House>- who the hell is J.Whitner?,- No idea.

32
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,010
<2-5,Foreman>Stevie的心电图,和超声波心动图正常 但--
<2-5,Foreman>Stevie lipa's ekg and echocardiogram were normal, but--

33
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,450
<2-6,House>正常就好 让他回家
<2-6,House>normal is good.Send him home.

34
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,330
<2-6,House>J.Whitner 医生
<2-6,House>J.Whitner!Doctor.

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,720
<2-6,House>他是谁 哪儿能找到他?
<2-6,House>Who is he and where do I find him?

36
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,880
<2-7,Cameron>她是新来的研究员,为Ereshevsky工作
<2-7,Cameron>She's a new researcher, works with ereshevsky.

37
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,700
<2-8,Chase>迷人吗?
<2-8,Chase>Is she hot?

38
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,750
<2-9,Cameron>她坐轮椅
<2-9,Cameron>She's in a wheelchair.

39
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,950
<2-10,Chase>并不表明她不迷人
<2-10,Chase>Doesn't mean she's not hot.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,720
<2-11,House>就因为她不能弯腰,Cuddy就要折腰
<2-11,House>Just means she can't bend over, so cuddy has to bend over backwards.

41
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,180
<2-12,Foreman>16岁孩子 检查发现血性胸腔积液
<2-12,Foreman>16-year-old kid.E.R.Work-up revealed a bloody pleural effusion.

42
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,970
<2-13,House>奇怪
<2-13,House>That's odd.

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,940
<2-14,Foreman>我也这么觉得
<2-14,Foreman>Yeah, that occurred to me.

44
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,950
<2-15,House>你花这么久才提到?
<2-15,House>What took you so long to mention it?

45
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,930
<2-16,Foreman>CT(断层摄影)未发现肿块和肺炎
<2-16,Foreman>No tumors or pneumonia on the ct.

46
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,230
<2-17,Chase>他在亲热时昏厥
<2-17,Chase>He passed out while making out.

47
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,060
<2-17,Chase>要是他热衷于性,那也少不了毒品和摇滚乐
<2-17,Chase>If he's into sex, drug and rock and roll can't be that far behind--

48
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,540
<2-17,Chase>我猜吸食可卡因
<2-17,Chase>I'm guessing cocaine.

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,740
<2-18,Foreman>毒物筛检没有发现
<2-18,Foreman>Tox screen was clean.

50
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,230
<2-19,Cameron>他当时未用 不代表他从不用毒品
<2-19,Cameron>just means he wasn't on drugs,,not that he hasn't been using drugs.

51
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,010
<2-20,House>我看是个管道活
<2-20,House>Looks like a plumbing problem to me.

52
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,260
<2-20,House>血管渗漏
<2-20,House>Leaky pipes.

53
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,510
<2-21,Foreman>如果动脉瘤破裂 他进停尸房了,而不是送来急诊室
<2-21,Foreman>If he popped an aneurysm,,he'd be in the morgue, not the E.R.

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,240
<2-22,House>所以你得做静脉造影,而不是动脉x光片
<2-22,House>That's why you're gonna do a venogram instead of an arteriogram.

55
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,570
<2-22,House>不是高压破裂 而是低压渗漏
<2-22,House>This is not a high-pressure burst--it's a low-pressure leak.

56
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,440
<2-23,Chase>仍可能是毒品让血管腐蚀了
<2-23,Chase>Still could have been drugs that caused,the pipes to corrode in the first place.

57
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,880
<2-24,House>去查查他的床垫
<2-24,House>So go look under his mattress.

58
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,470
<2-24,House>看看有没有藏着药片 粉末和润滑剂
<2-24,House>See if he's got any pills or powder stashed with the hand lotion.

59
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,230
<3-1,House>漂亮坐骑
<3-1,House>Sweet ride.

60
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,100
<3-1,House>我也祈愿要一个带U型靠背和座垫的
<3-1,House>I asked for the one with the sissy bar and the banana seat,

61
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,310
<3-1,House>哪知圣诞老人只给我了这个
<3-1,House>but santa gave me this instead.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,750
<3-1,House>这就是调皮捣蛋的下场
<3-1,House>Guess that's what I get for being naughty.

63
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,810
<3-2,Whitner>你一定是House医生
<3-2,Whitner>You must be dr.House.

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,390
<3-2,Whitner>是
<3-2,Whitner>Yeah.

65
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,500
<3-3,House>停车管理处有些事搞错了
<3-3,House>So, looks like there's been some sort of mix-up at the parking office.

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,370
<3-4,Whitner>他们不得不给我安排近门的停车位
<3-4,Whitner>They had to move me closer to the door.

67
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,590
<3-5,House>不得不 你不像是持械威胁的主
<3-5,House>Had to?You don't look like the type to pull a weapon.

68
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,220
<3-6,Whitner>- 轮椅,- 拐杖
<3-6,Whitner>- Wheelchair.,- Cane.

69
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,510
<3-7,House>我觉得你该光明磊落地,把我的位子还给我
<3-7,House>I think you should do the honorable thing, let me have my space back.

70
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,300
<3-8,Whitner>既然你说得这么客气--,轮椅
<3-8,Whitner>Oh, well, uh, since you asked so nicely--wheelchair.

71
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,120
<3-9,House>拐杖 走长路腿会疼
<3-9,House>Cane!Walking long distances makes my leg hurt.

72
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,800
<3-10,Whitner>难道我就容易了?
<3-10,Whitner>And it's easy for me?

73
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,860
<3-11,House>当然不
<3-11,House>'Course not.

74
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,930
<3-11,House>扳动摇控杆 你的拇指肌一定酸痛
<3-11,House>Pushing that little lever, your thumb muscles must burn.

75
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,510
<3-11,House>那最后10码肯定是种折磨
<3-11,House>I'm sure the last ten yards are pure torture.

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,720
<3-12,Whitner>穿过停车场很危险 车子看不见我
<3-12,Whitner>Crossing the parking lot's dangerous--cars can't see me.

77
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,160
<3-13,House>你有没有试过 在薄冰拄拐杖?
<3-13,House>Did you ever hit a patch of black ice with a cane?

78
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,940
<3-14,Whitner>天 没有 只因我不能走路!
<3-14,Whitner>No, gosh, on account of the fact that I can't walk!

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,870
<3-14,Whitner>也许你该向停车管理处要几个鞋钉
<3-14,Whitner>Maybe you should ask the parking office for some crampons.

80
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,940
<3-15,House>问题在于谁能更轻易地穿过停车场
<3-15,House>Look, this is about who can most easily cross the parking lot.

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,010
<3-15,House>你胜出
<3-15,House>You're the winner.

82
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,470
<3-16,Whitner>奖品显然就是停车位
<3-16,Whitner>Oh, and the prize is apparently a parking space.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,440
<4-1,Foreman>你父母的手机都没有应答
<4-1,Foreman>there's still no answer at either one of your parents' cell numbers.

84
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,880
<4-1,Foreman>还没有其他方法能联系到他们?
<4-1,Foreman>Is there any other way we might be able to contact them?

85
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,780
<4-1,Foreman>不 他们去开会
<4-1,Foreman>No.They're in a conference.

86
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,760
<4-2,Stevie>也许得关闭手机
<4-2,Stevie>They probably had to turn them off or something.

87
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,200
<4-3,Leah>他们在哪儿不重要
<4-3,Leah>What does it matter where they are?

88
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,030
<4-3,Leah>他很疼 你得做些什么
<4-3,Leah>I mean, he's in pain.You gotta do something.

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
<4-4,Foreman>必须得到他们签字
<4-4,Foreman>We need them to sign this.

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
<4-5,Leah>他为什么不能签?
<4-5,Leah>Why can't he just sign the papers?

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,090
<4-6,Foreman>- 他16岁了,- 还不是成年人
<4-6,Foreman>- He's 16.,- Still not an adult.

92
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,950
<4-7,Leah>那打电话给我父母
<4-7,Leah>Then call my parents.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,910
<4-7,Leah>他们认识
<4-7,Leah>They know him.

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,830
<4-7,Leah>他们会按规矩负责的
<4-7,Leah>They'll take responsibility, do whatever you need.

95
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,750
<4-8,Foreman>不行
<4-8,Foreman>I can'T.It won't--

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,530
<4-9,Leah>你不能让他坐着受苦,直到他父母最终决定--
<4-9,Leah>you can't just let him sit here in agony until his parents finally decide--

97
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,550
<4-10,Stevie>Leah 没事
<4-10,Stevie>leah.It's okay.

98
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,140
<4-11,Leah>不
<4-11,Leah>No, it's not.

99
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,770
<4-12,Stevie>我感觉像有铁砧压着我的胸
<4-12,Stevie>I feel like there's an anvil sitting on my chest.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,580
<4-13,Foreman>你赢
<4-13,Foreman>You win.

101
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
<4-13,Foreman>现在就做静脉造影
<4-13,Foreman>We're doing the venogram now.

102
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,990
<4-13,Foreman>过后再争执
<4-13,Foreman>We'll deal with the fall out later.

103
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,180
<5-1,Stevie>手指觉得湿乎乎
<5-1,Stevie>My fingers feel wet.

104
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,600
<5-1,Stevie>那是造影剂
<5-1,Stevie>That's just the dye.

105
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,900
<5-2,Foreman>神经分辨不出这是体内
<5-2,Foreman>Your nerves can't tell the difference between the cold inside

106
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,490
<5-2,Foreman>还是体外的冷
<5-2,Foreman>your body and the wet outside your body.

107
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,980
<5-3,Stevie>神经无法分辨 还是大脑不能解读?
<5-3,Stevie>The nerves can't tell the difference, or the brain can't interpret the difference?

108
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,770
<5-4,Foreman>两者皆有
<5-4,Foreman>It's a little of both.

109
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,830
<5-4,Foreman>你喜欢科学?
<5-4,Foreman>You like science?

110
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,240
<5-5,Stevie>是扩散式样
<5-5,Stevie>It looks like a diffusion pattern.

111
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,870
<5-6,Foreman>因为是低压的静脉
<5-6,Foreman>That's because it's the venous side, low pressure.

112
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,510
<5-7,Stevie>适用格锐目定律?,(扩散速率与温度 压力 密度的关系)
<5-7,Stevie>So graham's law applies?

113
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,710
<5-8,Foreman>你已经学物理了?
<5-8,Foreman>You've taken physics al ready?

114
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,580
<5-9,Stevie>只是自己看看书
<5-9,Stevie>No.Just sort of read up on my own.

115
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,360
<5-10,Foreman>有很多我也是自学
<5-10,Foreman>I had to teach myself a lot of stuff too.

116
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,370
<5-10,Foreman>我念的学校糟透了
<5-10,Foreman>Schools sucked where I grew up.

117
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,530
<5-10,Foreman>你读私立还是公立学校?

<5-11,Stevie>公立
<5-11,Stevie>Public.

119
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,510
<5-11,Stevie>是我肺静脉上有穿孔 是吗?
<5-11,Stevie>Leak has to be in the pulmonary veins to get in my lungs, right?

120
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
<5-13,Stevie>- 是,- 我看不出 你呢?
<5-13,Stevie>- Yep.,- I don't see anything.Do you?

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,800
<5-14,Foreman>- 没,- 没道理
<5-14,Foreman>No.It doesn't make sense.

122
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,200
<5-15,Stevie>没有出血 怎么会有积液?
<5-15,Stevie>How can I have a bloo effusion without any bleeding?

123
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,480
<6-1,Cameron>脏死了
<6-1,Cameron>This is putrid.

124
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,550
<6-2,Chase>在检查事项中加入食物寄生虫和传染病
<6-2,Chase>Put food-borne parasites and infections on the list to check on.

125
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,570
<6-2,Chase>我去查卧室
<6-2,Chase>I'll take the bedroom.

<7-1,Woman>I'm sorry, I didn't know there was anyone-- we were just--

127
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,870
<7-2,Chase>我有枪
<7-2,Chase>I have a gun.

128
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,310
<7-3,Woman>你要什么随便拿
<7-3,Woman>Look, you can take whatever you want.

129
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,010
<7-4,Man>- 钱包在衣服里,- 别动!
<7-4,Man>- My wallet's in my suit.,- Freeze!

130
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,600
<7-5,Woman>我报警了
<7-5,Woman>Oh!I'm calling the cops.

131
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,050
<7-6,Man>你没有枪
<7-6,Man>Okay, you don't have a gun.

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,590
<7-7,Chase>你也不会报警
<7-7,Chase>And you're not calling the cops.

133
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,420
<7-8,Man>我会报警 除非你们立马走
<7-8,Man>Oh, no,I'm calling the cops, unless you two get out of here right now.

134
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,900
<7-9,Chase>除非?
<7-9,Chase>Unless?

135
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,400
<7-9,Chase>要等到入室盗贼干了什么才报警?
<7-9,Chase>Who calls the cops unless a burglar does something?

136
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,710
<7-9,Chase>你是不想把风流事捅出去
<7-9,Chase>You don't want to have to explain the affair.

137
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,840
<7-10,Woman>我们不是偷情
<7-10,Woman>We're not having an affair.

138
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,750
<7-10,Woman>他戴着戒指 你没有
<7-10,Woman>He's got a ring.You don'T.

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,810
<7-11,Chase>由楼下厨房的情形
<7-11,Chase>And judging from the state of the kitchen downstairs

140
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,260
<7-11,Chase>和打扫了一半的卧室判断
<7-11,Chase>and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

141
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,180
<7-11,Chase>我猜你做情人好过做女佣
<7-11,Chase>I'm guessing you're a better lover than you are a maid.

142
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,950
<7-12,Woman>女佣?
<7-12,Woman>Maid?

143
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,440
<7-12,Woman>你这浑小子
<7-12,Woman>You son of a bitch.

144
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,430
<7-12,Woman>我不是女佣
<7-12,Woman>I'm not a maid, okay?

145
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,490
<7-12,Woman>这是我的房子 不是他的
<7-12,Woman>This is my house, not his.

146
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,460
<7-12,Woman>对不起
<7-12,Woman>Oh, sorry.

147
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,900
<7-13,Chase>厨房有什么不对了?
<7-13,Chase>And what's wrong with my kitchen?

148
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,850
<7-14,Cameron>没什么 很抱歉
<7-14,Cameron>Nothing.We're sorry.

149
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,200
<7-14,Cameron>我们是想帮Stevie
<7-14,Cameron>We're just here to help stevie.

150
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,930
<7-15,Woman>谁是Stevie?
<7-15,Woman>Who's stevie?

151
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,630
<7-16,Cameron>你的 儿子?
<7-16,Cameron>Your...son?

152
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,640
<7-17,Woman>什么?
<7-17,Woman>Huh?

153
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,460
<8-1,Chase>地址是你给的
<8-1,Chase>it was the address you gave.

154
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,020
<8-2,Stevie>肯定是急诊室写错了
<8-2,Stevie>The E.R.Must have written it down wrong.

155
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,320
<8-3,Cameron>不想让我们找到你父母,所以你胡诌
<8-3,Cameron>Or you lied because you don't want us to talk to your parents.

156
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,960
<8-4,Stevie>我把电话号码都给你们了
<8-4,Stevie>I gave you their phone numbers.

157
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,400
<8-5,Foreman>你是给了号码
<8-5,Foreman>you gave us some numbers.

158
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,690
<8-5,Foreman>联系不上任何人
<8-5,Foreman>We haven't been able to reach anyone.

159
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,370
<8-6,Stevie>说过了 他们一定是在开会
<8-6,Stevie>I told you,they must be in a conference.

160
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,250
<8-7,Leah>他说谎
<8-7,Leah>He's lying.

161
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,880
<8-8,Stevie>Leah.
<8-8,Stevie>Leah

162
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,890
<8-8,Stevie>他是罗马尼人
<8-8,Stevie>He's romani.

163
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,000
<8-9,Leah>吉普赛人
<8-9,Leah>A gypsy.

164
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,780
<8-10,Cameron>你没有家?
<8-10,Cameron>So you don't have a home?

165
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,340
<8-11,Stevie>当然有
<8-11,Stevie>Of course we do.

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,430
<8-11,Stevie>接下来你要问营火舞蹈,还是偷窃幼童?
<8-11,Stevie>Next you're gonna ask me about dancing around campfires and-- Stealing children?

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,160
<8-11,Stevie>这就是我不对人说的原因
<8-11,Stevie>This is why I don't tell people.

168
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,700
<8-12,Leah>他们自己人之间分享所有,对外人戒心很深
<8-12,Leah>They share everything with each other and nothing with the gadje-- the outsiders.

169
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,870
<8-13,Stevie>和外人交流 没给我的族人带来好结果
<8-13,Stevie>Sharing information with outsiders has not gone so well for my people.

170
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,270
<8-14,Foreman>我明白 可你对我们撒谎 会让病情恶化
<8-14,Foreman>I get it, but right now you're making yourself more vulnerable by lying to us.

171
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,380
<8-15,Stevie>你们不能去我家
<8-15,Stevie>You can't go to my house.

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
<8-15,Stevie>会污染它
<8-15,Stevie>You'll pollute it.

173
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,920
<8-16,Foreman>我们只是检查一下
<8-16,Foreman>All we're gonna do is look around.

174
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,130
<8-17,Leah>你们到场就足够危害
<8-17,Leah>Your presence is enough.

175
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,050
<8-18,Stevie>我父母对这很看重
<8-18,Stevie>My parents take it seriously.

176
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,890
<8-18,Stevie>不管是精神还是肉体
<8-18,Stevie>It's spiritual as much as it is physical.

177
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,040
<8-19,Chase>你知道他住在哪儿?
<8-19,Chase>You know where he lives?

178
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,530
<8-19,Chase>别说
<8-19,Chase>Don'T.

179
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,540
<8-20,Stevie>我什么都告诉你们
<8-20,Stevie>Look, I'll tell you whatever you need to know.

180
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,800
<8-21,Chase>- 如果对你的回答无法取信,- 我有时候喝酒
<8-21,Chase>If we can't trust your answers-- I drink sometimes, okay?

181
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,190
<8-22,Stevie>我吸过大麻
<8-22,Stevie>I've smoked pot.

182
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,630
<8-22,Stevie>我什么都说
<8-22,Stevie>I'll tell you anything.

183
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,940
<8-22,Stevie>实话
<8-22,Stevie>The truth.

184
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,010
<8-22,Stevie>你们不能去我家
<8-22,Stevie>You just-- You can't go in my home.

185
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,270
<8-23,Cameron>大麻不会导致出血
<8-23,Cameron>The pot wouldn't cause a bleeding problem.

186
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,230
<8-23,Cameron>但大麻上的杀虫剂会
<8-23,Cameron>A pesticide on the pot could.

187
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,290
<8-23,Cameron>你从哪儿得到的?
<8-23,Cameron>Where did you get it?

188
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,370
<8-24,Stevie>学校里一孩子
<8-24,Stevie>Some kid at school.

<8-25,Leah>Stevie 大麻是我给他的
<8-25,Leah>stevie.He got the pot from me.

<8-27,Leah>He reads books.

194
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,530
<8-28,Foreman>还说了什么谎话?
<8-28,Foreman>What else are you lying about?

195
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,980
<8-28,Foreman>你父亲真是教授?
<8-28,Foreman>Is your father really a professor?

196
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,510
<8-29,Stevie>他是推销员
<8-29,Stevie>He's a salesman.

197
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,960
<8-30,Leah>能到手的任何东西 他们都买卖
<8-30,Leah>They buy and sell anything they can get their hands on.

198

<8-31,Foreman>他们 你和你爸爸一起做买卖
<8-31,Foreman>they--so you're with your dad when he's making these deals?

<8-32,Leah>他上个星期才到芝加哥
<8-32,Leah>He was just in chicagoa week ago.

<8-34,Stevie>No.My dad's got a truck.

202
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,290
<9-1,Cuddy>你不是认真的吧
<9-1,Cuddy>You can't be serious.

203
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,280
<9-2,House>我当真
<9-2,House>Actually, I can.

204
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,430
<9-2,House>我的地盘得要回来
<9-2,House>See?It's my space.I want it back.

205
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,590
<9-3,Cuddy>不是你的车位
<9-3,Cuddy>It's not your space.

206
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,080
<9-3,Cuddy>是医院的车位
<9-3,Cuddy>It's the hospital's space.

207
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,150
<9-3,Cuddy>院方认为 处境困难的人应享好位置
<9-3,Cuddy>And the hospital thinks that the person who's worse off should get the better space.

208
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,360
<9-3,Cuddy>你在残障人士停车位申请中提到,你能走50码
<9-3,Cuddy>Your application for a handicapped space says you can walk 50 yards.

209
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,710
<9-4,House>Whitner说她每换一次机油能驶上50英里
<9-4,House>And whitner says she can roll 50 miles between oil changes.

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,190
<9-4,House>我可换不了腿
<9-4,House>I can't change my leg.

211
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,650
<9-5,Cuddy>我把你换到离前门46码的地方
<9-5,Cuddy>The space I moved you to is only 46 yardsaway from the front door.

212
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,930
<9-5,Cuddy>我量过 你没问题
<9-5,Cuddy>I measured.You'll be fine.

213
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,500
<9-6,House>好么 那我走入大厅4码再瘫倒,胜过倒在雪地上
<9-6,House>Great--so I can collapse four yards into the lobby instead of outside in the cold.

214
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,800
<9-7,Cuddy>只要你不在我办公室倒下就行
<9-7,Cuddy>As long as it's not in my office.

215
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,820
<9-8,House>你知道谁一连6年赢得纽约市马拉松大赛?
<9-8,House>You know who won the new york city marathon six years in a row?

216

<9-8,House>坐轮椅一哥们
<9-8,House>Guy in a wheelchair.

217
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,460
<9-9,Cuddy>那你也弄个轮椅坐 别来烦我
<9-9,Cuddy>Then go get yourself one and leave me alone.

218
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,310
<9-10,House>还我车位 我乐得整天滚来滚去
<9-10,House>Gimme my space, I'll be happy to roll around all day.

219
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,830
<9-11,Cuddy>你坐轮椅坚持不了一星期
<9-11,Cuddy>You couldn't last one week in a wheelchair.

220
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,600
<9-12,House>想打赌?
<9-12,House>Wanna bet?

221
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,720
<10-1,Cameron>你怎么了?
<10-1,Cameron>What's wrong with you?

222
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,170
<10-2,House>一周不用腿,万事皆解决
<10-2,House>Nothing that a week off my feet won't solve.

223
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,980
<10-3,Foreman>静脉造影没有发现渗漏
<10-3,Foreman>venogram's negative.No leak.

224
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,070
<10-4,House>你是说没找到渗漏?
<10-4,House>You mean you couldn't find the leak.

225
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,990
<10-5,Cameron>你的腿恶化了?
<10-5,Cameron>is your leg worse?

226
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,530
<10-6,House>不 是我的车位遇险
<10-6,House>No, but my parking spot is.

227
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,260
<10-6,House>血液只应存在于循环系统中
<10-6,House>Blood is only made inside the circulatory system,

228
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,510
<10-6,House>要是在外面发现了
<10-6,House>which means when we find it outside--

229
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,090
<10-7,Foreman>没有渗漏 淋巴腺我也查了
<10-7,Foreman>there's no leak.I even checked lymphatics.

230
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,440
<10-8,Cameron>你坐一周的轮椅
<10-8,Cameron>So you're gonna spend a weekin a wheelchair

231
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,400
<10-8,Cameron>就是为了得到离门近的车位?
<10-8,Cameron>just to get a parking space closer to the front door?

232
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,110
<10-9,House>比起把腿剁下来可简单多了
<10-9,House>Easier than chopping off my legs.

233
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,460
<10-10,Foreman>排除了毒素和毒品
<10-10,Foreman>We've ruled out toxins and drugs.

<10-10,Foreman>一定程度上 他是罗马尼人
<10-10,Foreman>kind of.He's romani.

235
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,340
<10-11,Chase>不得不保守秘密
<10-11,Chase>Apparently, they feel the need to keep secrets,

236
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,090
<10-11,Chase>很难确证任何事
<10-11,Chase>so it's hard to know anything for sure.

237
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,670
<10-12,House>他也是个人
<10-12,House>Yeah, he's also a human being,

238
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,640
<10-12,House>一开始就不该相信他
<10-12,House>which means you shouldn't be trusting him to begin with.

239
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,970
<10-12,House>别依赖他给出答案 你们得自己找
<10-12,House>Stop relying on his answers and find some on your own.

240
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,230
<10-13,Foreman>这是深静脉血栓
<10-13,Foreman>It's a deep veinthrombosis.

241
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,380
<10-13,Foreman>这孩子在车子后座上待了16个小时
<10-13,Foreman>The kid spent 16 hours in the backseat of an old pickup.

242
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,400
<10-13,Foreman>导致了血液凝块 行到了肺部
<10-13,Foreman>Causes a clot and makes its way to his lungs.

243
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,840
<10-13,Foreman>该做动脉X光摄影 找到凝块,用tpa(组织纤溶酶原)溶栓
<10-13,Foreman>We should do an arteriogram,find the clot, bust it with tpa.

244
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,990
<10-14,House>或者找出渗漏
<10-14,House>Or we could find the leak.

245
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,530
<10-15,Foreman>没有渗漏
<10-15,Foreman>There's no leak.

246
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,190
<10-16,House>你不该对坐轮椅的嚷嚷
<10-16,House>Hey, you can't yell at a guy in a wheelchair.

247
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,490
<10-16,House>缓慢的渗漏
<10-16,House>It's a slow leak.

248
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,840
<10-16,House>让它加速
<10-16,House>You gotta speed it up.

249
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,540
<10-16,House>稀释血液 重做静脉造影
<10-16,House>Thin his blood. Redo the venogram.

250
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,170
<10-17,Cameron>那会导致大出血
<10-17,Cameron>That could cause a massive bleed.

251
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,810
<10-18,House>好极了 大出血就更好找了
<10-18,House>Excellent--massive'll beeven easier to find.

252
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,300
<10-18,House>借过
<10-18,House>Pardon me.

253
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,740
<10-18,House>看来你们得乘下一部了
<10-18,House>Guess you guys are gonna have to get the next one.

254
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,530
<11-1,Stevie>我以为你们要做静脉造影
<11-1,Stevie>I thought you were redoing the venogram.

255
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,140
<11-2,Foreman>等做完动脉造影之后
<11-2,Foreman>As soon as we're done with the arteriogram.

256
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,610
<11-3,Cameron>你会觉得被扎了下
<11-3,Cameron>Okay, you're gonna feel a little poke.

257
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,640
<11-4,Stevie>能不能你来做?
<11-4,Stevie>Could you maybe do that?

258
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,910
<11-5,Cameron>放心 只是你的腿
<11-5,Cameron>don't worry.It's just your leg.

259
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
<11-5,Cameron>我不会更进一步
<11-5,Cameron>I don't have to go any further than this.

260
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,980
<11-6,Foreman>看这个
<11-6,Foreman>take a look at this.

261
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,610
<11-6,Foreman>你前臂的骨头
<11-6,Foreman>Bones of your forearm.

262
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,390
<11-7,Stevie>桡骨和尺骨
<11-7,Stevie>Uh, radius and ulna.

263
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
<11-8,Foreman>手腕这儿呢?
<11-8,Foreman>How 'bout the wrist?

264
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,160
<11-9,Stevie>月骨 钩骨
<11-9,Stevie>Um...lunate...hamate...the...

265

<11-10,Cameron>惊慌的情人尝试高难度姿势,(SLTPTTCH 腕部骨骼首字母缩写)
<11-10,Cameron>scared lovers try positions they can't handle.

266
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,010
<11-10,Cameron>这是我记忆腕骨的方法
<11-10,Cameron>It's a mnemonic for the wrist bones.

267
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,220
<11-10,Cameron>唯一能记住它们的方法
<11-10,Cameron>It's the only way I can remember them.

268
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,270
<11-12,Foreman>怎么了?
<11-12,Foreman>Are you okay?

269
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,650
<11-13,Stevie>我的胃
<11-13,Stevie>Ow.Ow, my stomach.

270
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,750
<11-14,Foreman>你碰到什么?
<11-14,Foreman>You hit something?

271
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,250
<11-16,Foreman>- 才刚开始,- 躺平
<11-16,Foreman>- I barely started.,- Lie flat.

272
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,860
<11-17,Stevie>不行 太疼了
<11-17,Stevie>No, I can'T.It hurts too much.

273
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,780
<11-18,Cameron>我抽出来
<11-18,Cameron>I'm getting out.

274
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,120
<11-19,Foreman>这是看清楚的唯一机会
<11-19,Foreman>It's our only chance to see what's going on.

275
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,910
<11-20,Cameron>如果他动 我会刺破动脉
<11-20,Cameron>If he moves,I could shred his artery.

276
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,890
<11-21,Stevie>拿出来 马上
<11-21,Stevie>Just get it out!Now!

277
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,990
<11-22,Foreman>没事的 Stevie
<11-22,Foreman>It's gonna be okay, stevie.

278
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,960
<11-22,Foreman>注入造影剂
<11-22,Foreman>Just inject the dye.

279
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,930
<11-23,Cameron>造影剂进入了肝脏 却没有出来
<11-23,Cameron>Dye's going into his liver,but it's not coming out.

280
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,140
<11-24,Foreman>血凝块一定压迫了肝静脉
<11-24,Foreman>The clot's gonna be constricting the flow in the hepatic vein.

281
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,240
<11-25,Cameron>不是压迫
<11-25,Cameron>It's not constricting it.

282
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,520
<11-25,Cameron>而是完全阻塞了
<11-25,Cameron>It's completely blocking it.

283
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,680
<11-25,Cameron>肝脏一塌糊涂
<11-25,Cameron>His whole liver's fried.

284

<12-1,Foreman>孩子的肝脏衰竭 因肝静脉严重阻塞
<12-1,Foreman>kid's liver's failing because of massive clots blocking his hepatic vein.

285
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,580
<12-1,Foreman>他怎么可能既出血又有血栓?
<12-1,Foreman>How can he have both a bleed and a clot?

286
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,310
<12-2,House>不是血栓
<12-2,House>It's not a clot.

287
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,140
<12-2,House>肯定是导管丝堵住了静脉
<12-2,House>Must have blocked a vein with a catheter wire.

288
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,150
<12-3,Cameron>不可能
<12-3,Cameron>Not a chance.

289
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,190
<12-4,Chase>下游血压高也可能阻碍血流
<12-4,Chase>Increased pressure downstream could also stop the blood.

290
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,630
<12-5,Foreman>没有心脏衰竭和肝硬化
<12-5,Foreman>there's no heart failure or cirrhosis.

291
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,640
<12-5,Foreman>说明一定是血栓
<12-5,Foreman>Means it has to be a clot.

292
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,410
<12-6,House>严重的血栓堵住了静脉
<12-6,House>Massive clots block veins.

293
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,380
<12-6,House>这不会导致渗漏
<12-6,House>They don't make them leak.

294
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,030
<12-6,House>鉴于他明显有--
<12-6,House>And since he clearly has some kind of--

295
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,320
<12-7,Cuddy>你有小麻烦?
<12-7,Cuddy>you having a little problem?

296
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,190
<12-8,House>你介意帮个手?
<12-8,House>Would you mind?

297
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,880
<12-8,House>真是羞辱
<12-8,House>Boy, that was humiliating.

298
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,510
<12-8,House>不知道Whitner日子怎么过的?
<12-8,House>How does whitner make it through the day?

299
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,860
<12-9,Cuddy>骄兵必败
<12-9,Cuddy>"Pride goeth before the fall.

300
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,630
<12-10,House>还好 我有个宝贝椅坐
<12-10,House>" Lucky for me, I'm sittingin one of these babies.

301
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,550
<12-10,House>还有什么等我驳斥的理论?
<12-10,House>So, what other theories can I shoot down?

302
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,930
<12-11,Cameron>DIC(弥散性血管内凝血)能解释
<12-11,Cameron>Dic would explain both--

303
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,170
<12-12,House>血小板正常,PTT(凝血酶活时间)也没有提高
<12-12,House>his platelets are normal and his ptt isn't elevated.

304
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,850
<12-13,Chase>白血病?
<12-13,Chase>Leukemia?

305
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
<12-14,House>全血球和分类计数无异常
<12-14,House>Normal cbc and differential.

306
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,500
<12-14,House>该像水管工一样思考时,你们怎么还摆医生的谱
<12-14,House>You guys are still thinking like doctors when you should be thinking like plumbers.

307
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,700
<12-14,House>快 给我点带劲的
<12-14,House>Come on, I wanna see some butt crack.

308
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,480
<12-14,House>肝脏里什么东西在血管上扎了洞
<12-14,House>Something inside the liver is punching holes in the pipes.

309
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,360
<12-14,House>血从开口渗出 粘在异物上 造成了血块
<12-14,House>Blood bleeds through the opening, sticks to the intruder,forms a mass.

310
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,980
<12-16,House>- 血栓,- 血块
<12-16,House>- A clot.,- A mass.

311
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,140
<12-17,Chase>癌症 肿瘤能腐蚀血管
<12-17,Chase>cancer.A tumor could erode a blood vessel.

312
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,920
<12-18,Foreman>肺结核肉状瘤形成肉芽肿也可能
<12-18,Foreman>well, so could a granuloma from tuberculosisor sarcoidosis.

313
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,080
<12-19,House>做CT MRI(核磁共振),痰液检查和血管紧张素转换酶水平
<12-19,House>Do a ct, mri, a sputum,and an ace level.

314
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,710
<12-19,House>借过
<12-19,House>excuse me, sorry.

315
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,820
<12-19,House>瘸子来了
<12-19,House>Cripple coming through.

316
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,050
<13-1,Mother>他说喉咙痛
<13-1,Mother>He says his throat hurts.

317
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,730
<13-2,House>从用词看 你觉得不是
<13-2,House>That phrasing means you think it doesn'T.

318
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,750
<13-3,Mother>不是
<13-3,Mother>No, I don'T.

319
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,480
<13-4,House>我走运了
<13-4,House>Good enough for me.

320
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,420
<13-5,Mother>你去哪里?
<13-5,Mother>Where are you going?

321
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,770
<13-6,House>妈妈懂得多
<13-6,House>Mothers know best.

322
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,690
<13-6,House>出去时自己拿个棒棒糖
<13-6,House>Get yourself a sucker on the way out.

323
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,700
<13-7,Mother>我认为他是为了不去上学而装病
<13-7,Mother>Look, I think he's just faking so he doesn't have to go to school.

324
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,860
<13-8,House>你看我像检查逃学的训导员吗?
<13-8,House>How did you know I was a truant officer?

325
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,830
<13-9,Mother>我跟他说 不去学校就得看医生
<13-9,Mother>I told him he had a choice--go to school or the doctor.

326
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,850
<13-10,House>他浪费你时间 你就来浪费我的
<13-10,House>Right--he's wasting your precious time, so you decided to waste mine.

327
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,630
<13-10,House>多体贴
<13-10,House>How thoughtful.

328
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,560
<13-10,House>我坐轮椅 他坐上面检查不到
<13-10,House>I'm in a wheelchair, so I can't examine him all the way up there.

329
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,330
<13-10,House>跳下来
<13-10,House>Hop down.

330
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,020
<13-10,House>我的人生就是一难接一难
<13-10,House>My life is just one horror after another.

331
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,790
<13-10,House>张嘴
<13-10,House>Open.

332
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,930
<13-11,Mother>看着是肿痛么?
<13-11,Mother>Does it look like it hurts?

333
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,120
<13-12,House>没有
<13-12,House>Nope.

334
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,030
<13-14,House>- 这是什么,- 注射器
<13-14,House>- What's that?,- It's a syringe.

335
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,620
<13-14,House>我是帮你 让他讨厌医生甚于学校
<13-14,House>I'm with you--make him hate the doctor's office more than he hates school.

336
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,340
<13-14,House>够了
<13-14,House>That's okay.

337
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,910
<13-15,Mother>不认为--
<13-15,Mother>I don't--I don't think that's--

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,070
<13-16,House>只是盐水 直接注射进肌肉痛得要命
<13-16,House>it's just saline--hurts like hell when it's injected directly into the muscle.

339
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,430
<13-16,House>你看是胳膊还是屁股?
<13-16,House>So what do you think?Arm or ass?

340
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,820
<13-17,Mother>我想他学乖了
<13-17,Mother>I think he's learned his lesson.

341
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,120
<13-18,House>我不觉得
<13-18,House>Oh, I don't know.

342
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,510
<13-18,House>最好检查下
<13-18,House>We better check.

343
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,150
<13-18,House>Jack 你妈妈是不是大蠢蛋?
<13-18,House>Jack, is your mommy a big fat idiot?

344
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,080
<13-18,House>瞧吧
<13-18,House>Well, what do you know?

345
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,140
<13-18,House>看来你是对的
<13-18,House>Guess you were right.

346
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,770
<14-1,Foreman>保持不动 Stevie
<14-1,Foreman>Just hold still, stevie.

347
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,780
<14-1,Foreman>不会很久
<14-1,Foreman>This shouldn't take long.

348
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,620
<14-2,Stevie>我想这里的麦克风收不到点头状
<14-2,Stevie>Sorry, i'm guessing the mike in this thing doesn't pick up nods.

349

<14-3,Cameron>聪明孩子
<14-3,Cameron>Smart kid.

<14-4,Foreman>可惜会浪费了
<14-4,Foreman>Too bad it's all gonna go to waste.

351
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,130
<14-5,Chase>当个推销员没什么不好
<14-5,Chase>Nothing wrong with being a salesman.

352
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,810
<14-6,Foreman>他该追求自己的生活
<14-6,Foreman>He should be able to pursue his own life,

353
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,390
<14-6,Foreman>而不是帮父母卖旧烤箱
<14-6,Foreman>not be stuck helping his parents sell old toasters.

354
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,790
<14-7,Cameron>他还年轻 没法预料以后什么样?
<14-7,Cameron>He's still young--you never know what he'll end up doing.

355
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
<14-8,Foreman>除非他回学校,不然我很清楚他将来什么样
<14-8,Foreman>Unless he goes back to school, I know exactlywhat he'll end up doing.

356
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,850
<14-8,Foreman>等等
<14-8,Foreman>Wait.

357
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,340
<14-8,Foreman>这是不是伤口?
<14-8,Foreman>Is that a lesion?

358
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,060
<14-9,Chase>放大五倍
<14-9,Chase>magnifying times five.

359
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,220
<14-10,Cameron>是肉芽肿
<14-10,Cameron>it's a granuloma.

360
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,470
<14-11,Foreman>韦格纳肉芽肿病最有可能
<14-11,Foreman>Means wegener's is most likely.

361
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,940
<14-12,Judy>Stevie!
<14-12,Judy>Stevie!

362

<14-16,Foreman>Your son is sick.

366
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,730
<14-16,Foreman>门上的标牌--
<14-16,Foreman>The sign on the door--

367
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,740
<14-17,Franklin>标牌说不能带有金属物
<14-17,Franklin>no, the sign says no metal.

<14-17,Franklin>我们都取下了
<14-17,Franklin>We took everything off.

<14-20,Cameron>还不清楚
<14-20,Cameron>We don't know yet.

372
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,840
<14-21,Judy>他不会死 是吗?
<14-21,Judy>He's not gonna die, is he?

373
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,530
<14-22,Foreman>你儿子病得很重
<14-22,Foreman>Your son is very ill.

374
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,780
<14-22,Foreman>还在查病因
<14-22,Foreman>We're still trying to figure out why,

375
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,170
<14-22,Foreman>所以需要你们出去
<14-22,Foreman>which is why we need you to leave the room.

376
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,770
<15-1,Foreman>你准备怎么做?
<15-1,Foreman>what are you going to do now?

<15-2,House>我要把屁股从这个座位挪到那个
<15-2,House>Oh, now I've gotta slide my butt from one padded seat to another.

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,010
<15-2,House>要是碰伤膝盖怎么办?
<15-2,House>What if I bump my knee?

379
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,460
<15-3,Foreman>核磁共振在他的肺部发现肉芽肿
<15-3,Foreman>Mri showed a granulomain his liver.

382
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,420
<15-5,Foreman>不 血凝 出血 肉芽肿表明了是韦格纳病
<15-5,Foreman>No--clotting, bleeding, and a granuloma equals wegener'S.

383
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,480
<15-6,House>我知道 所以才说棒极了
<15-6,House>I know.That's why I said fantastic.

384
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,490
<15-6,House>我可是真诚的
<15-6,House>I was being sincere.

385
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,500
<15-6,House>帮我一把
<15-6,House>Now give me a hand.

386
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,610
<15-7,Foreman>那不公平
<15-7,Foreman>It wouldn't be fair.

387
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,190
<15-7,Foreman>准备活检肝脏来证实
<15-7,Foreman>We're gonna biopsy the liver to confirm.

388
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,580
<15-8,House>你不帮忙才不公平
<15-8,House>Wouldn't be fair not to.

389
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,560
<15-8,House>人是好心 仁慈 友善的,会帮助坐轮椅的人
<15-8,House>People are good and kind and gentle and help people in wheelchairs.

390
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,570
<15-9,Foreman>你才不信这一套
<15-9,Foreman>You don't believe that.

391
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,000
<15-10,House>- 可你信,- 不 我不信
<15-10,House>- But you do.,- No, I don'T.

392
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,100
<15-11,Foreman>Foreman.
<15-11,Foreman>Foreman

393
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,260
<15-12,House>别做活检
<15-12,House>Forget the biopsy.

394
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,080
<15-12,House>在得出结论前 他肝脏就不行了
<15-12,House>His liver'll be gone before you get the results.

395
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,720
<15-12,House>给他用环磷酰胺(免疫抑制剂),在韦格纳病于另一根血管上钻孔前
<15-12,House>Start treatment with cyclophosphamide before wegener's punches a hole in another pipe.

396
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,150
<16-1,Foreman>衣服怎么回事?
<16-1,Foreman>What's with the clothes?

397
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,090
<16-1,Foreman>你还不能出院
<16-1,Foreman>You're not being discharged.

398
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,390
<16-1,Foreman>我知道 是我父母
<16-1,Foreman>I know.It-- it's my parents.

399
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,590
<16-2,Stevie>他们一定要我穿
<16-2,Stevie>They insist that I wear this stuff.

400
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,370
<16-3,Foreman>坚持用我们的食物-,衣服 陈设是有原因的
<16-3,Foreman>We insist on our own food,gown, and furnishings for a reason.

401
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,670
<16-4,Stevie>我的胸痛
<16-4,Stevie>Hey, my--my chest burns.

402
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,490
<16-4,Stevie>你确定治疗作用了?
<16-4,Stevie>Are you sure the treatments are working?

403
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,750
<16-5,Foreman>韦格纳病使机体自我攻击
<16-5,Foreman>Wegener's causes the body to attack itself.

404
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,300
<16-5,Foreman>不会一夜间好转
<16-5,Foreman>It doesn't get undone overnight.

405
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,300
<16-5,Foreman>耐心点
<16-5,Foreman>Be patient.

406
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,120
<16-6,Judy>你的汤呢?
<16-6,Judy>Where's your soup?

407
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,770
<16-7,Foreman>垃圾桶里
<16-7,Foreman>It's in the garbage.

408
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,020
<16-8,Judy>有柳树皮汁
<16-8,Judy>It has willow bark extract.

409
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,140
<16-9,Foreman>柳树皮汁基本上就是阿司匹林
<16-9,Foreman>Willow bark extract is basically aspirin.

410
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,630
<16-10,Judy>是 对付发热
<16-10,Judy>Yes, for the fever.

411
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,690
<16-11,Foreman>他已经在用药了 我们的药物
<16-11,Foreman>He's already on meds--our meds.

412
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,520
<16-11,Foreman>可不想有不良冲突反应
<16-11,Foreman>We can't risk any adverse interactions.

413
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,720
<16-11,Foreman>这些东西都得拿走
<16-11,Foreman>We need all this stuff to go.

414
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,050
<16-11,Foreman>我们必需控制环境
<16-11,Foreman>We need to control this environment.

415
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,930
<16-12,Franklin>我们也是
<16-12,Franklin>So do we.

416
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,710
<16-12,Franklin>人得病是有原因的
<16-12,Franklin>People get sick for a reason.

417
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,290
<16-12,Franklin>因他们的生活失去平衡
<16-12,Franklin>'Cause something in their life is out of balance.

418
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,060
<16-13,Stevie>爸爸 他是医生
<16-13,Stevie>Dad, he's a doctor.

419
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,460
<16-13,Stevie>他不想听你说教
<16-13,Stevie>He doesn't want to hear your talk.

420
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,480
<16-14,Judy>那女孩走了 平衡就开始重建
<16-14,Judy>Balance is just starting to be restored now that that girl is gone.

421
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,970
<16-15,Foreman>你们不在时,你们儿子可全靠她照顾
<16-15,Foreman>That girl took pretty good care of your son while you were away.

422
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,270
<16-16,Judy>我们领教了
<16-16,Judy>Yes, we can see that.

423
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,340
<16-17,Foreman>这些能让他感觉自在些
<16-17,Foreman>All this stuff may make him feel more comfortable,

424
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,070
<16-18,Franklin>- 但--,- 治疗要花多长时间?
<16-18,Franklin>- but it's not--,- how long is this treatment gonna take?

425
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,800
<16-19,Foreman>很快就应该能看到他肝功能有起色
<16-19,Foreman>We should start to see some improvement in his liver function soon.

426
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,870
<16-20,Judy>"很快" 科学的词
<16-20,Judy>"Soon."Very scientific.

427
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,960
<16-21,Stevie>对不起
<16-21,Stevie>I'm sorry.

428
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,050
<16-22,Foreman>一会儿回来给你检查
<16-22,Foreman>Be back in a little bit to check on you.

429
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,160
<17-1,Wilson>啊 来了
<17-1,Wilson>ah, yes.

430
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,870
<17-1,Wilson>这不是Ironside医生,(Ironside:一电视剧中坐轮椅的侦探)
<17-1,Wilson>If it isn't dr.Ironside.

431
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,540
<17-1,Wilson>不是医生
<17-1,Wilson>Ah, if isn't "dr.

432
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
<17-2,House>我小时候没有朋友
<17-2,House>I had no friends when I was growing up,

433
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,040
<17-2,House>老是一个人看电视
<17-2,House>"so all I did was watch tv by myself,

434
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,480
<17-2,House>所以我如今能旁征博引通俗文化
<17-2,House>"which is why I can now make constant pop culture references

435
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,540
<17-2,House>除了我 没人听得明白
<17-2,House>which no one understands but me.

436
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,990
<17-3,Wilson>这是我的名字 别叫破了,(出自音乐电影Grease的一句台词)
<17-3,Wilson>" That's my name. Don't wear it out."

437
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,170
<17-4,House>躲得过Cuddy 躲不过她的党羽
<17-4,House>Ah, ah.Safe from cuddy, but I guess not from her trusted rat-complice.

438
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,670
<17-5,Wilson>讲道理的人不会拿残疾程度来讲价钱
<17-5,Wilson>Reasonable people don't debate the relative merits of their handicaps.

439
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,540
<17-6,House>讲道理的人定规矩靠证据
<17-6,House>Reasonable people make rules based on evidence--

440
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,210
<17-6,House>好比走50码有困难
<17-6,House>like difficulty covering a distance, say 50 yards,

441
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,710
<17-6,House>而不是依据预设的悲惨度等级
<17-6,House>not on some pre-ordained pathetic-ness scale.

442
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,740
<17-7,Wilson>据我所知,顽固不是第八条天授美德
<17-7,Wilson>Last I checked,pigheadedness was not the eighth heavenly virtue.

443
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,130
<17-8,House>做错了才叫顽固不化
<17-8,House>It's only pigheaded if you're wrong.

444
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,010
<17-8,House>做对了 这叫做坚持原则
<17-8,House>If you're right, they call it sticking to your principles.

445
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,790
<17-9,Wilson>放弃吧 你这是自贬身份
<17-9,Wilson>Give it up.You're demeaning yourself.

446
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,390
<17-10,House>有人也这么对Rosa Parks说过,(美国现代民权运动之母)
<17-10,House>That's what they told rosa parks.

447
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
<17-11,Wilson>别站起来
<17-11,Wilson>Don't stand up in there.

448
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,440
<17-11,Wilson>我可盯着你的脚
<17-11,Wilson>I'm watching your feet.

449
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,600
<18-1,Franklin>离开我们家
<18-1,Franklin>Get out of our home.

450
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,940
<18-2,Leah>这里不是谁的家
<18-2,Leah>This is not a home.

451
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,630
<18-2,Leah>当然不
<18-2,Leah>It's certainly not--

452
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,260
<18-3,Judy>只要我们儿子在 这儿就是我们家
<18-3,Judy>it's our home as long as our son is here.

453

<18-4,Stevie>妈 爸 能不能冷静一下
<18-4,Stevie>Mom, dad, will you just please just calm down?

454
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,700
<18-5,Franklin>你不是家人
<18-5,Franklin>You're not family.

455
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,800
<18-5,Franklin>不能待在这儿
<18-5,Franklin>You have no right to be here.

456
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,290
<18-6,Leah>你要做什么 把我扔出去?
<18-6,Leah>What are you gonna do,throw me out?

457
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,480
<18-6,Leah>你不能碰外族女人
<18-6,Leah>You can't even touch the gadje.

458
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,540
<18-7,Judy>我来碰你
<18-7,Judy>I'll touch you.

459
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,650
<18-8,Foreman>怎么了?
<18-8,Foreman>What is going on?

460
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
<18-9,Leah>是我送他进医院的
<18-9,Leah>I'm the one who brought him here.

461
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,430
<18-9,Leah>我有权知道他的情况
<18-9,Leah>I should be able to see how he's doing.

462
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,630
<18-10,Judy>如果不是你 他不会来这儿
<18-10,Judy>He wouldn't even need to be here if it weren't for you.

463
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,560
<18-11,Leah>是我不干净 让他的肝脏衰竭
<18-11,Leah>Right--I'm so unclean,I caused his liver to shut down.

464
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,640
<18-11,Leah>够了
<18-11,Leah>Enough.

465
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,700
<18-12,Foreman>没人会被赶走
<18-12,Foreman>No one is leaving.

466
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,790
<18-13,Franklin>他是我们的儿子 我们要她离开
<18-13,Franklin>He's our son,and we want her out of here.

467
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,270
<18-14,Stevie>很疼
<18-14,Stevie>It hurts.

468
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,900
<18-15,Foreman>又是你的胃?
<18-15,Foreman>Your stomach again?

469
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,680
<18-15,Foreman>不 哪里?
<18-15,Foreman>No.What?

470
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,640
<19-1,Foreman>他的肝脏有了起色
<19-1,Foreman>his liver's actually improving.

471
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,990
<19-1,Foreman>堵住了一个孔 又捅开另一个
<19-1,Foreman>We plug one hole and end up poking another.

472
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,530
<19-2,House>这是讨论病情还是,向Cuddy申请加薪?
<19-2,House>We talking about the patient or how to get a raise from cuddy?

473
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,450
<19-3,Foreman>针对韦格纳病的治疗使他膀胱大出血
<19-3,Foreman>The wegener's treatment gave him a massive hemorrhagein his bladder.

474
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,420
<19-4,House>意味着...
<19-4,House>Which means...

475
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,420
<19-4,House>是韦格纳病
<19-4,House>it's wegener'S.

476
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,340
<19-5,Foreman>我刚说什么了?
<19-5,Foreman>What did I just say?

477
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,590
<19-6,Cameron>以韦格纳病来治疗 结果一切都糟糕
<19-6,Cameron>we were treating him for wegener's when eveverything went wrong.

478
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,410
<19-7,House>并非全部
<19-7,House>Not everything.

479
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,140
<19-8,Foreman>是 今天好天气
<19-8,Foreman>Yeah, it was a very lovely day outside.

480
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,680
<19-8,Foreman>可是 治疗让他情况更糟
<19-8,Foreman>On the other hand,the treatment made him worse.

481
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,890
<19-9,House>治疗让他的膀胱变糟 不是肝
<19-9,House>Treatment made his bladder worse, not his liver.

482
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,370
<19-10,Chase>肝脏的凝块在消解
<19-10,Chase>Clot in the liver's breaking up.

483
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,220
<19-11,House>核磁共振 痰检 血管紧张素转换酶水平,排除了肺结核 肉状瘤
<19-11,House>And the mri, sputum, and ace ruled out tb, sarcoidosis,

484
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,040
<19-11,House>和淋巴瘤 只剩下
<19-11,House>and lymphoma, which leaves us with...

485
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,440
<19-12,Cameron>仍可能是癌症--
<19-12,Cameron>still could be a cancer with multiple--

486
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,080
<19-13,House>用核磁共振 断层摄影 验血,都没检查出的癌症?
<19-13,House>a cancer we can't see on mri, ct, or blood tests?

487
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,200
<19-13,House>是韦格纳病
<19-13,House>It's wegener'S.

488
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,790
<19-15,House>并非诊断错了
<19-15,House>It's not the wrong diagnosis.

489
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,890
<19-15,House>而是治疗有误
<19-15,House>It's the wrong treatment.

490
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,570
<19-16,Foreman>可以加强对免疫系统抑制
<19-16,Foreman>We could increase immuno suppression.

491
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,420
<19-16,Foreman>用上甲氨蝶呤
<19-16,Foreman>Add methotrexate.

492
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,960
<19-17,Chase>不能给肺有问题的孩子用甲氨喋呤
<19-17,Chase>we can't give methotrexate to a kid who's already had lung problems.

493
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,140
<19-18,House>甲氨喋呤地毯式轰炸
<19-18,House>Methotrexateis carpet bombing.

494
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,010
<19-18,House>什么炸飞了
<19-18,House>Hits everything.

495
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,790
<19-18,House>我们需要精确制导炸弹
<19-18,House>We need a smart bomb.

496
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,480
<19-18,House>不是抑制免疫系统 而是改变它
<19-18,House>So we don't suppress the immune system-- we change it.

497
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,030
<19-18,House>免疫调节
<19-18,House>Immune modulation.

498
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,420
<19-19,Cameron>Ft-28(免疫调节剂）
<19-19,Cameron>Ft-28.

499
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,770
<19-18,House>他的抗体攻击自身的血管
<19-18,House>His antibodies are attacking his blood vessels.

500
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,070
<19-18,House>应激导致出血和凝结
<19-18,House>The irritation causes them to bleed and clot.

501
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,610
<19-18,House>我们改变他的免疫系统使抗体
<19-18,House>We change his immune system so the antibodies don't interact

502
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,140
<19-18,House>不再攻击血管 在别处正常工作
<19-18,House>with his blood vessels but work fine everywhere else.

503
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,580
<19-19,Cameron>Ft-28仍在试验中
<19-19,Cameron>Ft-28's still experimental.

504
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,070
<19-19,Cameron>没得到药监局批准
<19-19,Cameron>It's not fda-approved.

505
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,760
<19-20,House>对克罗氏病和风湿性关节炎疗效显著
<19-20,House>It's worked for crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

506
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,390
<19-21,Chase>他没得克罗氏病和关节炎
<19-21,Chase>He doesn't have crohn's or arthritis.

507
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,380
<19-22,House>那就假设他有...
<19-22,House>Let's say that he does...

508
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,350
<19-22,House>并开始治疗
<19-22,House>and start the treatment.

509
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,680
<20-1,Franklin>绝对不行
<20-1,Franklin>absolutely not.

510
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,330
<20-1,Franklin>我们族人曾被用于实验 绝不允许再发生
<20-1,Franklin>My people have been experimented on before.Never again.

511
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,440
<20-2,Foreman>Lipa先生 恕我直言
<20-2,Foreman>Mr.Lipa,with all due respect,

512
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,360
<20-2,Foreman>拿这家医院和奥斯威辛(集中营),相比太荒谬了
<20-2,Foreman>comparing this hospitalto auschwitz is ridiculous.

513
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,860
<20-2,Foreman>Ft-28的安全性在,几百位患者身上都得到了验证
<20-2,Foreman>Ft-28's been proven safe in hundreds--

514
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,390
<20-3,Franklin>人们总说自己值得信任
<20-3,Franklin>people always say you can trust them.

515
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,540
<20-3,Franklin>为什么不说点别的?
<20-3,Franklin>Why would they say anything else?

516
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,520
<20-3,Franklin>我们怎么会轻信
<20-3,Franklin>Why do they think we would listen--

517
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,820
<20-4,Foreman>嗨 你以为我不了解这种感受
<20-4,Foreman>hey, hey, hey.You think I don't understand what it's like to

518
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,690
<20-4,Foreman>来自于曾被奴役和虐待的民族
<20-4,Foreman>come from a people who've been enslaved, mistreated,

519
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
<20-4,Foreman>也曾被作为实验对象
<20-4,Foreman>and experimented on?

520
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,770
<20-4,Foreman>塔斯基吉实验二战后还持续了28年,(以黑人男子做梅毒实验)
<20-4,Foreman>Tuskegee went on for 28 years after world war ii.

521
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,170
<20-5,Franklin>禁止罗马尼人踏入这个州的法令,(吉普赛人原称罗马尼人)
<20-5,Franklin>And the laws that made it illegal for the romani to even set foot

522
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,190
<20-5,Franklin>直到1998年还是白纸黑字
<20-5,Franklin>in this state were still on the books until 1998.

523
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,630
<20-5,Franklin>这历史不算古老
<20-5,Franklin>It's not ancient history.

524
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,600
<20-6,Foreman>常规治疗不起作用
<20-6,Foreman>Conventional therapy hasn't worked.

525
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,990
<20-6,Foreman>你的儿子说不定会死的
<20-6,Foreman>Your son may be dying.

526
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,490
<20-6,Foreman>他需要针对性治疗 你要相信我们
<20-6,Foreman>He needs a targeted approach,and you need to trust us.

527
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,130
<20-6,Foreman>我很抱歉
<20-6,Foreman>I'm sorry.

528
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,390
<20-7,Judy>毕生的经历告诫我们不能相信你
<20-7,Judy>A life time of experiences tells me I can't trust you.

529
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,880
<20-7,Judy>过去的三天也不会改变这信念
<20-7,Judy>And the past three days have done nothing to change that.

530
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,280
<20-8,Franklin>我们想让儿子接受治疗 不是当作实验品
<20-8,Franklin>We want our son treated,not experimented on.

531
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,150
<20-8,Franklin>如果你束手无策 直说就是
<20-8,Franklin>If you don't know how to do that, then just tell us

532
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,890
<20-8,Franklin>我们带他到有办法的地方去
<20-8,Franklin>so we can take him someplace where they do.

533
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,150
<21-1,House>他们做的没错
<21-1,House>they're absolutely right.

534
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,260
<21-1,House>远离未经证实 实验性的东西
<21-1,House>Stay away from that unproven, experimental stuff.

535
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,420
<21-1,House>不如执着于变换家具布置 直到他好转
<21-1,House>Much better to stick with the "moving of furniture until he gets better" approach.

536
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,290
<21-2,Foreman>是  说的对
<21-2,Foreman>Yes, you're right.

537
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,740
<21-2,Foreman>我们该想出别的方案
<21-2,Foreman>We're gonna have to come up with something else.

538
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,170
<21-3,House>这已经是没办法的办法了
<21-3,House>You mean another last-ditch desperation move?

539
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,820
<21-3,House>有还有别的主意?
<21-3,House>You got anything?

540
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,830
<21-3,House>再去说服 只许成不许败
<21-3,House>Go back and don't take no for an answer.

541
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,220
<21-3,House>你算什么推销员?
<21-3,House>What kind a salesman are you?

542
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,630
<21-4,Foreman>我不想跟这些往窗户上贴锡纸的人打交道,(吉普赛人极度神秘)
<21-4,Foreman>The kind who avoids the house with the crazy couple who put tinfoil over their windows.

543
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,220
<21-5,House>如果他们买得起锡纸,就有钱买你的东西
<21-5,House>They got money for tinfoil, they got money for whatever you're selling.

544
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,940
<21-6,Foreman>什么意思?
<21-6,Foreman>What's that mean?

545
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,110
<21-7,House>如果他们不信任你 不妨以毒攻毒
<21-7,House>Means that if they don't trust you, you should earn that lack of trust.

546
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,070
<21-8,Foreman>付钱买锡纸什么意思?
<21-8,Foreman>what does paying for tinfoil mean?

547
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,760
<21-9,House>我为什么要回答所有的问题?
<21-9,House>Why should I have to answer all the questions?

548
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,210
<21-9,House>哦 对不起
<21-9,House>Oops.Sorry.

549
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,850
<21-9,House>动力方向没掌握好
<21-9,House>Still getting used to the power steering.

550
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,330
<21-9,House>我想你听说了?
<21-9,House>I assume you've heard the news?

551
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,460
<21-10,Whitner>我一点不担心
<21-10,Whitner>I'm not worried.

552
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,730
<21-10,Whitner>就我看来 你不知羞耻还没自制力
<21-10,Whitner>From what I hear,what you lack in shame you also lack in will power.

553
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,040
<21-11,House>我或许意志软弱 但是骨头硬
<21-11,House>My will may be weak, but my backbone is strong.

554
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,910
<21-11,House>不拄拐杖 腿都不疼了
<21-11,House>And pain-free, now that I've stopped using the cane.

555
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,310
<21-11,House>当然瞟Cuddy的低领衫难度加大
<21-11,House>'Course, it's harder to look down cuddy's shirt.

556
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,660
<21-11,House>看她翘臀的优势显著增加
<21-11,House>Then, the vantage point on her ass is much improved.

557
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,010
<21-11,House>这就是我 永远看着光明的一面
<21-11,House>That's just me--alwayslooking on the bright side.

558
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,170
<21-11,House>我就是那个说她的C罩杯名不副实的人
<21-11,House>I'm the guy who said that her c cups are half-full.

559
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,090
<21-12,Whitner>还真辣  不是么
<21-12,Whitner>They are nice,aren't they?

560
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,010
<21-12,Whitner>哦 不
<21-12,Whitner>Oh...no.

561
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,850
<21-13,House>想讨好我不是这么容易
<21-13,House>You're not gonna win me over that easily.

562
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,910
<21-13,House>光有个轮子(坐轮椅)
<21-13,House>You may have a wheel.

563
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,540
<21-13,House>还不能上润滑油(得到通融)
<21-13,House>It doesn't mean you get the grease.

564
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
<21-13,House>这轮子必须吱吱作响(还要会闹事),[谚: squeak wheel gets grease]
<21-13,House>You gotta squeak.

565
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,550
<21-13,House>这是什么？
<21-13,House>What's that?

566
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,180
<22-1,Franklin>环磷酰胺
<22-1,Franklin>Cyclophosphamide.

567
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,530
<22-2,Foreman>我们应你的要求用常规治疗
<22-2,Foreman>We're continuing the standard treatment as you requested.

568
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,320
<22-2,Foreman>请大家都离开几分钟
<22-2,Foreman>Uh, I have to ask everyone to leave the room for a few minutes

569
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,860
<22-2,Foreman>我好换绷带
<22-2,Foreman>while I apply some bandages.

570
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,680

<22-6,Foreman>我们要换个方法治疗 但你父母不同意
<22-6,Foreman>We need to changeyour treatment, but your parentswon't let us.

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,640
<22-6,Foreman>他们认定我们想拿你
<22-6,Foreman>They've got it in their minds that we want to try

577
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,150
<22-6,Foreman>做没人性的实验
<22-6,Foreman>some sort of inhuman experiment on you.

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,830
<22-9,Stevie>你建议这个
<22-9,Stevie>The fact that you're recommending...

582
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,560
<22-9,Stevie>实验性疗法是因为没有选择了?
<22-9,Stevie>experimental treatment means you haveno other options?

583
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,720
<22-9,Stevie>恐怕是
<22-9,Stevie>Sorry.

<22-14,Foreman>The rest of the world,though--

591
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,870
<22-15,Stevie>不能信任别的人
<22-15,Stevie>the rest of the world can't trust.

<22-16,Foreman>你可以相信我
<22-16,Foreman>You can trust me.

<22-17,Stevie>How do I know?

594
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,210
<22-18,Foreman>要是你服药 再告诉你父母,我的执照会被吊销
<22-18,Foreman>Because if you do this,then tell your parents, I lose my license.

<23-1,Foreman>might as well stage the diseasewhile he's still on the table.

00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,320
<23-2,House>什么事情花这么长时间

00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,150
<23-9,House>在他的肝脏里有一个肉芽肿
<23-9,House>He had a granulomain his liver.

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,310
<23-9,House>不 那只不过是疤痕组织

<16-1,Foreman>核磁共振看上去象肉芽肿 但是并不是
<16-1,Foreman>Looked like a granuloma on the mri, but it's not.

<16-2,Stevie>不知道这有什么需要争论的

634
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,500
<23-8,House>他状况不稳定
<23-8,House>He's unstable.

635
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,830
<23-9,House>他有韦格纳病 意味着他有肉芽肿
<23-9,House>He's got wegener's,which means he's got granulomas.

<23-12,House>如果他是鸵鸟 你得等上46英尺
<23-12,House>If he were an ostrich,you'd have a 46-foot wait.

647
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,360
<23-19,House>介意我缝合么
<23-19,House>Mind if we close?

648
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,490
<23-19,House>幸好我们推销ft-28没有成功
<23-19,House>Well, it's a good thing we never sold him on ft-28.

649
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,640
<23-19,House>他父母是正确的
<23-19,House>His parents were right.

650
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,660
<24-1,Cameron>他父母不会再让我们靠近他了
<24-1,Cameron>There's no way his parents are gonna let us near him again.

651
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,340
<24-2,Foreman>手术恢复之前 没法把他转移到别的医院
<24-2,Foreman>they won't be able to transfer him until he's recovered from the surgery.

652
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,690
<24-3,Chase>这下手术组也不会和我们亲近了
<24-3,Chase>You can add the surgical team to the list of people who won't let us near him.

<24-5,Foreman>We should test himfor von willebrand'S.

656
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,810
<24-6,House>或者来玩一下井字棋
<24-6,House>Or we could just play tic-tac-toe.

<24-6,House>X代表出血

00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,930
<24-6,House>从肺部开始的 对吧
<24-6,House>We started in the lungs, right?

660
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,750
<24-6,House>我们都做了什么
<24-6,House>What did we do?

00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,400
<24-8,House>一次出血 一次凝块
<24-8,House>That's one bleed, one clot.

663
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,170
<24-8,House>然后呢
<24-8,House>Then what?

664
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,740
<24-9,Foreman>肝脏停止工作

<24-17,House>我没有查过大肠
<24-17,House>I didn't run that.

678
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,290
<24-18,Cameron>因为没有理由去查

727
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:30,040
<26-8,Foreman>不 像是根 牙签

728
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,340
<27-2,Franklin>你确定?
<27-2,Franklin>Are you sure?

729
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,970
<27-3,Foreman>他一定是意外吞了下去
<27-3,Foreman>He must have swallowed it accidentally and

730
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,320
<27-3,Foreman>以为总归可以把它消化
<27-3,Foreman>just figured he'd digest it eventually.

731
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,380
<27-3,Foreman>当你们在车里亲热时
<27-3,Foreman>When you two were making out in the car,

732
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,770
<27-3,Foreman>肠道弯曲压迫那根牙签
<27-3,Foreman>it must have folded awkwardly and pushed the toothpick

733
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,170
<27-3,Foreman>穿过肠壁刺进了肺部
<27-3,Foreman>through the wall of the intestine and into the lung.

734
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,950
<27-3,Foreman>移动到肝部 并且前进到他的膀胱和脾脏
<27-3,Foreman>And it moved on to his liver and made its wayto his bladder and spleen.

735
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,480
<27-4,Leah>就这样 他会好起来的吧
<27-4,Leah>So that's it.He's gonna be okay.

736
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,300
<27-5,Foreman>对 几个小洞
<27-5,Foreman>Yeah.Small holes.

737
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,560
<27-5,Foreman>既然取出来了 他好起来就快了
<27-5,Foreman>He shouldn't take that long to heal, now that we've got it out.

738
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,330
<27-6,Franklin>瞧
<27-6,Franklin>See?

00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,460
<27-8,Judy>如果你不吻他...
<27-8,Judy>If you hadn't been kissing him...

742
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,340
<27-9,Leah>你听到了这 是因为牙签!
<27-9,Leah>that's what you heard?It was the toothpick!

743
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,610
<27-9,Leah>是因为那令人恶心的习惯--
<27-9,Leah>It was that disgusting habit--

744
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,580
<27-10,Franklin>要不是他扭曲身体 牙签早排出了
<27-10,Franklin>it would have just passed right through him if he hadn't been writhing around.

745
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,890
<27-10,Franklin>难道不对么--
<27-10,Franklin>Isn't that right--

746
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,190
<27-10,Franklin>- 就这个?,- 对
<27-10,Franklin>- that's it?,- Yeah.

747
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,200
<28-1,Stevie>就这个
<28-1,Stevie>That's it.

748
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,600
<28-2,Foreman>木材吸水 密度和它周围的组织一样
<28-2,Foreman>Wood absorbs water, becomes the same density as the tissue around it.

749
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,830
<28-2,Foreman>所以在CT和核磁共振上都看不到
<28-2,Foreman>That's why it didn't show upon the ct or mri.

750
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,700
<28-3,Stevie>挺酷的
<28-3,Stevie>That's cool.

751
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:31,690
<28-3,Stevie>我是吃了苦,可这么小的东西带来这么大伤害
<28-3,Stevie>I mean, not cool for me, but...lotta damagefor something so small.

752
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,670
<28-4,Foreman>这里的实验室 有一个带薪实习的职位
<28-4,Foreman>You know, the lab here, they have a paid intern position.

754
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,950
<28-4,Foreman>但如果你想 我可以给你个面试的机会
<28-4,Foreman>but if you want, I could probably get you an interview.

755
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,330
<28-4,Foreman>一些入门杂活
<28-4,Foreman>There's some entry-level stuff,some gopher work,

756
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,890
<28-4,Foreman>但能接触到许多很酷的事
<28-4,Foreman>but you'd also have access to a lot of cool things.

<28-5,Stevie>谢谢 真的 但 我不能
<28-5,Stevie>Thanks, really, but...I can'T.

<28-6,Foreman>你比大多数的医生有更强的好奇心
<28-6,Foreman>You have more curiosity than 90% of the doctors on the staff.

761
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,430
<28-6,Foreman>不是那样
<28-6,Foreman>Uh...it's not that.

762
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,490
<28-7,Stevie>只是...
<28-7,Stevie>It's just...

763
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,740
<28-7,Stevie>我每天都跟家人一起工作
<28-7,Stevie>I go to work every day with my family, you know?

<28-9,Stevie>No, I can'T.

768
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,630
<28-10,Foreman>因为他们不想让你那样
<28-10,Foreman>Because they don't want to let you.

769
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,500
<28-10,Foreman>他们不应该替你作选择的
<28-10,Foreman>They shouldn't be making you choose.

770
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,720
<28-11,Stevie>也许不应该 但就是这样
<28-11,Stevie>Maybe not, but they are.

771
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,070
<28-11,Stevie>我也选择他们
<28-11,Stevie>And I'm choosing them.
