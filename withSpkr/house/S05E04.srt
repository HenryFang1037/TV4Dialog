67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,410
<2-21,House>转移话题不是因为我想躲避沉重的事

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,370
<2-21,House>我转移话题是因为我想躲避肤浅的事
<2-21,House>I'm deflecting because I'mabcavoiding something shallow.

<13-1,Kutner>病人都要呆在病房里
<13-1,Kutner>Patients stay inside.

<13-4,Nicole>每次我和家人出门 人们都会盯着我看
<13-4,Nicole>People stare at me anyabctime I'm out with my family.

200
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,120
<13-4,Nicole>就像个谜语一样
<13-4,Nicole>It's like a puzzle.

<13-4,Nicole>"猜猜哪个不是亲生的"
<13-4,Nicole>"Which one of theseabcthings doesn't belong?"

<13-6,Nicole>做个与众不同的好孩子一定容易许多
<13-6,Nicole>Must be easier to beabcdifferent when you're a success.

<13-6,Nicole>怎么了?
<13-6,Nicole>Is that a problem?

208
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,630
<13-7,Kutner>这就是为什么待在病房里比较好

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,950
<14-10,House>随我加入到阴暗面吧
<14-10,House>Join me on the dark side.

231
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,900
<14-11,Wilson>你的阴暗面结束了 House
<14-11,Wilson>The dark side's done,House.

232
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,980
<14-11,Wilson>我只负责把你送到你母亲面前 别的不管
<14-11,Wilson>I'm delivering you to yourabcmother, and that's it.

233
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,580
<14-11,Wilson>我向前看了
<14-11,Wilson>I have moved on.

234
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,070
<15-1,Cameron>你们觉得House会送什么abc"温柔的安慰" 还是"窝心的着想"花束?
<15-1,Cameron>What do you think House would send, the "gentleabccomfort" arrangement or the "warm thoughts" bouquet?

235
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,230
<15-1,Cameron>我说假如他不是混蛋的话
<15-1,Cameron>I mean, if he wasn't an ass.

236
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,550
<15-2,Chase>送个巨大的棺材型饼干
<15-2,Chase>Send one of those giantabccookies shaped like a coffin.

237
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,020
<15-2,Chase>他妈妈会相信是House送的
<15-2,Chase>His mom would believe it was from him.

238
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,010
<15-3,Foreman>你们想送什么就送什么
<15-3,Foreman>I didn't tell you soabcyou could send anything.

239
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,630
<15-3,Foreman>只想提醒下 这人跟人类的标准相去甚远
<15-3,Foreman>Just wanted you to know the extent to whichabcthe man is disconnected from the human race.

240
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,070
<15-4,Kutner>用了六袋冰冻血浆才止住出血
<15-4,Kutner>Took a six-pack ofabcffp to stop the oozing.

241
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,390
<15-5,Cameron>她既有出血又有血栓?
<15-5,Cameron>She's bleeding and clotting?

242
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,660
<15-6,Kutner>检出裂红细胞说明是弥散性血管内凝血abc也就是说她有癌症
<15-6,Kutner>Plus schistocytes on her smear meansabcit's dic, which means she's got cancer.

243
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,030
<15-7,Cameron>她还年轻 可能是白血病
<15-7,Cameron>She's young. It could be leukemia.

244
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,110
<15-8,Kutner>不太可能 白细胞计数正常
<15-8,Kutner>Normal wbc makes that less likely.

245
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,790
<15-9,Foreman>腹痛可能说明是胃肠道肿瘤
<15-9,Foreman>The belly pain points toward a G.I.Tumor.

246
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,900
<15-10,Kutner>House已经做过超声了
<15-10,Kutner>House already didan ultrasound.

247
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,560
<15-11,Foreman>但他不是在找肿瘤 去做CT
<15-11,Foreman>He wasn't looking forabca tumor. Go run a ct.

248
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,730
<15-12,Chase>我不信
<15-12,Chase>I don't buy it.

249
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,410
<15-13,Foreman>CT可以找到小肠的癌变 但是超声...
<15-13,Foreman>Ct can find small intestinalabccancers that an ultrasound--

250
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,890
<15-12,Chase>我不信House无动于衷
<15-12,Chase>I don't buy House.

251
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,160
<15-14,Chase>我爸爸去世时 虽然我恨他abc但我慌得害死了一个病人
<15-14,Chase>When my father died,I wound upabckilling a patient. And I hated the man.

252
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,900
<15-14,Chase>不管House如何嘴硬abc我肯定他已经六神无主了
<15-14,Chase>Whatever House says or doesn'tabcsay, I'm sure the guy's a mess.

253
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,290
<16-1,Wilson>即便他是混蛋 还是你父亲
<16-1,Wilson>So he was a bastard. Heabcwas still your father.

254
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,770
<16-1,Wilson>你们在生理上的联系abc决定了你对他有感情
<16-1,Wilson>You're biologically programmed toabchave feelings for him.

255
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,390
<16-2,House>不 我没有
<16-2,House>No, I'm not.

256
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,600
<16-3,Wilson>感情不能用理性衡量
<16-3,Wilson>Feelings aren't rational.

257
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,530
<16-3,Wilson>我知道你无法接受不能量化的事物
<16-3,Wilson>I know you have trouble with anythingabcthat can't be quantified and counted.

258
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,700
<16-4,House>他不是我亲生爸爸
<16-4,House>He's not my biological father.

259
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,840
<16-4,House>我12岁时就发现了
<16-4,House>I figured it out when I was 12.

260
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,640
<16-4,House>当然咯
<16-4,House>Of course.

261
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,030
<16-5,Wilson>你12岁时已是这般遗世独立了
<16-5,Wilson>You were a brilliant,sociallyabcisolated 12-year-old,

262
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,740
<16-5,Wilson>于是你臆想出另一个世界abc好让你的人生不那么糟糕
<16-5,Wilson>and you create a parallel universeabcin which your life doesn't suck.

263
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,830
<16-6,House>我有事实为据
<16-6,House>I look at the facts.

264
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,850
<16-6,House>首先 我妈妈怀我时abc他被派遣到冲绳训练
<16-6,House>First of all, he was deployed on training exercisesabcoff okinawa during the time I had to be conceived.

265
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,560
<16-7,Wilson>鉴于你已经150岁了abc他当年没有飞机可以坐回来
<16-7,Wilson>And since you're 150 yearsabcold, air travel was impossible.

266
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,770
<16-8,House>他的第二根脚趾比脚趾头长
<16-8,House>His second toe isabclonger than his big toe.

267
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,000
<16-8,House>而我的不是
<16-8,House>Mine isn't.

268
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,070
<16-9,Wilson>真可悲 你竟怀疑你妈在外面乱搞--
<16-9,Wilson>This is sad. You don'tabcbelieve your mother screwed around--

269
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,290
<16-10,House>我头皮上有块特别的胎记abc我妈有个朋友也有这么一块
<16-10,House>I have a distinctivered birthmark on my scalpabcthat matches a certain friend of the family.

270
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,670
<16-11,Wilson>假如你相信这是真的abc你就不会说胎记了
<16-11,Wilson>If you believed this story, you wouldn'tabcbe telling me about his birthmarks.

271
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,530
<16-11,Wilson>而是基因测试的结果
<16-11,Wilson>You'd be telling me about theabcgenetic testing you had done.

272
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,750
<16-11,Wilson>既然你没提 显然是你还没做
<16-11,Wilson>And sinceyou haven't mentionedabcit, obviously, you didn't do it.

273
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,310
<16-11,Wilson>因为你不想-- House 你想干吗?
<16-11,Wilson>Because you don't wantabcto--House, what are you doing?

274
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,710
<16-11,Wilson>把你的-- 拿开 有警察!
<16-11,Wilson>Get your--get offabcthe-- there's a cop!

275
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,980
<17-1,Kutner>Nicole 躺着别动 只要几秒就好
<17-1,Kutner>Nicole, lie still. This'llabconly take a few seconds.

276
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,230
<17-2,Taub>在上腹切开1毫米
<17-2,Taub>one millimeter cutabcthrough upper abdomen.

277
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,130
<17-3,Kutner>养父母当时以为自己不能生育 收养了她
<17-3,Kutner>She was adopted when the parentsabcthought they couldn't have kids.

278
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,380
<17-3,Kutner>后来他们又有了三个孩子
<17-3,Kutner>Then they had three more.

279
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,350
<17-3,Kutner>她把这一切理解为abc"谢谢参与 但我们有自己的孩子了"
<17-3,Kutner>She took the message as "thanks forabcplaying, but we have our real children now."

280
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,040
<17-4,Taub>然而在亲生孩子看来abc自己的降生是意外 她才是父母亲手挑选的
<17-4,Taub>And the real children probably thinkabcthey're accidents while she was hand-picked.

281
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,880
<17-4,Taub>每个人都对父母不满
<17-4,Taub>Everybody's gotabcproblems with their parents.

282
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,000
<17-5,Kutner>但她成了瘾君子abc一定出了什么问题
<17-5,Kutner>She's an addict. Something went wrong.

283
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,970
<17-6,Taub>一定是父母的问题吗? 把胰腺部分放大
<17-6,Taub>And it has to be theabcparents? Magnifying pancreas.

284
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,560
<17-7,Kutner>我没说是父母的错
<17-7,Kutner>I'm not saying the parents screwed up.

285
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,720
<17-8,Taub>你说的是你喜欢她
<17-8,Taub>You're saying you like her.

286
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,420
<17-8,Taub>所以你不希望这是她的错
<17-8,Taub>So you don't want herabcfaults to be her fault.

287
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,550
<17-8,Taub>但总归是某个人的错abc然而除了她 你只认识--
<17-8,Taub>But they're someone's fault, andabcthe only other people you know are--

288
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,560
<17-9,Kutner>看来我们又得找House了
<17-9,Kutner>I think we may need to call House again.

289
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,440
<18-1,House>你一不小心开快了?
<18-1,House>you lost track of your speed?

290
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,950
<18-1,House>这简直是希特勒式的借口
<18-1,House>I think that was hitler's excuse.

291
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,010
<18-1,House>一不小心杀了无数犹太人
<18-1,House>Lost track of the jews.

292
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,620
<18-1,House>结果没人追究他责任
<18-1,House>No one held him responsible.

293
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,810
<18-2,Wilson>我不想开玩笑 House
<18-2,Wilson>I'm not playing House.

294
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,450
<18-3,House>你想保护我
<18-3,House>You were protecting me.

295
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,530
<18-3,House>换作正常人都会把我捅出来
<18-3,House>Anybody in their right mindabcwould have ratted me out.

296
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,720
<18-4,Wilson>我只想尽快解决问题
<18-4,Wilson>I'm just trying to speed things along.

297
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,640
<18-4,Wilson>你一定得出席葬礼
<18-4,Wilson>You are going to this funeral.

298
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,360
<18-5,House>有话快说
<18-5,House>Make it fast.

299
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,580
<18-5,House>我可不想错过搜查肛门的镜头
<18-5,House>I don't want to miss theabcanal cavity search.

300
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,610
<18-6,Foreman>似乎胰腺里有个肿块
<18-6,Foreman>Looks like a mass in the pancreas.

301
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,080
<18-7,House>我可看不到 这是无线通信abc我要详细的描述
<18-7,House>Not to me. This is radio.abcAnd I want a full play-by-play.

<18-8,Foreman>有大量积液
<18-8,Foreman>It's fluid-filled.

303

<18-9,Costello>麻烦你下车好吗 先生?
<18-9,Costello>Would you get out ofabcthe car, please, sir?

<18-15,Foreman>Seriously? What'd you do?

311
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,830
<18-16,House>显然我在开玩笑
<18-16,House>I'm obviously joking.

312
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,130
<18-16,House>要是Wilson被拷上手铐摁到了车头盖上abc我还能气定神闲地做鉴别诊断吗?
<18-16,House>If wilson was getting handcuffed on the hood ofabchis car, would I be carrying on a differential?

<19-1,Kutner>压路机代表什么? 威力abc也许是胰腺癌
<19-1,Kutner>what are the traits of a steamroller?abcPowerful. Maybe pancreatic cancer.

323
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,480
<19-2,Foreman>好提议abc但能解释的症状只有好似压路机般
<19-2,Foreman>Great idea,except the only symptom itabcmatches up with is being steamrollerish.

324
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,160
<19-3,Thirteen>你不觉得House想到什么了吗?
<19-3,Thirteen>You don't think House is onto something?

325
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,080
<19-4,Foreman>我相信他已经有了主意
<19-4,Foreman>I think he thought he had an idea.

326
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,300
<19-4,Foreman>但我也相信破译他没说完整的隐喻abc不知有多困难
<19-4,Foreman>I also think his metaphors are toughabcenough to decipher after he's said them.

327
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,900
<19-4,Foreman>把精力集中在医学问题上
<19-4,Foreman>We need to be focusing on the medicine.

331
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,890
<19-8,Foreman>既然他关心肿瘤的尺寸和位置
<19-8,Foreman>He reacted to the size and location.

332
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,300
<19-8,Foreman>我们就注意这些

333
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,140
<19-8,Foreman>而不是在病人岌岌可危的时候abc还在玩什么字谜游戏
<19-8,Foreman>Not playing mad libs while our patient's explodingabcnoun destroys her life-sustaining noun.

334
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,770

335
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,450
<19-10,Thirteen>会不会不是指压路机的特征abc而是它的作用?
<19-10,Thirteen>What if it's not how a steamrollerabcworks, but what it does?

336
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,990
<19-10,Thirteen>清除障碍
<19-10,Thirteen>Clears things.

337
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,300
<19-11,Foreman>简直浪费时间
<19-11,Foreman>This is a waste of time.

338
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,190
<20-1,House>我得接电话
<20-1,House>I need that phone call.

339
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,580
<20-1,House>我是医生 当有人给我连打仨电话
<20-1,House>I'm a doctor, and when someoneabctries to call you three times,

340
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,560
<20-1,House>就是个暗号abc代表"赶紧接电话 不然有人要挂了"
<20-1,House>it's code for "pick up the damnabcphone before someone dies."

341
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,940
<20-2,Costello>我相信医院还有别的好医生
<20-2,Costello>I'm sure there's other smart doctors.

342
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,470
<20-3,House>说出来吓你一跳
<20-3,House>You'd be surprised.

343
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,470
<20-4,Wilson>你说你已经搞定了
<20-4,Wilson>You told me you'd taken care of this.

344
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,970
<20-5,House>的确
<20-5,House>I did.

345
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,130
<20-6,Wilson>这是你对我说的第一句话
<20-6,Wilson>First words you ever said to me.

346
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,160
<20-7,House>我搞定了
<20-7,House>I took care of it.

347
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,750
<20-7,House>肯定是你搞糟的
<20-7,House>You must've screwed up somehow.

348
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,730
<20-7,House>长官
<20-7,House>Sir?

349
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,770
<20-8,Wilson>我不是催你 但我们要去出席葬礼--
<20-8,Wilson>Not to hurry you, but weabcneed to be at a funeral--

350
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:59,320
<20-9,Costello>在路易斯安那州警局答复前abc谁也不准走 不准接电话
<20-9,Costello>nobody is going anywhere or taking anyabcphone calls till I hear back from louisiana.

351
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,370
<20-10,Wilson>这是很久前的拘捕令了
<20-10,Wilson>It's a really old warrant.

352
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,820
<20-10,Wilson>这东西不是有时效性的吗?
<20-10,Wilson>Isn't there a statute ofabclimitations on this kind of thing?

353
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,680
<20-11,House>当你逃出这个州 它会持续生效
<20-11,House>It's suspended when you flee the state.

354
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,090
<20-12,Wilson>我没有逃走 我离开了这个州
<20-12,Wilson>I didn't flee theabcstate. I left the state.

355
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,060
<20-12,Wilson>因为我不住这个州
<20-12,Wilson>Because I don't live in the state.

356
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,210
<20-12,Wilson>而且只是桩很小的罪名...
<20-12,Wilson>And the charges were just so minor...

357
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,280
<20-13,Costello>"毁坏文物及他人财产 攻击他人"
<20-13,Costello>"vandalism, destructionabcof property, assault."

358
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,600
<20-14,Wilson>我可以解释
<20-14,Wilson>There is a simple explanation.

359
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,930
<20-14,Wilson>当时新奥尔良有个医学大会...
<20-14,Wilson>There was a medicalabcconventionin new orleans...

360
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,970
<20-15,Costello>你无需向我解释
<20-15,Costello>you don't need to explain to me.

361
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,130
<20-16,Wilson>我当时刚从医学院毕业
<20-16,Wilson>I was fresh out of med school.

362
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,770
<20-16,Wilson>会上的人我一个不认识
<20-16,Wilson>I didn't know anybody at the convention.

363
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,390
<20-17,House>听到他说了吗 Wilson
<20-17,House>You heard the man,wilson.

364
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,000
<20-17,House>你无需向他解释
<20-17,House>You don't have to explain.

365
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,560
<20-18,Wilson>我不想坐在这浪费时间abc好让你逃避你爸的葬礼!
<20-18,Wilson>I am not gonna sit here wasting time justabcso you can avoid your father's funeral!

366
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,080
<20-19,House>他是我爸
<20-19,House>He's my father.

367
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,980
<20-19,House>我有权避开他的葬礼
<20-19,House>I have the right to avoid his funeral.

368
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,730
<20-20,Costello>不 只要你妈在生 你就没权
<20-20,Costello>Not if your mother's alive,you don't.

369
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,380
<20-20,Costello>好吧...解释我听听
<20-20,Costello>Okay... explain.

370
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,360
<21-1,Chase>House关注8厘米这个点了吗?
<21-1,Chase>did House react toabcthe eight centimeters?

371
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,430
<21-2,Foreman>他吹了一下口哨 囊肿很大abc换了谁都这么认为
<21-2,Foreman>He whistled. It's huge.abcAnyone would think so.

372
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,500
<21-3,Cameron>House要不是关注这点 他不会吹口哨
<21-3,Cameron>House doesn't whistle becauseabche's impressed.

373
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,440
<21-3,Cameron>就是说这出乎他意料
<21-3,Cameron>It means he wasn't expecting it.

374
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,840
<21-3,Cameron>意味着这个点让他改变了主意
<21-3,Cameron>It means he changedabchis mind at that point.

375
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,220
<21-4,Chase>单一的特大囊肿排除了有扩散机制的病abc硬皮病和狼疮
<21-4,Chase>a single super-sized cyst ruled out aabcdiffuse process like scleroderma or lupus.

376
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,680
<21-5,Cameron>排除了扩散abc那只剩下对胰腺本身产生影响的单一机制
<21-5,Cameron>Rule out diffuse process, you're stuck withabcsingle process affecting just the pancreas.

377
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
<21-6,Foreman>结石或者胰腺分裂症
<21-6,Foreman>Gallstones or pancreatic divisum.

378
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,800
<21-7,Chase>他接着问的问题可以缩窄范围
<21-7,Chase>Whatever he asked next wouldabchave narrowed that down.

379
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,030
<21-8,Foreman>他问了位置
<21-8,Foreman>He asked about location.

380
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,120
<21-9,Chase>在头部是结石 尾部是分裂症
<21-9,Chase>Heads it's gallstones,tailsabcit's divisum.

381
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,370
<21-10,Foreman>在头部 她得了结石
<21-10,Foreman>It's at the head. She's got gallstones.

382
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,050
<21-11,Kutner>那个压路机的比喻--
<21-11,Kutner>The steamroller meanspotholes--

383
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,870
<21-12,Foreman>悠着点 我们有结论了
<21-12,Foreman>relax. We got it.

384
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,290
<21-13,Kutner>你们知道她得了结石?
<21-13,Kutner>You figured out she's got gallstones?

385
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,880
<22-1,Wilson>我去了酒店的吧台abc想喝杯酒放松心情
<22-1,Wilson>I was at the hotel bar tryingabcto unwind, have a drink.

386
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:39,630
<22-1,Wilson>有个人不停在点唱机上播abcBilly Joel的"遗下温柔一刻"
<22-1,Wilson>There was this guy who kept playing billy joel'sabcleave a tender moment alone on the jukebox.

387
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,530
<22-2,Costello>"遗下温柔一刻"是首好歌
<22-2,Costello>Leave a tender moment is a good song.

388
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,570
<22-3,House>很棒的歌 他反应过激了
<22-3,House>It's a great song. He was out of line.

389
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,800
<22-4,Costello>虽然没有"意大利餐厅往事"动听
<22-4,Costello>Not as good as scenes fromabcan italian restaurant or...

390
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,160
<22-5,Wilson>我很礼貌地让他别播了
<22-5,Wilson>so I--I asked theabcman to stop, politely.

391
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,190
<22-6,House>没错 你很礼貌地大喊
<22-6,House>Yeah, you yelled politely.

392
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,930
<22-7,Wilson>一开始 我很礼貌地劝了几次abc但那混蛋完全没反应
<22-7,Wilson>I was polite the first couple of times,abcbut courtesy made no impressionon this ass.

393
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,850
<22-7,Wilson>所以我把一个酒瓶扔向镜子
<22-7,Wilson>So I threw a bottle into the mirror,

394
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,770
<22-7,Wilson>以表达我内心的愤懑
<22-7,Wilson>which successfully conveyed my message.

395
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,000
<22-8,House>砸坏一面10尺高的古董镜
<22-8,House>And smashed a ten-foot antique mirror.

396
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,320
<22-8,House>在他的带动下abc两个酒客也砸起了酒杯
<22-8,House>And set an example to two otherabcpatrons who threw shot glasses.

397
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,700
<22-9,Wilson>我和接下来的打斗一点没关系
<22-9,Wilson>I had nothing to do with that fight.

398
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,920
<22-9,Wilson>所谓攻击他人的指控完全不成立
<22-9,Wilson>The assault charge was totally bogus.

399
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,390
<22-9,Wilson>而且我赔偿了那面镜子
<22-9,Wilson>And I paid for the mirror.

400
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,150
<22-10,Costello>我知道怎么一回事了
<22-10,Costello>I think I have the picture.

401
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,490
<22-10,Costello>我想 你就是那个不停播歌的人
<22-10,Costello>I assume you're the guy whoabcwas playing the song.

402
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,860
<22-11,House>不 我是把他保释出来的人
<22-11,House>No, I was the guy who bailed him out.

403
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,620
<22-12,Wilson>我们就是这么认识的 我在监狱里
<22-12,Wilson>That's how we met. I was in jail.

404
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,950
<22-13,Costello>你根本不认识这人 为什么要保释他?
<22-13,Costello>This guy wasa total strangerabcto you, and you bailed him out?

405
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,900
<22-14,House>那个会议很无聊
<22-14,House>It was a boring convention.

406
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,560
<22-14,House>得找个人陪我喝酒
<22-14,House>Had to have somebody to drink with.

407
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,230
<22-15,Wilson>我们的友谊正是建立在这一基础上
<22-15,Wilson>and there's the foundationabcof our entire friendship.

408
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,170
<22-15,Wilson>要不是你某个周末无聊abc这一切根本不存在
<22-15,Wilson>If you hadn't been bored oneabcweekend, it wouldn't even exist.

409
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,200
<22-16,House>嘿 那个会上有3000人
<22-16,House>Hey, there were 3,000abcpeople at that convention.

410
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,340
<22-16,House>你是我唯一觉得不无聊的abc这总说明了什么吧
<22-16,House>You were the one I thought wasn'tabcboring. That says something.

411
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,880
<22-17,Wilson>这也说明了你骗我abc你根本没有替我撤销指控
<22-17,Wilson>It also says something that you lied toabcme about getting the charges dropped!

412
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,730
<22-18,House>我找了个律师 他和警方达成了协议
<22-18,House>I got a lawyer. He cut a deal.

413
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,370
<22-18,House>你后来没找他吗?abc你不知道还要接受传讯吗?
<22-18,House>You didn't call the guy? Youabchave to show up at the arraignment.

414

<22-18,House>Everybody knows that.

415
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,250
<22-19,Wilson>只有你这种成天犯事的人才会知道
<22-19,Wilson>Everybody with yourabcmisdemeanor experience.

416
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,170
<22-20,Costello>你们可以走了
<22-20,Costello>You can go.

<22-21,House>他是个逃犯
<22-21,House>He--he's aabcfugitive from justice.

419

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,160
<24-7,House>而是囊肿引发了这一切症状
<24-7,House>I'm talking about what theabccyst caused. Everything.

446
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,260
<24-8,Foreman>囊肿只是症状 不是病因
<24-8,Foreman>Cysts are symptoms,not diagnoses.

447
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,900
<24-9,House>除非这是一个多囊肿abc与其它器官相联系
<24-9,House>Unless it's a multiple cyst,abcwith connections to other organs--

448
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,130
<24-9,House>好比一台压路机
<24-9,House>like a steamroller.

449
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,210
<24-10,Taub>但和肾离得也太远了吧
<24-10,Taub>That's a long road down to the kidneys.

450
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,460
<24-11,Foreman>我们怎么证实?
<24-11,Foreman>How do we prove it?

451
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,850
<24-11,Foreman>扫描看不出来
<24-11,Foreman>Won't be visible in a scan.

452
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,690
<24-11,Foreman>病人出现肾衰时abcChase也不能在她体内乱捣鼓
<24-11,Foreman>Chase isn't gonna go groping aroundabcwhen she's got kidney failure.

453
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
<24-12,Thirteen>气泡
<24-12,Thirteen>Bubbles.

454
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,370
<24-13,House>是你新脱衣舞娘的名字?
<24-13,House>Is that your new stripper name?

455
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,790
<24-14,Thirteen>是的 我们把气泡注射入囊肿内abc并跟踪它们的去向
<24-14,Thirteen>Yes. And also,we inject bubbles intoabcthe cyst and follow where they drift.

456
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,870
<24-14,Thirteen>如果转移到别的器官 证明你是对的abc把囊肿割除 她就没事了
<24-14,Thirteen>If they end up in the other organs, weabcknow you're right, cut it out, she's fine.

457
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,340
<24-15,House>气泡可行 做个超声
<24-15,House>Bubbles is right. Go echo.

458
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,170
<24-15,House>我没有迷路
<24-15,House>I'm not lost.

459
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,320
<25-1,Taub>Nicole 你得躺着别动
<25-1,Taub>Nicole, you gotta stay still.

460
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,770
<25-2,Nicole>我-我很紧张
<25-2,Nicole>I'm--I'm nervous.

461
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,830
<25-3,Kutner>你不是紧张 而是震颤性谵妄对吧?
<25-3,Kutner>You're not nervous.abcIt's the dts, isn't it?

462
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,680
<25-4,Nicole>我来这儿以后一滴酒都没沾过
<25-4,Nicole>I haven't had a drink since I got here.

463
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,460
<25-4,Nicole>感谢上帝 我们总算没错过
<25-4,Nicole>Good heavens,we haven'tabcmissed it after all.

464
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,400
<26-1,Wilson>像是圣诞颂歌的结尾
<26-1,Wilson>It's like the end of a christmas carol.

465
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,080
<26-2,Blythe>真高兴你来了
<26-2,Blythe>I'm so glad you're here.

466
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,060
<26-2,Blythe>看到你我才卸下了心头大石
<26-2,Blythe>Oh, it's a load off ofabcmy mind just to see you.

467
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,110
<26-2,Blythe>谢谢你 James
<26-2,Blythe>Thank you, james.

468
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,940
<26-3,House>妈 你怎能推迟葬礼?
<26-3,House>Mom, how could you delay the funeral?

469
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,230
<26-4,Blythe>宝贝 你爸爸死了abc他不会介意的
<26-4,Blythe>Honey, your dad is dead.abcHe's not going to care.

<26-4,Blythe>你想好说什么了吗?
<26-4,Blythe>Do you know what you're going to say?

471
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,420
<26-5,House>没想好 让牧师或者他部队的兄弟...
<26-5,House>I don't know. Just let the ministerabcor one of his buddies from the corps...

472
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,790
<26-6,Blythe>你一定得说
<26-6,Blythe>you're talking.

473
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,830
<26-6,Blythe>我不管你是否喜欢他
<26-6,Blythe>I don't care that you didn't like him.

474
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,150
<26-6,Blythe>他是你父亲 而且他很爱你
<26-6,Blythe>He was your father,and he loved you.

475

<26-6,Blythe>战争结束了 Greg
<26-6,Blythe>The war is over, greg.

<26-6,Blythe>别这么紧张兮兮的
<26-6,Blythe>Stop looking so worried.

478
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,260
<26-6,Blythe>我知道他会让我骄傲的
<26-6,Blythe>I know he's gonna make me proud.

<26-7,Wilson>我相信 你比我更了解他
<26-7,Wilson>I'm sure you know him better than I do.

480
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
<27-1,Taub>病情已经危及了肝脏
<27-1,Taub>Her liver's been compromised.

481
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,890
<27-1,Taub>震颤性谵妄会引起她的肌肉抽搐abc注射镇静剂也不起作用
<27-1,Taub>And the dts will cause her muscles toabccontinue to twitch, even under sedation.

482
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,890
<27-1,Taub>我们必须对她全身麻醉
<27-1,Taub>We need to paralyzeabcher to do this procedure.

483
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,590
<27-2,Nicole>我不想这样
<27-2,Nicole>I wanted to stop.

484
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,330
<27-3,Kutner>酚巴比妥昏迷不仅能让我们注入囊肿abc还可以抑止震颤
<27-3,Kutner>A phenobarbital coma will not only allowabcus to inject the cyst,it'll treat the dts.

485
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,840
<27-3,Kutner>当她醒来时 就不会再受戒酒后的苦
<27-3,Kutner>When she wakes up,sheabcwon't be in withdrawal.

486
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,690
<27-4,Bob>我们从前看过她戒酒
<27-4,Bob>We've seen her through withdrawal before.

<27-4,Bob>我们看着她经历一切
<27-4,Bob>We've seen her through everything.

488
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,040
<27-4,Bob>我们支持过 也强硬过
<27-4,Bob>We've been supportive,abcwe've been combative.

489
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,250
<27-4,Bob>曾经半夜把她从酒吧抬回来
<27-4,Bob>We've picked her up fromabcbars in the middle of the night.

490
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,090
<27-4,Bob>也曾经把她留在监狱里过夜
<27-4,Bob>We've let her spend the night in jail.

491
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,610
<27-5,Nicole>我以前总会说 没事的
<27-5,Nicole>I used to say it'd be okay.

492
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,010
<27-5,Nicole>我能挺过来
<27-5,Nicole>That I'd get it together.

493
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,970
<27-5,Nicole>我再也不这么说了
<27-5,Nicole>I don't say that anymore.

494
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,020
<27-6,Kutner>我们先让你恢复健康
<27-6,Kutner>Let's make you healthy.

495
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,030
<27-6,Kutner>再操心怎么让你恢复清醒
<27-6,Kutner>Then we'll worry about making you sober.

496
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,610
<28-1,Minister and mourners>上帝是我的牧羊人 我不应该...
<28-1,Minister and mourners>The lord is my shepherd,abcI shall not want...

497
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,480
<28-2,House>我无话可说
<28-2,House>I am not talking.

498
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,710
<28-2,House>我们只是30年前共用一块地皮的陌生人
<28-2,House>We were strangers who sharedabcsome geography 30 years ago.

499
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,280
<28-3,Wilson>对 你完全没受他的影响
<28-3,Wilson>Right, he had no influence on you at all.

00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,900
<28-3,Wilson>一个对守时有严格要求的父亲
<28-3,Wilson>The father who wasabccompulsive about punctuality.

501
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,280
<28-4,House>这是他的缺点
<28-4,House>His issue.

502
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,510
<28-4,House>我刻意避免变成我的缺点
<28-4,House>Which I deliberately made not my issue.

503
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,290
<28-5,Wilson>却形成你的缺点
<28-5,Wilson>Thereby making it your issue.

504
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:40,280
<28-5,Wilson>就是非得迟到4个小时abc不遵守规章纪律
<28-5,Wilson>Compulsively showing up four hours late,abcignoring discipline,ignoring rules.

505
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,050
<28-6,House>天 他也在
<28-6,House>Oh, god, he's here.

506
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,930
<28-7,Wilson>谁?
<28-7,Wilson>Who's here?

507
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,910
<28-7,Wilson>你假装是你父亲的人?
<28-7,Wilson>The one you're pretending is your father?

508
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,690
<28-7,Wilson>选得好 他长得像Sean Connery
<28-7,Wilson>Nice pick. He looks like sean connery.

509
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,280
<28-7,Wilson>当你计划闹剧的时候abc你有没有跟你老爸讲
<28-7,Wilson>So back when you were devising thisabcfantasy, did you tell your father:

510
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,310
<28-7,Wilson>"老爸 我没认出你abc因为我选007做我老爸了"?
<28-7,Wilson>"Dad, I refuse to recognize your existenceabcbecause I have chosen james bond as my dad"?

511
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,070
<28-8,House>措辞稍有差异
<28-8,House>I used different words.

512
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,330
<28-8,House>什么?
<28-8,House>What?

513

<28-9,Wilson>听到孩子说 因为太恨自己abc连脑海中对父亲的形象都改变了
<28-9,Wilson>Hearing your own son hates you soabcmuch he's replaced you in his mind?

514
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,930
<28-9,Wilson>太糟糕了 他怎么受得了?
<28-9,Wilson>That's gotta suck. How did he take it?

515
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,030
<28-10,House>我跟你说过了 他一个夏天没跟我说话
<28-10,House>I already told you. He didn'tabcspeak to me for a summer.

<28-11,Blythe>今天大家能来 对我太重要了
<28-11,Blythe>It means more to me than--than Iabccan say to have all of you here today.

<28-11,Blythe>我们的孩子Gregory有几句话想说
<28-11,Blythe>And now, uh,our son gregoryabcwould like to say a few words.

<28-12,House>对于这 我不感到意外
<28-12,House>And that doesn't surprise me.

523
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:26,770
<28-12,House>如果对一个人的考核abc是看他怎么对待下级的话
<28-12,House>Because if the test of a man is howabche treats those he has power over,

524
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,090
<28-12,House>那恐怕我父亲通不过这项考核
<28-12,House>it was a test my father failed.

525
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,340
<28-12,House>你们急迫地向这个人表达敬意
<28-12,House>This man you're eager to pay homage to,

<28-12,House>他严厉惩罚失败abc无法接受--
<28-12,House>He punished failure, and he didabcnot accept anything less than--

530
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,110
<28-13,House>神圣的使命
<28-13,House>sacred calling.

531
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,820
<28-13,House>比任何私人感情都要重要
<28-13,House>More important than anyabcpersonal relationship.

532

<28-17,House>你一定得在大庭广众闹别扭么?
<28-17,House>you really want to doabcthis in front of everybody?

541
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,980
<28-17,House>你这是惩罚我还是他们?
<28-17,House>You wanna punish me or them?

542
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,510
<29-1,Wilson>我居然还能感到意外
<29-1,Wilson>How can I still feel surprise?

543
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,660
<29-1,Wilson>你竟然把表达哀悼的仪式变成一场闹剧
<29-1,Wilson>You would take,even this, a moment ofabcreal human grief, and turn it into a farce.

544
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,670
<29-2,House>得了吧

00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,490
<33-6,House>佛像不会加重病情
<33-6,House>Buddha wouldn't make it worse.

653
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,170
<33-7,Thirteen>也许是重量给背部施压
<33-7,Thirteen>Maybe the weight stressedabcher back, which--

654
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,280
<33-8,House>如果她这辈子没举过重物的话abc还有可能
