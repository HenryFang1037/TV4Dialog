<2-2,Bob>I'd like to personally welcome all of our new employees

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,380
<3-1,Foreman>并且  我得问  你们为什么想回来
<3-1,Foreman>and ask, why the hell do you want to come back?

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,550
<3-2,Chase>冲浪冲腻了
<3-2,Chase>Tired of surfing.

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,040
<3-3,Foreman>他一点没变
<3-3,Foreman>He hasn't changed.

50
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,150
<3-4,Chase>工作内容也没变  对吧
<3-4,Chase>And neither has the job, right?

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,110
<3-4,Chase>我们还是不择手段救死扶伤吧
<3-4,Chase>We still get to do crazy crap?

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,090
<3-5,Taub>救人性命而非只是整形开刀
<3-5,Taub>Save people's lives instead of just their noses?

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,470
<3-6,Foreman>关于那个  不择手段救死扶伤
<3-6,Foreman>About that... about the crazy stuff?

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,540
<3-7,Taub>开始了
<3-7,Taub>Here we go.

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,390
<3-7,Taub>他由同伴变成了敌人
<3-7,Taub>He's gone from ally to enemy.

56
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,700
<3-8,Chase>人家别无选择  人家现在是老板
<3-8,Chase>He has no choice. He's the boss now.

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,590
<3-8,Chase>人家得在其位  谋其事
<3-8,Chase>He has to be professional.

58
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,900
<3-8,Chase>人家每做一个决定
<3-8,Chase>He has to base his decisions

59
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,050
<3-8,Chase>都得从医院的利益出发
<3-8,Chase>on what's best for the entire hospital.

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,980
<3-8,Chase>这不是针对我们
<3-8,Chase>We can't take it personally.

61
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,260
<3-9,Foreman>是不是我自己说更好一点
<3-9,Foreman>Couldn't have said it better myself.

62
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,250
<3-10,Chase>你已经打好草稿
<3-10,Chase>You did.

63
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,990
<3-10,Chase>我只不过把你桌上的稿子念出来
<3-10,Chase>I'm just reading the notes on your desk.

64
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,520
<3-10,Chase>他还想让我们做他的眼线
<3-10,Chase>He also wants us to spy for him.

65
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,540
<3-11,Foreman>不是眼线
<3-11,Foreman>Not spy.

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,240
<3-11,Foreman>我是不想豪斯进监狱
<3-11,Foreman>I'm trying to keep house out of prison.

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,330
<3-11,Foreman>出于那个目的  我需要知道他的所作所想
<3-11,Foreman>To do that, I need to know what he's doing and planning.

68
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,730
<3-12,Chase and Taub>-眼线  -眼线
<3-12,Chase and Taub>- Spy. - Spy.

69
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,570
<3-13,Foreman>我说  伙计们  我是你们老板
<3-13,Foreman>Come on, guys. I am your boss.

70
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,990
<3-13,Foreman>你们得有点分寸
<3-13,Foreman>You do have to treat me appropriately.

71
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,440
<3-13,Foreman>但也不必太过拘谨
<3-13,Foreman>But it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.

72
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,650
<3-13,Foreman>工作之外  我还把你们当朋友
<3-13,Foreman>Outside of work, I still consider us all friends.

73
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,430
<3-14,Taub>很高兴你这么想
<3-14,Taub>I'm glad you feel that way,

74
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,850
<3-14,Taub>因为我确实有事相求
<3-14,Taub>because I do have a favor to ask.

75
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,630
<3-14,Taub>我告诉豪斯我下周才能回来
<3-14,Taub>I told House I couldn't come back until next week.

76
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,130
<3-14,Taub>他说他完全理解  接着叫我滚蛋
<3-14,Taub>He said he understood completely and that I was fired.

77
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,150
<3-14,Taub>所以
<3-14,Taub>So...

78
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,170
<3-14,Taub>因为我家孩子还得随我待两天
<3-14,Taub>since I have my kids for the next two days,

79
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,080
<3-14,Taub>我需要个保姆
<3-14,Taub>I need a babysitter.

80
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,830
<3-15,Foreman>不行
<3-15,Foreman>No!

81
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,840
<4-1,Adams>男性病人发生室颤
<4-1,Adams>Male patient went into v-fib

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,940
<4-1,Adams>但没有心脏疾病的迹象
<4-1,Adams>but shows no signs of heart disease

83
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,050
<4-1,Adams>也未出现任何其它症状
<4-1,Adams>or any other symptoms, for that matter.

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,360
<4-2,House>他的心脏闹别扭时
<4-2,House>What was he doing

85
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,400
<4-2,House>他在做什么
<4-2,House>when his heart decided to do the mambo?

86
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,360
<4-3,Park>他说他在工作
<4-3,Park>He said he was at work.

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,240
<4-4,House>你迟到了
<4-4,House>You're late.

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,170
<4-5,Taub>照我的日程表  我早了一星期
<4-5,Taub>According to my calendar, I'm a week early.

89
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,520
<4-6,House>胡子这招挺好使
<4-6,House>Beard's a nice touch.

90
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,790
<4-6,House>让大家知道你不是个大姑娘
<4-6,House>Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl.

91
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,020
<4-6,House>哦  你俩真登对
<4-6,House>Oh, now, you two make a cute couple.

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,230
<4-6,House>而你俩
<4-6,House>And you two...

93
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,660
<4-6,House>也罢
<4-6,House>It's not important.

94
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,430
<4-7,Park>朴克医生
<4-7,Park>Dr. Park.

95
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,370
<4-7,Park>你比我想象中要高很多啊
<4-7,Park>You're a lot taller than I thought you'd be.

96
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,860
<4-8,Taub>我也很期待与你合作
<4-8,Taub>And I look forward to working with you as well.

97
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,360
<4-9,House>他在说谎  不只陶博  还有病人
<4-9,House>He's lying, not just Taub--the patient.

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,250
<4-9,House>他膝盖的擦伤
<4-9,House>These abrasions on his knees--

99
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,620
<4-9,House>是新弄的
<4-9,House>They're minty fresh...

100
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,640
<4-9,House>大概就十小时前
<4-9,House>about ten hours old.

101
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,010
<4-10,Adams>他玩腰旗橄榄球时弄的
<4-10,Adams>He got them playing flag football.

102
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,240
<4-10,Adams>他说他玩腰旗橄榄球时弄的
<4-10,Adams>He said he got them playing flag football.

103
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,110
<4-11,House>我肯定"旗"指代阴茎
<4-11,House>I'm sure that's true if "Flag" is a euphemism for "Penis"

104
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,650
<4-11,House>玩橄榄球是"插入阴道"的委婉说法
<4-11,House>and "Football" is a euphemism for "Entering a vagina."

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,850
<4-12,Adams>他为什么要说谎
<4-12,Adams>Why lie about it?

106
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,910
<4-13,Taub>人人都说谎
<4-13,Taub>Everybody lies.

107
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,070
<4-14,House>话说
<4-14,House>Speaking of which,

108
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,600
<4-14,House>你的俩宝贝闺女呢
<4-14,House>how are your two baby girls?

109
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,970
<4-15,Park>双胞胎  恭喜
<4-15,Park>Wow, twins-- congratulations.

110
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,830
<4-16,House>囧
<4-16,House>Awkward!

111
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,500
<4-16,House>他同时搞大了两个女人的肚子
<4-16,House>He knocked up two different women at the same time...

112
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,640
<4-16,House>至少他这么认为
<4-16,House>At least he thinks he did.

113
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,970
<4-16,House>-你验DNA了吗  -为什么
<4-16,House>- You have them DNA tested yet? - Why would I?

114
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,770
<4-17,Taub>-他们长得像我  -小孩会长变样
<4-17,Taub>- They look just like me. - But they will grow.

115
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,530
<4-18,House>去查出他还隐瞒了什么
<4-18,House>Find out what else he's lying about.

116
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,610
<4-18,House>做个运动测试
<4-18,House>Do an exercise test--

117
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,180
<4-18,House>看能否让他再次室颤
<4-18,House>See if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.

118
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,590
<4-19,Park>可致他再次心脏骤停
<4-19,Park>But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.

119
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,510
<4-20,House>希望如此  那样的话我们就能找出病因
<4-20,House>Hopefully. Then we'll know what set it off.

120
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,010
<4-21,Chase>他是说  在医院发病
<4-21,Chase>He means it's better to do it here

121
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,060
<4-21,Chase>总要好过在外面
<4-21,Chase>where we can revive him

122
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,400
<4-21,Chase>在这里我们能及时施救
<4-21,Chase>than have it happen somewhere else.

123
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,070
<4-22,House>浪子回头
<4-22,House>The prodigal son has returned.

124
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,360
<4-22,House>现在  恕我失陪
<4-22,House>Now, if you'll excuse me,

125
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,520
<4-22,House>我得去杀鸡宰羊筹备午宴[欢饮回来]
<4-22,House>I have to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.

126
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,810
<5-1,Bob>我告诉过你们  心脏病发时
<5-1,Bob>I told you, I was sitting at my desk

127
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,920
<5-1,Bob>我就坐在书桌旁
<5-1,Bob>when the attack happened.

128
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,030
<5-2,Chase>这些擦伤来自昨晚
<5-2,Chase>These rug burns are from last night.

129
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,440
<5-3,Adams>我们认为你当时在做爱
<5-3,Adams>We think you were having sex,

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,720
<5-3,Adams>但是失忆可能也是一个症状
<5-3,Adams>but memory loss could also be a symptom.

131
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,880
<5-3,Adams>也许我们该问问你老婆
<5-3,Adams>Maybe we should ask your wife.

132
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,530
<5-3,Adams>别
<5-3,Adams>Don't.

133
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,840
<5-4,Bob>我  我昨晚做了蠢事
<5-4,Bob>I-I did something stupid last night,

134
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,530
<5-4,Bob>不过那只是一夜情
<5-4,Bob>but it was a one-time thing.

135
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,540
<5-4,Bob>你们不知道我有多后悔
<5-4,Bob>You have no idea how bad I feel about it.

136
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,820
<5-5,Adams>你有负罪感  那是你们夫妻俩的事
<5-5,Adams>Your guilt is between you and your wife.

137
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,420
<5-5,Adams>我们只需知道当时发生了什么
<5-5,Adams>We just need to know what happened.

138
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,290
<5-6,Bob>我在汽车旅馆里正做爱
<5-6,Bob>I was having sex at a motel

139
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,010
<5-6,Bob>突然感觉有点眩晕
<5-6,Bob>when I started to feel light-headed.

140
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,090
<5-6,Bob>等我恢复神智时  我已面朝天花板躺着
<5-6,Bob>Next thing I knew, I was laying on my back.

141
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,650
<5-6,Bob>几乎不能呼吸
<5-6,Bob>I could barely breathe.

142
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,490
<5-7,Denise>情况怎么样
<5-7,Denise>Is everything all right?

143
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,580
<5-8,Chase>我们准备进行运动测试
<5-8,Chase>We'd like to perform an exercise test,

144
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,040
<5-8,Chase>增加其身体负荷  模拟发病时的状态
<5-8,Chase>re-create the stress that may have caused his symptoms.

145
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,920
<5-9,Denise>他当时坐在书桌旁
<5-9,Denise>He was sitting at his desk.

146
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,270
<5-10,Chase>我们担心他的心脏有问题
<5-10,Chase>It's his heart we're worried about.

147
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,580
<5-10,Chase>测试时将实时监测他的心律
<5-10,Chase>The test will monitor its rhythm

148
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,490
<5-10,Chase>这样我们就能发现任何的异常
<5-10,Chase>so we can check for any abnormalities.

149
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,890
<6-1,House>被关过一个月禁闭之后
<6-1,House>I spent a month in solitary.

150
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,550
<6-1,House>你是觉得敲一天门这事我干不出来吗
<6-1,House>You don't think I can keep this up all day?

151
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,890
<6-2,Wilson>我头疼着呢  能不能麻烦你小点声
<6-2,Wilson>I have a headache. Could you just lower your voice?

152
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,560
<6-3,House>奇斯和陶博回来喽
<6-3,House>Chase and Taub are back!

153
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,360
<6-4,Wilson>要我买个冰激凌蛋糕庆祝吗
<6-4,Wilson>You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?

154
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,220
<6-5,House>我觉得陶博今天
<6-5,House>I also think that Taub

155
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,580
<6-5,House>带了他家两个小不点一起来上班了
<6-5,House>has brought his little Taubettes into work with him today.

156
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,550
<6-6,Wilson>怎么会
<6-6,Wilson>Why would he do that?

157
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,350
<6-7,House>我没给他足够的时间做出其它选择
<6-7,House>Because I didn't give him time to do anything else.

158
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,600
<6-7,House>于是我就开始琢磨
<6-7,House>Then I started wondering,

159
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,930
<6-7,House>会有哪个滥好人愿意帮他照顾小孩呢
<6-7,House>who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?

160
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,140
<6-8,Wilson>她们不在我这
<6-8,Wilson>They're not here.

161
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,150
<6-8,Wilson>说啥呢
<6-8,Wilson>What?

162
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,990
<6-9,House>我就是来和老朋友聊聊天的
<6-9,House>I just came for a chat with a friend.

163
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,380
<6-9,House>朋友  这是什么味道
<6-9,House>What's that I smell, friend?

164
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,300
<6-10,Wilson>你的疑惑我非常理解
<6-10,Wilson>I understand your confusion.

165
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
<6-10,Wilson>我午餐的时候吃了一个婴儿  再加上...
<6-10,Wilson>I was eating a baby for lunch,and...

166
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,850
<6-10,Wilson>我头痛越来越严重了
<6-10,Wilson>I have a massive migraine.

167
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,230
<6-10,Wilson>你能不能别在我面前晃了
<6-10,Wilson>Will you please just go away?

168
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,020
<6-11,House>你应该躺下来  好好休息会
<6-11,House>You should probably lie down and rest.

169
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,730
<6-12,Wilson>没错  我正有此意
<6-12,Wilson>Yeah. I was trying to.

170
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,710
<6-13,House>不过  还有一件事
<6-13,House>Oh! There is one more thing.

171
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,590
<7-1,Chase>他的身体状态太好了
<7-1,Chase>He's in too good of shape.

172
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,540
<7-1,Chase>我们得让他达到昨天晚上的状态
<7-1,Chase>We need to get him to the point he was at last night.

173
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,920
<7-2,Adams>别指望我
<7-2,Adams>Well, don't look at me.

174
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,100
<7-2,Adams>但要是你愿意的话
<7-2,Adams>But if you want to...

175
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,450
<7-3,Chase>犀利
<7-3,Chase>Cute.

176
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,830
<7-3,Chase>不过我想说的不是身体上的压力
<7-3,Chase>But I didn't mean physical stress.

177
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,800
<7-4,Park>难道你们男人就不明白什么叫不负责任吗
<7-4,Park>Don't you guys think this is irresponsible?

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,570
<7-4,Park>好比说你让两个女人同时怀了孩子
<7-4,Park>It's like you getting two women pregnant at the same time.

179
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,650
<7-4,Park>我只是想说这种事情发生的概率
<7-4,Park>I just mean the part about the odds of it happening.

180
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,060
<7-4,Park>应该高得不可思议吧
<7-4,Park>They had to be incredibly high.

181
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,430
<7-4,Park>如果真的出现室颤的话
<7-4,Park>And if we induce V-fib,

182
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,310
<7-4,Park>从概率上来说  我们应该能把他救回来
<7-4,Park>odds say that we'll be able to revive him.

183
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,930
<7-4,Park>但不怕一万就怕万一
<7-4,Park>But there's always a chance we can't.

184
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,270
<7-5,Taub>又极端又鲁莽  这就是豪斯
<7-5,Taub>It's extreme and reckless. That's House.

185
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,140
<7-5,Taub>你得适应才行
<7-5,Taub>You get used to it.

186
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,430
<7-6,House>要么我就会炒了你
<7-6,House>Or I fire you.

187
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,130
<7-6,House>看看我的新发现
<7-6,House>Look what I found...

188
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,100
<7-6,House>两个小盆友
<7-6,House>Kiddie-winkies!

189
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,380
<7-6,House>不知道她们是谁家的
<7-6,House>I wonder who they belong to.

190
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
<7-7,Taub>我的孩子  给我
<7-7,Taub>Give me my kids.

191
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,870
<7-8,House>我说真的  我真心想知道她们是谁的娃
<7-8,House>No. I genuinely wonder who they belong to.

192
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,010
<7-8,House>我需要一个DNA样本
<7-8,House>I need a DNA sample.

193
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,230
<7-9,Taub>我是不会让你对我的孩子做DNA测试的
<7-9,Taub>I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.

194
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,380
<7-10,House>已经完成了  这支棉签是给你准备的
<7-10,House>Already did. This swab's for you.

195
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,340
<7-10,House>好吧  要是你这么不差钱
<7-10,House>Fine. If you don't mind paying a fortune

196
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
<7-10,House>愿意养别人家的小孩
<7-10,House>in child support for some other guy's kids,

197
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,770
<7-10,House>我瞎操什么心
<7-10,House>no skin cells off my cheek.

198
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,760
<7-11,Park>心律终于上去了
<7-11,Park>His heart rate's finally elevating.

199
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,530
<7-12,Denise>奇斯医生说你有话要和我说
<7-12,Denise>Dr. Chase said you had something to tell me.

200
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,500
<7-13,Chase>我们刚刚说到你膝盖上的擦伤是怎么回事
<7-13,Chase>We were talking about how you got the abrasions on your knees

201
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,790
<7-13,Chase>腰旗橄榄球的事
<7-13,Chase>the flag football game.

202
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,450
<7-14,Bob>对了  亲爱的  你得帮我向他们告个假了
<7-14,Bob>Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you to let the guys know

203
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,390
<7-14,Bob>我周六应该去不了了
<7-14,Bob>I'm not gonna be able to play on saturday.

204
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,830
<7-15,Denise>整个镇上的人都知道你住院了
<7-15,Denise>The whole town knows that you're in the hospital.

205
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,940
<7-15,Denise>不用担心
<7-15,Denise>I wouldn't worry about it.

206
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,430
<7-16,Adams>你想说的不是这个吧
<7-16,Adams>That's not what you wanted to tell her.

207
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,320
<7-16,Adams>你不是说那次比赛不太寻常吗
<7-16,Adams>You said the game wasn't typical.

208
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,640
<7-16,Adams>发生了一些让你心烦的事
<7-16,Adams>Something happened that you were upset about?

209
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,390
<7-17,Bob>我不太懂  你说的是
<7-17,Bob>I don't understand. What are you--

210
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,210
<7-17,Bob>我感觉  感觉不太
<7-17,Bob>I don't f-- I don't feel very w--

211
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,940
<7-18,Denise>他怎么了
<7-18,Denise>What's happening?

212
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
<7-19,Taub>不是心脏问题
<7-19,Taub>It's not his heart.

213
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,260
<7-20,Chase>我知道
<7-20,Chase>I know.

214
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,270
<7-20,Chase>他癫痫发作了
<7-20,Chase>He's having a seizure.

215
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,290
<8-1,Park>他癫痫发作时
<8-1,Park>There wasn't any abnormal electrical activity in his E.K.G.

216
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,530
<8-1,Park>心电图上显示一切正常
<8-1,Park>when his seizure occurred.

217
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,350
<8-1,Park>不是室颤引发的
<8-1,Park>It wasn't caused by a V-fib.

218
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,590
<8-2,Adams>但也不能完全排除
<8-2,Adams>We still can't rule it out.

219
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,830
<8-2,Adams>从急救室那边的心电图结果来看
<8-2,Adams>His E.K.G. from the E.R. documented--

220
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,970
<8-4,House>心肌炎
<8-4,House>Myocarditis--

221
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,800
<8-3,Chase>病毒性感染导致心脏壁肌受损
<8-3,Chase>Viral infection weakening the wall muscles.

222
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,480
<8-3,Chase>我们要对他的心脏做活检确认
<8-3,Chase>We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.

223
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,630
<8-4,House>心肌炎不会引起癫痫
<8-4,House>Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.

224
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,750
<8-5,Taub>可能是原发性疾病  布鲁格达氏综合症
<8-5,Taub>Could be genetic-- Brugada Syndrome.

226
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,630
<8-6,House>感谢上帝
<8-6,House>Oh, my god.

227
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,310
<8-6,House>又一个浪子回头啊
<8-6,House>Two prodigal sons.

228
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,620
<8-6,House>来来来  拥抱一下
<8-6,House>Come on. Let's hug it out.

229
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,750
<8-7,Taub>你是真觉得我想得不错呢
<8-7,Taub>You really like the idea,

230
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,910
<8-7,Taub>还是想从我这拔根头发做亲子鉴定
<8-7,Taub>or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?

231
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,110
<8-8,House>你的想法蠢到家了
<8-8,House>It's a stupid idea.

232
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,280
<8-8,House>真是那样  应该能从心电图上看出端倪来
<8-8,House>We would have seen evidence of Brugada in the E.K.G.

233
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,400
<8-8,House>这沙发
<8-8,House>You know, this is...

234
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,200
<8-8,House>根本就是在破坏我这的好风水
<8-8,House>This is just messing with my Feng Shui here.

235
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,700
<8-8,House>那里怎么样
<8-8,House>What about over there?

236
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,870
<8-8,House>嗜铬细胞瘤
<8-8,House>A pheochromocytoma.

237
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,910
<8-9,Park>肾上腺素过量会导致心脏问题
<8-9,Park>Excess adrenaline can cause heart problems

238
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,790
<8-9,Park>以及癫痫
<8-9,Park>and...seizures.

239
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,600
<8-10,House>没意思
<8-10,House>Boring!

240
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,120
<8-11,Park>不好意思  我来这是为了救死扶伤
<8-11,Park>I'm sorry. I thought I was here to treat the patients,

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,460
<8-11,Park>不是逗你开心的
<8-11,Park>not entertain you.

242
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,620
<8-12,House>你就不能一石二鸟吗
<8-12,House>Would it hurt to do both?

243
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,880
<8-12,House>这样果然好多了
<8-12,House>Oh, this is much better!

244
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,830
<8-12,House>我说没意思  又没说它错
<8-12,House>I said it was boring. I didn't say it was wrong.

245
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,030
<8-13,Park>那你觉得我是对的
<8-13,Park>So I'm right.

246
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,260
<8-14,House>不  你是错的  光源性癫痫
<8-14,House>Nope. You're wrong. Photic epilepsy--

247
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,290
<8-14,House>同样无趣
<8-14,House>It's equally boring,

248
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,020
<8-14,House>不过这个倒有可能是对的
<8-14,House>But it has the advantage of possibly being right.

249
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,450
<8-14,House>做个脑电图看看
<8-14,House>Give him an E.E.G. to confirm.

250
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,360
<9-1,Wilson>要是你什么时候听闻我说想要孩子
<9-1,Wilson>If you ever hear me mention anything about wanting kids,

251
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,400
<9-1,Wilson>务必给我来几拳让我清醒
<9-1,Wilson>please feel free to punch me in the liver.

252
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,390
<9-2,Foreman>此话怎讲
<9-2,Foreman>Why?

253
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,420
<9-3,Wilson>简直就是魔音灌耳
<9-3,Wilson>It's like Satan's alarm clock.

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,420
<9-4,Foreman>豪斯又在打什么鬼主意
<9-4,Foreman>What's House up to?

255
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,460
<9-4,Foreman>他还什么都没问我要
<9-4,Foreman>He hasn't asked me for anything.

256
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,840
<9-4,Foreman>规矩得诡异
<9-4,Foreman>He's been incredibly well-behaved.

257
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,160
<9-4,Foreman>甚至乖乖看门诊了
<9-4,Foreman>He's doing his clinic hours.

258
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,590
<9-5,Wilson>这现象还真是让人忧虑
<9-5,Wilson>That is a sign of concern.

259
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,060
<9-6,Foreman>你明明就和我一样了解他
<9-6,Foreman>And you know him as well as I do.

260
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,150
<9-6,Foreman>他定会时不时跳出来表明一下自己不是善类
<9-6,Foreman>He needs to constantly establish he's the alpha dog.

261
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,180
<9-7,Wilson>他要回了他的小鸭子  要回了他的办公室
<9-7,Wilson>He's got his team back. He's got his office back.

262
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,230
<9-7,Wilson>他已经得到了所有他想要的东西
<9-7,Wilson>He's got everything he needs.

263
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,460
<9-8,Foreman>你还真相信他会有满足的一天
<9-8,Foreman>You really believe that-- he's content?

264
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,360
<9-8,Foreman>我不想让他用给我搞破坏的方式自我毁灭
<9-8,Foreman>I don't want to let House sabotage himself by sabotaging me,

265
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,680
<9-8,Foreman>要实现这个目的  我需要你的指导和信任
<9-8,Foreman>and I need your guidance and your trust to do that.

266
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,520
<9-9,Wilson>别别别
<9-9,Wilson>No, no, no.

267
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,910
<9-9,Wilson>卡迪和他一出状况就来找我
<9-9,Wilson>Cuddy had a problem with House, she came to me.

268
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,430
<9-9,Wilson>需要发泄也来找我
<9-9,Wilson>Wanted to vent--me.

269
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,590
<9-9,Wilson>你也知道结果是什么了
<9-9,Wilson>How did that turn out?

270
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,010
<9-9,Wilson>你和豪斯之间有问题的话  好好解决它
<9-9,Wilson>You have a problem with House, deal with it,

271
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,670
<9-9,Wilson>或者另请高明
<9-9,Wilson>or find someone else who can.

272
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,970
<10-1,Chase>之前的事情  我很抱歉
<10-1,Chase>I'm sorry about earlier,

273
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,240
<10-1,Chase>不过我们需要诱发反应
<10-1,Chase>but we needed to provoke a reaction.

274
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
<10-2,Bob>真是管用
<10-2,Bob>It worked.

275
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,990
<10-2,Bob>我现在都没办法再直视她的眼睛了
<10-2,Bob>I can barely look her in the eyes anymore.

276
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,450
<10-3,Adams>我会想听我的丈夫实话实说
<10-3,Adams>I'd want my husband to tell me the truth.

277
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,290
<10-3,Adams>当然
<10-3,Adams>Sure.

278
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,480
<10-4,Chase>你会觉得好受些  但是她会是什么感觉
<10-4,Chase>You'll feel better, and she'll feel what--

279
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
<10-4,Chase>遭人背叛  伤心欲绝
<10-4,Chase>devastated, betrayed?

280
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,890
<10-4,Chase>心痛不已
<10-4,Chase>Heartbroken.

281
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,080
<10-4,Chase>你真的想如此对待她吗
<10-4,Chase>Do you really want to do that to her?

282
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,780
<10-4,Chase>不想
<10-4,Chase>No.

283
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,790
<10-5,Bob>但我没法这样活着
<10-5,Bob>But I can't live like this.

284
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,120
<10-6,Chase>但她可以
<10-6,Chase>But she can.

285
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,500
<10-6,Chase>准备好了
<10-6,Chase>All set.

286
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,820
<10-7,Adams>我们需要你平躺着  尽量放松
<10-7,Adams>All right, we need you to sit back and try to relax.

287
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,090
<10-7,Adams>看着头顶的灯
<10-7,Adams>Just look at the light.

288
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,340
<11-1,Park>他们在后面修什么呢
<11-1,Park>What exactly are they building back there?

289
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,400
<11-2,House>我的梦
<11-2,House>A dream.

290
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,160
<11-3,Chase>脑电图显示无异常脑部活动
<11-3,Chase>The E.E.G. didn't show any abnormal brain activity.

291
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,700
<11-4,Adams>不是光源性癫痫
<11-4,Adams>He doesn't have photic epilepsy.

292
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,720
<11-5,House>我知道  因为他得的是嗜铬细胞瘤
<11-5,House>I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.

293
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,730
<11-6,Park>你说我是错误的
<11-6,Park>You said I was wrong.

294
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,920
<11-7,House>你的错在于没有先排除癫痫
<11-7,House>You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first.

295
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,360
<11-7,House>几个小时就能发现这点
<11-7,House>That only takes a couple of hours.

296
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,740
<11-7,House>找到让他全身充斥着肾上腺素的肿瘤
<11-7,House>Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system

297
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,750
<11-7,House>得要一整晚
<11-7,House>is gonna take all night.

298
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,270
<11-7,House>监控他的脑部活动  进行持续尿检
<11-7,House>Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urine test

299
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,760
<11-7,House>每两小时抽一次血
<11-7,House>and blood draws every two hours.

300
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,410
<11-8,Taub>我不行  我要带孩子
<11-8,Taub>I can't! I have my kids!

301
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,430
<11-8,Taub>威尔森十五分钟后就下班了
<11-8,Taub>Wilson's leaving in, like, 15 minutes!

302
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,790
<11-9,House>-奇斯和亚当斯负责检查  -谢谢
<11-9,House>- Chase and Adams can do the test. - Thank you.

303
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,210
<11-10,Taub>给你按摩床的钱
<11-10,Taub>For the massage bed.

304
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,850
<11-11,House>你和朴克去检查小旅馆
<11-11,House>You and Park are checking the motel.

305
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,560
<11-11,House>他在那里搞的外遇  去看看周围的环境
<11-11,House>He was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.

306
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,190
<12-1,Park>他找不到保姆
<12-1,Park>He couldn't find a babysitter.

307
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,010
<12-1,Park>别看了
<12-1,Park>Get over it.

308
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,980
<12-2,Taub>你非得把咱俩害死
<12-2,Taub>You're gonna get us killed.

309
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,860
<12-3,Park>她认为我是跑到她地盘上的妓女
<12-3,Park>She thinks I'm a prostitute on her turf.

310
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,560
<12-3,Park>示弱才会把你害死
<12-3,Park>Showing weakness is what gets you killed.

311
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,050
<12-4,Taub>她怎么会认为你是个妓女
<12-4,Taub>Why would she think you're a prostitute?

312
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,090
<12-5,Park>跟一个年龄大我一倍的人出现在这破旅馆
<12-5,Park>I'm in a dump with a guy almost twice my age.

313
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,620
<12-5,Park>她还能怎么想
<12-5,Park>What else is she gonna think?

314
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,230
<12-6,Taub>我哪有那么老
<12-6,Taub>How old do you think I am?

315
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,120
<13-1,Chase>谁背叛你了
<13-1,Chase>So who cheated on you?

316
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,730
<13-2,Adams>我们刚认识
<13-2,Adams>We just met.

317
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,270
<13-2,Adams>不觉得现在就敞开心扉
<13-2,Adams>Don't you think it's a little early

318
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,410
<13-2,Adams>谈论过去的感情创伤早了点吗
<13-2,Adams>to be dragging up our baggage in front of each other?

319
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,670
<13-3,Chase>谁说我有过创伤
<13-3,Chase>Who says I have baggage?

320
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,140
<13-4,Adams>我知道豪斯入狱后
<13-4,Adams>I know when House went to prison,

321
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,320
<13-4,Adams>你退出了医生这行
<13-4,Adams>you quit medicine.

322
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,660
<13-4,Adams>-没人会这么做  除非...  -我没退出
<13-4,Adams>- You don't do that unless-- - I didn't quit.

323
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,750
<13-5,Chase>只是休长假
<13-5,Chase>I took a vacation.

324
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,460
<13-5,Chase>我知道等他出来  就能回来工作
<13-5,Chase>I knew when he got out, I'd get my job back.

325
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,480
<13-6,Adams>豪斯自己都没想到要回来
<13-6,Adams>House didn't even know he was coming back.

326
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,110
<13-7,Chase>我相信他
<13-7,Chase>I had faith.

327
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,040
<13-8,Adams>这分明就是受过伤的人才会说的话
<13-8,Adams>Now, that has baggage stamped all over it.

328
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,840
<13-9,Adams>出现癫痫了吗
<13-9,Adams>Seizure activity?

329
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,710
<13-10,Chase>不是  是某个传感器松了
<13-10,Chase>No. One of the sensors came loose.

330
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,360
<13-11,Adams>我去弄好
<13-11,Adams>I'll fix it.

331
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,750
<13-12,Chase>看到什么了
<13-12,Chase>What is it?

332
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,390
<13-13,Adams>不是嗜铬细胞瘤
<13-13,Adams>Not a pheochromocytoma.

333
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,070
<14-1,Chase>病人颈部出现一个肿块
<14-1,Chase>Our patient now has a mass in his neck,

334
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,560
<14-1,Chase>他的体温在过去三小时持续上升
<14-1,Chase>and his body temp's been rising over the last three hours.

335
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,950
<14-2,Park>装修工人都哪去了
<14-2,Park>Where is the construction crew?

336
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,910
<14-3,House>我可不会让他们没日没夜得干活
<14-3,House>Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night.

337
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,850
<14-3,House>就让他们晚上来
<14-3,House>So I chose night.

338
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,230
<14-4,Adams>而尿检和血检显示
<14-4,Adams>And his urine and blood tests

339
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,130
<14-4,Adams>没有会造成肾上腺素分泌的肿瘤
<14-4,Adams>didn't show any evidence of an adrenaline-secreting tumor.

340
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,030
<14-5,Park>脑膜炎  可以做腰椎穿刺来确认
<14-5,Park>Meningitis. We can do a lumbar puncture to confirm.

341
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,810
<14-6,Taub>抱歉  我得把我的孩子送到
<14-6,Taub>Sorry. I had to drop my kids off

342
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,010
<14-6,Taub>城市另一头的托儿所
<14-6,Taub>at day care across town.

343
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,040
<14-6,Taub>-我错过了什么  -不是脑膜炎
<14-6,Taub>- What'd I miss? - It's not meningitis.

344
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,310
<14-7,Chase>他的脖子没有僵直  精神状态也正常
<14-7,Chase>His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.

345
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,830
<14-8,House>他只是在猜测
<14-8,House>He's only guessing.

346
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,450
<14-8,House>我在跟陶博说
<14-8,House>I'm talking to Taub.

347
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,220
<14-8,House>在做亲子测试前  还不能说是"我的孩子"
<14-8,House>He can't say "my kids" until he lets me test them.

348
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,270
<14-8,House>跟我说说他的情人屋
<14-8,House>Tell me about the love shack

349
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,730
<14-8,House>他被着老婆搞外遇的地方
<14-8,House>where he cheated on his bride.

350
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,910
<14-9,Taub>硬币派上用场了
<14-9,Taub>Quarters came in handy.

351
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,220
<14-9,Taub>我的孩子爱死按摩床了
<14-9,Taub>My kids loved the massage bed.

356
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,060
<14-11,House>等你回家了
<14-11,House>Probably want to boil the kids

357
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,430
<14-11,House>最好给孩子彻底消下毒
<14-11,House>for a couple hours when you get home.

358
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,050
<14-12,Park>浴室里也检测出

<14-13,House>Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.

<14-14,Park>-是的  你怎么知道  -脖子上的肿块
<14-14,Park>- Yeah. How'd you know? - The bulge in his neck.

362
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,030
<14-15,House>细菌侵入他的咽旁间隙
<14-15,House>Bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space,

363
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,670
<14-15,House>移动到颈静脉  形成了血栓
<14-15,House>moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus--

364
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,000
<14-15,House>是雷米尔综合症
<14-15,House>Lemierre's syndrome.

<14-15,House>用阿莫西林和克拉维酸治疗
<14-15,House>Treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

366
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,640
<14-15,House>在血块移动到肺部害死他前
<14-15,House>Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs

367
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,440
<14-15,House>把它取出来
<14-15,House>and kills him.

368
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,170
<14-16,House>你身上有无数的细胞
<14-16,House>You got at least a trillion cells.

369
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,100
<14-16,House>我总归能趁你不备弄到手
<14-16,House>You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.

370
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,600
<15-1,Bob>我必须跟我妻子说实话
<15-1,Bob>I have to tell my wife the truth.

<15-2,Park>手术后你有的是时间说
<15-2,Park>There's plenty of time for that after the operation.

<15-3,Bob>如果我死了呢
<15-3,Bob>What if I die,

373
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,420
<15-3,Bob>某一天她发现我曾欺骗过她
<15-3,Bob>and one day she finds out I cheated on her?

374
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,620
<15-3,Bob>我就没有机会解释
<15-3,Bob>I'll never be able to explain,

375
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,350
<15-3,Bob>告诉她我有多么抱歉
<15-3,Bob>never tell her how sorry I am.

376
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,000
<15-4,Taub>你在这里每浪费一秒
<15-4,Taub>You're increasing the odds of that

377
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,180
<15-4,Taub>那样的几率就越大
<15-4,Taub>every second we waste here.

378
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,870
<15-5,Bob>不  在跟她谈话前我是不会同意手术的
<15-5,Bob>No, I'm not agreeing to anything until I talk to her.

379
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,910
<15-6,David>爸爸
<15-6,David>Daddy!

380
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,100
<15-7,Bob>小家伙们
<15-7,Bob>Hey, guys.

381
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,750
<15-8,Sally>你的脖子看着真恐怖
<15-8,Sally>Your neck looks really gross.

382
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,380
<15-9,Bob>我好想你们
<15-9,Bob>I missed you both so much.

383
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,350
<15-9,Bob>但我需要你们帮个忙
<15-9,Bob>But I need to ask you favor.

384
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,100
<15-9,Bob>我要跟妈妈单独说会儿话
<15-9,Bob>I need to talk to Mommy alone for a second.

385
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,580
<15-9,Bob>能帮忙照看一下他们吗
<15-9,Bob>Would you mind watching them for us?

386
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,520
<16-1,Taub>他就是个傻瓜
<16-1,Taub>This guy's an idiot.

387
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,220
<16-2,Park>我觉得他说的有道理
<16-2,Park>I think he actually has a good point.

388
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,290
<16-2,Park>如果多年后  你发现死去的爱妻
<16-2,Park>What would you think if you found out years later

389
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,170
<16-2,Park>曾背叛过你  你会怎么想
<16-2,Park>your beloved dead wife cheated on you?

390
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,370
<16-3,Taub>我不会相信
<16-3,Taub>I wouldn't believe it.

391
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,210
<16-3,Taub>只要不是她亲口对我说的
<16-3,Taub>As long as I don't hear it directly from her,

392
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,670
<16-3,Taub>我至少可以抱有"这不是真的"的希望
<16-3,Taub>then I can hang on to hope that it's not true.

393
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,210
<16-3,Taub>但他这么做...
<16-3,Taub>But this way...

394
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,180
<16-3,Taub>她要么离开他  要么原谅他
<16-3,Taub>she has to either dump him or forgive him.

395
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,990
<16-4,Denise>孩子们  收拾东西  我们走了
<16-4,Denise>Guys, get your stuff. We're leaving.

396
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,050
<16-5,Park>非常抱歉
<16-5,Park>I'm so sorry.

397
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,680
<16-5,Park>我会回来的
<16-5,Park>I'll be back.

398
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,810
<16-6,Denise>我要把孩子送到我母亲家里
<16-6,Denise>I'm gonna drop our kids off at my mother's.

399
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,920
<16-6,Denise>他犯了个错误
<16-6,Denise>Look, he made a mistake...

400
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,860
<16-6,Denise>一个愚蠢  难以饶恕的错误
<16-6,Denise>A stupid, horrible mistake.

401
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,300
<16-6,Denise>但我们会解决的
<16-6,Denise>But we'll get through this.

402
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
<16-6,Denise>现在我只希望我丈夫能好起来
<16-6,Denise>All I care about right now is that my husband gets better.

403
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,220
<17-1,Wilson>昨天很抱歉
<17-1,Wilson>Sorry about yesterday.

404
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,230
<17-1,Wilson>豪斯就是《飞天万能车》里的儿童猎手
<17-1,Wilson>House was like the child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

405
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,650
<17-2,Taub>他为何这么关心孩子是不是我的
<17-2,Taub>Why is he so obsessed with my kids being my kids?

406
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,590
<17-2,Taub>因为他看出了不稳定因素
<17-2,Taub>Because he sees insecurity,

407
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,900
<17-2,Taub>当豪斯发现别人软弱时  他就会进攻
<17-2,Taub>and when House senses weakness, he pounces.

408
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,570
<17-2,Taub>而令他感到不安的是
<17-2,Taub>And because his insecurity

409
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,410
<17-2,Taub>其他人拥有的信任
<17-2,Taub>is the fact that other people can have faith

410
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,290
<17-2,Taub>无需他们强迫性地去找寻支持的理由
<17-2,Taub>and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.

411
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,780
<17-3,Wilson>同时  他开了个赌局
<17-3,Wilson>Also, he started a betting pool

412
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,770
<17-3,Wilson>赌哪个孩子是你亲生的
<17-3,Wilson>on which kid is yours and which isn't.

413
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,880
<17-4,Taub>整间医院的人都在赌孩子是不是我的
<17-4,Taub>An entire hospital betting on the legitimacy of my kids?

414
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,010
<17-4,Taub>重新回到朋友之中的感觉真好
<17-4,Taub>It's great to be back among friends.

415
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,590
<17-5,Wilson>这事儿错不在我
<17-5,Wilson>I'm not the bad guy here.

416
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,040
<17-5,Wilson>我赌的可是两个孩子都是你的
<17-5,Wilson>I'm betting on them both being yours.

417
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,930
<17-5,Wilson>赢了钱我会捐给慈善机构的
<17-5,Wilson>I would have donated the money to charity.

418
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,000
<17-5,Wilson>接近血栓
<17-5,Wilson>Approaching the clot.

419
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,550
<18-1,Chase>正在等待
<18-1,Chase>Stand by for...

420
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,190
<18-2,Adams>这不是血栓
<18-2,Adams>It's not a clot.

421
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,840
<18-3,Chase>这是他的淋巴结
<18-3,Chase>It's his lymph nodes.

422
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,890
<18-3,Chase>肿块不是由化脓或者出血引起的
<18-3,Chase>The bulge wasn't caused by pus or blood.

423
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,280
<18-3,Chase>是组织感染导致的
<18-3,Chase>It's tissue inflammation.

424
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,360
<18-3,Chase>-怎么感染的那么严重  -是淋巴瘤
<18-3,Chase>- How can there be that much tissue  - Lymphoma.

425
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,070
<18-4,Adams>我们要做个活组织检查
<18-4,Adams>We need to take a biopsy.

426
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,260
<18-5,Chase>我没割破什么吧
<18-5,Chase>Did I nick something?

427
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,500
<18-7,Chase>-不知道  -未见出血
<18-7,Chase>- I don't know. - I don't see any bleeding in here.

428
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,280
<18-8,Adams>他的巩膜出现黄疸
<18-8,Adams>His sclera's jaundiced.

429
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,420
<18-8,Adams>我想是肝出问题了  肝衰竭了
<18-8,Adams>I think it's his liver. It's failing.

430
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,500
<19-1,Adams>我们无缘无故就做了个大手术
<19-1,Adams>We did a major operation for no reason.

431
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,570
<19-1,Adams>不是雷米尔氏综合症
<19-1,Adams>It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.

432
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,400
<19-2,Chase>反正我们也要给他的淋巴结做活检的
<19-2,Chase>We would have had to biopsy his lymph nodes anyway

433
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,610
<19-2,Chase>看看是不是癌症
<19-2,Chase>to check for cancer.

434
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,920
<19-3,Adams>活检显示不是癌症
<19-3,Adams>Which it's not. Biopsy was clean.

435
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,710
<19-4,Park>有可能是酒精戒断的反应
<19-4,Park>We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal.

436
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,340
<19-4,Park>这可以解释他的心脏问题
<19-4,Park>It explains his heart,

437
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,300
<19-4,Park>癫痫和肝衰竭
<19-4,Park>seizures, and liver failing.

438
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,730
<19-5,House>但是解释不通淋巴结肿大
<19-5,House>But not his swollen lymph notes.

439
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,210
<19-6,Park>你为什么要在这里蹭有线电视
<19-6,Park>Why are we stealing cable from here?

440
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,060
<19-6,Park>办公室里又没电视
<19-6,Park>We don't even have a TV in our office.

441
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,500
<19-7,House>我是一个
<19-7,House>I'm an ex-con

442
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,900
<19-7,House>想要从良的惯犯
<19-7,House>trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by.

443
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,370
<19-7,House>只懂小偷小摸
<19-7,House>Stealing's all I know,

444
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,290
<19-7,House>同时我对病人的症状推断
<19-7,House>that and the fact that I was right

445
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,750
<19-7,House>也是正确的
<19-7,House>about what's wrong with our patient.

446
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,590
<19-7,House>只是对症结还不清楚
<19-7,House>Just wrong about what?

447
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,640
<19-8,Taub>豪斯的意思是这不是雷米尔氏症候群
<19-8,Taub>He means it's not Lemierre's,

448
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,870
<19-8,Taub>但确实是感染
<19-8,Taub>but it's still an infection,

449
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,450
<19-8,Taub>这就是为什么扩散得那么快
<19-8,Taub>which is why it's spreading so rapidly.

450
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,940
<19-9,Park>做切片培养需要时间
<19-9,Park>Cultures take time,

451
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,630
<19-9,Park>他的肝脏恐怕坚持不了多久了
<19-9,Park>and his liver doesn't have much left.

452
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,600
<19-10,House>所以我们要给他服用广谱抗生素
<19-10,House>That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

453
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,930
<19-11,Adams>这样做会毁了他剩余的肝功能
<19-11,Adams>The blast will fry what's left of his liver.

454
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,430
<19-11,Adams>这样治疗会要了他的命
<19-11,Adams>The cure will kill him.

455
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,390
<19-12,Chase>我们先给他肝脏移植
<19-12,Chase>Not if we get him a liver transplant first

456
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,810
<19-12,Chase>再给他用广谱抗生素就行了
<19-12,Chase>and then treat him with a broad spectrum.

457
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,250
<19-13,House>老队伍获胜
<19-13,House>And old team for the win!

458
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,340
<19-13,House>不是我要记分
<19-13,House>Not that I'm keeping score.

459
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,870
<19-13,House>也就是量化一下大家的表现
<19-13,House>It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values

460
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,450
<19-13,House>来决定谁能加薪
<19-13,House>to determine who gets raises,

461
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,270
<19-13,House>谁能休假  谁能获得我的尊重
<19-13,House>vacation time, and my respect.

462
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,400
<20-1,Adams>我们将他列上了肝脏移植名单
<20-1,Adams>We have him on the donor list for a liver.

463
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
<20-1,Adams>但是这需要时间
<20-1,Adams>But these things take time.

464
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,410
<20-2,Denise>就是说他可能死在移植前
<20-2,Denise>So he could die before he gets one.

465
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,120
<20-3,Adams>有这个可能  但我们还有一个选择
<20-3,Adams>It's a possibility. But we have another option.

466
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,620
<20-3,Adams>我们能从活体捐献者身上
<20-3,Adams>We can do a partial liver transplant

467
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,130
<20-3,Adams>做部分肝脏移植手术
<20-3,Adams>from a living donor.

468
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,460
<20-3,Adams>我来吧
<20-3,Adams>I'll do it.

469
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,740
<20-4,Chase>也要你配型相符才行  但是为了增加几率
<20-4,Chase>If you're a match, but to increase our odds,

470
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,490
<20-4,Chase>我们希望你们的朋友和亲人都能做个检测
<20-4,Chase>we'd like to get your friends and family tested as well.

471
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,210
<20-5,Bob>这手术安全吗
<20-5,Bob>Is it safe?

472
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,150
<20-6,Adams>是个大手术
<20-6,Adams>It's a major surgery.

473
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,820
<20-6,Adams>捐献者一般住院一周
<20-6,Adams>The donor spends a week in the hospital

474
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,920
<20-6,Adams>之后在家修养三个月
<20-6,Adams>and up to three months convalescing at home.

475
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,950
<20-7,Bob>我不能让别人为我冒风险
<20-7,Bob>I can't ask someone to do that for me.

476
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,290
<20-8,Denise>成千上百的人愿意为你这么做
<20-8,Denise>There are hundreds of people who would do that for you.

477
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,110
<20-9,Bob>因为他们不知道我真实的一面
<20-9,Bob>Because they don't know the real me.

478
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,540
<20-10,Denise>你是个好人
<20-10,Denise>You are a good man

479
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,220
<20-10,Denise>只是犯了一个错误
<20-10,Denise>who made a mistake.

480
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,400
<20-11,Bob>那我必须先向他们说明
<20-11,Bob>Then I have to tell them first.

481
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,560
<20-12,Denise>你也要考虑下我的感受
<20-12,Denise>I have to live with this too.

482
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,570
<20-12,Denise>我知道
<20-12,Denise>I know.

483
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,350
<20-13,Bob>我很抱歉  但
<20-13,Bob>And I'm sorry, but...

484
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,040
<20-13,Bob>只有这样我才能让他们帮我
<20-13,Bob>this is the only way that I can do this.

485
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,070
<21-1,Bob>在我请求各位
<21-1,Bob>Before I ask any of you

486
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,310
<21-1,Bob>为我牺牲三个月的生命之前
<21-1,Bob>to sacrifice three months of your life for me,

487
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,580
<21-1,Bob>我要坦白
<21-1,Bob>I have a confession.

488
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,230
<21-1,Bob>我有过外遇
<21-1,Bob>I had an affair.

489
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
<21-1,Bob>我做了对不起德尼丝的事
<21-1,Bob>I cheated on Denise.

490
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,360
<21-1,Bob>我不会怪你们  如果你们决定...
<21-1,Bob>I wouldn't blame anyone if you decide...

491
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,590
<21-2,Denise>我原谅他了
<21-2,Denise>I forgive him.

492
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,360
<21-2,Denise>这件事就到此为止吧
<21-2,Denise>That should be enough for all of us.

493
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,300
<21-2,Denise>谢谢你们能来
<21-2,Denise>Thank you so much for coming here...

494
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
<21-3,Bob>我话还没说完
<21-3,Bob>There's more.

495
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,640
<21-3,Bob>拉里
<21-3,Bob>Larry.

496
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,910
<21-3,Bob>我给你的卡车新装的变速器
<21-3,Bob>That new transmission I put in your truck,

497
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,670
<21-3,Bob>根本没那个必要
<21-3,Bob>you didn't need it.

498
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,840
<21-3,Bob>乔  你也没必要重装引擎
<21-3,Bob>Joe, same thing with the engine rebuild.

499
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,330
<21-3,Bob>事实上  我欺骗过今晚在场的大多数人
<21-3,Bob>In fact, I cheated most of you here tonight.

500
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,860
<21-3,Bob>有半数的时候  你们送来
<21-3,Bob>Half the time you bring your cars

501
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,850
<21-3,Bob>我维修厂的车子  没有任何问题
<21-3,Bob>into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.

502
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,950
<21-3,Bob>我敲你们竹杠有些年头了
<21-3,Bob>I've been ripping you all off for years.

503
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,300
<21-3,Bob>我还从嘉实奖学基金里私吞了一万块钱
<21-3,Bob>I also took $10,000 from the Harvest Scholarship Fund,

504
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,840
<21-3,Bob>赌博全输光了
<21-3,Bob>and I lost it gambling.

505
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,610
<21-3,Bob>我很抱歉
<21-3,Bob>I'm sorry.

506
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,290
<21-4,Park>我不是你们认为的那个人
<21-4,Park>I'm not the man you thought I was.

507
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
<21-4,Park>进展真是太顺利了
<21-4,Park>That went over well.

508
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,660
<22-1,Chase>最后两个没走的捐助者
<22-1,Chase>Out of the two donors who didn't walk out,

509
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,880
<22-1,Chase>他们的配型都不符合
<22-1,Chase>both were negative for a potential match.

510
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,970
<22-1,Chase>坦露真相很可能就这样害死他了
<22-1,Chase>Telling the truth may have just killed this guy.

511
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,870
<22-2,Adams>我让他告诉老婆偷腥的事
<22-2,Adams>I told him to tell his wife he cheated,

512
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,810
<22-2,Adams>没让他把旧账都翻出来
<22-2,Adams>not confess every sin he's ever committed.

513
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,500
<22-3,Park>如果每个人都像他一样
<22-3,Park>If everyone did that,

514
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,570
<22-3,Park>我们永远别想找到捐献者了
<22-3,Park>we'd never find a donor for anyone again.

515
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,080
<22-4,Adams>不是每个人都会欺骗和讹诈
<22-4,Adams>Everybody doesn't lie, cheat, or steal

516
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,830
<22-4,Adams>-自己的朋友  -他们会的
<22-4,Adams>- from their friends. - Yeah, they do.

517
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,330
<22-5,Chase>可能没这个人那么极品
<22-5,Chase>Maybe not as much as this guy,

518
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,550
<22-5,Chase>但如果人们只说真话
<22-5,Chase>but if people told nothing but the truth,

519
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,450
<22-5,Chase>这世界一定会乱套的
<22-5,Chase>the world would probably burn down overnight.

520
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,090
<22-6,Adams>有些人觉得现在已经乱了
<22-6,Adams>Some people think it's burning now.

521
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,810
<22-6,Adams>如果人们不撒谎的话会好点
<22-6,Adams>Maybe if everybody didn't lie.

522
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,050
<22-6,Adams>这太有爱了
<22-6,Adams>Aw, that is cute.

523
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,340
<22-7,House>我在说你的胸部
<22-7,House>I'm talking about your breasts.

524
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,880
<22-7,House>你每次认真说事的时候胸部总会活灵活现的
<22-7,House>They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.

525
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,520
<15-1,Bob>这是真话
<15-1,Bob>Truth.

526
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,960
<14-7,Chase>听着不舒服对吧
<14-7,Chase>It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

527
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,410
<22-5,Chase>还有一点也是真的
<22-5,Chase>More truth.

528
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,020
<22-6,Adams>我之所以注意到是因为奇斯在盯着看
<22-6,Adams>I only noticed because Chase was staring at them.

529
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,710
<22-7,House>他会死不认账  因为他不想冒犯你
<22-7,House>He'd never admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you.

530
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,910
<22-7,House>正因如此  他也不会告诉你
<22-7,House>Same reason he'd never tell you

531
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,680
<22-7,House>他想和你上床
<22-7,House>that he's thought about having sex with you.

532
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,410
<22-7,House>虽然  有一说一  每个遇到你的男人
<22-7,House>Although, to be fair, every man you've ever met

533
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,100
<22-7,House>都会对你性致盎然
<22-7,House>has thought about having sex with you.

534
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,660
<22-7,House>他们都会撒谎否认  因为如果你知道了
<22-7,House>They'll lie, because if you knew

535
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,690
<22-7,House>很可能就不会和他们翻云覆雨了
<22-7,House>you probably wouldn't want to have sex with them.

536
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,490
<22-7,House>这些只是过去一分钟里的谎话
<22-7,House>And that's just some of the lies from the last minute.

537
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,080
<22-7,House>接下来有个更大的谎言
<22-7,House>And here's a bigger one.

538
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,210
<22-7,House>你对我前面说的早就知晓  只是装作不知道
<22-7,House>You already know this, but you pretend you don't,

539
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,190
<22-7,House>因为那样显得你比较文明
<22-7,House>because it makes you feel civilized.

540
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,620
<22-7,House>大多数人觉得忽视真相会过得自在些
<22-7,House>Most people find it easier to ignore the truth.

541
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,050
<22-7,House>问问陶博就知道了
<22-7,House>Ask Taub.

542
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,340
<22-7,House>我们的病人等不到
<22-7,House>Our patient can't wait for a transplant

543
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,230
<22-7,House>那个遥遥无期的移植了
<22-7,House>that's never gonna come.

544
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,510
<22-7,House>该采取极端且鲁莽的办法了
<22-7,House>We need to get reckless and extreme.

545
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,500
<22-7,House>用CT定位他肝脏坏死的地方并予以切除
<22-7,House>C.T. his liver, find the damaged area, and cut it out.

546
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,580
<22-7,House>但愿剩下的部分还能够
<22-7,House>Hopefully, what's left will be enough

547
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,320
<22-7,House>承受广谱抗生素治疗
<22-7,House>so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

548
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,090
<23-1,Taub>十分抱歉第一次让你们俩呆在一起
<23-1,Taub>I'm sorry the first time I had both of you together

549
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,650
<23-1,Taub>我得工作
<23-1,Taub>I had to work.

550
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,130
<23-1,Taub>不过爸爸的老板是个混蛋
<23-1,Taub>But daddy's boss is what we call a jackass.

551
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,770
<23-1,Taub>很好  待在那
<23-1,Taub>Good. Stay right there.

552
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,120
<23-1,Taub>我也为...
<23-1,Taub>I'm also sorry...

553
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,930
<23-1,Taub>我将要做的事感到抱歉...
<23-1,Taub>for what I'm about to do...

554
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,650
<23-1,Taub>因为...
<23-1,Taub>Because...

555
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,320
<23-1,Taub>因为没有什么能改变我对你俩的感情
<23-1,Taub>because nothing will ever change how I feel about you guys.

556
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,040
<23-1,Taub>不过..
<23-1,Taub>But...

557
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,380
<23-1,Taub>不过爸爸很脆弱而且需要知道
<23-1,Taub>but daddy is weak and needs to know.

558
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,480
<24-1,Chase>凌晨12点半  你怎么还在
<24-1,Chase>30 in the morning. Why are you still here?

559
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,510
<24-1,Chase>豪斯还在
<24-1,Chase>House is here

560
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,080
<24-2,Foreman>而且明显在为一个
<24-2,Foreman>and apparently prepping for an operation

561
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,550
<24-2,Foreman>可能导致病人死亡的手术做准备
<24-2,Foreman>that will probably kill a patient.

562
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,580
<24-3,Chase>如果有其它解决方法我也不会这么做
<24-3,Chase>I wouldn't be doing this if I thought there was another way.

563
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,280
<24-4,Foreman>有啊  他需要肝移植
<24-4,Foreman>There is. He needs a transplant.

564
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,970
<24-5,Chase>你手头就有合适的肝吗
<24-5,Chase>You have one lying around?

565
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,140
<24-5,Chase>因为如果未来几小时内没有的话他就会死
<24-5,Chase>'cause he'll be dead if he doesn't get one in the next few hours.

566
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,230
<24-6,Foreman>那也是自然原因造成的
<24-6,Foreman>That falls under natural causes.

567
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,590
<24-6,Foreman>如果他死在你手里我们就会面临...
<24-6,Foreman>If you kill him, we're looking at...

568
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,130
<24-7,Chase>死了就是死了
<24-7,Chase>Dead is dead.

569
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,240
<24-8,Foreman>我们的律师可不是这么认为的
<24-8,Foreman>Not as far as our lawyers are concerned.

570
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,920
<24-8,Foreman>我不是要当恶人
<24-8,Foreman>I'm not being a dick.

571
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,930
<24-8,Foreman>这是个现实问题
<24-8,Foreman>This is a real issue,

572
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,100
<24-8,Foreman>我得从大局出发
<24-8,Foreman>and I have to worry about the big picture now.

573
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,030
<24-8,Foreman>我不需要
<24-8,Foreman>I don't.

574
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,270
<24-9,Chase>我只是要做你一年前也会做的事
<24-9,Chase>I'll be doing what you would have done a year ago.

575
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,690
<24-9,Chase>我会进行这个手术
<24-9,Chase>I'll be in surgery.

576
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,290
<24-9,Chase>奇斯...
<24-9,Chase>Chase...

577
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,400
<24-10,Adams>你得看看这个
<24-10,Adams>You need to check this out.

578
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,390
<24-10,Adams>这是10小时前他肝脏的CT成像
<24-10,Adams>This is a C.T. scan of his liver from ten hours ago...

579
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,580
<24-10,Adams>这是现在的
<24-10,Adams>This is from now.

580
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,690
<24-11,Foreman>肝脏在自我修复
<24-11,Foreman>It's healing itself.

581
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,380
<25-1,Taub>我离开时
<25-1,Taub>When I left the room,

582
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,290
<25-1,Taub>他正跟她说单身派对上脱衣舞女郎的事
<25-1,Taub>he was telling her about the strippers from his bachelor party.

583
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,580
<25-2,Chase>肝功能已经改善了百分之三十
<25-2,Chase>Liver function has improved 30%--

584
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,200
<25-2,Chase>在他必须进行肝移植前我们又赢得了几天时间
<25-2,Chase>Buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.

585
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,170
<25-3,House>有趣的是  它为什么会自我修复呢
<25-3,House>Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?

586
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,100
<25-4,House>还有这场景
<25-4,House>And scene.

587
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,430
<25-4,House>现在回到无聊的现实中
<25-4,House>Now we're back to boring reality reality.

588
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,920
<25-4,House>他之前有过肝昏迷
<25-4,House>His liver was in shock before.

589
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,670
<25-4,House>他住院以来一直有过敏反应
<25-4,House>He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.

590
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,380
<25-5,Chase>这可以解释为什么他的症状发展如此迅速
<25-5,Chase>Could explain why his symptoms appeared so rapidly.

591
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,750
<25-6,Adams>也可能是症状消失的原因
<25-6,Adams>And maybe starting to go away.

592
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,850
<25-7,Taub>我们得进行划痕实验查找诱因
<25-7,Taub>We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.

593
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,680
<25-8,House>或者是谁  一切都起源于他对妻子不忠
<25-8,House>Or who. This all started when he cheated on his wife.

594
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,730
<25-9,Park>他对某人过敏吗
<25-9,Park>He's allergic to a person?

595
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,000
<25-10,House>或是她的
<25-10,House>Or something she's wearing--

596
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,160
<25-10,House>化妆品或是香水
<25-10,House>makeup, perfume,

597
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,370
<25-10,House>避孕用品  凯蒂猫玩偶
<25-10,House>birth control method, her "Hello kitty" doll.

598
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
<25-10,House>你们去找那女人和诱因
<25-10,House>Two of you go find her and find out what.

599
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,770
<25-10,House>你们俩在进行划痕实验的同时
<25-10,House>Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids

600
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,560
<25-10,House>使用糖皮质激素和肾上腺素进行治疗
<25-10,House>and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.

601
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,710
<26-1,Cindy>你们认为是我引起的吗
<26-1,Cindy>You think I did this to him?

602
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,100
<26-2,Chase>也许是你穿的用的或是给他的东西
<26-2,Chase>Or something you wear, own, use, or gave him.

603
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,220
<26-3,Cindy>我就给了他个避孕套  他没带
<26-3,Cindy>I gave him a condom. He didn't have one.

604
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,270
<26-5,Cindy>-哪种  -我不知道是哪种
<26-5,Cindy>- What kind? - I don't know what kind.

605
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,370
<26-5,Cindy>我在健康日活动工作时拿的
<26-5,Cindy>I got it from the health fair I was working at.

606
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,920
<26-6,Chase>-你在医疗机构工作吗  -我是形象大使
<26-6,Chase>- You're in the medical profession? - I'm Miss Cedarville.

607
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,390
<26-7,Cindy>健康日活动是我的职责之一
<26-7,Cindy>The health fair is one of my responsibilities.

608
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,460
<26-8,Adams>另一职责是和38岁已婚男子乱搞吗
<26-8,Adams>Is another one hooking up with 38-year-old married men?

609
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,850
<26-9,Chase>我猜我该充当白脸
<26-9,Chase>I guess I'm supposed to be the good cop.

610
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,050
<26-9,Chase>我知道这很难
<26-9,Chase>I know this is tough.

611
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,810
<26-9,Chase>不过你记住的任何事都可能挽救他的生命
<26-9,Chase>But anything you can remember might help save his life.

612
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,450
<26-10,Cindy>他送我回家  然后...
<26-10,Cindy>He was giving me a ride home, and...

613
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,240
<26-10,Cindy>他看上去总是很友善
<26-10,Cindy>he always seemed so nice.

614
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,040
<26-10,Cindy>然后我们就去了汽车旅馆
<26-10,Cindy>And then we ended up at the motel.

615
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,260
<26-10,Cindy>现在人人都在议论这事
<26-10,Cindy>And now everybody's talking about it.

616
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,520
<26-10,Cindy>如果他们发现那是我
<26-10,Cindy>And if they find out it was me,

617
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,260
<26-10,Cindy>我就会丢掉我的头衔甚至工作
<26-10,Cindy>I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.

618
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,440
<26-10,Cindy>城里的人都不会再跟我说话了
<26-10,Cindy>And no one in town is ever gonna speak to me again.

619
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,340
<26-10,Cindy>我犯了个错误  现在这错误会毁了我的生活
<26-10,Cindy>I made a mistake, and now it's gonna end up ruining my life.

620
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,590
<27-1,Bob>德尼丝再也不会想见到我了
<27-1,Bob>Denise never wants to see me again.

621
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,940
<27-2,Park>你还以为会发生什么
<27-2,Park>What did you think was gonna happen?

622
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,370
<27-3,Bob>我厌倦了生活在谎言之中
<27-3,Bob>I was sick of living a lie.

623
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,280
<27-3,Bob>每个人都爱我  每个人都指望着我
<27-3,Bob>Everybody loved me. Everybody looked up to me.

624
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,960
<27-3,Bob>但是...
<27-3,Bob>But...

625
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,850
<27-3,Bob>我不配
<27-3,Bob>I didn't deserve it.

626
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,070
<27-4,Taub>谁都会犯错
<27-4,Taub>Everybody makes mistakes.

627
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,670
<27-4,Taub>只是通常他们不会同时将所有错误都公之于众
<27-4,Taub>They just don't usually broadcast all of them at the same time.

628
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,200
<27-5,Bob>如果我都要死了
<27-5,Bob>Well, if I'm gonna die,

629
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,320
<27-5,Bob>我宁愿干净的离去
<27-5,Bob>I might as well do it with a clean soul.

630
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,720
<27-6,Park>如果你活下来呢
<27-6,Park>And if you live?

631
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,080
<27-6,Park>你还没过河呢
<27-6,Park>You didn't just burn bridges.

632
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,770
<27-6,Park>就先把桥给拆了
<27-6,Park>You torched, nuked, and salted the earth with them.

633
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,480
<27-7,Bob>人人都要为所犯的罪过付出代价
<27-7,Bob>Everybody has to pay for their sins.

634
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,760
<27-7,Bob>感觉就像你在用烧火棍捅我
<27-7,Bob>Oh, it feels like you stuck me with a hot poker.

635
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,580
<27-8,Taub>过敏反应
<27-8,Taub>An allergic reaction.

636
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,810
<27-9,Park>是来自小麦过敏源
<27-9,Park>It's the swab for wheat-based allergies.

637
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,130
<27-10,Bob>我一辈子都在吃小麦
<27-10,Bob>I've been eating wheat my entire life.

638
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,140
<27-10,Bob>我不对小麦过敏
<27-10,Bob>I'm not allergic to wheat.

639
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,740
<27-10,Bob>现在感觉全身像着火了一样
<27-10,Bob>Now it feels like my whole body's on fire.

640
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
<28-1,Park>这没道理啊
<28-1,Park>This doesn't make any sense.

641
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,400
<28-1,Park>当我用含小麦过敏源的试纸测试时
<28-1,Park>He broke out with a rash

642
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,570
<28-1,Park>他皮肤上起了很多皮疹
<28-1,Park>right after I tested with the wheat-allergy swab,

643
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,410
<28-1,Park>但没有任何一项血液指标证明他对此过敏
<28-1,Park>But none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.

644
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,630
<28-2,Taub>那就不是过敏
<28-2,Taub>Then he's not allergic to it.

645
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,010
<28-3,Chase>也许是糖皮质激素起了什么作用
<28-3,Chase>Could the corticosteroids have somehow caused it?

646
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
<28-4,Taub>他发皮疹时我还没给他注射糖皮质激素
<28-4,Taub>I didn't hook them up yet. After he broke out,

647
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,630
<28-4,Taub>我想在对他用药前先确定是否为谷类过敏源
<28-4,Taub>I wanted to confirm it was gluten before we dosed him.

648
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,940
<28-5,Chase>也可能是乳胶过敏  起初由避孕套引起
<28-5,Chase>Could be a latex allergy. Started with a condom,

649
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,940
<28-5,Chase>然后我们戴的手套用的仪器造成了持续性刺激
<28-5,Chase>and we kept it going with our gloves and equipment.

650
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,050
<28-6,Taub>在乳胶试验中他也没表现出阳性反应
<28-6,Taub>He doesn't test positive for that either.

651
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,180
<28-7,Park>他的血样在任何试验中都没表现出阳性反应
<28-7,Park>None of his samples test positive for anything.

652
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,440
<28-8,Taub>那他就是对某些没测试过的东西过敏
<28-8,Taub>Then he's allergic to something not on the tests.

653
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,360
<28-8,Taub>我继续查
<28-8,Taub>I'll keep looking here.

654
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
<28-9,Chase>我们开始用类固醇治疗看是否能将过敏源清除
<28-9,Chase>We'll start the steroids and see if it clears up.

655
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,180
<28-10,Foreman>你只有一个病人却有三份DNA结果
<28-10,Foreman>You have one patient and three DNA results?

656
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,320
<28-11,Taub>否则我怎么比较家族性遗传病
<28-11,Taub>How else do I compare them to other genetic disorders?

657
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,210
<28-11,Taub>怎么回事
<28-11,Taub>What's up?

658
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,390
<28-12,Foreman>奇斯基本上把我归为叛徒了
<28-12,Foreman>Chase basically called me a sellout.

659
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,790
<28-13,Taub>就因为你把白大褂挂起来以谋求更多的薪水
<28-13,Taub>Just because you hung up your lab coat for more money

660
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,100
<28-13,Taub>和更大的办公室吗
<28-13,Taub>and a bigger office?

661
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,870
<28-14,Foreman>我将其束之高阁是因为卡迪走后得有人负责
<28-14,Foreman>I hung it up because someone had to run this place after Cuddy left.

662
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,310
<28-15,Taub>外面有的是管理人才
<28-15,Taub>There are a lot of good administrators out there,

663
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,500
<28-15,Taub>好医生却没几个
<28-15,Taub>not many good doctors.

664
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,830
<28-16,Foreman>比你想的多多了
<28-16,Foreman>More to it than you think.

665
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,170
<28-16,Foreman>比如说
<28-16,Foreman>For example,

666
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,180
<28-16,Foreman>你正在看的是猴子的DNA
<28-16,Foreman>you're looking at monkey dna.

667
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,210
<28-16,Foreman>我的分析是
<28-16,Foreman>My analysis--

668
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,600
<28-16,Foreman>豪斯在操纵你进行DNA测试后偷去了测试结果
<28-16,Foreman>House took your results after he manipulated you into providing them.

669
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,650
<29-1,Adams>他就像蛇一样在蜕皮
<29-1,Adams>He's shedding his skin like a snake.

670
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
<29-2,Taub>如果是过敏反应
<29-2,Taub>If it was an allergic reaction,

671
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,790
<29-2,Taub>那么糖皮质激素和肾上腺激素治疗
<29-2,Taub>the corticosteroids and epinephrine

672
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,890
<29-2,Taub>只会使他好转而不会恶化
<29-2,Taub>would have made him better, not worse.

673
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,530
<29-3,Park>有人在思考答案吗
<29-3,Park>Is everyone trying to think of an answer?

674
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,460
<29-3,Park>还是每个人都不敢说出所想的答案
<29-3,Park>Or is everyone afraid to say what they think the answer is?

675
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,830
<29-4,House>我就当你们是后者了
<29-4,House>I take it you're in the latter category.

676
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,020
<29-5,Park>史蒂文斯—约翰逊综合征
<29-5,Park>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome...

677
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,290
<29-5,Park>符合所有症状  并且可以解释
<29-5,Park>it fits all of his symptoms and explains

678
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,330
<29-5,Park>为何用过类固醇之后他的病情恶化
<29-5,Park>why he got worse after the steroids.

679
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,100
<29-5,Park>几乎所有药物治疗都会使该病加剧
<29-5,Park>Most medication exacerbates the condition.

680
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,680
<29-6,Chase>不治之症
<29-6,Chase>There's no treatment for it.

681
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,450
<29-7,House>符合
<29-7,House>It fits.

682
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,110
<29-7,House>病例到此结束
<29-7,House>Case closed.

683
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,750
<29-7,House>你们何不回家睡会儿觉
<29-7,House>Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

684
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,040
<30-1,Bob>我感觉像在地狱一样
<30-1,Bob>I feel like I'm in hell.

685
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,830
<30-2,Chase>不能给你使用过多的止痛药物
<30-2,Chase>We can't give you too much pain medication,

686
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,740
<30-2,Chase>不然你的病情会更糟
<30-2,Chase>or we'll make your condition worse.

687
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,580
<30-3,Bob>我还有最后一件事要忏悔
<30-3,Bob>I got one final confession to make.

688
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,930
<30-4,Chase>还有什么
<30-4,Chase>What's left...

689
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,440
<30-4,Chase>你逃税了吗
<30-4,Chase>You cheated on your taxes?

690
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,130
<30-5,Bob>我杀过人
<30-5,Bob>I'm a murderer.

691
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,330
<30-5,Bob>我杀了我的合伙人
<30-5,Bob>I killed my business partner.

692
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,160
<30-5,Bob>一枪打在他头上
<30-5,Bob>I shot him in the head.

693
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,570
<30-5,Bob>然后伪造自杀现场
<30-5,Bob>I made it look like suicide.

694
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,580
<30-5,Bob>而且他只是第一个
<30-5,Bob>And he was just the first.

695
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,750
<30-6,Chase>你还杀了其他人
<30-6,Chase>You killed more?

696
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,370
<30-7,Bob>还有三个
<30-7,Bob>Three...

697
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,370
<30-7,Bob>或者四个
<30-7,Bob>or four.

698
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,650
<30-8,Chase>我回来之前别再杀人
<30-8,Chase>Try not to kill anyone else until I get back.

699
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,300
<31-1,Chase>是神经病变  他的大脑前交通动脉
<31-1,Chase>It's neurological. There's an aneurysm

700
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,440
<31-1,Chase>有一个动脉瘤
<31-1,Chase>in the anterior communicating artery of his brain...

701
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,440
<31-1,Chase>正是负责冲动控制与抑制的部位
<31-1,Chase>the area moderating impulse control and compulsion.

702
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,690
<31-1,Chase>神经瘤越长越大
<31-1,Chase>As it grew larger,

703
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,300
<31-1,Chase>他承认的事也越来越离谱
<31-1,Chase>so did the confessions.

704
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,540
<31-1,Chase>看着
<31-1,Chase>Watch.

705
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:33,240
<31-1,Chase>鲍勃  我储物柜里丢了一只鞋
<31-1,Chase>Bob, one of my shoes is missing from my locker.

706
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,050
<31-1,Chase>对不起
<31-1,Chase>I'm so sorry.

707
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,840
<31-2,Bob>我正需要钱
<31-2,Bob>I-I needed the cash, and, um,

708
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,850
<31-2,Bob>你的柜子正开着
<31-2,Bob>the locker was open.

709
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,260
<31-3,Park>我从未听说有神经疾病
<31-3,Park>I never heard of a neurological problem

710
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,030
<31-3,Park>会导致皮肤脱落
<31-3,Park>that causes someone's skin to fall off.

711
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,980
<31-4,House>因为根本没有这样的病
<31-4,House>Because there isn't one.

712
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,310
<31-4,House>动脉瘤只是另一个症状
<31-4,House>The aneurysm is just another symptom.

713
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,710
<31-4,House>而不是病因
<31-4,House>It's not the cause.

714
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,510
<31-4,House>把这些都考虑进去  不难想到
<31-4,House>You add them all together, we get...

715
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,490
<31-4,House>不难想到川...
<31-4,House>We get Kaw... Kawas... Kawas...

716
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,420
<31-4,House>川崎病
<31-4,House>It's Kawasaki's Disease.

719
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,990
<31-5,Taub>我们只是想  川崎病通常只在
<31-5,Taub>We just figured since it basically presents

00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,090
<31-5,Taub>亚洲儿童身上出现
<31-5,Taub>only in Asian children...

721
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,060
<31-6,House>也不是说没有可能患病
<31-6,House>Which you might have, by the way.

722
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,270
<31-6,House>所以我们才会将它遗漏
<31-6,House>Which is basically why we missed it.

723
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,270
<31-6,House>地毯依然...
<31-6,House>Rug burns...

<31-6,House>If it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have to repair it.

729

<31-6,House>你们其他人
<31-6,House>The rest of you...

<32-2,House>我还自我怀疑了一整天呢
<32-2,House>I've been second-guessing myself all day.

<32-3,Taub>检测结果在哪里
<32-3,Taub>Where are the DNA results?

736
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,260
<32-4,House>先承认我是对的
<32-4,House>First admit that I was right.

737
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,100
<32-5,Taub>是你使手段让我去测的

<32-6,House>Now you admit that it was incredibly easy,

740
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,370
<32-6,House>因为心诚则无人可欺
<32-6,House>because you can't cheat an honest man.

741
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,320
<32-7,Taub>我爱她们
<32-7,Taub>I love them.

742
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,740
<32-7,Taub>就算其中有一个不是我亲生  我也不在乎
<32-7,Taub>I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.

743
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,920
<32-8,House>如果两个都不是呢
<32-8,House>What about both?

744
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,010
<32-8,House>有可能哦  我还没看
<32-8,House>Could be. Haven't read these.

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,050
<32-9,Taub>但我不要看结果
<32-9,Taub>but I'm not doing this.

748
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,490
<32-9,Taub>我不在乎
<32-9,Taub>I don't care.

<32-10,House>你在乎  我能证明
<32-10,House>You do, and I'll prove it.

00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,090
<32-10,House>你希望我把结果扔进碎纸机
<32-10,House>I will shred this.

00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,630
<32-10,House>此事一笔勾销
<32-10,House>and we'll forget all about it.

753
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,720
<32-10,House>还是我们去实验室灯箱前
<32-10,House>Or we'll go to the light box in the lab

<32-11,Taub>Let me see them.

757
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,130
<32-11,Taub>只是想确定一下全部结果都在里面
<32-11,Taub>Just wanted to make sure all three were inside.

<33-1,Denise>There wasn't any money missing from the scholarship fund.

762
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,160
<33-1,Denise>你不由自主承认一些没做过的错事
<33-1,Denise>how it made you confess to crimes you hadn't committed.

00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,190
<33-1,Denise>你跟别人有外遇的事
<33-1,Denise>The affair with that girl...

764

<33-1,Denise>是真的吗
<33-1,Denise>is that real?

<33-3,Denise>我就知道你不会那样对我
<33-3,Denise>I knew you could never do that to me.

00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,530
<33-3,Denise>不知怎么的
<33-3,Denise>I don't know how...

770
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,180
<33-3,Denise>可我就是知道
<33-3,Denise>but I knew.

00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,790
<34-3,Foreman>我想我不应该再自寻烦恼
<34-3,Foreman>Second-guessing my best doctors

776
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,370
<34-3,Foreman>去怀疑我最优秀的医生们
<34-3,Foreman>shouldn't be one of them.

777
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,580
<34-4,Chase>怎么到这儿来了
<34-4,Chase>Why are you up here?

00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,630
<34-7,Foreman>豪斯一直不回家
<34-7,Foreman>House won't go home.

782
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,220
<34-7,Foreman>我不能让他脱离我的监管留在医院
<34-7,Foreman>And there's no way I'm leaving him here unsupervised.

00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,770
<34-8,Chase>豪斯什么都不做
<34-8,Chase>House is screwing with you...

784
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,760
<34-8,Chase>是在故意整你
<34-8,Chase>by not screwing with you.

<34-8,Chase>他整晚都在看电视喝马提尼
<34-8,Chase>He's watching TV and drinking martinis all night.

<34-8,Chase>还能让你为了找出并不存在的计划
<34-8,Chase>Meanwhile, he's keeping you here searching for a plan
