<7-11,Lucas>He always moralized and gotabceven. He hasn't fired back.

119
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,740
<7-12,House>万物皆变
<7-12,House>Things always change.

120
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,980
<7-13,Lucas>那很烂
<7-13,Lucas>And that sucks.

121
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,220
<7-13,Lucas>是啊
<7-13,Lucas>Yeah.

122
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,540
<7-14,House>查出他是在哪儿
<7-14,House>Find out where he was.

123
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,170
<8-1,Thirteen>早该知道这不是个巧合
<8-1,Thirteen>should've known it wasn't a coincidence.

124
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,420
<8-1,Thirteen>找到了几封你的信
<8-1,Thirteen>Found your letters.

125
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,470
<8-1,Thirteen>你认出了House的名字
<8-1,Thirteen>You recognized house's name.

126
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,730
<8-1,Thirteen>而且你是我所见过的病人之中abc唯一喜欢跟他搭讪
<8-1,Thirteen>And you're the first patient I've seenabcwho actually enjoyed being accosted by him.

127
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,080
<8-2,Spencer>我应该告诉你的 但是...
<8-2,Spencer>I would'veabctold you, but--

128
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,790
<8-3,Thirteen>你能跟我说什么呢?
<8-3,Thirteen>what exactly would you have told me?

129
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,740
<8-3,Thirteen>跟我上床只是为了接近House?
<8-3,Thirteen>That you slept with me to get to house?

130
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,100
<8-3,Thirteen>你为了让他接你的病例 努力了一年多?
<8-3,Thirteen>That you've been trying to get himabcto take your case for over a year?

131
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,270
<8-4,Spencer>我病了 没有人给我回过信
<8-4,Spencer>I'm sick. No one even wrote back.

132
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,570
<8-5,Thirteen>你利用了我
<8-5,Thirteen>You used me.

133
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,580
<8-5,Thirteen>你利用了我
<8-5,Thirteen>You used me.

134
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,290
<8-7,Thirteen>我的动机很明确
<8-7,Thirteen>My motives were clear.

135
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,490
<8-8,Spencer>你如果问过我名字的话abc也许就能发现我的动机
<8-8,Spencer>You might've figured out my motivesabcfaster if you bothered to ask my name.

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,970
<8-8,Spencer>我跟你去了那个酒吧abc因为我想和你谈谈
<8-8,Spencer>I followed you to that barabcbecause I wanted to talk to you.

137
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,750
<8-8,Spencer>看是否你能帮助我联系House
<8-8,Spencer>See if you'd help me get to house.

138
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,120
<8-8,Spencer>我没想到你这么主动
<8-8,Spencer>I didn't expect you to be so aggressive.

139
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,420
<8-9,Thirteen>那个癫痫发作是真的吗?
<8-9,Thirteen>Was that seizure even real?

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,130
<8-10,Spencer>我干嘛要伪装我的症状?
<8-10,Spencer>Why would I fake a symptom?

141
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,560
<8-10,Spencer>这只能让House更难诊治我
<8-10,Spencer>It would just make itabcharder for house to diagnose me.

142
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,070
<8-11,Thirteen>没有什么需要诊断的 你的活检结果均正常
<8-11,Thirteen>There's nothing to diagnose.abcYour biopsy results are negative.

143
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,860
<8-12,Spencer>那就是什么别的病
<8-12,Spencer>Then it's something else.

144
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,010
<8-13,Thirteen>换上衣服 你得出院
<8-13,Thirteen>Get dressed. I'm discharging you.

145
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,410
<8-14,Spencer>House收的我 显然他认为...
<8-14,Spencer>House admitted me.Heabcobviously thinks--

146
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,770
<8-15,Thirteen>House利用你作窥探我私生活的借口
<8-15,Thirteen>house is using you as an excuse toabcstick his nose in my personal life.

147
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,100
<8-16,Spencer>我总是觉得很累
<8-16,Spencer>I'm tired all the time.

148
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,300
<8-16,Spencer>我从晚上十点睡到第二天中午abc还是觉得累
<8-16,Spencer>Some nights I fall asleep at 10:00abcand wake up at noon,still tired.

149
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,450
<8-16,Spencer>我看过的所有医生都说我没事
<8-16,Spencer>Every doctor I see tellsabcme there's nothing wrong.

150
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,270
<8-17,Thirteen>这说明了什么?abc他们都错了还是你错了?
<8-17,Thirteen>And that proves what, exactly? Thatabcthey're wrong,or that you're wrong?

151
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,720
<8-18,Thirteen>得了 你还指望我相信...
<8-18,Thirteen>Oh, come on.Youabcexpect me to believe--

152
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,550
<8-18,Thirteen>后仰 深呼吸 试着放松
<8-18,Thirteen>Sit back. Deep breaths. Try and relax.

153
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,020
<8-19,Thirteen>拿除颤器来 她要不行了
<8-19,Thirteen>Get the paddles. She's gonna crash.

154
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,020
<8-19,Thirteen>该死
<8-19,Thirteen>Damn.

155
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,910
<8-20,Thirteen>不得不心脏除颤以稳定病人的心脏
<8-20,Thirteen>we had to use paddles toabcstabilize the patient's heart.

156
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,640
<8-21,House>眼部问题 脑部问题 到现在的心脏问题
<8-21,House>Eye issue, brain issue,abcnow a heart issue.

157
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,390
<8-21,House>像个真正的病例
<8-21,House>Sounds like a real case to me.

158
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,630
<8-22,Thirteen>我知道了 我错了 可以继续了吗?
<8-22,Thirteen>I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?

159
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,340
<8-23,House>你心烦意乱是因为她跟你在一起时
<8-23,House>You're just upset because theabcwhole time she was with you,

160
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,240
<8-23,House>想的却是我那很强很有力的...诊断技巧
<8-23,House>she was thinking of my huge,abcthrobbing...diagnostic skills.

161
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,220
<8-23,House>毒品可以解释所有症状
<8-23,House>Drugs would explain everything.

162
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,770
<8-24,Taub>今天早上你否定了毒品
<8-24,Taub>This morning,you rejected drugs.

163
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,400
<8-25,House>因为当时我同意13的看法 想逗她玩
<8-25,House>That's when I thought that thirteen wasabcright and was just jerking her around.

164
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,530
<8-25,House>心博骤停说明她可能毒品成瘾
<8-25,House>Cardiac arrest means sheabccould be a serious user.

165
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,800
<8-27,Foreman>- 好极了abc- 什么?
<8-27,Foreman>- Great.abc- What?

166
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,470
<8-28,Thirteen>这说明了她是在我家里用的药
<8-28,Thirteen>That means that something sheabcdid at my place set this off.

167
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,820
<8-28,Thirteen>要么是她带毒品来abc要么是从我药柜里拿的
<8-28,Thirteen>Either she brought drugs in, or sheabcgrabbed something from my medicine cabinet.

168
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,100
<8-28,Thirteen>也就是说我家要被搜查了
<8-28,Thirteen>And that means myabcplace needs to be searched.

169
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,890
<8-28,Thirteen>我很乐意亲自去做abc不幸的是那样House提不起兴趣
<8-28,Thirteen>Now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunatelyabcthat would be far less titillating for house,

170
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,380
<8-28,Thirteen>所以他会变着花样找原因
<8-28,Thirteen>so he's about to come up withabcsome convoluted medical reason

171
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,230
<8-28,Thirteen>让我呆在这儿 他去翻我的东西
<8-28,Thirteen>why I have to stay here whileabche goes through my stuff.

172
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,470
<8-29,House>病人的父亲刚做了旁路分流术
<8-29,House>Patient's dad had bypass surgery.

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,080
<8-29,House>说明她有患动脉粥样硬化的可能abc需要做个超声
<8-29,House>Means she's a candidate forabcatherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound.

174
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,650
<8-29,House>找个借口没那么复杂
<8-29,House>That was much lessabcconvoluted than what you just said.

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,180
<8-30,Thirteen>我不会给你我的钥匙abc要是你非得这么做 我也要去
<8-30,Thirteen>I'm not giving you my keys. Ifabcyou want to do this,I'm going.

176
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,950
<8-31,House>谁会开锁?
<8-31,House>Who could pick a lock?

177
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,580
<8-31,House>我去
<8-31,House>I'll go.

178
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,510
<8-32,Foreman>监督他不会偷你的内衣
<8-32,Foreman>Make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.

179
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,410
<9-1,House>真丢黑人兄弟的脸 让开
<9-1,House>you're a disgrace to yourabcstereotype. Move over.

180
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,700
<9-2,Foreman>你觉得你开锁比我快?
<9-2,Foreman>Think you can pick a lock faster than me?

181
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,040
<9-3,House>不需要开锁
<9-3,House>No need to pick.

182
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,560
<9-4,Foreman>好啊 从你的手下那里偷
<9-4,Foreman>Nice. Steal from your employees.

183
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,130
<9-4,Foreman>从不
<9-4,Foreman>Never.

184
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,110
<9-5,House>我让私家侦探在调查小鸭子时弄的钥匙
<9-5,House>I had my dick make keys whenabcI hired him to dick up the team.

185
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,280
<9-6,House>总是想像她卧室里有做爱用的秋千
<9-6,House>Always imagined she'd have aabcsex swing in the living room.

186
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,740
<9-7,Foreman>- 把我的钥匙给我abc- 我没有你的钥匙
<9-7,Foreman>- Give me my key.abc- Don't have your key.

187
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,740
<9-9,Foreman>你指望我相信你雇了lucas调查所有人abc除了我?
<9-9,Foreman>You expect me to believe that you hiredabclucas to investigate everyone except for me?

188
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,820
<9-10,House>浪费钱 我早就对你了如指掌
<9-10,House>Waste of money. I alreadyabcknow everything about you.

189
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,710
<9-11,Foreman>13有她的包 那个肯定是病人的abc检查一下毒品
<9-11,Foreman>Thirteen had her purse. That's gottaabcbe the patient's. Check it for drugs.

190
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,350
<9-12,House>我趁机查她的卧室
<9-12,House>I call shotgun on the bedroom.

191
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,190
<9-13,Foreman>你知道我年少时偷过车
<9-13,Foreman>You know that I stole aabccar when I was a teenager.

<9-13,Foreman>你知道我母亲有老年痴呆症
<9-13,Foreman>You know that my mom has alzheimer's.

193
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,090
<9-13,Foreman>其余的你一无所知
<9-13,Foreman>You know nothing else.

194
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,030
<9-14,House>想要我调查你? 什么时候这么饥渴了?
<9-14,House>Want me to have you investigated?abcWhen did you get so needy?

195
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,110
<9-15,Foreman>不是饥渴 只是不吃这一套
<9-15,Foreman>Not needy. Just don't buy it.

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,970
<9-15,Foreman>你总是想要知道人们的一切
<9-15,Foreman>You always want moreabcinformation about people.

197
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,600
<9-16,Foreman>看看你都跑到哪儿去了 包里没毒品
<9-16,Foreman>Look where we are. Purse is clean.

<9-17,House>昨晚13不是第一次带陌生人回家
<9-17,House>Last night wasn't the first time thatabcthirteen brought home some strange.

199
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,920
<9-18,Foreman>难道你找到了她的日记...
<9-18,Foreman>If you foundabcher diary--

200
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,880
<9-19,House>没有性用具 要是你总跟一个人睡abc需要点提高性趣的配件
<9-19,House>no toys.You sleep with the same person overabcand over, that's when you need accessories.

201
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,140
<9-19,House>刚开始时 光两个人就很容易兴奋 但...
<9-19,House>First time is plentyabcexciting on its own. Unless...

202
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,650
<9-20,House>你觉得哮喘吸入器可以当性玩具吗?
<9-20,House>you think an asthma inhalerabccould be used as a sex toy?

203
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,480
<9-21,Foreman>有很多不犯法就能了解他人的方法
<9-21,Foreman>There are ways of getting to knowabcpeople without committing felonies.

<9-22,House>我对人感兴趣 对谈话不感兴趣
<9-22,House>People interest me. Conversations don't.

205
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,380
<9-23,Foreman>因为谈话是双向的
<9-23,Foreman>Because conversations go both ways.

206
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,570
<9-23,Foreman>像13一样(双性恋)

<10-9,Kutner>- 你搬家了?abc- 谁在意?
<10-9,Kutner>- You moved?abc- Who cares?

219
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,320
<10-10,Thirteen>他不在意 只是惊讶自己毫不知情
<10-10,Thirteen>He doesn't. He's justabcsurprised he didn't know.

220
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,470
<10-11,House>你保留那些别人不会特意去隐藏的事
<10-11,House>You withhold things otherabcpeople would never bother to.

221

<10-11,House>The move,a little wheeze, whatever youabcthought was in my pocket instead of your inhaler.

<10-11,House>也许还得去你家找找
<10-11,House>Maybe I should make aabcreturn trip to your place.

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,850
<10-12,Kutner>病人身上要是没有咬痕abc找到蜘蛛也没用
<10-12,Kutner>Spider bite doesn't explain anything unlessabcthe patient was actually bitten by a spider.

224
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,870
<10-12,Kutner>我去检查一下
<10-12,Kutner>I'll do the exam.

225
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
<10-13,House>别开玩笑 这样不合适
<10-13,House>don't be ridiculous. Thatabcwould be inappropriate.

<10-13,House>It'd be better if a woman gropes her.abcThere's no sexual tension that way.

227
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,370
<11-1,Thirteen>请站起来并脱掉衣服
<11-1,Thirteen>I need you to standabcup and take off your gown.

228
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,260
<11-2,Spencer>有蜘蛛咬的话 我会感觉到
<11-2,Spencer>I think I would'veabcfelt a spider biting me.

229
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,580
<11-3,Thirteen>不一定
<11-3,Thirteen>Not necessarily.

230
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
<11-4,Spencer>经过了那晚 你还需要戴手套吗?
<11-4,Spencer>You really need those afterabceverything we did the other night?

231
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,720
<11-5,Thirteen>那晚我不是你的医生
<11-5,Thirteen>The other night I wasn't your doctor.

232
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,960
<11-6,Spencer>你还要生我的气多久?
<11-6,Spencer>How long are you gonna stay mad at me?

233
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,890
<11-7,Thirteen>你还要在这呆多久?
<11-7,Thirteen>How long are you going to be here?

234
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,380
<11-8,Spencer>好吧
<11-8,Spencer>Okay, then.

235
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,940
<11-9,Thirteen>听着...
<11-9,Thirteen>Look...

236
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,870
<11-9,Thirteen>我本不打算再见你了
<11-9,Thirteen>I really had no intentionabcof ever seeing you again.

237
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,680
<11-10,Spencer>那我在这 有点打破你的计划 我理解
<11-10,Spencer>So... having me end up here isabca little less than ideal. I get it.

238
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,750
<11-10,Spencer>但...我们才刚认识
<11-10,Spencer>But... we just met.

239
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,700
<11-10,Spencer>你怎么知道不想再见我了?
<11-10,Spencer>How'd you know you didn'tabcwant to see me again?

240
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,780
<11-11,Thirteen>不是针对你个人
<11-11,Thirteen>It's nothing personal.

241
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,400
<11-11,Thirteen>我只是不喜欢重复
<11-11,Thirteen>I'm just really not thatabcinto repeat performances.

242
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,870
<11-12,Spencer>我应该不是你第一个猎物
<11-12,Spencer>I figured I wasn't theabcfirst girl you cruised.

243
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,060
<11-13,Thirteen>为什么这么说?
<11-13,Thirteen>Why is that?

244
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,680
<11-14,Spencer>你很擅长此道
<11-14,Spencer>You're awfully good at it.

245
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,050
<11-15,Thirteen>我如果经验老道的话abc会只有7分吗?
<11-15,Thirteen>You'd think with all that experienceabcthat I'd be better than a seven.

246
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,240
<11-16,Spencer>我们刚认识 都醉得厉害
<11-16,Spencer>We just met. We were both drunk.

247
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,710
<11-16,Spencer>又不代表没有进步空间
<11-16,Spencer>Not like there wasn't potential.

248
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,050
<11-16,Spencer>我们再多练习一下 9分不在话下
<11-16,Spencer>Little more practice for the both ofabcus, I'd say we're looking at a nine.

249
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,600
<11-16,Spencer>轻而易举
<11-16,Spencer>Easy.

250
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,890
<11-16,Spencer>但这就需要不断重复了
<11-16,Spencer>But that would require aabcrepeat performance.

251
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,080
<11-16,Spencer>你不必把手拿开
<11-16,Spencer>You didn't have to move your hand.

252
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,670
<11-17,Thirteen>没有啊 我手在你臀部 你感觉不到?
<11-17,Thirteen>I didn'T. My hand's on yourabchip. You don't feel that?

253
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,450
<11-18,Spencer>没感觉 这代表什么?
<11-18,Spencer>No. What does that mean?

254
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,010
<11-19,Thirteen>代表这不是蜘蛛咬导致的
<11-19,Thirteen>It means it's not a spider bite.

255
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,680
<12-1,Thirteen>验血证实了低钾abc解释了臀部麻木的原因

<12-1,Thirteen>情况虽然不好 应该还有点时间abc给你评论一下我的个人生活
<12-1,Thirteen>It's not good,but I think we've got time for atabcleast one or two comments about my personal life.

257
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,020
<12-2,House>你却浪费在评论我的评论上了
<12-2,House>Which you just wasted withabcthat comment about my comments.

258
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,370
<12-2,House>低钾意味着心脏问题是abc由肾脏问题引起的
<12-2,House>Low potassium means her heart problemabcwas a symptom of a kidney problem.

259
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,650
<12-2,House>那肾脏问题是由什么引起的?
<12-2,House>What caused the kidney problem?

260
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,930
<12-3,Thirteen>可能是免疫球蛋白A肾病
<12-3,Thirteen>Could be I. G. A. Nephropathy.

261
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,620
<12-4,House>她没有便血

262
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,610
<12-5,Thirteen>那是后急性肾小球肾炎?
<12-5,Thirteen>P. S. A. G. N. ?

263
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,590
<12-6,House>但她血压正常

<12-7,Thirteen>她的肾不能过滤血液中的酸
<12-7,Thirteen>Her kidney's don't filterabcacid out of the blood.

266
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,660
<12-7,Thirteen>过量的酸降低钾含量 引发肾脏石灰化
<12-7,Thirteen>Excess acid drives down potassium,abccauses kidney calcifications.

267
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,740
<12-8,House>如果是这样abc只需碳酸氢钠中和一下酸就行了
<12-8,House>If it's rta, all she needs isabcsodium bicarbonate for the acid

268
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,130
<12-8,House>然后手术切除石灰化的部分
<12-8,House>and surgery to removeabcthe calcifications.

269
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,440
<12-8,House>给肾做个CT 看到石灰化就证实诊断了
<12-8,House>Ct her kidneys. If you findabccalcifications, we have our diagnosis.

270
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,030
<13-1,House>他现在在干嘛?
<13-1,House>what's he doing now?

271
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,630
<13-2,Lucas>玩劫车游戏
<13-2,Lucas>he's playing that carjacking video game.

272
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,070
<13-2,Lucas>如果不是见红灯就停的话 能开更远
<13-2,Lucas>He'd get a lot farther if heabcdidn't stop at all the red lights.

273
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,640
<13-3,House>也许他做了些我会嘲笑的事
<13-3,House>Maybe he was doing somethingabche thinks I'll mock him for.

274
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,310
<13-5,House>比如...所有的事
<13-5,House>Like... just about anything.

275
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,600
<13-6,Lucas>你不这么认为
<13-6,Lucas>You don't think it's that.

276
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,870
<13-7,House>不认为我会嘲笑他做的所有事
<13-7,House>I don't think it's just about anything?

277
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,320
<13-8,Lucas>你不认为这只是小事
<13-8,Lucas>You don't think it'sabcabout anything trivial.

278
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,460
<13-8,Lucas>你要不担心 就不会坐我车里面了
<13-8,Lucas>If you weren't worried, youabcwouldn't be sitting in my car.

279
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,720
<13-9,House>也许他在看心理医生
<13-9,House>Maybe he's seeing a shrink.

280
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,900
<13-9,House>她可不像送比萨的
<13-9,House>that does not lookabclike a pizza delivery.

281
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,630
<13-10,House>不是又怎样abcWilson才不花钱买"比萨"
<13-10,House>doesn't matter if it isn't.abcWilson doesn't buy his pizza.

283
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,520
<13-10,House>至少有一个像我这样反常的
<13-10,House>There's got to be a pervert likeabcme living in at least one of them.

284
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,400
<13-11,Lucas>是呀 因为你代表这这国家八分一的人
<13-11,Lucas>Yes, because you represent one out ofabcevery eight people living in this country.

285
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,630
<13-11,Lucas>看来他的"比萨"口味有所开发哦
<13-11,Lucas>Apparently he hasabcdeveloped a taste for pizza.

286
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,420
<13-12,Lucas>世事常变啊
<13-12,Lucas>Ah, things change.

287
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,580
<14-1,Taub>CT显示左肾的锥上缘还有点石灰化组织
<14-1,Taub>ct shows one more calcification nearabcthe superior pyramid on the left kidney.

<14-2,Chase>看到了
<14-2,Chase>See it.

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,780
<14-3,Foreman>被我找到了
<14-3,Foreman>I, uh, I found it.

291
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,210
<14-4,Foreman>两星期前他做了CAG序列检测
<14-4,Foreman>He did the cag test two weeks ago.

292
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,930
<14-4,Foreman>数值这么高意味着abc你剩下的时间比意料中少了
<14-4,Foreman>A number this high means youabchave less time than you thought.

293
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,580
<14-4,Foreman>不开心是可理解的
<14-4,Foreman>It's understandable you'd be upset.

294
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,530
<14-4,Foreman>但不代表你要自暴自弃
<14-4,Foreman>Doesn't mean you have to self-destruct.

<14-5,Thirteen>如果你打算评判我abc那么从House手里把我救下也不算高尚

<14-8,Foreman>You're doing drugs. Staying up allabcnight,having sex with strangers.

310
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,880
<15-1,Taub>意味着肾小管性酸中毒不是根本问题
<15-1,Taub>Means the rta isn't the underlying cause.

311
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,990
<15-2,House>13去哪了?
<15-2,House>Where's thirteen?

314

<15-7,Kutner>If her lungs are fine, maybe theabcproblem's in the supply line. Airway collapse.

319
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,760

<30-4,Thirteen>Jumping to a transplantabcwhen we don't know what she--
