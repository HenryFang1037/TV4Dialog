<4-15,CUDDY>- 你刚才给他了什么,- 面部神经瘫痪
<4-15,CUDDY>- What did you give him? - paralytic.

38

<4-22,HOUSE>要么让我继续用棉签去擦别人私处,或者让我想想这家伙的精神错乱和疼痛
<4-22,HOUSE>So either I can continueto swab people's privates or I can figure outif this guy's delirium,pain,

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,220
<4-22,HOUSE>疯狂的心率是有生命危险呢,还是只是一种古怪的人格
<4-22,HOUSE>and insanely high heart rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk.

<6-3,HOUSE>因为他头晕
<6-3,HOUSE>Because he was dizzy.

55
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,060
<6-3,HOUSE>表示内耳出了问题
<6-3,HOUSE>It means the problem was affecting his inner ear.

56
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,330
<6-4,CAMERON>护士说他绕圆圈跑,并不表示他那时候头晕
<6-4,CAMERON>Nurses said he was running in circles.Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

57
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,370
<6-5,HOUSE>他并没有绕圆圈跑

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,300
<6-10,HOUSE>- 如果能解释所有症状,- 也可能解释不了所有的
<6-10,HOUSE>- If it explains everything - might not explain everything.

65
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,100
<6-11,CHASE>好吧 如果他开始就有精神病呢
<6-11,CHASE>well,what if he was psychotic first,

66
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,370
<6-11,CHASE>然后自残 损害了耳部
<6-11,CHASE>then self-mutilated,damaged the ear.

<6-17,HOUSE>不错
<6-17,HOUSE>Good.

74
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,560
<6-18,CAMERON>很大可能是他先有了慢性病,特别是当有心率加快的现象出现
<6-18,CAMERON>Decent chance he had a chronic illness first,especially given the rapid heart rate.

75
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,360
<6-20,CAMERON>持续的耳部感染,增加了对内耳的压迫
<6-20,CAMERON>Lingering ear infection.Pressure builds up in his inner ear

76
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,850
<6-20,CAMERON>当他在门诊候诊的时候,通过中耳骨乳突爆发
<6-20,CAMERON>and bursts through the mastoid bone while he's waiting in the clinic.

77
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,260
<6-20,CAMERON>是啊

80
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,060
<6-22,HOUSE>你们忙这些的时候,顺道往他耳朵里倒点酒精
<6-22,HOUSE>Oh,while you're at it,pour some alcohol into his ear

81
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,690
<6-22,HOUSE>然后把蟑螂拿出来
<6-22,HOUSE>and take out the cockroach.

82
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,630
<6-23,FOREMAN>有个蟑螂在他耳朵里?
<6-23,FOREMAN>He has a cockroach in his ear?

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,730
<6-24,HOUSE>他发疯之前一直在抓耳朵,所以我就偷看了一下
<6-24,HOUSE>He was scratching that ear right before the event,so I took a peek.

84
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,200
<6-24,HOUSE>我猜是因为它开始咬人了
<6-24,HOUSE>My guess is it started biting.

85
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,880
<6-25,CAMERON>他没有什么别的事?
<6-25,CAMERON>Nothing else wrong with him?

86
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,460

<6-26,HOUSE>It's pretty gross.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,530
<6-27,CHASE>那么 我们干吗还要去作那么多检查
<6-27,CHASE>So.why are we doing the tests?

89
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,610
<6-28,HOUSE>不做这些我就要接着去坐门诊
<6-28,HOUSE>Well,it's either that or I have to keep doing clinic duty.

90

<6-28,HOUSE>做检查 或者别让Cuddy看到就好了
<6-28,HOUSE>Do the tests,or just stay out of cuddy's sight.

<9-2,CAMERON>他没有
<9-2,CAMERON>He doesn'T.

119
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,390
<10-1,CUDDY>你给耳朵里有虫子的病人预定了CT
<10-1,CUDDY>You ordered a ct on a patientwith a bug in his ear.

<10-2,HOUSE>你怎么知道我在这
<10-2,HOUSE>How'd you knowI was here?

121

<10-3,CUDDY>我在门诊偶遇了cameron
<10-3,CUDDY>Ran into cameronin the clinic.

<10-5,CUDDY>你预约不必要的检查就是为了
<10-5,CUDDY>You ordered pointless testsjust to--

124
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,990
<10-6,HOUSE>如果你没有偶遇cameron,那就不会是没用的了
<10-6,HOUSE>it wouldn'thave been pointless if you had"run into" cameron.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,030
<10-7,CUDDY>她受到惩罚了
<10-7,CUDDY>She got punished.

<10-7,CUDDY>她被一个垂死的病人粘住了
<10-7,CUDDY>She's stuckwith another dying patient.

127
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,150
<10-8,CUDDY>那是维柯丁?

<10-9,HOUSE>Breath mint.

129
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,480
<10-9,HOUSE>我以为你会亲我
<10-9,HOUSE>Thought youwere gonna kiss me.

130
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,830
<10-10,CUDDY>不是戒毒了吗
<10-10,CUDDY>What happened to rehab?

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,080
<10-11,HOUSE>我不去了
<10-11,HOUSE>I got out.

132
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,230
<10-12,CUDDY>- 那是诡计是吧,- 前戏够了吧
<10-12,CUDDY>- it was a scam? - Enough foreplay.

133
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,320
<10-13,HOUSE>你到底要不要亲我
<10-13,HOUSE>Are you gonna kiss me or not?

134
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,170
<10-14,CUDDY>你现在就回门诊去
<10-14,CUDDY>You are going backto the clinic.

135
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,100
<10-14,CUDDY>或者监狱
<10-14,CUDDY>Or jaiL.

136
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,150
<10-15,HOUSE>你作伪证把我弄出监狱,回头你怎么跟警察说
<10-15,HOUSE>You perjured yourselfto keep me out of jail.How are you gonna tell--

137
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,970
<10-16,CUDDY>我以为你会戒毒,所以才那样做
<10-16,CUDDY>I only did that because I thought youwere getting clean.

138
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,960
<10-17,HOUSE>所以要么去坐门诊要么就坐牢房
<10-17,HOUSE>So it's do clinic dutyor go to jail?

139
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,910

140
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,650

<11-4,HOUSE>那些鸽子怎么有胆量在上面拉屎
<11-4,HOUSE>pigeons wouldn't have the nerveto poop on it.

<11-9,SHERLOCK NOSE>我推断你是一个不关心细节的人
<11-9,SHERLOCK NOSE>I extrapolated youwere a person for whom detail was not a major concern.

158
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,370
<11-9,SHERLOCK NOSE>我担心你工作也一样马虎
<11-9,SHERLOCK NOSE>I was worriedyou might apply that same standardin your work.

<12-7,HOUSE>if they'll leavefor 50 bucks, they're not all that sick.

170
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,820
<12-9,CUDDY>或者说明他们穷而且敢玩命,所以医院门诊才存在
<12-9,CUDDY>Or they're poorand desperate, which is why this placeis here.

171
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,040

<30-12,FOREMAN>你不会真要这么说吧？
<30-12,FOREMAN>You might not wantto phrase it quite that way.

425
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,030
<30-13,CAMERON>你得让她谈到底怎么出的事
<30-13,CAMERON>You need to get herto talk about what happened.

<30-15,CAMERON>假装一切没发生--
<30-15,CAMERON>Pretending it didn't happen--

428
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,990
<30-16,FOREMAN>现在对她最好就是假装一切都没发生
<30-16,FOREMAN>Wrong.Pretending this didn't happen is the best thingshe could possibly do.

429
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,100
<30-17,CAMERON>得让她正视这一切
<30-17,CAMERON>She's gotta make this real.

<30-18,FOREMAN>你知道我们到底该正视什么吗?
<30-18,FOREMAN>You know what we should be trying to make real or process?

<30-19,CAMERON>也许没错 可她不可能假装没有这件事
<30-19,CAMERON>Maybe you're right,except there's no way she can pretendthis didn't happen.

433
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,080
<30-19,CAMERON>除了正视之外 她别无选择
<30-19,CAMERON>So she has no choicebut to process it.

<36-1,FOREMAN>问题很简单 你的生活是不是一团糟

524
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,200
<34-10,HOUSE>而是在探寻我的生活经历
<34-10,HOUSE>She's asking for my personal life experience

525
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,040
<34-10,HOUSE>好照搬到其他人身上

<38-4,HOUSE>她在身边时我从不犯错
<38-4,HOUSE>I hardly ever screwed upwhen she was around.

<41-6,HOUSE>Just one false step,one crackin the sidewalk.

687
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,180
<41-7,EVE>你没有
<41-7,EVE>You don't really.

688
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,810
<41-8,HOUSE>我是个恶人
<41-8,HOUSE>I'm evil.

689
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,260
<41-9,EVE>恶人不会承认这点
<41-9,EVE>Evil people don't saythey're evil.

690
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,940
<41-10,HOUSE>听上去是个逻辑漏洞
<41-10,HOUSE>That soundslike an easy loophole.

691
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,640
<41-10,HOUSE>人们可以做好事
<41-10,HOUSE>People can do good things.

692
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,080
<41-10,HOUSE>但要是本性就不好
<41-10,HOUSE>But if their instinctsare not good,

693
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,920
<41-10,HOUSE>那只能说不存在上帝,或者他残酷到超乎想象
<41-10,HOUSE>either god doesn't exist or he's unimaginably cruel.

694
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,000
<41-11,EVE>我不信
<41-11,EVE>I don't believe that.

695
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,110
<41-11,EVE>那你信什么?
<41-11,EVE>So what do you believe?

696
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,180
<41-12,HOUSE>你觉得为什么会这样?
<41-12,HOUSE>Why do you thinkthis happened?

697
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,100
<41-13,EVE>我不想谈这个
<41-13,EVE>I don't wantto talk about it.

698
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,120
<41-14,HOUSE>一样
<41-14,HOUSE>Me neither.

699
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,230
<41-14,HOUSE>糟透了
<41-14,HOUSE>Too bad.

700
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,490
<41-15,EVE>我想这没什么原因
<41-15,EVE>You know,I don't thinkthere was a reason.

701
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,560
<41-16,HOUSE>啊 哈 那么存在上帝 他要你被强奸
<41-16,HOUSE>Uh-huh,so god does exist,lets you get raped,

702
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,920
<41-16,HOUSE>还要你毫无由头的留下强奸犯的孩子
<41-16,HOUSE>and needs youto keep your rape baby for no reason.

703
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,970
<41-17,EVE>好吧 或许他在考验我
<41-17,EVE>Well,maybe hewas challenging me.

704
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,300
<41-18,HOUSE>他伤害你 因为想帮你
<41-18,HOUSE>He hurts you to help you.

705
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,660
<41-19,HOUSE>这样的解释好过上帝讨厌你
<41-19,HOUSE>I guess it's better than because he hates you.

706
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,480
<41-20,EVE>你想要我相信没有上帝
<41-20,EVE>You're trying to convince me there's no god.

707
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,220
<41-20,EVE>你为什么非说这种话?
<41-20,EVE>Why would you even saysomething like that?

708
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,800
<41-21,HOUSE>因为你会毁了你的生活
<41-21,HOUSE>Because you'rethrowing your life away.

709
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,390
<41-22,EVE>我在按信仰办事
<41-22,EVE>I'm doing what I believe.

710
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,740
<41-23,HOUSE>你的信仰毫无道理
<41-23,HOUSE>What you believedoesn't make sense.

711
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,040
<41-24,EVE>这样帮不了我
<41-24,EVE>This is not helping me.

712
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,490
<41-25,HOUSE>那么我帮不了你
<41-25,HOUSE>Then I can't help you.

713
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,190
<41-26,HOUSE>如果你相信永恒 那还谈什么生命
<41-26,HOUSE>If you believe in eternity,then life is irrelevant.

714
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,980
<41-26,HOUSE>在宇宙面前 像一只小虫般微不足道
<41-26,HOUSE>The same as a bugis irrelevant in comparisonto the universe.

715
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,020
<41-27,EVE>如果你不相信永恒,那你这一世有什么意义
<41-27,EVE>If you don't believein eternity,then what you do hereis irrelevant.

716
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,610
<41-28,HOUSE>意义在于你如何过这一世
<41-28,HOUSE>Your actions hereare all that matters.

717
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,100
<41-29,EVE>有什么意义!
<41-29,EVE>Then nothing matters.

718
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,170
<41-29,EVE>既然没有终极后果
<41-29,EVE>There's noultimate consequences.

719
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,050
<41-29,EVE>我没法这样过
<41-29,EVE>I couldn't livelike that.

720
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,560
<41-30,HOUSE>所以你要让自己相信,犯事那家伙会遭天谴
<41-30,HOUSE>So you need to think that the guy,who did this to you is gonna be punished.

721
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,330
<41-31,EVE>我需要知道生而有意
<41-31,EVE>I need to know that it all means something.

722
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,680
<41-31,EVE>我需要安慰
<41-31,EVE>I need that comfort.

723
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,410
<41-32,HOUSE>是啊 舒服了吗?
<41-32,HOUSE>Yeah.Are you feeling comfortable?

724
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,730
<41-32,HOUSE>现在舒服了 心里暖暖的?
<41-32,HOUSE>You feeling good right now,feel warm inside?

725
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,510
<41-33,EVE>我被强奸了
<41-33,EVE>I was raped.

726
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,810
<41-33,EVE>你的说辞呢?
<41-33,EVE>What's your excuse?

727
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,580
<42-1,EVE>你觉得犯事那家伙的日子会难过吗?
<42-1,EVE>Do you think the guywho did this to me feels bad?

728
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,210
<42-2,HOUSE>对你有帮助吗?
<42-2,HOUSE>That'd help you?

729
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,090
<42-2,HOUSE>会让你感觉好些吗?
<42-2,HOUSE>It'll make youfeel better?

730
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,580
<42-3,EVE>你干嘛老这样...
<42-3,EVE>Why do you always do that...

731
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,800
<42-3,EVE>总是问我为什么这么问,而不去回答我的问题?
<42-3,EVE>ask why I'm asking questions instead of just answering the question?

732
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,720
<42-4,HOUSE>我对答案不感兴趣
<42-4,HOUSE>Because the answerdoesn't interest me.

733
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,260
<42-4,HOUSE>我不在乎他的感受
<42-4,HOUSE>I don't carewhat he's feeling.

734
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,970
<42-4,HOUSE>我关心你的感觉
<42-4,HOUSE>I'm interestedin what you're feeling.

<42-6,HOUSE>我跟你困在一间房里 是吧?
<42-6,HOUSE>I'm trapped in the roomwith you,right?

<42-7,HOUSE>为什么选了我?
<42-7,HOUSE>Why did you choose me?

738
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,430
<42-7,HOUSE>你身上有些东西
<42-7,HOUSE>There's somethingabout you.

739
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,600
<42-8,EVE>告诉我你也受过伤
<42-8,EVE>It's like you're hurt too.

740
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,810
<42-9,HOUSE>是真的
<42-9,HOUSE>It was truE.

741

<43-2,CUDDY>会没事的
<43-2,CUDDY>She's gonna be okaY.

751
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,680
<43-3,HOUSE>能这么简单就好了
<43-3,HOUSE>Yeah.It's that simple.

<43-3,HOUSE>她说了经过
<43-3,HOUSE>She's talkingabout what happened.

753
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,330
<43-4,CUDDY>很难得 做得好
<43-4,CUDDY>That's huge.You did good.

<43-4,CUDDY>And everyone'll tell you that's whatwe gotta

755
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,410
<43-5,HOUSE>就得让她说出来 对吧?

756
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,570
<43-5,HOUSE>其实我们没帮到她

759
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,600
<43-5,HOUSE>或许我们做到的,只是让一个女孩哭
<43-5,HOUSE>But maybe all we've doneis make a girl cry.
