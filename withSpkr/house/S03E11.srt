<4-2,CHASE>为什么不质疑取证程序?
<4-2,CHASE>Why don't you contest the search ,of the pharmacy records?

59
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,260
<4-3,FOREMAN>你可以辩称他违反医患保密规定
<4-3,FOREMAN>Yeah, you could argue it violated ,doctor-patient confidentiality.

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,920
<4-4,CAMERON>问题是他当时不是病人也非医生
<4-4,CAMERON>Except he wasn't the patient or the doctor.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,700
<4-4,CAMERON>只是个从病人和医生那里偷药的人
<4-4,CAMERON>He was the guy who stole from ,the patient and the doctor.

<4-5,HOUSE>Running into smoke-filled burning buildings ,can be a bit disorienting.

<4-6,CAMERON>他现在不在着火的房子里了,可他还是不停颤抖
<4-6,CAMERON>He's not in a burning building anymore,,and he's still shivering.

<4-7,FOREMAN>下丘脑的肿瘤可能导致体温波动
<4-7,FOREMAN>A hypothalamic tumor could cause ,a vacillating temperature.

68
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,020

<4-8,HOUSE>So could er nurses who are too busy to notice

69
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,070
<4-8,HOUSE>没注意病人喜欢,热咖啡和冰汽水一起喝

<4-10,HOUSE>In case you hadn't noticed,,not exactly in the mood to dance.

<4-12,HOUSE>Ekg showed arrhythmia.

74
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,970

<4-13,CAMERON>没有胸部痛感

76
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,760
<4-13,CAMERON>而且吸入烟雾就能导致心律不齐
<4-13,CAMERON>And smoke inhalation already ,explains the arrhythmia.

77
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,790
<4-14,CHASE>这人在烧伤病房待了6个月,做了一系列手术
<4-14,CHASE>The guy was in the burn unit for six months ,and had multiple surgeries.

78
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,440
<4-14,CHASE>可能是院内感染 MRSA,(耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌)
<4-14,CHASE>Could be a hospital-acquired infection.,Maybe mrsa

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,860
<4-15,HOUSE>我同意

85
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,250
<5-4,CUDDY>律师可没本事说服检查官取消案子,而Tritter可以
<5-4,CUDDY>Your lawyer isn't gonna be able to get the da ,to the drop the case.Tritter caN.

86

<5-6,CUDDY>You are not impressing anyone.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,370

<5-6,CUDDY>You may call yourself principled,

89
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,320
<5-6,CUDDY>但你实际上是个一根筋到底的,不谙世事的白痴

<5-8,CUDDY>you used the rectal thermometer on him.

92
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,730
<5-8,CUDDY>也是你在该道歉的时候羞辱了他
<5-8,CUDDY>You insulted him instead of apologizing.

93
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,590
<5-8,CUDDY>还是你 居然当着他的面磕药
<5-8,CUDDY>You flaunted your drug use in his face.

94

<12-1,CAMERON>Lp was negativefor meningitis.,We're back to square one.

00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,120
<12-4,CAMERON>我们是在乱打乱撞
<12-4,CAMERON>We're throwing darts.

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,670
<12-4,CAMERON>我们得去问House
<12-4,CAMERON>We need to go to house.

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,260
<12-5,FOREMAN>我们要自己解决
<12-5,FOREMAN>We need to deal with this ourselves.

<12-6,CAMERON>他能安排出时间,Derek始终是他的病人
<12-6,CAMERON>He can make the time.,Derek's still his patient.

<12-7,CHASE>I think you of all people would ,want to cut him some slack.

<12-8,CAMERON>他的伤不是自己的错
<12-8,CAMERON>He didn't ask for what's happening to him.

245
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,730
<12-8,CAMERON>哪像House什么都是自找的
<12-8,CAMERON>House did everything to himself.

246

<12-8,CAMERON>别人已经够对他手下留情的了
<12-8,CAMERON>He's been cut more than enough slack.

<13-1,WOMAN>我以为他会挽住我说他理解我
<13-1,WOMAN>I guess I was hoping he'd put his arms ,around me and tell me he understood.

250
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,450
<13-1,WOMAN>但是他却说不能原谅我
<13-1,WOMAN>But he said he wasn't ready to forgive me.

251
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,190
<13-2,THERAPIST>他也许永远不会
<13-2,THERAPIST>he may never be ready.

<13-5,HOUSE>Maybe not a god perse,,but that andre the giant guyw as powerful.

<13-5,HOUSE>放弃自己的意志  臣服于超然力量
<13-5,HOUSE>surrendering my will to this higher power.

<13-6,THERAPIST>If you could do this on your own,,I assume you wouldn't be here.

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
<13-7,HOUSE>是的
<13-7,HOUSE>True.

272

<13-12,CHASE>这个人担心失业,疼却不说
<13-12,CHASE>This guy's worried about losing his job,so he's hiding the pain.

280
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,690
<13-12,CHASE>我们查出痛处或许能找到问题所在
<13-12,CHASE>We find out where the pain is,maybe we find out where the problem is.

281
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,360
<13-13,FOREMAN>或是他根本感觉不到疼
<13-13,FOREMAN>Or he doesn't feel pain.

282
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,090
<13-14,CHASE>不管何种解释 一定有事

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,640
<18-1,AMY>我怎么会引发他的心脏病?
<18-1,AMY>How can I be causing his heart attacks?

340
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,990
<18-2,CAMERON>或学你携带了触发的物质
<18-2,CAMERON>You may be carrying an agent that triggered them.

341
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,320
<18-2,CAMERON>任何东西都可能,霉菌孢子 有毒植物碎屑
<18-2,CAMERON>It could be anything.,Mold spores,poisonous plant residue,

342
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,030
<18-2,CAMERON>从火场带来的一些东西
<18-2,CAMERON>something you picked up at a fire site.

343
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,780
<18-2,CAMERON>除非我们找到这种物质,否则不能让你接近Derek
<18-2,CAMERON>Until we identy the agent,,we can't allow you near derek.

344
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,760
<18-3,AMY>我不敢相信我害他成这样
<18-3,AMY>I can't believe that I'm doing this to him.

345
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,860
<18-4,CAMERON>你不必责备自己
<18-4,CAMERON>You can't blame yourself for this.

346
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,290
<18-5,AMY>你知道他为什么会植皮吗?
<18-5,AMY>You know how he got those skin grafts?

347
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,840
<18-6,CAMERON>他在火场被烧伤
<18-6,CAMERON>He was trapped in a fire.

348
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,350
<18-6,CAMERON>我们在一幢办公大楼清理火灾现场
<18-6,CAMERON>We were clearing rooms in an office building fire,

349
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,840
<18-7,AMY>天花板忽然塌了
<18-7,AMY>and the ceiling collapsed.

350
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,100
<18-7,AMY>把我困在房间内
<18-7,AMY>And it cut me off from the rest of the group.

351
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,070
<18-7,AMY>我大声说自己没事
<18-7,AMY>And I kept yelling that I was fine,

352
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,730
<18-7,AMY>但是Derek等不及救援队来清理残骸
<18-7,AMY>but derek refused to wait for ,the team to clear the debris,

353
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,900
<18-7,AMY>他动身寻找其他进入点
<18-7,AMY>so he took off looking for another access point.

354
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,650
<18-7,AMY>被复燃火烧伤
<18-7,AMY>He got caught in a back draft.

355
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,340
<18-7,AMY>差点因为我而送命
<18-7,AMY>He almost died because of me once.

356
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,340
<18-7,AMY>这次又是因为我
<18-7,AMY>And now it's happening again.

357
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,650
<19-1,HOUSE>你又不是我妈妈
<19-1,HOUSE>You're not my mom.

358
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,970
<19-1,HOUSE>不用老来看我
<19-1,HOUSE>You don't have to keep checking up on me.

359
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,790
<19-2,WILSON>最近如何?
<19-2,WILSON>How you doing?

360
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,500
<19-3,HOUSE>还不错
<19-3,HOUSE>Not bad.

361
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,810
<19-3,HOUSE>我刚意识到自己在这里权势尽失
<19-3,HOUSE>Considering I've just learned ,I'm completely powerless

362
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,960
<19-4,WILSON>看到这整个楼区了吗?
<19-4,WILSON>see this big fancy wing?

363
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,650
<19-4,WILSON>之所以存在就是因为能帮助戒毒
<19-4,WILSON>It was built because this program works.

364
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,040
<19-5,HOUSE>逻辑错误
<19-5,HOUSE>Faulty logic.

365
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,270
<19-5,HOUSE>这个楼区之所以存在,是因为出钱的人认为能帮助戒毒
<19-5,HOUSE>This big fancy wing exists because ,some people with money think that it works.

366
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,860
<19-5,HOUSE>他们以为有钱什么都能买
<19-5,HOUSE>They want to believe they can buy a better world.

367
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,510
<19-5,HOUSE>这简直就是绝望中的幻想
<19-5,HOUSE>This is nothing short of idealized despair.

368
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,380
<19-5,HOUSE>还让其他人也沉浸在这里面
<19-5,HOUSE>Let other people wallow in it.

369
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,060
<19-6,WILSON>我不知道那是什么意思
<19-6,WILSON>I don't even know what that means.

370
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,190
<19-7,HOUSE>这什么都不是
<19-7,HOUSE>None of this means anything.

371
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,260
<19-7,HOUSE>只是空喊口号和陈词滥调
<19-7,HOUSE>It's just nonsensicals logans and platitudes.

372
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,880
<19-8,WILSON>意思是耐心点 不是马上见效
<19-8,WILSON>Meaning takes time.It takes work.

373
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,840
<19-9,HOUSE>你以为我在干吗?
<19-9,HOUSE>What do you think I've been doing?

374
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,810
<19-10,WILSON>你才来这里两天
<19-10,WILSON>You've been here for two days.

375
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,080
<19-10,WILSON>就大谈沉浸在这里
<19-10,WILSON>Talk about wallowing in it.

376
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,240
<19-10,WILSON>我们都清楚
<19-10,WILSON>We all get it.

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,100
<19-10,WILSON>我知道你要忍受多少痛苦
<19-10,WILSON>We know how much pain you have.

378
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,450
<19-10,WILSON>你就是来面对这种痛苦,开始新生活的
<19-10,WILSON>You're here to deal with that ,and get on with your life.

379
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,630
<19-10,WILSON>是啊
<19-10,WILSON>Right.

380
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,680
<19-11,HOUSE>我应该和一个将死的病人搞外遇,然后搬去酒店住
<19-11,HOUSE>I should have an affair with a dying patient ,and move into a hotel.

381
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,580
<19-12,WILSON>你是懦夫 House
<19-12,WILSON>You're a coward, house.

382
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,390
<19-12,WILSON>你总挑别人的毛病,因为你害怕面对自我
<19-12,WILSON>You find fault in everybody,because ,you're afraid to look at yourself.

383
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,930
<19-12,WILSON>多谢
<19-12,WILSON>Thanks.

384
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,000
<19-13,HOUSE>正愁想不出什么陈词滥调
<19-13,HOUSE>I was running short on platitudes.

385
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,670
<19-13,HOUSE>你可以走了
<19-13,HOUSE>You can leave now.

386
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,000
<20-1,CAMERON>我们检测了Amy身上的十几种物质
<20-1,CAMERON>We tested amy for about a dozen different agents,

387
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,440
<20-1,CAMERON>都不是诱因
<20-1,CAMERON>but they all came back negative.

388
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,040
<20-2,DEREK>所以她不是诱因
<20-2,DEREK>So she's not causing the attacks.

389
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,900
<20-3,CAMERON>Derek...  你是不是很爱她?
<20-3,CAMERON>Derek...are you in love with her?

390
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,440
<20-4,DEREK>难道有什么关系吗?
<20-4,DEREK>What does that have to do with anything?

391
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,240
<20-5,CAMERON>Amy告诉我你要植皮的原因了
<20-5,CAMERON>Amy told me how you got those skin grafts.

392
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,090
<20-5,CAMERON>我知道你很照顾她
<20-5,CAMERON>And the way you're always watching out for her.

393
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,990
<20-5,CAMERON>也看见你看她的眼神
<20-5,CAMERON>And I see the way you look at her.

394
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,700
<20-5,CAMERON>你告诉过她吗?
<20-5,CAMERON>Have you told her how you feel?

395
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,410
<20-6,DEREK>她有个六岁大的女儿
<20-6,DEREK>She has a six-year-old daughter.

396
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,930
<20-7,CAMERON>当妈妈照样能恋爱
<20-7,CAMERON>Women with daughters can still fall in love.

397
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,970
<20-8,DEREK>我知道
<20-8,DEREK>I know.

398
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,480
<20-8,DEREK>因为她跟我哥哥相爱了
<20-8,DEREK>Because she did.With my brother.

399
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
<20-8,DEREK>他们订婚了
<20-8,DEREK>They're engaged.

<21-1,CAMERON>伤心综合症
<21-1,CAMERON>broken heart syndrome.

401
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,960
<21-1,CAMERON>他爱上一个人 却受着折磨
<21-1,CAMERON>He's in love,and it's killing him.

402
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,770
<21-2,FOREMAN>我以为只有八十岁的寡妇才会酱紫
<21-2,FOREMAN>Thought that only happened to 80-year-old widows.

403
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,000
<21-3,CAMERON>多亏了他的绝经期还有雌激素水平 ,基本上他就是一个老太太
<21-3,CAMERON>Thanks to his menopause and estrogen level ,he basically is an old woman.

404
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,390
<21-3,CAMERON>Bhs是一种对情感体验的剧烈身体反映
<21-3,CAMERON>Bhs is an acute physical response ,to an emotional experience.

405
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,610
<21-3,CAMERON>压力触发了儿茶酚胺的大量产生
<21-3,CAMERON>Stress triggers a flood of catecholamines

406
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,040
<21-4,CHASE>那是一种很普遍的疲劳原发性心肌症,不是心脏病发作
<21-4,CHASE>that's a plain old stress cardiomyopathy,not a heart attack.

407
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,650
<21-5,CAMERON>但是如果你太担心因为治病
<21-5,CAMERON>But if you're too worried about losing your job

408
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,730
<21-5,CAMERON>失去你的工作 他们就会转变成 ,全方位的心脏病发作
<21-5,CAMERON>to get it treated,they can devolve ,into full-on heart attacks.

409
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,550
<21-5,CAMERON>你觉得在amy订婚的时候发生,这只是一种巧合么
<21-5,CAMERON>You think it's a coincidence this ,started when amy got engaged?

410
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,020
<21-6,HOUSE>不 我不觉得
<21-6,HOUSE>No, I don'T.

411
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,730
<21-6,HOUSE>现在已经知道为什么了,剩下要做的就是如何去解决
<21-6,HOUSE>But now that you know the why,what are you gonna do to stop the how?

412
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,830
<21-7,FOREMAN>我们已经给他注射了β-受体阻滞药 ,和硝化甘油 没有效果
<21-7,FOREMAN>We already put him on beta blockers ,and nitroglycerine,no effect.

413
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,340
<21-8,CAMERON>我们需要给他用抗抑郁剂
<21-8,CAMERON>We need to put him on anti-depressants.

414
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,410
<21-9,HOUSE>除非你是正确的
<21-9,HOUSE>Not if you're right.

415
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,330
<21-9,HOUSE>抗抑郁剂会抑制 ,他的自主神经系统
<21-9,HOUSE>Anti-depressants would inhibit ,his autonomic nervous system

416
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,220
<21-9,HOUSE>那只会加速他的心脏病发作
<21-9,HOUSE>which would only speed up the heart attacks.

417
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,060
<21-10,CHASE>我们可以给他三丙基硫脲嘧啶,(抗甲亢,心绞痛或充血性心力衰竭等的药物)
<21-10,CHASE>We could trypropyl thiouracil.

418
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,570
<21-10,CHASE>降低他的新陈代谢速度
<21-10,CHASE>Slow down his metabolic rate.

419
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,640
<21-11,HOUSE>甲状腺反映只会让心脏变得更脆弱
<21-11,HOUSE>Thyroid effect would only weaken the heart.

420
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,210
<21-12,FOREMAN>那唯一的方法只有用血液稀释剂了
<21-12,FOREMAN>The only other optionis blood thinners.

421
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,070
<21-13,HOUSE>这又不是一个动脉脆弱的肥仔
<21-13,HOUSE>This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled ,arteries and a swollen heart.

422
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,150
<21-13,HOUSE>是他的大脑企图杀死心脏
<21-13,HOUSE>He's a guy whose brain is trying to his heart.

423
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,180
<21-14,CHASE>那就去给他找个女朋友 让他开心点
<21-14,CHASE>So buy him a girlfriend.Make him happy.

424
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,650
<21-15,CAMERON>那只是你眼里的快乐罢了
<21-15,CAMERON>That might make you happy.

425
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,740
<21-15,CAMERON>唯一能让他开心的只有amy
<21-15,CAMERON>The only thing that'll make him happy is amy.

426
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,610
<21-16,CHASE>那就让他离她远点就好了
<21-16,CHASE>So keep him away from her.

427
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,920
<21-17,CAMERON>每次她走进病房他就会心肌梗塞
<21-17,CAMERON>He has a myocardial infarction every time ,she walks in the room.

428
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,650
<21-17,CAMERON>如果我们告诉他以后再也见不到她,你觉得他的心脏会怎么样
<21-17,CAMERON>What do you think will happen to his heart ,when we tell him he can never see her again?

429
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,170
<21-18,CHASE>他需要一个心理医生
<21-18,CHASE>he needs a shrink.

430
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,210
<21-19,FOREMAN>chase的意见跟以往一样出色
<21-19,FOREMAN>Chase's idea is as good as any.

431
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,690
<21-19,FOREMAN>因为要做脑子电击治疗 ,而且还要把amy赶走
<21-19,FOREMAN>Because short of fryingh is brain ,and wiping amy out,

432
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,200
<21-19,FOREMAN>他会崩溃的
<21-19,FOREMAN>he's screwed.

433
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,490
<21-20,HOUSE>找cuddy
<21-20,HOUSE>We need cuddy.

434
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,750

<21-21,FOREMAN>Why?

435
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,260
<21-22,HOUSE>这样你就可以告诉她 为什么,你要去油炸一个男人的脑子
<21-22,HOUSE>So you can tell her why you need to ,fry a guy's brain.

436
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,430
<22-1,CUDDY>他的心脏有问题,而你要电击他的脑子
<22-1,CUDDY>The guy's heart isn't working,and you want to shock his brain.

437

<22-2,HOUSE>Electroshock therapy is the only way ,to erase his memories of amy

438
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,730

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,530
<29-40,CUDDY>Wilson医生提醒我了
<29-40,CUDDY>Dr. Wilson informed me that dr.House already tried

673
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,590
<29-40,CUDDY>House医生想通过这种方式偷止痛药
<29-40,CUDDY>to steal the pain medication of this patient,

674
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,890
<29-40,CUDDY>所以我知道
<29-40,CUDDY>which made clear to me that dr. House was in

675
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,870
<29-40,CUDDY>House医生已经陷入几近绝望的境地
<29-40,CUDDY>a particularly vulnerable and desperate state.

676
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,900
<29-40,CUDDY>于是我去药房把药换了
<29-40,CUDDY>So I went to the pharmacy and I swapped bottles.

677
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,220
<29-40,CUDDY>House拿到的只是一瓶安慰剂
<29-40,CUDDY>Dr. House only got a bottle with placebos.

678
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,360
<29-41,VELEZ>我明白你想保护同事的冲动
<29-41,VELEZ>I understand your impulse to ,protect a valued colleague.

<29-45,VELEZ>如果是真的 为什么不早点拿出来?
<29-45,VELEZ>if this is real, why didn't she mention it earlier?

683
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,310
<29-46,GEMEINER>我提议驳回诉讼
<29-46,GEMEINER>I move to dismiss this case.

<29-49,CUDDY>I guess I never expected it to go this far.
