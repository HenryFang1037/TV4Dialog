<6-2,House>I said,"do u think you can get the da off my back?"

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,100
<6-3,Medicaid guy>她说“不能，但是当你出狱后 你依然有工作”
<6-3,Medicaid guy>And she said,"no. But when you get out of jail, you'll still have a job."

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,000
<6-3,Medicaid guy>我45岁了，放弃了很多
<6-3,Medicaid guy>I'm 45. I've given up a lot

<2-4,Foreman>-那又怎样？我也合格啊 -你不是豪斯
<2-4,Foreman>-So? I'm board certified -You are not house

<2-6,Foreman>如果你觉得我不合格 干嘛让我当负责人?
<2-6,Foreman>Why'd you put me in charge of the department if you think I can't handle it?

39
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,900
<2-7,Cuddy>因为是暂时的，因为有人命令我
<2-7,Cuddy>Because it's temporary, and because I was ordered to

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,800
<2-8,Foreman>-什么症状? -哦，算了吧
<2-8,Foreman>-What are the symptoms? -Oh,come on

41
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,200
<2-9,Cuddy>不见人你就想给诊断 证明你跟豪斯一样棒？
<2-9,Cuddy>You're gonna diagnose him without meeting him? Prove that you're as brilliant as house?

42
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,200
<2-10,Foreman>我得知道症状才能推荐医院
<2-10,Foreman>I need to know the symptoms to know which hospital to recommend

43

<2-12,Foreman>I know a lot of good people in that field seeing as I happen to be a neurologist

46
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,400

<2-13,Cuddy>-You're pouting -Not at all

<2-16,Foreman>-Before he exposes us-- I get it.Famous patient needs famous doctor

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,300
<2-17,Cuddy>-我打给泰勒 -谢谢
<2-17,Cuddy>-I'll call taylor -Thank you

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,200
<2-18,Foreman>要不还是你打给他吧
<2-18,Foreman>Or maybe you should call him

52
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,300
<2-18,Foreman>万一我说了蠢话怎么办?
<2-18,Foreman>What if I say something stupid?

53
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
<2-19,Cuddy>哦，天啊，还是豪斯比较好相处
<2-19,Cuddy>Oh,god.House is easier

<3-1,Chase>-Have you been taking any drugs? -I displaced my function. Accolade

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,100
<3-3,Elizabeth>他过去有规律地饮酒 但戒除已近一年
<3-3,Elizabeth>He used to drink regularly, but he's been clean and sober for nearly a year

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,500
<3-4,Foreman>石先生，你以为自己说话正常 但其实是讲话能力减弱了
<3-4,Foreman>Mr. Stone,you think you're speaking normally,but your speech is impaired

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,700
<3-4,Foreman>他知道自己要说的话 但选择词汇时发生错误
<3-4,Foreman>He knows what he wants to say,but when he reaches for a word, he finds something else

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,800
<3-7,Foreman>对他来说没什么问题
<3-7,Foreman>It all sounds right to him

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,500
<3-7,Foreman>我需要你写下自己的名字 然后画一张脸
<3-7,Foreman>I want you to write your name and draw a face

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,100
<3-8,Cameron>这叫失写症，失去写的能力 多数是暂时性的
<3-8,Cameron>It's called agraphia. oss of ability to write. Most often it's temporary

<3-13,Foreman>Don't give me a sentence.Just say yes or a no.You understand me?

<3-15,Greta>-Elizabeth. Fletch. Is he okay? -We don't know.This is fletch's editor

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,200
<3-17,Greta>斯格塔，我要保证急救报告陈述正确
<3-17,Greta>Greta sims.I wanted to make sure that the emts told you the right story

69
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,400
<3-18,Chase>-有多少陈述啊? -他不是绊倒的，是倒下去了 失去知觉了
<3-18,Chase>-How many stories are there? -He didn't trip.He just fell.Out of the blue

70
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
<3-19,Greta>他的脚先拐了一下，看上去象是绊的
<3-19,Greta>His foot jerked a little bit first.That's what made it look like a trip

71
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,200
<4-1,Stacy>别说，别谈你账单的事 因为没有辩护余地
<4-1,Stacy>don't say anything.Don't attempt to defend your billing practices.Your billing practices are indefensible

72
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,100
<4-3,Stacy>-我们都了断这个了 -如果我真认为你能听进去人话 我就住嘴了
<4-3,Stacy>-We've been over this -If I thought you were capable of listening,I'd shut up

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,900
<4-4,House>那完全没有道理
<4-4,House>That makes no sense at all

74
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,400
<4-5,Medicaid Guy>-下午好 -下午好
<4-5,Medicaid Guy>-Good afternoon -Good afternoon

75
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
<4-7,Medicaid Guy>难易表上有达到五级的情况吗？
<4-7,Medicaid Guy>Every case you have rates a five on the complexity scale?

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,400
<4-8,Stacy>豪斯医生有特殊需要
<4-8,Stacy>Dr. House has a rather specialized practice

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,600
<4-9,Medicaid Guy>好，那我们来完成这个吧
<4-9,Medicaid Guy>Okay. Then let's go through these

78
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,000
<4-10,House>-所有吗? -如果你有午餐聚会，取消吧
<4-10,House>-All of these? -If you have lunch reservations, cancel them

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,400
<4-11,Medicaid Guy>好，病人...
<4-11,Medicaid Guy>All right. Patient...

80
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,700
<5-1,Foreman>如果不是绊倒的，怎么摔的？ 中风？抽搐？
<5-1,Foreman>if he didn't trip, something made him fall. Stoke? Seizure?

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
<5-2,Chase>30个人看见他绊倒了 一个人说不是，你信谁？
<5-2,Chase>30 people saw him trip.One person says he didn't. Who you gonna believe?

82
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,600
<5-3,Cameron>他所有的症状用头外伤都可以解释
<5-3,Cameron>His symptoms can all be explained by the head trauma

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,400
<5-3,Cameron>导致外伤和抽搐，那又导致失语症 该做个脑电图
<5-3,Cameron>Causes a contusion or a seizure.That causes the aphasia. We should get an eeg

84
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,000
<5-5,Chase>-如果是中风，就有凝块问题 -就算是跌倒，药品问题也比较象
<5-5,Chase>-If it was a stroke, it could be a clotting issue -Even if he fell, drug use is far more likely

85
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,500
<5-6,Foreman>-我定一个氧化监视检查 -小蔡，我们还没完成细分呢
<5-6,Foreman>-I'm ordering a tox screen -Chase,we're not done with the differential

86
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
<5-7,Chase>-你不是我的老板 -我是豪斯的老板，豪斯是你的老板
<5-7,Chase>-You're not my boss -I'm house's boss.House is your boss

87
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,200
<5-9,Chase>-简单算数 -是你发我工钱吗?
<5-9,Chase>-The math is pretty simple -Are you signing my paychecks?

88
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
<5-10,Foreman>-雇人炒人归你管么? -这不是那回事儿……
<5-10,Foreman>-Are you hiring or firing? -This is not about that--

89
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,000
<5-11,Chase>唯一需要你督导的是防止豪斯做疯事
<5-11,Chase>the only thing you've been asked to do is supervise house in case he does something insane

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,900
<5-12,Cameron>没准能救人一命
<5-12,Cameron>Which might,you know, save a life

91
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
<5-13,Foreman>-得有人负责啊 -为什么?
<5-13,Foreman>-Somebody's gotta be in charge -Why?

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,900
<5-15,Foreman>你觉得我们可以任意作为吗? 来个诊断比赛
<5-15,Foreman>You think we should all just do whatever we wanna do? Maybe have a race to the diagnosis

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
<5-16,Cameron>我觉得同仁中也该有个商量
<5-16,Cameron>I think it should be a discussion among peers

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,900
<5-16,Cameron>我觉得我们够岁数达成共识了
<5-16,Cameron>I think we're grown up enough to reach a consensus

95
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,100
<6-1,Medicaid guy>病人，62岁，你开了vi的处方
<6-1,Medicaid guy>Patient,62 years old.You prescribed viagra

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,200
<6-1,Medicaid guy>我在史多丽的病例里居然发现了 勃起障碍的处方
<6-1,Medicaid guy>I look in vain for the words erectile dysfunction in the notes for delores smith

97
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
<6-2,House>她心脏有问题
<6-2,House>She had a heart condition

98
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,600
<6-3,Medicaid guy>-你没有硝酸甘油了吗 -她还血压低
<6-3,Medicaid guy>-And you ran out of nitroglycerin? -She also had low blood pressure

99
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,500
<6-4,House>所以硝酸甘油会有危险 而小蓝药片就可以兼顾了
<6-4,House>So nitro would be dangerous.Little blue pills improve blood flow

100
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
<6-4,House>是舒张血管的，所以有时你会头疼
<6-4,House>They're vasodilators.It's why you sometimes get the headaches.

101
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,800
<6-5,Stacy>-我想豪斯医生明白了 -当然
<6-5,Stacy>-I think dr. House understands -of course I do

102
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,000
<6-6,House>-那女人心脏有问题，她得照顾自己 －一个男人无法抓紧他的助手 这是民族的危急时刻
<6-6,House>-The woman has a heart condition she's on her own -A man can't nail his office assistant,it's national crisis time

103
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,200
<6-7,Medicaid guy>你真的认为我们会为 用途外的药品用途付钱么？
<6-7,Medicaid guy>Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication?

104
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,500
<6-8,House>行，我来付，多少钱?
<6-8,House>Fine. I'll pay for it.How much are the pills?

105
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,900
<6-9,Stacy>-她吃了多少? -把钱拿开

<6-12,Stacy>But is he wrong about the pills?

<6-13,Medicaid guy>-我们不认同用途外的处方 -你再有3周就退休了
<6-13,Medicaid guy>-Off-label use is not sanctioned -You're retiring in three weeks

110
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,200
<6-14,Stacy>你干这行都快20年了，难道你对自己 都不认可的管理条例不厌烦吗？
<6-14,Stacy>You've been doing this job nearly 20 years.Aren't you tired of administering policy you disagree with?

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,800

<6-15,Medicaid guy>-I never said I disagree -What can they do to you?

<7-8,Stacy>Your flight leaves at 7:00.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
<7-9,House>你查我背景了吗?
<7-9,House>You did a background check on me?

121
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,300
<7-10,Stacy>我的9点才走，看来你要自己吃饭了
<7-10,Stacy>-And mine doesn't leave till 9:00pm.It looks like you'll be dining alone

122
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,800
<7-11,House>你查了我的班机好确保你自己走
<7-11,House>You checked on my flight so you could be sure to be on a different one

123
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,500
<7-12,Stacy>-我以为我们已经过了回避阶段 -我不觉得会这么快
<7-12,Stacy>-I thought we were past the avoidance stage -I didn't think we'd be finished this soon

<8-1,Foreman>这会显示你的颈动脉是否有凝块
<8-1,Foreman>This will show us if there's a problem with your carotid artery that might cause a blood clot

127
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,500
<8-1,Foreman>如果大脑有，就可以解释失语和跌倒
<8-1,Foreman>If it went to his brain, that could explain the aphasia and the falling down

128
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,100
<8-2,Elizabeth>-你还要做脑电，是同样的用途吗？ -哦，是预防
<8-2,Elizabeth>-And you're giving him an eeg?Is that for the same thing? -Uh,it's just a precaution

129
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,000
<8-3,Cameron>我想外伤导致了问题 得等他稳定会慢慢复原
<8-3,Cameron>I think the trauma caused some swelling, and we need to keep him stable until the body can repair the damage

130
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,500
<8-4,Greta>-而你觉得他俩都错了? -我们涉及全面预防，小心为妙吧
<8-4,Greta>-And you think they're both wrong? -we're just covering all the bases.Being safe

<8-7,Foreman>-Fluid in his lungs -Push 40 iv lasix.

<8-7,Foreman>我们要插管，他失去呼吸功能了
<8-7,Foreman>We need to intubate.He's losing his respiratory drive

134
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,100
<9-1,Foreman>现在有两个症状了，失语和肺部积液 抽搐无法满足两个症状
<9-1,Foreman>and then there were two.Aphasia and fluid in the lungs.Seizure can't cause both

135
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
<9-3,Foreman>-中风也不行 -除非他有反常心率
<9-3,Foreman>-Neither can a stroke -Unless he had an abnormal heart rhythm

136
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,600
<9-4,Chase>还有，尿检显示安非他明阳性
<9-4,Chase>and then there was one.Urine test is positive for amphetamines

<9-5,Foreman>-安非他明不导致肺水肿 -如果抽就会
<9-5,Foreman>-Amphetamines don't cause pulmonary edema -They do if you smoke 'em.

<9-7,Foreman>他的一本书里提到戒酒戒毒 改变人生
<9-7,Foreman>In one of his books he talked about giving up drugs and alcohol, how it changed his life.

139
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,600
<9-8,Chase>所有人都撒谎
<9-8,Chase>Everybody lies

140
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,700
<10-1,Nurse>当他准备倾听的时候 该能看出来他是个嫉妒的类型
<10-1,Nurse>When he started wanting to hear every minute of my day, it should have been a clue he was the jealous type

141
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
<10-1,Nurse>但在两人关系中的那个阶段
<10-1,Nurse>But you know,in that first stage of a relationship

142
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,800
<10-1,Nurse>你身体里充满化学物质 觉得一切都是可爱的
<10-1,Nurse>where it's like your body's full of these chemicals that make you think everything they do is charming--

143
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,100
<10-1,Nurse>啊，对不起
<10-1,Nurse>Ah.Excuse me

<11-2,Wilson>这得打一会儿呢
<11-2,Wilson>This may take a minute

146
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,200
<11-3,House>-失语症先生有什么新进展? -卡迪打电话给你了?
<11-3,House>-so what's new with mr. Aphasia? -Cuddy called you?

147
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
<11-5,House>有人掩护他们的屁股
<11-5,House>Everybody covers their ass

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
<11-6,Wilson>肺水肿，小蔡作了氧化监视 安非他明呈阳性
<11-6,Wilson>Pulmonary edema.Chase did a tox screen.It came back positive for amphetamines

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,700
<11-7,House>-他跳起胜利之舞 -我打赌也有毛病
<11-7,House>-He did the dance of victory -I'm betting there's another shoe

150
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,200
<11-8,Wilson>我以为孩子们不打给你呢
<11-8,Wilson>I thought the kids didn't call you

151
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,700
<11-9,House>我了解你讲故事的路子
<11-9,House>I know the way you tell stories.

152
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,400
<11-10,Wilson>福满找石福莱谈毒品的问题 发现他发烧了
<11-10,Wilson>Foreman went to talk to stone about his drug test,found him running a temperature

153
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,400
<11-11,House>所以不是药的事，节律都错了
<11-11,House>So it's not the drugs.They've just got such a bad rep.

154
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,800
<11-11,House>甜心，你不该那样做
<11-11,House>Honey,you shouldn't do that

155
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,700
<11-12,House>－好，我挂了，他们该找我了 -你没有电话等?
<11-12,House>Okay,I gotta hang up.They're probably trying to reach me -You don't have call waiting?

<11-14,House>-我挂你的电话 -每月五块
<11-14,House>-I'm hanging up on you now -It's $5.00 a month

157
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,500
<12-1,Cameron>药物不导致高烧
<12-1,Cameron>Drugs don't cause fever.

158
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
<12-2,Foreman>脑炎或脑膜炎最可疑 给抗生素吧
<12-2,Foreman>Encephalitis or meningitis are the obvious suspects.Start him on antibiotics

159
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,700
<12-3,Cameron>可能是自体免疫问题 狼疮什么的，我们该给他上类固醇
<12-3,Cameron>It could be an autoimmune disease.Lupus,behcet's. We could start him on a high dose of steroids.

160
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,500
<12-4,Chase>如果他确实有脑炎 类固醇会削弱他的免疫系统
<12-4,Chase>Except if he does have encephalitis, Steroids could weaken his immune system

161
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,700
<12-5,Foreman>-福满 -烧有多高?
<12-5,Foreman>-Foreman -How high a fever?

162
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,300
<12-6,House>把扬声器打开 你干嘛不给我电话呢？
<12-6,House>Put me on speaker phone.And why haven't you called me?

163
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,900
<12-7,Foreman>101.你怎么知道?
<12-7,Foreman>101.How'd you know?

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,700
<12-8,House>怎么？你以为你们这帮孩子父母一走 就开派对，而我不会听说？
<12-8,House>What?You think you guys can have a party as soon as the parents are gone,and I won't hear about it?

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,900
<12-8,House>给上广谱抗生素防止脑膜炎病菌和 滤过性病毒
<12-8,House>Start with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis

166
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,900
<12-8,House>他得的是疱疹脑炎
<12-8,House>and an antiviral in case we luck out, and it's herpes encephalitis

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,200
<12-10,House>-如果是自体免疫怎么办? －那我们就玩完了
<12-10,House>-What if it's autoimmune? -Well,then we're screwed

168
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,500
<12-10,House>所以我们才需要更多资料 有家族遗传么？
<12-10,House>Which is why we need more information.Any genetic issue with the family?

169
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,400
<12-11,Foreman>－他无法谈话，病例很粗略 -他妻子只认识他没几年
<12-11,Foreman>the man can't talk.His medical records are sketchy. -And the wife's only known him a couple of years

170
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,300
<12-13,Foreman>-核磁共振怎样? -Ct 扫描隐形
<12-13,Foreman>-mri show anything? -Ct scan was negative.

171
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,200
<12-14,House>Ct?是短核磁么？
<12-14,House>Ct? That's,like, short for mri,right?

172
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,500
<12-14,House>太好了，能省不少时间
<12-14,House>Excellent.That'll save us a lot of time.

173
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
<12-15,Chase>我们约了20分钟后的核磁，福满只能约 到这了
<12-15,Chase>We've got an mri scheduled in 20 minutes.Earliest foreman could get the machine

174
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,100
<12-16,House>我教了你们骗、撒谎、偷 可我一转脸你们就排起队来了
<12-16,House>I teach you to lie,cheat,and steal, and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line?

175
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,000
<12-16,House>-做核磁，找病例 -他不能说话
<12-16,House>-Get an mri,and get a better medical history -The man can't talk

176
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,100
<12-18,House>谁管？他总归是要说谎的 我的航班晚了一会儿，几小时后到
<12-18,House>Who cares?He's probably gonna lie anyway. My flight's a little late.I'll be back in a few hours.

177
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,500
<12-19,Cameron>你管我们因为你管他？
<12-19,Cameron>So you're in charge of us because you're in charge of him?

178
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,800
<13-1,Chase>-家族病史有神经系统问题吗? -没有
<13-1,Chase>-Any family history of neurological problems? -No

<14-3,Elizabeth>-比湾的高尔夫球会 -不会是高尔夫球会
<14-3,Elizabeth>-It was a golf resort at key biscayne -No way it was a golf resort

185
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,800
<14-3,Elizabeth>对他的了解，我看是他很快喝遍了 能找到的酒吧
<14-3,Elizabeth>Knowing fletch,I assume he was working his way through every bar in the keys

<16-1,Elizabeth>我们订婚时说了，要过不同的日子
<16-1,Elizabeth>When we got engaged, we decided we wanted a different kind of life

192
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,100
<16-1,Elizabeth>他放弃了男性杂志，没了疯狂的机会
<16-1,Elizabeth>And he dropped the macho journalism.No more taking crazy chances

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,100
<16-1,Elizabeth>包括他的身体
<16-1,Elizabeth>That includes his health

194
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,800
<17-1,Greta>他不让我告诉贝兹
<17-1,Greta>he asked me not to tell elizabeth

195
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,500
<17-2,Foreman>他对她隐瞒了药品习惯?
<17-2,Foreman>He's been lying to her about his drug habit?

196

<17-3,Greta>是也不是，在婚前，他老用药
<17-3,Greta>Well,yes and no.Be--before elizabeth-- he used drugs recreationally

197
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,300
<17-3,Greta>我不喜欢，但就是那哆哆嗦嗦的行为 才使他有今天的声望
<17-3,Greta>I wasn't crazy about it, but that thrill-seeking behavior is what made him the kind of journalist that he was

198
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,800
<17-5,Greta>-现在呢? -他为她痴迷
<17-5,Greta>-And now,ae? -The man's twisted himself into knots for her

199

<17-7,Greta>他的新式乡村生活没有刺激 使他难受
<17-7,Greta>His new suburban lifestyle.Lack of excitement was throwing him off

203
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
<17-8,Foreman>所以就吃安眠药
<17-8,Foreman>So he started with sleeping pills

204
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,600
<17-9,Greta>被它们击倒后他需要在白天时提神
<17-9,Greta>When they knocked him out, he needed something to perk him back up during the day

<19-1,Foreman>There's a little edema.Brain swelling.And an area of scarring

209
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,800
<19-2,Elizabeth>-是失语的成因吗? -其实，那很奇怪
<19-2,Elizabeth>-Is that what's causing the aphasia? -Actually,that's what's odd

210
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,500
<19-3,Foreman>疤痕并不在导致失语的区域之内
<19-3,Foreman>The scarring's not in the area of the brain normally associated with conduction aphasia.

211
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,300
<19-3,Foreman>而且是旧伤，撞头之前就有
<19-3,Foreman>And it's old.Happened before he hit his head

212
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,300
<19-3,Foreman>也许是一次小的中风或其他情况 也许根本无关
<19-3,Foreman>Maybe a small stroke or some other underlying condition that cou be causing this, or it might have nothing to do with it at all

213
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
<19-3,Foreman>以前有过头外伤吗？事故？
<19-3,Foreman>Have you ever had head trauma before?An accident?

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
<19-3,Foreman>过去有过一侧麻痹吗?
<19-3,Foreman>You ever had any numbness on one side before?

215
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,300
<19-4,Fletcher>-头晕? -！@#￥％?
<19-4,Fletcher>-Dizziness? -What is the durable?

<20-1,House>Got you some coffee

<21-2,Chase>If it's meningitis, we have to id the bug fast

<21-2,Chase>-We need to do a lumbar puncture -I'm not doin lp with this edema

<21-4,Cameron>-可能会导致瘫痪 -豪斯怎么说?
<21-4,Cameron>-We could paralyze him -What does house say?

224
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,300
<21-5,Foreman>"你所拨打的用户已关机或超过服务区"
<21-5,Foreman>"The person you're trying to reach is out of the area or has turned off their phone."

225
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,700
<21-6,Chase>那你的意思呢?
<21-6,Chase>So what are your orders?

<21-11,Cuddy>-How's the patient? -Fine

232
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,700
<22-1,House>当人们展示自己时是通过小事情看的
<22-1,House>when people give themselves away, it's by little things

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,300
<22-1,House>那边的那个女人，她不是看不起咖啡 她正从面瘫康复中
<22-1,House>That woman over there, she's not sneering at her coffee.She's recovering from bell's palsy

234

<22-1,House>咖啡馆收费的女人不想让人知道 可她就快因als死去了
<22-1,House>The cashier at the coffee place, she doesn't want anyone to know, but she's dying of als

235
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
<22-1,House>她的手臂那种特定的僵硬方式是证明
<22-1,House>There's a particular sort of twitchy stiff arm that's characteristic

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
<22-1,House>然后是你
<22-1,House>And then there's you

237
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,200
<22-1,House>干嘛带十字架?
<22-1,House>Why aren't you wearing your cross?

238
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,900
<22-3,House>-我告诉你…… -你把首饰清洗剂放在水槽边 就是为了能整天带着它
<22-3,House>-I told you,I left it at-- -you keep jewelry cleaner under the sink so you won't have to go a day without it

239
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,700
<22-3,House>对，可你忘了早晨水管爆了
<22-3,House>True,you forgot it that morning the pipes burst

240
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,900
<22-3,House>可你又涉水回去找到了
<22-3,House>But then you went back and waded through the flood to retrieve it

241
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,600
<22-3,House>那干嘛今天不带?
<22-3,House>So why no wading today?

242
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,600
<22-4,Stacy>你就不带本书看什么的么？
<22-4,Stacy>Didn't you bring a book to read or something?

243
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,800
<23-1,Foreman>没
<23-1,Foreman>Nothing

244
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,500
<23-2,Foreman>咖啡因、安非他明 他跟我们说用的一样
<23-2,Foreman>Caffeine pills and amphetamines.Same stuff he told us he was taking

245
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,700
<23-3,Chase>和联苯酚
<23-3,Chase>And topamax

246
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,600
<23-4,Foreman>抗惊厥药？他说没有抽搐病史？
<23-4,Foreman>An anti-convulsant?He said there was no history of prior seizure

247
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,200
<23-5,Chase>甚至不是开给他的
<23-5,Chase>It's not even prescribed to him

248
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,100
<23-6,Foreman>-还是无法解释高烧，也许是减肥的吧 -再给我们个谎言吧
<23-6,Foreman>-Still doesn't explain his fever.Probably just using it for weight loss -Just gives us another lie

249
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,100
<23-7,Chase>他真有献身精神 是不是该查他家啊?
<23-7,Chase>He must really be devote. should we check the home?

250
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,500
<23-8,Foreman>如果他要瞒着他的妻子 干嘛不把东西藏办公室啊?
<23-8,Foreman>If he wanted to hide something from his wife, why wouldn't he hide it in the office?

251
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,400
<23-9,Chase>也许她要隐瞒什么
<23-9,Chase>Maybe she's hiding something

252
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,600
<23-10,Chase>浴室只有阿斯匹林和感冒药
<23-10,Chase>Nothing but aspirin and flu meds in the bathroom

253
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,100
<23-11,Foreman>这东西好像搁这好几个星期了
<23-11,Foreman>Looks like this stuff's been sitting here for weeks

254
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,400
<23-12,Chase>嗯，家庭改进，他大概以为可以继续
<23-12,Chase>hmm,home improvement.He probably thought he could take the project on

255
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,400
<23-12,Chase>后来意识到超过他的能力
<23-12,Chase>then realized it was a little more than he could handle

256
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,600
<23-13,Foreman>你要说重点，还是想 给个非医学的、冗长的无聊演讲？
<23-13,Foreman>You got a point to make, or did you just feel like giving a long, unnecessary explanation for something medically irrelevant?

257
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
<23-14,Chase>永远有答案的福满怎么了?
<23-14,Chase>What happened to the foreman who always has an answer?

258
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,200
<23-14,Chase>那个老挂着牌子“我跟豪斯一样棒， 可比他友善”的家伙
<23-14,Chase>The guy who practically wears a sign saying,"I'm as good as house, but I'm nicer."

259
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,900
<23-16,Chase>-我没那么说 －我猜有他在那反驳你 会更安全和自信吧
<23-16,Chase>-I never said that -I guess it's safe to be confident when house is there to overrule you

260
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,200
<23-16,Chase>-现在全靠你了? -是不一样了，是的
<23-16,Chase>-Now that it's all on you? -It's different. Yeah.

261
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,100
<23-17,Foreman>106航班去那维延误...
<23-17,Foreman>Flight 106 to Nashville has been delayed...

262
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,500
<23-18,House>你是故意不带的
<23-18,House>either you left it behind on purpose or by mistake.

263
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,100
<23-18,House>而你故意不带的意思是 它对你已经没有意义了
<23-18,House>The only reason you'd leave it behind intentionally is if it no longer meant anything to you

264
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,300
<23-18,House>而那是你妈妈的礼物 意思是你跟她吵架了
<23-18,House>But since it was a gift from your mom, that would mean you had a fight with her

265
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,800
<23-18,House>而你又不能跟鬼说话，所以也不是
<23-18,House>And since you don't talk to ghosts,that's unlikely

266
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
<23-19,Stacy>-算了，格里 -对，那我很在行
<23-19,Stacy>-Leave it alone,greg -Yeah,m good at that

267
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
<23-20,House>那么忘记就不是故意的
<23-20,House>So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally

268
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,000
<23-20,House>那我们又要解释为什么你没回去取
<23-20,House>But then we have to explain why you didn't go back for it when you realized

269
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,700
<23-21,Stacy>-我到了机场才发现 -不对，你到机场时化装了
<23-21,Stacy>-I didn't realize until I got to the airport -Nope,you were wearing makeup when you got to the airport

270
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,400
<23-22,House>你无法不看自己就化装
<23-22,House>You can't put on makeup without looking at yourself

271
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
<23-22,House>你看自己而没摸那个东西也不可能
<23-22,House>You can't look at yourself without touching that thing

272
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,600
<23-23,Stacy>-为什么这干你的事? -这不寻常，不寻常的事打扰到我
<23-23,Stacy>-Why does this matter to you? -It's an anomaly.Anomalies bug me

273
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,300
<23-25,Stacy>那你就难受着吧
<23-25,Stacy>Then you're gonna suffer

274
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
<23-26,Elizabeth>-我看是他的胃 -！@#￥％
<23-26,Elizabeth>-I think it's his stomach -I teal indigent

275
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,000
<23-28,Cameron>-是吃的东西的问题吗? -他老那样
<23-28,Cameron>-Is it something you ate? -He keeps doing that

276
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,400
<23-30,Elizabeth>！@#￥％
<23-30,Elizabeth>I teal indigent

277
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,000
<23-32,Elizabeth>-你饿吗? -不
<23-32,Elizabeth>-Are you hungry? -No

278
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
<23-34,Cameron>-他疼，是刺痛吗? -不
<23-34,Cameron>-He's in pain.Is it a sharp pain? -No!

279
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,100
<23-34,Cameron>！@#￥％
<23-34,Cameron>Teal indigent!

280
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
<23-36,Cameron>-味道 -对
<23-36,Cameron>-Taste -Yes!

281
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,400
<23-38,Cameron>-金属味? -对
<23-38,Cameron>-Uh,metallic taste? -Yes!

282
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
<23-40,Cameron>我马上回来
<23-40,Cameron>I'll be right back

283
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,000
<23-41,House>我猜也许是钩子断了
<23-41,House>I suppose it's also possible that the clasp broke

284
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,800
<23-41,House>-但那样你会带着它放包里 -我们打了一架
<23-41,House>-But then you'd be carrying the thing around in your purse -We had a fight

285
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,600
<23-42,Stacy>我们打了一架，我很生气没顾上 没化装也没带十字架
<23-42,Stacy>We had a fight,and I was angry and not thinking straight. And I walked out without my makeup and without my cross

286
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,500
<23-42,Stacy>我在杂货铺买的化妆品，可没买十字架 因为他们没有卖护身符的
<23-42,Stacy>And I stopped at the drugstore to buy makeup, but I couldn't buy a cross because they don't have an aisle for personal talismans!

287
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,800
<23-43,House>你打架了，会淡忘的
<23-43,House>So you had a fight.I'm sure it'll blow over

288
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,300
<23-44,Stacy>-什么都不为 -当然
<23-44,Stacy>-It was about nothing -Of course it was

289
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,200
<23-45,House>马克累了，他和担心 他缺乏灵活性
<23-45,House>Mark's tired.He's worried.He's got mobility problems

290
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
<23-45,House>他常为小事烦恼
<23-45,House>It's normal to blow up over little things

291
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,300
<23-46,Stacy>我不在乎为小事还是大事而吵
<23-46,Stacy>I don't mind fighting over little things.And I don't mind fighting over big things

292
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,000
<23-46,Stacy>那我可以理解，可我们没来由争吵
<23-46,Stacy>That I could understand.But we fight over nothing

293
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
<23-46,Stacy>你知道，邮箱写“截止下午5点”
<23-46,Stacy>You know,a mailbox with a sign that says "last pickup 5:00 P.M."

294
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,900
<23-46,Stacy>你知道那是截止送到邮局的时间 还是截止从邮局寄出的时间
<23-46,Stacy>Does that mean last pickup to go to the post office or last pickup to leave the post office and be sent out of town?

295
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,300
<23-48,Stacy>-你们为邮递时间吵架? -我尝试放弃话题，可他做不到
<23-48,Stacy>-You fought over mail delivery? -I tried to get him to drop the subject,but he wouldn't

296
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
<23-48,Stacy>我跟他说他是对的 他觉得我是在屈就他
<23-48,Stacy>I told him he was right, he thought i was being condescending

297
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,600
<23-49,House>你是的
<23-49,House>You were

298
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
<23-50,Stacy>-他把我从他生命中驱赶走 -也许你曲解了
<23-50,Stacy>-He's pushing me out of his life -Or maybe you're misinterpreting

299
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
<23-52,Stacy>我曲解你了么？至少我现在注意到了
<23-52,Stacy>Did I misinterpret with you?At least this time i recognize it

300
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,400
<23-52,Stacy>那样你就可以接受一个说法 两个你爱的男人，离开你更好
<23-52,Stacy>That's the benefit of convincing the only two men you've ever loved, they're better off without you

301
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,300
<23-53,House>对，都是你的错
<23-53,House>Yeah.It's all your fault

302
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,000
<23-53,House>你知道“史黛西”在原始希腊语的意思 就是亲密关系杀手
<23-53,House>You know,"stacy" in the original greek means relationship killer

303
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,500
<23-54,Stacy>我要去洗个脸让自己看起来更象成年人
<23-54,Stacy>I'm gonna go wash my face so I look like a grown-up again

304
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,800
<23-55,Stacy>喂，是你的电话
<23-55,Stacy>Hello.It's for you

305
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,100
<24-1,Wilson>-豪斯 -你知道你的电话死了么?
<24-1,Wilson>-House -Do you know your phone's dead?

306
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,600
<24-2,House>-你就不能充电么? -可以充电？我一直都在买新手机？
<24-2,House>-Do you ever recharge your batteries? -they recharge?I just keep buying new phones

307
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,700
<24-3,Wilson>我想你该知道你那失语的病人 嘴里有金属味道
<24-3,Wilson>I thought you should know your aphasia guy is tasting metal

308
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,300
<24-5,Wilson>-他的肌胺酸钎在哪里? -6.8，他肾衰了
<24-5,Wilson>-Where's his creatinine? -6.8.He's got kidney failure

309
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,300
<24-5,Wilson>卡麦伦给他做透析了 目前稳定
<24-5,Wilson>Cameron's got him on dialysis, and he's stable for the moment

310
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
<24-5,Wilson>不象卡迪，要自杀的模样
<24-5,Wilson>Unlike cuddy,who's suicidal

311
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,200
<25-1,Foreman>不是脑炎就是脑膜炎 也可能是自体免疫
<25-1,Foreman>It's either meningitis or encephalitis.Or maybe autoimmune

312
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,600
<25-2,Cuddy>太好了，好像一个午餐你就找到方向了
<25-2,Cuddy>That's perfect. Seems like you really narrowed it down over dinner

313
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,700
<25-3,Chase>-计划是这样的，我们跟豪斯谈…… -试了，他不接
<25-3,Chase>-Here's the plan.We talk to house-- -been trying.He's not answering his cell

314
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,200
<25-4,Foreman>无疑要做腰椎穿刺，没选择了
<25-4,Foreman>It's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture.There's no choice anymore

315
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,900
<25-5,House>-你得做的准确无误 -你说什么?
<25-5,House>-you have to do it just right -What are you talking about?

316
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,500
<25-6,Foreman>不管是否做椎刺
<25-6,Foreman>Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture

317
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,400
<25-7,House>或是向我开火我就不能向你们开火 一旦我回来掌握大局
<25-7,House>or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge

318
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,000
<25-8,Cuddy>-卡迪在那咆哮呢吗? -如果我知道你会失去联系……
<25-8,Cuddy>-Is cuddy there ranting? -If I'd known you'd be out of contact--

319
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,400
<25-10,Cuddy>-他们能应付 -是啊，目前只有三个器官系统失灵
<25-10,Cuddy>-they can handle it -Right,so far only three organ systems have failed

320
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,000
<25-11,House>好吧，他们不行，没关系，那家伙没 稳定到能移动，回自己的办公室咆哮吧
<25-11,House>okay,they can't.Doesn't matter.The guy's not stable enough to move.So go rant in your own office

321
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,400
<25-12,Cuddy>好，完事给我电话
<25-12,Cuddy>Fine.Call me when you're done

322
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,000
<25-13,Chase>你说做LP是什么意思？我们不会搞砸的
<25-13,Chase>What do you mean by doing the lp just right?We're not gonna screw it up

323
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,400
<25-14,House>麻烦的是那家伙知道我们不知道的事
<25-14,House>The odds are this guy knows something we dont.

324
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,300
<25-15,Foreman>就算他知道生命的真谛 也无法交流
<25-15,Foreman>He could know the answer to the meaning of life.The man can't communicate

325
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,100
<25-16,House>－有没有他想透露重要情况的迹象 －没有
<25-16,House>-have you had any indication that he's tried to communicate something important?   -No

326
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,300
<25-18,House>那是因为你们没把他吓到 我肯定你们是“我们会照顾你的”那样
<25-18,House>That's because you guys haven't scared him enough. I'm sure you've been all, "we'll take real good care of you."

327
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,400
<25-18,House>那他干嘛要说？等你们做试验的时候 跟他说他快死了
<25-18,House>Why should he say anything?When you prep him, tell him he's gonna die

328
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,200
<25-18,House>砸烂所有希望，别让卡麦伦去，卡迪
<25-18,House>Crush all hope. Don't let cameron do it.Cuddy.

329
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,100
<25-18,House>有问题么？
<25-18,House>You got a problem with any of that?

330
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,100
<26-1,Foreman>你会做椎刺，但别抱希望
<26-1,Foreman>You're scheduled for a lumbar puncture. But you shouldn't count on that having the answers

331
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,600
<26-1,Foreman>-如果你先生继续下滑…… -会死的
<26-1,Foreman>-If your husband continues to decline... -you'll die

332
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,900
<26-2,Chase>是否有什么要告诉我们的...
<26-2,Chase>If there's anything you haven't told us...

333
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
<26-3,Cameron>你的姿势怎样?
<26-3,Cameron>how you holding up?

334
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,000
<26-3,Cameron>我知道你刚听说的东西很可怕，但...
<26-3,Cameron>I know what you just heard is scary as hell,but...

335

<27-5,Stacy>哦，对，我忘了你没法背着走的
<27-5,Stacy>Oh,that's right, I forget it's hard for you to carry and walk

342

<27-5,Stacy>看到坏天气我在机场酒店定了房 最后一间了
<27-5,Stacy>I booked a room at the airport hotel when iaw how bad the weather was.It's the last one available

<27-10,House>Does mark know about this?

348
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,700
<27-11,Stacy>马克知道当坏事发生时我总有逃生计划
<27-11,Stacy>Mark knows when things are bad, I always like to have an escape route planned

349
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,400
<28-1,House>我非得知道发生啥事了？
<28-1,House>I have to know what's going on here.

350
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:21,200
<28-1,House>你跟马克吵架了，你又躲避我 我就想……
<28-1,House>When you have a fight with mark and you try to avoid me, I have to think that--

351
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,700
<28-2,Stacy>我感觉受攻击，不想离你近 因为那会导致什么事发生
<28-2,Stacy>that I'm feeling vulnerable and I don't wanna be around you because it might lead to something

352
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:33,900
<28-4,Stacy>-对，可然后是酒店房间... -也会导致事情发生
<28-4,Stacy>-Right.But then a hotel room... -might also lead to something

<28-5,House>那么是哪个呢?
<28-5,House>So which is it?

<28-7,House>真好的毒品?
<28-7,House>really good drugs?

356
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,300
<28-8,Stacy>不，象咖喱肉粉

<28-11,House>我知道，所以我觉得不是成瘾
<28-11,House>I know what it is.I didn't think it was addictive

359
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,700
<28-12,Stacy>你又烦人又来势凶猛，象……
<28-12,Stacy>You're abrasive and annoying and come on way too strong,like--

360
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,300
<28-12,Stacy>咖喱肉粉，如果你喜欢咖喱 那也不错啊
<28-12,Stacy>vindaloo curry.When you're crazy about curry, that's fine

361

<28-12,Stacy>But no matter how much you love curry, you have too much of it

362
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,000
<28-12,Stacy>都会把你的嘴掀开 让你好久好久都不想看见它
<28-12,Stacy>it takes the roof of your mouth of and then you never wanna see curry for a really, really long time

363
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,200
<28-12,Stacy>但当有一天你醒来，发现……
<28-12,Stacy>But you wake up one day and you think...

<29-14,Foreman>Now all we need is the english-aphasiac dictionary

381
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,100
<29-15,House>失语症患者会试图 找最靠近的意思来表达
<29-15,House>A fluent aphasiac retrieves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants

382

<29-15,House>会说成label，或椅子，没法猜
<29-15,House>he could say label or he could say chair,or he could just say jabberwocky.There's no way to tell

384
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,900
<29-16,Cameron>他还说, "they took my stain."
<29-16,Cameron>He also said, "they took my stain."

<29-17,House>等一下

<30-5,Elizabeth>他快因感染而死了 你们还玩文字游戏?
<30-5,Elizabeth>He's dying from some kind of infection,and you all are playing word games?

394
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,900
<30-6,Cameron>还有什么没说的吗?
<30-6,Cameron>Is there anything else you haven't told us?

395
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,100
<30-8,Foreman>我们再试一次
<30-8,Foreman>l-let's start this again

<32-1,House>-you must have gotten one new phrase out of him -Something

399
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,700
<32-2,Foreman>我们跟他聊好几个小时了 可能他已经放弃了
<32-2,Foreman>We've been talking to him for hours.Maybe he's just given up

400
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,400
<32-3,House>你确定已经告诉我所有 在他办公室或家里发现的东西了么？
<32-3,House>You sure you told me everything you found at his home and office?

401
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,900
<32-5,Foreman>-不，我们有所隐瞒 -也许不是韵或同义词
<32-5,Foreman>-No,we're hiding something -Maybe it's not a rhyme or a synonym

402
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,200
<32-6,Chase>还有什么？你认为我们该开始瞎猜吗？
<32-6,Chase>What else is there?You think we should just start guessing randomly?

403
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,200
<32-7,Cameron>也许豪斯错了
<32-7,Cameron>Maybe house is wrong.

404
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,400
<32-8,House>希望那不是思维的终结
<32-8,House>Hope that's not the end of the thought

<32-9,Cameron>小蔡给他做核磁的时候 他就提到过“stain”
<32-9,Cameron>he mentioned stain once before when chase was giving him the mri

406
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,700
<32-9,Cameron>-在我们吓唬他之前 -是吗?
<32-9,Cameron>-Before we scared him -He did?

407
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,300
<32-11,Cameron>在你笔记里
<32-11,Cameron>It's in your notes

408
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,800
<32-12,Chase>那么他只在核磁和椎刺时说过话？
<32-12,Chase>so he only talks during mris and lumbar punctures?

409
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,100
<32-12,Chase>-你的理论是他只在针对着他时才说话… -只要他太太不在才说话
<32-12,Chase>-Your theory is he can only talk with a needle in his back or-- -or when his wife's not in the room

410
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,300
<32-13,Cameron>越投入，谎言越多
<32-13,Cameron>The more devoted, the more reason to lie
