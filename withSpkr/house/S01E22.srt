1
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,290
<1-1,House>-我要走了  -别走  他会来的
<1-1,House>- I gotta go. - No, no. He'll be here.

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,950
<1-2,Stacy>我保证他只是迟到一会儿而已
<1-2,Stacy>I'm sure he's just running a little late.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,570
<1-3,House>他取消过两次检查了  他不会...
<1-3,House>He's canceled two exams. He's not gonna...

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,980
<1-4,Stacy>-他怕你  -自然
<1-4,Stacy>- He's scared of you. - Sure.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,450
<1-5,House>害怕老婆玩过的男人  有道理
<1-5,House>The ex-boy toy. Yeah, that makes sense.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,130
<1-6,Stacy>-他以前不怕你的  -是啊
<1-6,Stacy>- He wasn't scared before. - Right.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,930
<1-7,House>你认为怕我是某严重小恙的症状之一吗
<1-7,House>You think being afraid of me is a symptom of a serious ailment?

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,910
<1-8,Stacy>突发情绪波动  回归幼稚心态  腹痛
<1-8,Stacy>Sudden mood swings, infantile regression, abdominal pain.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,810
<1-8,Stacy>他还昏厥过两次
<1-8,Stacy>He's passed out twice.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,910
<1-8,Stacy>是的  我觉得他可能是生病了
<1-8,Stacy>Yeah, I think it might be a medical problem.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,220
<1-9,House>-他迟到20分钟  我要走了  -拜托
<1-9,House>- He's 20 minutes late. I'm out of here. - Please.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,340
<1-10,Stacy>-他会来的  -凭什么这么肯定
<1-10,Stacy>- He'll be here. - Why?

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,010
<1-11,House>因为他爱你  你说的话他都会听
<1-11,House>Because he loves you and does everything he's told?

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,980
<1-12,Stacy>因为我没告诉他你要来
<1-12,Stacy>Because I didn't tell him you'd be here.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,780
<1-13,House>-他喜欢能看见   -是啊
<1-13,House>- He likes to see. - Yes, he does.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,610
<1-14,Stacy>史黛西
<1-14,Stacy>Stace?

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,780
<1-15,Mark>怎么回事
<1-15,Mark>What's going on?

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,380
<1-17,House>你好  我是格雷戈·豪斯  你一定是马特
<1-17,House>Hi. I'm Greg House. You must be Matt.

19
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,000
<1-18,Stacy>-是马克  -马克·华纳  不必起来
<1-18,Stacy>- Mark. - Mark Warner. Don't get up.

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,890
<1-19,Mark>- 抱歉  开家长会  -没关系
<1-19,Mark>- Sorry. Parent conferences. - It's okay.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,960
<1-21,Mark>格雷戈·豪斯
<1-21,Mark>Wow. Greg House.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,620
<1-22,House>不是有意躲你
<1-22,House>No, I haven't been avoiding you.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,330
<1-23,Mark>我只是不想浪费你的时间
<1-23,Mark>I just didn't want to waste your time.

24
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,290
<1-23,Mark>其他医生给我检查过了  压力太大而已
<1-23,Mark>The other doctors checked me out. They said it was just stress.

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,900
<1-23,Mark>开始报考大学了  学生和家长都围着我
<1-23,Mark>College season. Kids, parents... they're all over me.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,820
<1-24,House>可以理解
<1-24,House>Makes sense to me.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,370
<1-26,House>-格雷戈  -不然你要我怎么做
<1-26,House>- Greg. - What do you want me to do?

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,370
<1-27,Stacy>你说会给他做检查
<1-27,Stacy>You said you'd check him out.

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,720
<1-28,House>他自称健康  有什么好检查的
<1-28,House>He says he's healthy. What's to check out?

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,930
<1-29,Mark>给你添麻烦了
<1-29,Mark>Sorry for the mix-up,

31
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,920
<1-29,Mark>不过你们有机会叙叙旧我很高兴
<1-29,Mark>but I'm glad you two got a chance to catch up.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,590
<1-29,Mark>-你们看起来聊得很开心  -真是高手
<1-29,Mark>- Looks like you're having fun. - Oh, he's good.

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,540
<1-30,House>装真诚能这么像  其他更不用说
<1-30,House>If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything.

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,000
<1-30,House>我对你老公的景仰无以言表了
<1-30,House>I can't tell you how much I like your fella.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,540
<1-31,Mark>彼此彼此
<1-31,Mark>Yeah, me too.

36
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,580
<1-31,Mark>你看  我就知道你会挖苦我
<1-31,Mark>You know, I thought you'd be all sarcastic.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,680
<1-31,Mark>还铆足了劲儿  因为我娶了史黛西
<1-31,Mark>Bitter, you know, because Stacy married me.

38
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,400
<1-32,House>我们该一起出去玩
<1-32,House>We should do things together.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,750
<1-32,House>打打球什么的  男人的娱乐
<1-32,House>Maybe throw a ball around or something. Guy stuff.

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,230
<1-33,Mark>我们可以一起去跑跑步[讽刺豪斯瘸腿]
<1-33,Mark>We could go for a run together.

41
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,240
<1-34,House>真有奥斯卡·王尔德范呀
<1-34,House>Ah! It's Oscar Wilde.

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,040
<1-35,Stacy>看你们争风吃醋我真是开心
<1-35,Stacy>This pissing contest is really turning me on.

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,560
<1-35,Stacy>他需要去医院
<1-35,Stacy>He needs to go to the hospital.

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,520
<1-36,House>敬女人  忍不了  杀不得
<1-36,House>Here's to women. Can't live with 'em, you can't kill 'em

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,730
<1-36,House>总不能告诉邻居她去大西洋城跳脱衣舞了
<1-36,House>and tell the neighbors they're stripping in Atlantic City.

47
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,750
<1-37,Mark>太对了
<1-37,Mark>Damn straight.

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,340
<1-39,Mark>-我比你高  -我头发比你多
<1-39,Mark>- I'm definitely taller. - I have more hair.

49
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,890
<1-39,Mark>而且我认为...
<1-39,Mark>And I think that...

50
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,510
<1-40,Stacy>马克
<1-40,Stacy>Mark?

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,680
<1-41,Paramedic>-有人叫急救车去普波教学医院吗  -这里
<1-41,Paramedic>- Someone call 911 for a wagon to Princeton Plainsboro? - Garson!

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,830
<1-41,Paramedic>-怎么回事  -不要紧的
<1-41,Paramedic>- What happened? - It's okay,

53
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,080
<1-42,House>女士们先生们  不必担心
<1-42,House>ladies and gentlemen. Nothing to worry about.

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,890
<1-42,House>-除非你们也吃了小牛肉  -你给他下药了
<1-42,House>- Unless you had the veal. - You dosed him.

55
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,470
<1-27,Stacy>我答应你要给他检查嘛
<1-27,Stacy>I told you I'd check him out.

56
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,370
<1-44,House>我还有点担心救护车会在他晕倒之前赶来呢
<1-44,House>I was a little worried they were gonna get here before he passed out.

57
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,110
<1-44,House>那样骗他喝酒就更难了
<1-44,House>Would have been tougher to get him to drink.

58
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,140
<1-44,House>你可以搭我的车  我们谈谈
<1-44,House>I'll give you a ride. We can talk.

59
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,000
<2-1,Cameron>肚子痛  脾气暴躁  没有明显病因
<2-1,Cameron>A tummy ache, cranky... no apparent source.

60
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,010
<2-1,Cameron>有何见解
<2-1,Cameron>Any thoughts?

61
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,550
<2-1,Cameron>福曼  有话要说吗
<2-1,Cameron>Foreman, you're gonna contribute,

62
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,110
<2-1,Cameron>还是你偷车偷累了
<2-1,Cameron>or are you too tired from stealing cars?

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,010
<2-1,Cameron>我在模仿豪斯  不好笑吗
<2-1,Cameron>I'm being House. It's funny.

64
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,320
<2-2,Foreman>好笑  我笑得牛奶都从鼻子里喷出来了
<2-2,Foreman>I know. You made milk come out of my nose.

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,620
<2-3,House>早  你们拿到病历了吗  什么问题
<2-3,House>Morning. You guys got the file. What's wrong?

66
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,990
<2-4,Cameron>之前的测验没有发现
<2-4,Cameron>Previous tests revealed nothing

67
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,400
<2-4,Cameron>任何可能引起腹部疼痛和情绪变化的问题
<2-4,Cameron>that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.

68
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,540
<2-5,House>那我们的工作完成了
<2-5,House>Then we're done.

69
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,390
<2-5,House>想做点什么  看球还是逛动物园
<2-5,House>What do you think? Ball game? Zoo?

70
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,370
<2-5,House>什么都行  我只想跟你们一起
<2-5,House>I don't care. I just want to hang with you guys.

71
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,220
<2-6,Chase>有没有可能是吸毒
<2-6,Chase>What about drugs?

72
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,630
<2-6,Chase>他的入院毒性检测显示
<2-6,Chase>His tox screen on admission

73
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,570
<2-6,Chase>他体内有大剂量的水合氯醛
<2-6,Chase>showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.

74
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,620
<2-7,House>不好意思  那是我弄的
<2-7,House>Yeah. Sorry. That was me.

75
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,340
<2-7,House>我不得不把他药翻了弄过来
<2-7,House>I had to dope him up to get him in here.

76
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,730
<2-7,House>这家伙认为自己没病
<2-7,House>Guy doesn't think he's sick.

77
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,460
<2-8,Cameron>-谁认为他有  -他妻子
<2-8,Cameron>- Who does? - His wife.

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,130
<2-10,Cameron>和你一起生活过的女人
<2-10,Cameron>The woman you used to live with.

79
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,610
<2-11,House>你说的是她印第安语昵称
<2-11,House>That's her Indian name.

80
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,090
<2-11,House>驾照上写的是史黛西
<2-11,House>On her driver's license it's Stacy.

81
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,540
<2-11,House>看来你是有话要说
<2-11,House>I assume you have a point.

82
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,560
<2-12,Cameron>你信她  不信病人
<2-12,Cameron>You believe her over the patient himself.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,010
<2-12,Cameron>所以我们才接这个病例
<2-12,Cameron>That's why we're taking this case.

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,130
<2-13,House>要听真话吗  我脑子里一直有个声音
<2-13,House>The truth? I hear voices all the time

85
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,880
<2-13,House>指挥我做各种事情  是不是很疯狂
<2-13,House>telling me to do stuff. It's crazy, huh?

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
<2-14,Cameron>不是"人人都会说谎"吗
<2-14,Cameron>What happened to "Everybody lies"?

87
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,210
<2-15,House>我说谎了
<2-15,House>I was lying.

88
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,170
<2-15,House>去做各种乱七八糟的检测
<2-15,House>Do the things... the blah, blah,

89
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,840
<2-15,House>就是其他医生都会做的那些
<2-15,House>blah, blah. All that stuff the other docs did.

90
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
<2-15,House>如果是阴性  给他做腹部超声检查
<2-15,House>If that's negative, ultrasound his belly.

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,290
<2-15,House>如果还是阴性
<2-15,House>If that's negative,

92
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,160
<2-15,House>对他的腹部和骨盆分别做有无造影剂断层扫描
<2-15,House>C.T. his abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast.

93
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,210
<2-16,Chase>-我有没有漏掉什么  -厨房的水槽
<2-16,Chase>- Did I miss anything? - Kitchen sink.

94
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,920
<2-16,Chase>Everything but the kitchen sink
<2-16,Chase>[意思是越轨的行为]

95
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,920
<2-17,House>我们当然可以对那里也...小坏蛋
<2-17,House>Well, we could certainly give that... Oh, you minx!

96
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,910
<3-1,Wilson>你一定是这样想的
<3-1,Wilson>What you're thinking is,

97
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,160
<3-1,Wilson>你会治好他  成为英雄  把她赢回来
<3-1,Wilson>you're going to save him, be a hero and win her back.

98
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,920
<3-1,Wilson>你这种扭曲的自恋每次都令我折服
<3-1,Wilson>It's always impressive, that level of twisted narcissism.

99
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,860
<3-2,House>她已经结婚了  你还看不出来我早败了
<3-2,House>She's married. Big clue I lost the game.

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,240
<3-3,Wilson>你不许靠近史黛西·华纳50英尺以内
<3-3,Wilson>You can't be within 50 feet of Stacy Warner.

101
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,830
<3-4,House>她让我给她老公看病呢
<3-4,House>Thought she wanted me to treat him.

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,290
<3-5,Wilson>看病归看病  离她远点
<3-5,Wilson>Treat the husband, stay away from the wife.

103
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,470
<3-6,House>要是他俩靠近了呢  我怎么办
<3-6,House>But what if they get close to each other? What do I do then?

104
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,180
<3-7,Wilson>你必须把他当做寻常病例对待
<3-7,Wilson>Hey. You have to treat this like a regular case.

105
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,460
<3-7,Wilson>做你自己
<3-7,Wilson>Be yourself...

106
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,310
<3-7,Wilson>冷漠  缺乏关怀  拒人千里
<3-7,Wilson>cold, uncaring, distant.

107
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,230
<3-8,House>拜托  不要崇拜我
<3-8,House>Please, don't put me on a pedestal.

108
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,770
<4-1,Cameron>我们对你的腹部做了CT
<4-1,Cameron>We C.T.'d your abdomen.

109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,400
<4-1,Cameron>没有找出腹痛的症结
<4-1,Cameron>Nothing that would explain the stomach pain.

110
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,850
<4-2,Stacy>-下一步怎么办  -出院
<4-2,Stacy>- What's the next move? - Leaving.

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,630
<4-3,Mark>我还要做多少检测
<4-3,Mark>How many more tests do I need?

112
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,280
<4-3,Mark>还要多少位医生诊断我没病
<4-3,Mark>How many more doctors need to clear me

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,770
<4-3,Mark>我们才能回归正常生活
<4-3,Mark>before we can get back to our life?

114
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,570
<4-4,Stacy>-只有一位  -豪斯
<4-4,Stacy>- Just one. - House.

115
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,290
<4-5,Mark>你一定觉得尴尬吧
<4-5,Mark>It must be awkward being treated

116
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,100
<4-6,Cameron>被妻子以前交往的人治疗
<4-6,Cameron>by a man who used to be involved with your wife.

117
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
<4-7,Mark>我这样分明没病
<4-7,Mark>It's awkward being in a

118
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,960
<4-7,Mark>却被困在医院里才叫尴尬
<4-7,Mark>hospital when there's nothing wrong with me.

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,460
<5-1,Cameron>核磁共振查不出问题  说明他应该是健康的
<5-1,Cameron>M.R.A.'s were clean, which means he's probably fine.

120
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,920
<5-1,Cameron>他不像是有妄想症  也没有迹象...
<5-1,Cameron>He doesn't seem paranoid. He shows no signs of...

121
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,300
<5-2,House>错  这只能说明我们没发现他的病症
<5-2,House>No. It means we have no idea what's wrong with him.

122
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,880
<5-3,Foreman>本·戈尔茨坦说他的时间表排满了
<5-3,Foreman>Ben Goldstein says his schedule's locked.

123
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,210
<5-3,Foreman>最早要明天才能手术
<5-3,Foreman>He can't do it before tomorrow.

124
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,490
<5-4,House>不行  就今天  打电话给他说我会安排
<5-4,House>No. Today. Call him, tell him I'll make it work.

125
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,670
<5-5,Cameron>你要给他开刀
<5-5,Cameron>You're cutting him open?

126
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,090
<5-6,House>等一下  没必要手术探查了
<5-6,House>Oh, hold it. There's no need for exploratory surgery.

127
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,780
<5-6,House>卡梅隆医生已经有诊断了
<5-6,House>Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.

128
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,610
<5-7,Cameron>没有  我只是认为
<5-7,Cameron>No, I just think it's premature

129
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,720
<5-7,Cameron>在确认他生病之前就做手术探查
<5-7,Cameron>and maybe irresponsible...

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
<5-7,Cameron>有欠考虑  而且可能有些不负责任
<5-7,Cameron>to do exploratory surgery before we know he's actually sick.

131
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,040
<5-8,House>不对  现在把他列入临终护理名单
<5-8,House>No, it's "Premature" To put him

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,750
<5-8,House>才是"有欠考虑"
<5-8,House>on a list for hospice care.

133
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,040
<5-8,House>暗示我的行为不合理
<5-8,House>And it's "maybe irresponsible"

134
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,170
<5-8,House>才叫做"可能有些不负责任"
<5-8,House>to imply my actions are not rationally supported.

135
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,750
<5-9,Cameron>我们的依据不过是他妻子...
<5-9,Cameron>All we have is his wife...

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,650
<5-10,House>说他腹痛  我觉得足够了
<5-10,House>Who says his stomach hurts. Works for me.

137
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,710
<5-11,Cameron>病人都不认为自己在生病  他怎么会同意
<5-11,Cameron>The patient doesn't even think he's sick. Why would he consent to...

138
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,630
<5-12,House>他妻子是律师  很会劝人的
<5-12,House>His wife's a lawyer. She's very convincing.

139
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,950
<5-12,House>给戈尔茨坦打电话  手术一定要做
<5-12,House>Call Goldstein. Surgery is on.

140
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,320
<6-1,Stacy>莱斯利诉莱斯利一案看似即将胜诉
<6-1,Stacy>Leslie versus Leslie seems to be right on point,

141
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,900
<6-1,Stacy>但我确信他们会争取...
<6-1,Stacy>but I'm sure they're going to try to distinguish it by...

142
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,530
<6-1,Stacy>抱歉  他们会着重于
<6-1,Stacy>Sorry. They'll try to distinguish it

143
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,530
<6-1,Stacy>指一名或几名法官持有的不同意多数法官意见
<6-1,Stacy>所达成的判决结果的意见

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,890
<6-1,Stacy>争取少数意见
<6-1,Stacy>relying on the minority opinion.

145
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,920
<6-2,House>双份牛奶  不加糖
<6-2,House>Double milk, no sugar.

146
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,830
<6-3,Stacy>我现在喜欢加糖了
<6-3,Stacy>I like sugar now.

147
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,040
<6-3,Stacy>别人会被你敲得心烦的
<6-3,Stacy>Some people would be annoyed by that.

148
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,910
<6-4,House>你知道人们为什么坐在等侯室里吗
<6-4,House>You know why people sit in waiting rooms?

149
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,530
<6-5,Stacy>好戏又要开始了
<6-5,Stacy>This is gonna be good.

150
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,200
<6-6,House>人们认为靠手术室越近就表示
<6-6,House>People think the closer they're sitting to the operating room,

151
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,640
<6-6,House>他们对病人越关心
<6-6,House>the more they care.

152
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,870
<6-7,Stacy>这也是我在这的原因
<6-7,Stacy>That's why I'm here.

153
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,860
<6-7,Stacy>所有人都看到我之前  我是不会离开的
<6-7,Stacy>I'm not moving until everybody sees me.

154
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,100
<6-8,House>除了马克之外  你有和其他人交往吗
<6-8,House>Are you doing anybody besides Mark?

155
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,820
<6-8,House>这是个医学问题
<6-8,House>It's a medical question.

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,620
<6-9,Stacy>因为如果我有的话  他的妄想就不是妄想了
<6-9,Stacy>Because if I am, his paranoia isn't paranoia.

157
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,050
<6-9,Stacy>它成了情有可原的反应而不是疾病症状
<6-9,Stacy>It's a justified response and therefore not a legitimate symptom.

158
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,260
<6-10,House>我就知道你会明白
<6-10,House>Knew you'd understand.

159
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,430
<6-11,Stacy>可是另一方面  如果这真是个医学问题
<6-11,Stacy>On the other hand, if it was really just a medical question,

160
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,960
<6-11,Stacy>你会派其他人来问
<6-11,Stacy>you would have sent one of your people.

161
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,160
<6-11,Stacy>招惹他们方便得很  为什么还来烦我呢
<6-11,Stacy>Why just push my buttons when you can push theirs too?

162
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,200
<6-11,Stacy>曼丁哥医生  去问那个妻子她有没有出轨
<6-11,Stacy>Hey, Dr. Mandingo, go ask the wife if she's been messin' around.

163
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,200
<6-11,Stacy>引出小说《曼丁哥人》
<6-11,Stacy>讲述阿拉巴马州种植园黑奴Mandinka的故事

164
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,600
<6-11,Stacy>你要问是因为  如果我有不忠行为
<6-11,Stacy>But you're asking because if I am... unfaithful,

165
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,600
<6-11,Stacy>我就有可能跟你上床
<6-11,Stacy>I might sleep with you.

166
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,660
<6-11,Stacy>答案是没有  我从不鬼混
<6-11,Stacy>The answer's no. I don't sleep around.

167
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,560
<6-11,Stacy>记得把这个写进他的医疗档案
<6-11,Stacy>Make sure you note that in his file.

168
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,530
<6-12,Foreman>华纳夫人
<6-12,Foreman>Mrs. Warner.

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,110
<6-12,Foreman>手术很成功  他在恢复室
<6-12,Foreman>The surgery went well. He's in Recovery.

170
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,110
<6-12,Foreman>你可以去看他了
<6-12,Foreman>You can see him now.

171
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,640
<6-12,Foreman>除了膀胱膨胀之外  戈尔茨坦一无所获
<6-12,Foreman>Goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder.

172
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,570
<6-13,House>膀胱膨胀不是疼痛的起因
<6-13,House>Neurogenic bladder isn't causing the pain.

173
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,470
<6-14,Foreman>也不会引起性格变化
<6-14,Foreman>It also doesn't cause personality changes.

174
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,450
<6-14,Foreman>换句话说  这完全证实了卡梅隆的诊断
<6-14,Foreman>On the other hand, it would completely account for Cameron's diagnosis.

175
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,860
<6-14,Foreman>病人是完全健康的
<6-14,Foreman>The patient's completely healthy.

176
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,000
<6-15,House>把手术录像给我
<6-15,House>Get me the video of the surgery.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,640
<7-1,House>曼丁哥医生  种植园需要你
<7-1,House>Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation house.

179
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,830
<7-1,House>好啦  别一起说
<7-1,House>Well, don't everybody talk at once.

180
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,510
<7-1,House>什么都没有
<7-1,House>There's nothing there.

181
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,450
<8-1,House>别盯着那个空又不空的酒瓶发呆  看屏幕
<8-1,House>Stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen.

182
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,240
<8-2,Cameron>这就是为什么我能拿高薪
<8-2,Cameron>Here's why I get the big bucks.

183
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,020
<8-3,House>这里什么都没有
<8-3,House>This is nothing.

184
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,150
<8-3,House>什么都没有的加强版
<8-3,House>An enhanced version of nothing.

185
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,730
<8-3,House>这...才是问题所在
<8-3,House>This... is the problem.

186
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,690
<8-5,Chase>-难以置信  -肌纤维震颤
<8-5,Chase>- Unbelievable. - Tremors in the muscle fiber.

187
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,350
<8-6,Cameron>这不是肠蠕动
<8-6,Cameron>That's not peristalsis.

188
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,910
<8-6,Cameron>是腹性癫痫
<8-6,Cameron>That's abdominal epilepsy.

189
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,040
<8-7,Foreman>意味着他有神经方面的问题
<8-7,Foreman>Means there's some sort of neurological problem.

190
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,360
<8-8,House>他的大脑里有枚定时炸弹
<8-8,House>A time bomb in his brain.

191
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,290
<8-8,House>谁说什么都没有来着
<8-8,House>I forget. Who said it was nothing?

192
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,120
<9-1,Foreman>我在他的脑电波中发现了
<9-1,Foreman>I saw a very small, diffuse abnormality

193
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,390
<9-1,Foreman>非常微弱的弥漫性异常  很可能是白质
<9-1,Foreman>in the brain waves. Probably white matter.

194
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,450
<9-1,Foreman>就是说他的神经轴突在死亡
<9-1,Foreman>Means his axonal nerves are dying.

195
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,420
<9-1,Foreman>所以他有神经性膀胱功能障碍
<9-1,Foreman>Explains the neurogenic bladder.

196
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,070
<9-2,House>坏死的神经达到一定数量  他也会死
<9-2,House>Enough nerves die, he dies.

197
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,100
<9-3,Foreman>大范围神经轴突死亡
<9-3,Foreman>Global axonal nerve death.

198
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,510
<9-3,Foreman>可能的成因是脑炎和阿兹海默症
<9-3,Foreman>Likely causes are encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

199
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,580
<9-4,Cameron>早发性阿兹海默症  最糟的可能
<9-4,Cameron>Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.

200
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,030
<9-5,House>他不会马上就死  但他会宁可早点死
<9-5,House>He won't die right away. He'll just want to.

201
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,400
<9-6,Cameron>我去检测血液中阿兹海默症的蛋白标记
<9-6,Cameron>I'll check the blood for Alzheimer's protein markers.

202
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,290
<9-7,House>据我所知  阿兹海默症有遗传组分
<9-7,House>Last I heard, Alzheimer's had a genetic component.

203
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,020
<9-7,House>病人有父母吗
<9-7,House>Did the patient have parents?

204
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,730
<9-8,Cameron>父母死于车祸  没有痴呆病史
<9-8,Cameron>Parents died in a car crash. No history of dementia.

205
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,330
<9-8,Cameron>送脑脊液去做血球计数
<9-8,Cameron>Send C.S.F. for C.B.C.

206
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,660
<9-9,House>和血清病毒筛查排除脑炎
<9-9,House>and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis...

207
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,270
<9-9,House>抽取Tau蛋白检测阿兹海默症
<9-9,House>and get Tau proteins to check for Alzheimer's.

208
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,170
<9-9,House>这些文件手感还是有点轻
<9-9,House>And this still feels a little light.

209
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,200
<9-10,Cameron>我调来了完整的病史
<9-10,Cameron>I took a complete medical history.

210
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,280
<9-11,House>查查他们的房子  带上贼小子
<9-11,House>Check out their house. Take Sparky with you.

211
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,540
<9-12,Chase>他们住在肖特山  有两小时路程呢
<9-12,Chase>They live in Short Hills. Two hours away.

212
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,250
<9-13,House>路费可以报销
<9-13,House>You can expense the tolls.

213
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,350
<9-14,Cameron>你对病史不感兴趣
<9-14,Cameron>You're not interested in a medical history.

214
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
<9-14,Cameron>你就是个企图窥视前女友的偷窥狂
<9-14,Cameron>You're a Peeping Tom trying to spy on your ex.

215
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,900
<9-15,House>她的秘密日记  重点找这个
<9-15,House>Her secret diary... That's the main thing.

216
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,630
<9-15,House>不过你们到她家的时候  也看一眼药柜
<9-15,House>But as long as you're there, take a peek in the medicine cabinet.

217
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,510
<9-15,House>检查毒素  重金属
<9-15,House>check for toxins, heavy metals...

218
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,750
<9-15,House>除脑炎和阿兹海默症之外
<9-15,House>anything that might explain this

219
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,930
<9-15,House>任何可以解释病症的东西
<9-15,House>other than encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

220
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,410
<9-15,House>路费记得要收据
<9-15,House>And get receipts for the tolls.

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,060
<10-1,Stacy>在做午饭吗  我猜是给马克的
<10-1,Stacy>Making lunch? I assume that's for Mark.

222
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,270
<10-2,Cameron>我们已经了解了他的父母  其他亲属呢
<10-2,Cameron>We know about his parents. What about further back?

223
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,520
<10-2,Cameron>祖父母  叔伯  姨妈
<10-2,Cameron>Grandparents, uncles, aunts.

224
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,080
<10-2,Cameron>他们的健康如何
<10-2,Cameron>How was their health?

225
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,260
<10-3,Stacy>格雷戈不喜欢盲目猜测  他已经有结论了吧
<10-3,Stacy>Greg hates fishing. He's got a theory.

226
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,580
<10-4,Cameron>现在可能性最大的是阿兹海默症
<10-4,Cameron>Most likely candidate right now is Alzheimer's.

227
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,920
<10-5,Stacy>不可能  他没有记忆丧失
<10-5,Stacy>No. There's been no memory loss.

228
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,680
<10-5,Stacy>我意思是  他会忘记把钥匙放在哪里
<10-5,Stacy>I mean, he forgets where he left his keys,

229
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,800
<10-5,Stacy>可谁不会呢
<10-5,Stacy>but who doesn't?

230
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,340
<10-6,Cameron>有家族病史吗
<10-6,Cameron>Any family history?

231
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,780
<10-7,Stacy>哪种  脑子不正常的吗

<10-7,Stacy>拉尔夫·纳德(Ralph Nader)
<10-7,Stacy>屡败屡战  5次竞选美国总统

234
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,880
<10-8,Cameron>没别的了
<10-8,Cameron>That's about it.

235
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,830
<10-8,Cameron>豪斯的腿出事的时候
<10-8,Cameron>You were with House

236
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,930
<10-8,Cameron>你...和豪斯在一起吗
<10-8,Cameron>when it happened... to his leg?

237
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,950
<10-9,Stacy>你对他感兴趣
<10-9,Stacy>You're interested in him.

238
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,220
<10-10,Cameron>我们约会过一次

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,150
<10-10,Cameron>不是很顺利
<10-10,Cameron>It didn't go very well.

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,540
<10-11,Stacy>我们的第一次约会也不顺利
<10-11,Stacy>Our first date didn't either.

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,060
<10-11,Stacy>我打算不再见他的
<10-11,Stacy>I was never gonna see him again.

242
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,600
<10-11,Stacy>结果一周之后我搬进了他家  一住就是5年
<10-11,Stacy>A week later, I moved in. Five years.

243
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,280
<10-11,Stacy>想知道些什么
<10-11,Stacy>What would you like to know?

<10-12,Cameron>他腿没坏之前是什么样的
<10-12,Cameron>What was he like before his leg?

245
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,740
<10-13,Stacy>跟现在差不多
<10-13,Stacy>Pretty much the same.

246

<10-14,Cameron>结果阴性  不是阿兹海默症
<10-14,Cameron>He's clear. No Alzheimer's.

250
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,690
<11-4,Chase>-说明他年纪大了  -也可能暗示着他背疼
<11-4,Chase>- Man's getting older. - Or it might indicate back pain.

251
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,140
<11-5,Foreman>是的话他妻子会提到的
<11-5,Foreman>Wife would have mentioned it.

<11-7,Foreman>在自己家里做的时候除外
<11-7,Foreman>Not when you do it in your own home.

254
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,940
<11-7,Foreman>可能只是单纯的改变  不见得是症状
<11-7,Foreman>Change could be just a change, not a symptom.

255
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,110
<11-7,Foreman>奇斯
<11-7,Foreman>Chase.

263
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,210
<12-3,House>看看清楚  "开给W·布朗"
<12-3,House>On the other hand, "Prescribed to W. Brown".

264
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,920
<12-4,Cameron>假名字  假处方
<12-4,Cameron>Fake name. Fake prescription.

265
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,100
<12-5,House>有可能  不过处方医师的名字是真的
<12-5,House>Could be, but the prescribing doc, his name's real.

266
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,460
<12-5,House>这家伙前不久因为给高中生
<12-5,House>This guy's just had his license pulled

267

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,750
<12-7,House>从布朗先生的生日可以看出他才17岁
<12-7,House>And Mr. Brown's birth date makes him 17 years old.

270
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,670
<12-7,House>你们想这会不会是
<12-7,House>Do you think maybe these were

271
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,600
<12-6,Foreman>高中训导主任没收的物品呢
<12-6,Foreman>confiscated by a high school guidance counselor?

<12-7,House>有其他发现吗
<12-7,House>Anything else?

273

<12-10,Cameron>不是  非常纯净
<12-10,Cameron>Said no. Champagne tap.

<12-10,Cameron>没有红细胞和白细胞  血清检测阴性
<12-10,Cameron>No red cells, no white cells. Serology's negative.

278
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,550
<12-11,House>那我们又回到了阿兹海默症
<12-11,House>Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,640
<12-12,Cameron>我已经告诉她不是阿兹海默症了
<12-12,Cameron>I told her he didn't have it.

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,140
<12-12,Cameron>标记检测结果是阴性
<12-12,Cameron>The marker tests were negative.

281
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,600
<12-13,House>你应当告诉她
<12-13,House>Well, then you should have told her that

282
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,940
<12-13,House>他将来还是有可能痴呆的
<12-13,House>he could still have it.

283
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,010
<12-13,House>PET扫描可以显示
<12-13,House>PET scan will reveal any

<12-13,House>大脑皮层代谢活动的任何变化
<12-13,House>changing metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex.

<12-13,House>给他做扫描  考考他的记忆
<12-13,House>Run him through and check his memory.

286
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,740
<13-1,Foreman>我们给你注射一种名为F.D.D.N.P的化学标记
<13-1,Foreman>We're going to inject a chemical marker called F.D.D.N.P.

287
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,170
<13-1,Foreman>-之后我会问你一系列问题  -检测我的记忆
<13-1,Foreman>- Then I'm gonna ask you a series of questions. - Test my memory.

288
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,260
<13-3,Foreman>是的  但我们首先要检查大脑某些特定功能
<13-3,Foreman>Yeah, but first we're gonna map out some specific brain functions.

289
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,140
<13-3,Foreman>就像是开车之前先检查下发动机
<13-3,Foreman>You know, check out the engine before we take the car for a drive.

290
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,060
<13-3,Foreman>监督我工作吗
<13-3,Foreman>Checking up on me?

<13-8,Mark>大脑边缘系统完好
<13-8,Mark>Limbic system's intact.

296
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,210
<13-9,Foreman>好  如果在路上捡到一封贴了邮票的信
<13-9,Foreman>Okay, say you find a stamped envelope on the street.

297
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,980
<13-9,Foreman>你会怎么做
<13-9,Foreman>What do you do?

298
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,620
<13-10,Mark>-找个邮筒把它邮了  -多好一人呐
<13-10,Mark>- Find a mailbox and mail it. - Geez. What a guy.

299
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,200
<13-11,House>他的额叶比我健全多了
<13-11,House>His frontal lobe is working way better than mine.

300
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,860
<13-11,House>记得自己什么时候结婚的吗
<13-11,House>Do you remember when you got married?

<13-12,Mark>3年前的7月  谁在问话
<13-12,Mark>Three years ago this July. Who is that?

302
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,030
<13-13,House>怎么了  他的长期记忆可能会有问题
<13-13,House>What? Could be a problem with his long-term memory.

303

<13-14,Mark>-教堂里举行的盛大婚礼吗  -是豪斯吗
<13-14,Mark>- Big church wedding? - Is that House?

304
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,950
<13-16,Foreman>-他能记住声音  -你这根本不是为了诊断
<13-16,Foreman>- He remembers voices. - This serves no diagnostic purpose.

305
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,100
<13-17,House>我认为你测试边缘系统马虎了
<13-17,House>I thought you skimped on the limbic system there.

306
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,770
<13-17,House>情感反应  我只想周全点
<13-17,House>Emotional reactions. I just want to be thorough.

307
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,500
<13-17,House>无神论者新娘穿白色婚纱了吗
<13-17,House>Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty white dress?

308
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,020
<13-18,Mark>她当时有没有想着你
<13-18,Mark>Was she thinking of you?

309
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,110
<13-18,Mark>这是查我病需要知道的吗
<13-18,Mark>Is that what you medically need to know?

310
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,450
<13-19,House>你的新娘戴了什么首饰
<13-19,House>What jewelry did your bride wear?

311
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,270
<13-20,Mark>她从不戴任何首饰
<13-20,Mark>She never wears any jewelry,

312
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,420
<13-20,Mark>除了她母亲给她的十字架
<13-20,Mark>except the cross her mother gave to her.

313
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,010
<13-20,Mark>也不穿底裤  至少那天没穿
<13-20,Mark>No underwear either, at least not that day.

314
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,980
<13-20,Mark>我记得这个是因为
<13-20,Mark>I remember 'cause she

315
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,470
<13-20,Mark>她在车上就把漂亮的白婚纱撕开了
<13-20,Mark>ripped her pretty white dress off in the car.

316
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,500
<13-20,Mark>这是你想要的答案吗  医生
<13-20,Mark>That the sort of answer you're looking for, Doctor?

317
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,950
<13-21,House>-我想我惹他不高兴了  -你得马上停下
<13-21,House>- I think I upset him. - You gotta stop this now.

318
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,540
<13-23,Mark>我还记得是在巴黎度的蜜月
<13-23,Mark>I remember the honeymoon was in Paris.

319
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,030
<13-23,Mark>我记得这个是因为我们整整两周没有离开房间
<13-23,Mark>I remember 'cause we didn't leave the room for two weeks.

320
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,320
<13-24,House>-想听听细节吗  -有一点自我保护
<13-24,House>- You want the details on that? - A little defensive.

321
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,880
<13-25,Foreman>在首先被人挑衅的情况下  不算是妄想症
<13-25,Foreman>It's not paranoia if someone's out to get you.

322
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,490
<14-1,House>劈头盖脸地来了
<14-1,House>Here we go.

323
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,090
<14-2,Stacy>他病了  焦虑多疑  你却拿我的事折腾他
<14-2,Stacy>He's sick, paranoid, and you keep hammering him about me?

324
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,740
<14-3,House>那些问题是专门设计
<14-3,House>The questions were designed to

325
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,470
<14-3,House>用以确定他边缘系统的功能参数
<14-3,House>define the operational parameters of his limbic system.

326
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,820
<14-4,Stacy>随你怎样狡辩  你只是在折磨他
<14-4,Stacy>Elevate the words all you want. You were just screwing with him.

327
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,020
<14-4,Stacy>真卑劣  即便以你的标准而言
<14-4,Stacy>Low, even by your standards.

328
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,250
<14-5,House>出于医疗目的的折磨  这就是我的工作
<14-5,House>Medical screwing. It's what I do.

329
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,900
<14-6,Stacy>那你干吗像个12岁小孩
<14-6,Stacy>Then why you run away like a 12-year-old.

330
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,110
<14-6,Stacy>躲到楼顶上  就像你一贯的作风
<14-6,Stacy>Go hide on the roof like you always do.

331
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,500
<14-7,House>我有5年没上来这里了
<14-7,House>I haven't been up here in five years.

332
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,670
<14-7,House>我不知道他得了什么病
<14-7,House>I don't know what's wrong with him.

333
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,910
<14-7,House>不是阿兹海默症  不是脑炎
<14-7,House>It's not Alzheimer's. It's not encephalitis.

334
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,110
<14-7,House>不是环境毒素  不是免疫系统疾病
<14-7,House>It's not environmental. It's not immunological.

335
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,460
<14-7,House>所有的检测每次都是阴性
<14-7,House>Every test is negative every time.

336
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
<14-7,House>他完全是健康的
<14-7,House>He's perfectly healthy,

337
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,650
<14-7,House>可他的大脑正在坏死
<14-7,House>but his brain is dying.

338
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,330
<14-8,Stacy>我从没想到...
<14-8,Stacy>It never occurred to me...

339
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,450
<14-8,Stacy>连你也会查不出问题
<14-8,Stacy>that you couldn't figure out what's wrong.

340
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,280
<14-9,House>我还没有放弃
<14-9,House>I haven't given up.

341
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,720
<14-10,Stacy>那我们怎么做
<14-10,Stacy>So what do we do?

342
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,250
<14-11,House>我们等
<14-11,House>We wait.

343
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,110
<14-12,Stacy>等什么
<14-12,Stacy>For what?

344
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,970
<14-13,House>等待变化的出现
<14-13,House>Something to change.

345
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,340
<14-13,House>生活最大的悲剧之一就是  世事总是...
<14-13,House>It's one of the great tragedies of life. Something always...

346
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,250
<14-13,House>世事总无常
<14-13,House>Something always changes.

347
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,330
<15-1,Mark>护士
<15-1,Mark>Nurse?

348
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,760
<15-1,Mark>护士
<15-1,Mark>Nurse!

349
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,050
<15-1,Mark>怎么了  出什么事了
<15-1,Mark>What happened? What's wrong?

350
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,890
<16-1,Stacy>我的脚趾发麻  刺痛
<16-1,Stacy>My toes-- They were numb, tingling,

351
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,500
<16-2,Mark>现在完全没知觉了
<16-2,Mark>Then nothing.

352
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,340
<16-2,Mark>也不疼  什么感觉都没了
<16-2,Mark>No pain. Nothing.

353
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,200
<16-3,Stacy>别担心  他们会治好你的
<16-3,Stacy>It's okay. They're going to take care of you.

354
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,270
<16-4,Mark>史黛西  我很害怕  握住我的手
<16-4,Mark>I'm scared, Stacy. Hold my hand.

355
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,300
<16-4,Mark>怎么了
<16-4,Mark>What?

356
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,050
<16-5,Stacy>到底怎么回事
<16-5,Stacy>What's happening?

357
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,210
<16-6,House>随着时间推移  他瘫痪了
<16-6,House>Time marches on. He's paralyzed.

358
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,620
<17-1,Foreman>他的症状拟似外周围神经系统受到侵害
<17-1,Foreman>His symptoms mimic a peripheral nervous system under attack.

359
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,200
<17-2,Chase>但他现在出现严重的肢体感觉异常
<17-2,Chase>But he's experiencing significant paresthesias,

360
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,890
<17-2,Chase>手脚均无法动弹
<17-2,Chase>And he can't move his hands or toes.

361
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,090
<17-1,Foreman>外周神经系统受损
<17-1,Foreman>It's peripheral.

362
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,450
<17-3,House>格林-巴利综合征攻击外周神经而非大脑
<17-3,House>Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain.

363
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,480
<17-4,Foreman>不是  我已间接做过库姆斯氏试验
<17-4,Foreman>No. No. I already did an indirect Coombs' test.

365
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,670
<17-4,Foreman>没有凝集  没有抗体
<17-4,Foreman>No agglutination, no antibodies.

366
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,680
<17-5,House>很主动嘛  好孩子
<17-5,House>Initiative. Like that.

367
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,230
<17-5,House>静脉注射免疫...
<17-5,House>Start him on I.V. Immuno--

368
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,120
<17-6,Foreman>没有抗体就没有格林-巴利综合征  说完了
<17-6,Foreman>No antibodies means he doesn't have Guillain-Barre. Period.

369
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,590
<17-7,House>完了?  应该还有别的可能性吧
<17-7,House>Period? More like dot, dot, dot.

370
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,350
<17-7,House>如果他体内有病毒而身体不产生抗体呢
<17-7,House>What if he has the virus but isn't producing those antibodies?

371
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,460
<17-8,Foreman>得了吧  那样的机率...
<17-8,Foreman>Come on. The chances of that

372
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,430
<17-9,House>没问你机率是多少  我是说"如果"
<17-9,House>Didn't ask about the Vegas line. I said "What if".

373
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,820
<17-10,Foreman>那就说明他生病了  可他的身体却无动于衷
<17-10,Foreman>It would mean he's sick, and his body's not doing anything about it.

374
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,580
<17-11,Cameron>所以要么我们争取下
<17-11,Cameron>So we either fight it for him

375
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,850
<17-11,Cameron>要么这病就是致命的
<17-11,Cameron>or it's fatal.

376
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,900
<17-12,House>"致命"这词多难听啊
<17-12,House>Fatal sounds very bad to me.

377
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,910
<17-13,Chase>没有抗体
<17-13,Chase>Well, without the antibodies,

378
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,410
<17-13,Chase>我们都无法测试
<17-13,Chase>We can't even test for it.

379
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,980
<17-13,Chase>无法确定我们诊断的对错
<17-13,Chase>Don't know if we're right.

380
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,060
<17-14,House>治疗方法也不是都那么危险
<17-14,House>Treatment isn't all that dangerous.

381
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,140
<17-14,House>血浆置换和静脉注射免疫球蛋白
<17-14,House>Plasmapheresis and I.V.I.G.

382
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,470
<17-14,House>如果起效  我们就对了
<17-14,House>If it works, we're right.

383
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,250
<17-14,House>如果他死了  就别有原因了
<17-14,House>If he dies... it was something else.

384
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,860
<18-1,Mark>那我的瘫痪可能只是一时的
<18-1,Mark>So the paralysis might not be permanent.

385
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,580
<18-2,Cameron>但愿如此  可大脑令人捉摸不定
<18-2,Cameron>That's our hope, but the brain's tricky. You never know.

386
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,960
<18-3,Mark>-怎么回事  -什么怎么回事
<18-3,Mark>- What was that? - What?

387
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,080
<18-5,Mark>他甩头的姿势还有那眼神
<18-5,Mark>With the head. The look.

388
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,390
<18-6,Stacy>他只想跟我谈谈
<18-6,Stacy>He just wants to talk to me.

389
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,500
<18-7,Mark>如果是关乎我的身体  他该跟我说
<18-7,Mark>Well, if it was medical,he should be talking to me.

390
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,990
<18-8,Stacy>我就在门外
<18-8,Stacy>I'll be just outside the door.

391
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,980
<18-9,Mark>走吧  去跟他聊吧
<18-9,Mark>Leave! Go talk to him.

392
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,860
<18-9,Mark>反正你早晚都会离开我的
<18-9,Mark>You're going to leave me anyway.

393
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,260
<18-10,Stacy>不  不会的
<18-10,Stacy>No. That's not gonna happen.

394
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,040
<18-11,Mark>你离开他  他瘸了
<18-11,Mark>You left him,and he had a limp.

395
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,710
<18-11,Mark>如果我无法行走  无法拥你入怀
<18-11,Mark>If I can't walk or hold you?

396
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,420
<18-12,Stacy>亲爱的  我哪儿也不去
<18-12,Stacy>Honey, I'm not going anywhere.

397
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,050
<18-12,Stacy>我也不和他说话了
<18-12,Stacy>I'm not going to talk to him.

398
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,050
<18-13,Mark>如果我不能自食其力
<18-13,Mark>If I can't feed myself?

399
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,540
<18-14,Cameron>马克  你现在的感觉都是假的
<18-14,Cameron>Mark, what you're feeling--It's not real.

400
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,780
<18-14,Cameron>是病毒导致的错觉
<18-14,Cameron>It's the virus.

401
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,240
<18-14,Cameron>-马克  怎么回事  -马克
<18-14,Cameron>- Mark? What is it? - Mark?

402
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,210
<18-14,Cameron>他的气道正在关闭
<18-14,Cameron>His throat's closing up.

403
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,870
<18-14,Cameron>他无法呼吸  蓝色警报  快点
<18-14,Cameron>He can't breathe. Code blue! Hurry!

404
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,860
<18-14,Cameron>这是免疫球蛋白输液反应  立刻上肾上腺素
<18-14,Cameron>He's having a reaction to the I.V.I.G. I need epi, stat.

405
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,860
<18-14,Cameron>-我没法下喉镜  -住手
<18-14,Cameron>- I can't get the scope in his throat. - Stop that.

406
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,470
<18-16,Cameron>他对药物产生过敏  他快不行了
<18-16,Cameron>He's having an allergic reaction. He's crashing.

407
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,470
<18-17,House>没有  你看他的生命体征
<18-17,House>No, he's not. Look at his vitals.

408
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,040
<18-17,House>血氧含量正常
<18-17,House>O2 sats are within range.

409
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,650
<18-17,House>我敢肯定他唯一的反常就是手心出汗
<18-17,House>I'm betting the only abnormal sign is sweaty palms.

410
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,740
<18-15,House>给他用2毫克的安定
<18-15,House>Push two milligrams Ativan.

411
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,160
<18-16,Cameron>不是过敏  只是恐慌而已
<18-16,Cameron>No allergic reaction. Just a panic attack.

412
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,200
<18-17,House>他显然是受惊了
<18-17,House>Something obviously freaked him out.

413
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,620
<18-17,House>现在我们能说话了吗
<18-17,House>Can we talk now?

414
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,760
<19-1,Stacy>你就不能径直走进他的病房
<19-1,Stacy>You couldn't just come into the room?

415
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,070
<19-2,House>已经有5个人来探望过他了
<19-2,House>He's had five visitors drive down.

416
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,880
<19-2,House>我一个都不认识
<19-2,House>I didn't recognize any of them.

417
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,920
<19-2,House>还有6个人给他送了花  糖果和泰迪熊
<19-2,House>Six more have sent him flowers, candy and a teddy bear,

418
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,340
<19-2,House>他定倍感欣慰
<19-2,House>Which I'm sure he finds very comforting.

419
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,030
<19-2,House>可卡片上那些名字我也一个都不认识
<19-2,House>But I didn't recognize any of the names on the cards.

420
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,340
<19-3,Stacy>惊人啊  马克有朋友
<19-3,Stacy>Shockingly, Mark has friends,

421
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,590
<19-3,Stacy>我还结交了一些新朋友
<19-3,Stacy>and I have some new ones.

422
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,370
<19-4,House>你有新朋友  我丝毫不感到震惊
<19-4,House>No, it's not shocking that you have new friends,

423
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,550
<19-4,House>令我震惊的是  你舍弃你所有的旧朋友
<19-4,House>But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones.

424
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,760
<19-6,House>-我没有 -是吗  我也这么想的
<19-6,House>- I haven't. - No, I didn't think so.

425
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,680
<19-6,House>我猜你只是没有通知他们你来了这里
<19-6,House>I just think you didn't tell any of them that you were down here.

426
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,270
<19-6,House>为什么这么做呢
<19-6,House>Now, why would that be?

427
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,270
<19-6,House>-你在忙什么  -要等会儿
<19-6,House>- What are you up to? - It's gonna take a little while.

428
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,030
<19-6,House>为什么你没告诉你的老朋友
<19-6,House>Why would you not tell your oldest friends...

429
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,650
<19-6,House>你把马克送到
<19-6,House>that you were taking Mark to

430
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,740
<19-6,House>普波教学医院救治
<19-6,House>Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital to try to save his life?

431
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,890
<19-7,Stacy>我很忙  没时间一一通知
<19-7,Stacy>I've been busy. I haven't kept track of who knows what.

432
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,050
<19-8,House>瞧  我的老朋友要我小心点
<19-8,House>See, my old friends are telling me to be careful.

433
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,090
<19-8,House>他们似乎认为
<19-8,House>They seem to think--

434
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,930
<19-9,Stacy>是他  是他送的熊
<19-9,Stacy>He. And he sent me the bear.

435
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,600
<19-10,House>明白了
<19-10,House>Figures.

436
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,230
<19-10,House>他似乎认为
<19-10,House>He seems to think

437
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,910
<19-10,House>我对你还没忘怀
<19-10,House>that I'm not over you...

438
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,070
<19-10,House>和你共处一室有点危险
<19-10,House>And that it might be dangerous for me to spend time with you.

439
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,880
<19-10,House>我猜你的朋友或许有类似的担忧
<19-10,House>I'm thinking your friends might have similar concerns,

440
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,890
<19-10,House>所以你没告诉他们你在这里和在我一起
<19-10,House>And so you didn't tell them you'd be here with me.

441
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,400
<19-11,Stacy>你想说什么  我还爱着你吗
<19-11,Stacy>What's your point? That I'm still in love with you?

442
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,040
<19-11,Stacy>我该抛弃垂死的丈夫
<19-11,Stacy>I should abandon my dying husband,

443
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,700
<19-11,Stacy>和你一起去里约热内卢
<19-11,Stacy>and we should head for Rio.

444
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,030
<19-12,House>不是
<19-12,House>No.

445
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,240
<19-13,Stacy>格雷戈  我感激你为我们做的事情
<19-13,Stacy>Greg I appreciate what you are doing for us

446
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,210
<19-13,Stacy>不过看来威尔森说的没错
<19-13,Stacy>but I think maybe Wilson's right.

447
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,270
<19-13,Stacy>或许你该和我保持距离
<19-13,Stacy>Maybe you should just stay away from me.

448
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,500
<20-1,Wilson>怎么了
<20-1,Wilson>What's up?

449
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,820
<20-2,House>爱那个熊呗  可爱死了
<20-2,House>Love the bear. It's adorable.

450
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,360
<20-3,Wilson>我老婆会杀了我的
<20-3,Wilson>My wife's gonna kill me.

451
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
<20-3,Wilson>今晚我们有客  她亲自下厨
<20-3,Wilson>We're having company. She cooked.

452
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,260
<20-4,House>刚拿到马克的最新血检报告
<20-4,House>I got Mark's latest blood work.

453
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,900
<20-4,House>治疗毫不起效
<20-4,House>He's not responding to treatment.

454
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,440
<20-5,Wilson>我很遗憾
<20-5,Wilson>I'm sorry.

455
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,760
<20-5,Wilson>我倒挺开心的
<20-5,Wilson>I was happy.

456
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,020
<20-6,House>他是我的病人
<20-6,House>He's my patient.

457
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,620
<20-6,House>而且他是个好人  说不定还是个大好人
<20-6,House>I'm sure he's a good guy. He's probably a great guy.

458
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,270
<20-6,House>显然比我好得多得多
<20-6,House>He's apparently a much better guy than I am.

459
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,670
<20-6,House>可我心里面竟有点希望他死
<20-6,House>And some part of me wants him to die.

460
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,530
<20-6,House>只不过我搞不清
<20-6,House>I'm just not sure

461
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,530
<20-6,House>我这样到底是我因为想和她重温旧梦
<20-6,House>if it's because...I want to be with her,

462
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,920
<20-6,House>还是因为我希望她痛苦不堪
<20-6,House>Or it's because I want her to suffer.

463
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,860
<21-1,House>介意我和史黛西聊一会儿吗
<21-1,House>Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?

464
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,760
<21-2,Stacy>我就在门外  亲爱的
<21-2,Stacy>I'll be just outside, honey.

465
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,520
<22-1,House>你们相处的挺融洽
<22-1,House>You two are good together.

466
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,290
<22-2,Stacy>你对马克一无所知
<22-2,Stacy>You know nothing about Mark.

467
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,220
<22-3,House>他带你去了巴黎
<22-3,House>He took you to Paris.

468
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,550
<22-3,House>我觉得这就挺好
<22-3,House>That's good enough for me.

469
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,320
<22-4,Stacy>我们从没去过巴黎
<22-4,Stacy>We never went to Paris.

470
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,930
<22-5,House>你们度蜜月的时候去的
<22-5,House>Your honeymoon.

471
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,050
<22-5,House>巴黎一直是你的梦之城
<22-5,House>It's been your dream city.

472
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,530
<22-5,House>你从16岁开始就憧憬巴黎
<22-5,House>You wanted to go since you were 16.

473
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,490
<22-5,House>他实现了你的心愿
<22-5,House>He actually took you.

474
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,610
<22-6,Stacy>不啊 那时我得工作
<22-6,Stacy>No, I had to work.

475
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,260
<22-6,Stacy>我们在纽约待了一晚就回肖特山了
<22-6,Stacy>We spent the night in New York. Then we went back to Short Hills.

476
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,170
<22-6,Stacy>怎么回事
<22-6,Stacy>What is it?

477
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,130
<22-7,House>马克什么时候不骑山地车转而练瑜伽的
<22-7,House>When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?

478
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,370
<22-8,Stacy>大概一个月前吧
<22-8,Stacy>About a month ago.

479
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,100
<22-8,Stacy>差不多是他生病的时候
<22-8,Stacy>The same time he started getting sick.

480
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,060
<22-8,Stacy>这说明什么问题
<22-8,Stacy>What does that mean?

481
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,880
<22-9,House>又多了两个病症
<22-9,House>We have two more symptoms.

482
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,840
<23-1,House>我们曾问过病人一些问题
<23-1,House>The patient was asked a series of questions

483
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,310
<23-1,House>以测试他的脑功能
<23-1,House>to determine the functionality of his brain.

484
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,800
<23-2,Foreman>-你拷问了他史黛西的情况  -随便啦
<23-2,Foreman>- You grilled him about Stacy. - Whatever.

485
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,580
<23-3,House>关键是
<23-3,House>Yeah, the point is,

486
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,540
<23-3,House>我们诊断需要知道的他其实全都告诉我们了
<23-3,House>he told us everything we need to know to diagnose him.

487
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,110
<23-3,House>前提是把你的超炫PET扫描当测谎仪来用
<23-3,House>That is, if we use your fancy PET scan as a lie detector.

488
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,410
<23-3,House>瞧  说谎是个很费脑子的过程
<23-3,House>See, it's a very creative process, lying.

489
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,030
<23-3,House>说真相的过程倒是容易许多  看这里
<23-3,House>Now, telling the truth is a much simpler process. See here.

490
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,250
<23-3,House>问题9
<23-3,House>Question nine.

491
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,490
<23-3,House>马克长篇大论了一番
<23-3,House>This is where Mark gives a long, rambling answer about

492
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,120
<23-3,House>他和史黛西的巴黎之旅
<23-3,House>taking Stacy to Paris.

493
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,640
<23-3,House>PET扫描的结果是什么
<23-3,House>What does the PET scan say?

494
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,590
<23-4,Foreman>脑活跃程度最小  只有额叶和颞叶
<23-4,Foreman>Minimal involvement. Just the frontal and temporal lobes.

495
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,550
<23-5,Chase>他说他去了巴黎  PET扫描确认属实
<23-5,Chase>He said he went to Paris, and the PET confirms it.

496
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,870
<23-5,Chase>那又怎样
<23-5,Chase>So, what?

497
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,530
<23-6,House>他们根本没去
<23-6,House>They didn't go.

498
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,430
<23-6,House>他们没去巴黎  可马克的大脑认为
<23-6,House>They didn't go to Paris, and yet Mark's brain apparently thinks...

499
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,970
<23-6,House>他真的花了40法郎游览了巴士底监狱
<23-6,House>that he really did spend 40 francs on a tour of the bastille.

500
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,650
<23-6,House>好了  现在的症状是间歇伴有腹部疼痛
<23-6,House>So we have an intermittent syndrome that presents with abdominal pain,

501
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,340
<23-6,House>多神经病变  妄想症
<23-6,House>Polyneuropathy, paranoia...

502
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,070
<23-6,House>以及幻觉
<23-6,House>And delusions.

503
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,910
<24-1,House>急性间歇性卟啉病有个特征
<24-1,House>Now, here's the thing about Acute Intermittent Porphyria.

504
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,290
<23-6,House>它潜伏在阴暗的巷子里  伺机扑向你
<23-6,House>It'll jump you in a dark alley,

505
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,310
<23-6,House>暴打你一顿之后  把你扔那儿流血
<23-6,House>beat the crap out of you, leave you bleeding.

506
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,880
<23-6,House>不过它戴了手套  所以没有留下指纹
<23-6,House>But it wears gloves, so no fingerprints.

507
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
<23-6,House>血检查不出  尿检也查不出
<23-6,House>Doesn't show up in blood tests, urine tests, nothing...

508
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,110
<23-6,House>除非你在案发现场抓它个正着
<23-6,House>Unless you catch it red-handed in the middle of an attack.

509
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,160
<23-7,Chase>可急性间歇性卟啉病还有其他症状
<23-7,Chase>But there are other symptoms of A.I.P.

510
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,820
<23-9,Chase>-比如说呢  -对光敏感
<23-9,Chase>- Such as? - Light sensitivity.

511
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,680
<23-10,House>是啊  生这种病的一大悲剧
<23-10,House>Yeah. One of the true tragedies of this condition...

512
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,730
<23-10,House>就是它整得你直想把你崭新拉风的山地车扔车库里
<23-10,House>is it makes you want to stick your cool new mountain bike in the garage...

513
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,580
<23-10,House>躲在屋子里做运动  比如说瑜伽
<23-10,House>And take up an indoor sport like, say, yoga.

514
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,460
<23-10,House>开始治疗  用血红素和葡萄糖
<23-10,House>Start the treatment. Hematin and glucose.

515
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,280
<23-11,Cameron>你现在给他用血红素  万一你错了
<23-11,Cameron>If you give him Hematin now and you're wrong,

516
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,890
<23-11,Cameron>他今天就没命
<23-11,Cameron>he dies today.

517
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,820
<23-12,Foreman>要确诊急性间歇性卟啉病只有一个办法
<23-12,Foreman>There's only one way to confirm A.I.P.,

518
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,370
<23-12,Foreman>在发病时采集尿样化验
<23-12,Foreman>urine sample made during the attack.

519
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,880
<23-13,Chase>可我们没办法预见他发病的时间
<23-13,Chase>And there's no way to predict when he'll have another attack.

520
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,690
<23-14,House>谁说没办法
<23-14,House>Sure there is.

521
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,210
<24-1,House>急性间歇性卟啉病有其特定的发病诱因
<24-1,House>Acute Intermittent Porphyria has very specific triggers.

522
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,760
<24-1,House>巴比妥酸盐  酒精
<24-1,House>Barbiturates, alcohol,

523
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,690
<24-1,House>高浓度蛋白质  都会使患者发病
<24-1,House>high levels of protein will set off an attack.

524
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,930
<24-2,Stacy>-那马克是因为什么发病呢  -完全不知道
<24-2,Stacy>- Which trigger do you think set off Mark's? - Not the faintest idea.

525
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,610
<24-3,House>所以我就三者合一  给他上一套餐
<24-3,House>That's why I'm gonna give him the combo plate. All of it.

526
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,070
<24-4,Stacy>那如果他有这病  你诱导发病
<24-4,Stacy>So if he has this, and you trigger an attack,

527
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,530
<24-4,Stacy>他的情况就会更糟  对吗
<24-4,Stacy>the attack makes him worse, right?

528
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,240
<24-5,House>对  但到时我们就知道病因  就能下药了
<24-5,House>Yeah. But then we'll know what it is and we can treat it.

529
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,740
<24-6,Mark>可我要没这病
<24-6,Mark>But if I don't have this thing

530
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,270
<24-6,Mark>你又给我打了那针  会怎么样
<24-6,Mark>and you give me that shot, what happens?

531
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,090
<24-7,House>不知道  我们不知道你的病因
<24-7,House>No idea. If we don't know what's messing up your brain,

532
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,660
<24-7,House>就不能预料反应
<24-7,House>we don't know how you'll react.

533
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,040
<24-8,Stacy>好  让我和他单独说会话
<24-8,Stacy>Okay, I-- I need a minute with my husband.

534
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,710
<24-8,Stacy>他不同意触发病症
<24-8,Stacy>He doesn't want the trigger.

535
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,710
<24-8,Stacy>他想再等等  看你们有没有新的说法
<24-8,Stacy>He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation.

536
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,390
<24-8,Stacy>如果真是这个病  他还能活多久
<24-8,Stacy>If it is A.I.P., how much time does he have?

537
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,710
<24-9,House>难说  下次发病可能就会致命
<24-9,House>No idea. Next attack could be fatal.

538
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,250
<24-9,House>可能半年后  也可能是五分钟
<24-9,House>Could be six months from now. Could be five minutes from now.

539
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,570
<24-10,Stacy>-我要你继续检测  -行
<24-10,Stacy>- I want you to test him. - Fine.

540
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,770
<24-11,House>我会检测羟甲基胆色烷合酶的突变情况
<24-11,House>I'll send for an H.M.B-synthase mutation.

541
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,680
<24-11,House>基因测试  一个月出结果
<24-11,House>Genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month.

542
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,470
<24-12,Stacy>注射吧  让他发病
<24-12,Stacy>Give him the cocktail, set off an attack.

543
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,430
<24-14,Stacy>-不  -为什么
<24-14,Stacy>- No. - Why not?

544
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,440
<24-15,House>因为他不同意
<24-15,House>Because he doesn't want me to.

545
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,300
<24-16,Stacy>我不会告你的  也不会举报你
<24-16,Stacy>I'm not gonna sue you. I'm not gonna report you.

546
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,910
<24-17,House>-他可能会  -他都瘫了
<24-17,House>- He might. - He's paralyzed.

547
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,600
<24-18,Stacy>你要治不好他  他什么都干不了
<24-18,Stacy>Either you cure him, or he won't be writing any letters.

548
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,540
<24-19,House>-我不会这么做的  -为什么呀
<24-19,House>- I'm not gonna do it. - Why not?

549
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,800
<24-21,House>不管你怎么问  不会就是不会
<24-21,House>You keep asking me that question. My answer doesn't change.

550
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,300
<24-21,House>情况我跟他说清楚了  由他选择
<24-21,House>I gave him the parameters. It's his call.

551
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,750
<24-22,Stacy>你想让他死
<24-22,Stacy>You want him to die.

552
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,770
<24-23,House>我查出病因  仁至义尽了
<24-23,House>I diagnosed him. I did my job.

553
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,890
<24-23,House>要霸王硬上弓  硬逼人治疗
<24-23,House>You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment,

554
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,640
<24-23,House>你比我在行
<24-23,House>you're way better at that than I am.

555
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,550
<24-24,Stacy>这是为你的腿报复我吗  你就这么小心眼
<24-24,Stacy>Is that what this is? Payback for your leg?

556
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,420
<24-24,Stacy>说多少次了  我捡回你一条命
<24-24,Stacy>How many times have we been over this? I saved your life.

557
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,310
<24-26,Stacy>-算是吧  -你要害死我丈夫来教训我吗
<24-26,Stacy>- Yeah, maybe. - You're gonna kill my husband to teach me a lesson?

558
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,020
<24-27,House>我没有  是他太固执太笨
<24-27,House>No. He's gonna die 'cause he's too stubborn

559
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,790
<24-27,House>要害死自己
<24-27,House>to make the right choice.

560
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,630
<24-28,Stacy>这可是你的地盘
<24-28,Stacy>Now we're in your territory.

561
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,460
<24-29,House>我是在尊重你丈夫的决定
<24-29,House>I'm respecting your husband's decision.

562
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,870
<24-29,House>这有什么奇怪的
<24-29,House>I don't see why you've got a problem with that.

563
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,260
<24-30,Stacy>你胡说八道
<24-30,Stacy>Because it's crap.

564
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,550
<24-30,Stacy>平时你对病人连恐吓带威胁  还满嘴谎话
<24-30,Stacy>Because you browbeat patients, intimidate them, lie to them.

565
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,380
<24-30,Stacy>你主意定了  才不管他们怎么决定
<24-30,Stacy>If you think you're right, you don't give a damn what they think.

566
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,290
<24-30,Stacy>恐吓威胁我也会
<24-30,Stacy>I did what you do all the time.

567
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,390
<24-30,Stacy>不过跟你不同  我只威胁你一个人
<24-30,Stacy>The only difference is, I did it to you.

568
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,600
<24-31,House>他永远不会原谅你
<24-31,House>He'll never forgive you.

569
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,500
<24-32,Stacy>没错  他不会
<24-32,Stacy>Yeah. He will.

570
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,900
<25-2,Stacy>-还是没变化  -没有恶化吗
<25-2,Stacy>- Still no change. - He's not getting worse?

571
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,630
<25-3,Foreman>没有  毫无变化
<25-3,Foreman>No. No change at all.

572
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,690
<25-4,Stacy>急性间歇性卟啉病就是这样吧
<25-4,Stacy>And that's consistent with A.I.P., right?

573
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,650
<25-4,Stacy>-发病前一切稳定  -对
<25-4,Stacy>- Until he has another attack, his condition's stable. - Yeah.

574
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,180
<25-7,Mark>-马克  你还是...-我不想试
<25-7,Mark>- Mark, you've got to... - I don't want to take that test,

575
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,720
<25-7,Mark>我要等他们确诊
<25-7,Mark>not until they're sure.

576
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,510
<25-9,Mark>-你不了解格雷戈  -就你了解
<25-9,Mark>- You don't know Greg. - Not like you do.

577
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,940
<25-9,Mark>我就见过他一次  还被他下了药
<25-9,Mark>I only met him when he drugged me.

578
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,970
<25-10,House>哎哟  羞愧死我了
<25-10,House>Boy, are my ears burning.

579
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,420
<25-11,Mark>-你拿的什么  -套餐呗
<25-11,Mark>- What's that? - Cocktail hour.

580
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,820
<25-12,House>我们可不歧视残疾人
<25-12,House>Just 'cause you can't hoist a few

581
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,350
<25-12,House>给你也来一份
<25-12,House>doesn't mean you should be left out.

582
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,790
<25-13,Mark>-你别碰我  -马克
<25-13,Mark>- Get away from me. - Mark,

583
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,490
<25-14,Stacy>如果这是他的诊断...
<25-14,Stacy>if this is what he thinks is wrong with you--

584
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,360
<25-15,Mark>-你信他不信我吗  -他是专业医生
<25-15,Mark>- You trust his judgment more than mine? - His medical judgment.

585
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,320
<25-17,Mark>-你要赌我的命  -我愿意
<25-17,Mark>- And you'd bet my life on that? - I would.

586
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,010
<25-18,Stacy>可我不愿意
<25-18,Stacy>I don't.

587
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,700
<25-20,House>聪明
<25-20,House>Smart.

588
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,500
<25-20,House>可惜你瘫了
<25-20,House>It's too bad you're paralyzed.

589
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,180
<25-20,House>叮咚  呼叫福曼医生
<25-20,House>Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman.

590
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,330
<25-20,House>出去吧  少管闲事
<25-20,House>Leave the room. It's not your problem.

591
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,840
<25-21,Foreman>你得征求病人同意
<25-21,Foreman>You need the consent from him.

592
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,820
<25-22,House>可医生  他脑筋糊涂哎
<25-22,House>But, Doc, he ain't right in the head.

593
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,990
<25-23,Cameron>那就要法院批准
<25-23,Cameron>Then you need a court order.

594
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,730
<25-24,House>行啊  你俩申请去  我们等着
<25-24,House>Okay. Then get one. We'll wait here.

595
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,290
<25-24,House>我保证不乱来
<25-24,House>I won't do nothin'.

596
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,770
<25-24,House>嚄  就喜欢三剑客的范儿
<25-24,House>Oh! Love the Musketeer thing.

597
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,600
<25-25,Cameron>-我都起鸡皮疙瘩了  -把注射器给我
<25-25,Cameron>- I got goose bumps. - Give me the syringe.

598
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,880
<25-26,Stacy>求你了  如果你猜对了  他只能拼一把
<25-26,Stacy>Please. If you're right, this may be his only shot.

599
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,980
<25-27,House>跟你商量商量
<25-27,House>So what's your plan?

600
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,520
<25-27,House>你对付高大威猛的黑小子
<25-27,House>You take the big dark one,

601
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,210
<25-27,House>我来搞定这小姑娘
<25-27,House>I've got the little girl,

602
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,120
<25-27,House>至于澳洲小白脸
<25-27,House>and the Aussie will

603
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,340
<25-27,House>一打起来马上跟吓破胆的小袋熊一样一溜烟跑没影
<25-27,House>run like a scared wombat if things turn rough.

604
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,850
<25-27,House>我做不到
<25-27,House>I can't do it.

605
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,550
<25-28,Mark>你这混蛋
<25-28,Mark>You son of a bitch!

606
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,420
<25-29,House>迅雷不及掩耳吧
<25-29,House>See what I did there?

607
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,490
<25-30,Stacy>什么时候会发病
<25-30,Stacy>When does it happen?

608
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,630
<25-31,Chase>如果真是急性间歇性卟啉病
<25-31,Chase>If he had A.I.P.,

609
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,250
<25-31,Chase>应该已经发病了
<25-31,Chase>should've already happened.

610
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,440
<25-33,Foreman>-各有不同嘛  -情况不妙
<25-33,Foreman>- Everyone's different. - This is not good.

611
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,790
<25-33,Foreman>他可能会血管栓塞  心动过速  还可能中风
<25-33,Foreman>He could have an embolism, tachycardia, stroke.

612
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,860
<25-35,Chase>怎么了  注射两毫克安定
<25-35,Chase>What's happening? Two milligrams of Ativan.

613
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,940
<25-36,Stacy>是发病了吗
<25-36,Stacy>Is that an attack?

614
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,500
<25-37,House>-给  -不行  会污染尿样
<25-37,House>- Here. - No. You'll pollute the sample.

615
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,400
<25-37,House>奇斯  从导尿管取样
<25-37,House>Chase, get urine from the catheter.

616
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,160
<25-38,Foreman>他没发病  他中风了
<25-38,Foreman>It's not an attack! He's stroking.

617
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,580
<25-39,Chase>他需要安定
<25-39,Chase>He needs Ativan!

618
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,600
<25-40,House>不是中风  出现高幅慢波阵只是因为血管痉挛
<25-40,House>This is not a stroke. The delta-wave burst is just a vasospasm.

619
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,040
<25-41,Chase>导尿管掉了  没法取样了
<25-41,Chase>Catheter's out. There's no way to collect the sample.

620
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,160
<25-42,Foreman>心跳降到40几  心动过缓  他不行了
<25-42,Foreman>Heart rate's in the 40s. Bradycardia. We're losing him.

621
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,010
<25-43,House>-按住他  -总之给他点什么
<25-43,House>- Hold him down. - Give him something!

622
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,720
<25-46,Foreman>-止痛药用光了  -你错了
<25-46,Foreman>- No painkillers. - You were wrong.

623
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,360
<25-47,House>直接从膀胱取样  新鲜纯净没得比
<25-47,House>Straight from the bladder. That's as fresh as it gets.

624
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,780
<25-47,House>等什么  赶紧上安定呀
<25-47,House>Would you give him the Ativan already.

625
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,700
<25-47,House>何必让他受活罪呢
<25-47,House>He doesn't need to be awake for this.

626
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,340
<26-1,Cameron>还黄澄澄的
<26-1,Cameron>It's still yellow.

627
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,240
<26-2,House>让开
<26-2,House>Move.

628
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,880
<26-4,Chase>-干嘛  -加盏灯有什么用
<26-4,Chase>- What? - You think another light's gonna make the difference?

629
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,690
<26-5,House>有机化学原理  光照越足  氧化越快
<26-5,House>Organic chem-- more light, more oxidation.

630
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,930
<26-5,House>脑瓜转起来没
<26-5,House>Does that ring any bells?

631
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,420
<26-5,House>开始用药  150毫克葡萄糖
<26-5,House>Start the patient on 150 milligrams glucose,

632
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,400
<26-5,House>75毫克血红素
<26-5,House>75 milligrams Hematin.

633
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,340
<27-1,Mark>要不要掰手指
<27-1,Mark>You wanna thumb wrestle?

634
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,530
<27-2,Stacy>来吧
<27-2,Stacy>Come on.

635
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,120
<27-3,Mark>-我还是讨厌那疯子  -我懂
<27-3,Mark>- He's still a maniac. - I know.

636
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,400
<27-5,Cameron>豪斯医生
<27-5,Cameron>Dr. House?

637
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,590
<27-5,Cameron>他怎么样了
<27-5,Cameron>How's he doing?

638
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,450
<27-6,House>好得不能再好了
<27-6,House>Never better.

639
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,960
<27-6,House>我原以为
<27-6,House>I thought...

640
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,580
<27-7,Cameron>你被伤得太重  无法再爱了
<27-7,Cameron>you were too screwed up to love anyone.

641
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,470
<27-7,Cameron>可我错了
<27-7,Cameron>I was wrong.

642
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,230
<27-7,Cameron>你只是爱着别人
<27-7,Cameron>You just couldn't love me.

643
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,170
<27-7,Cameron>挺好
<27-7,Cameron>That's good.

644
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,100
<27-7,Cameron>我为你高兴
<27-7,Cameron>I'm happy for you.

645
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,640
<28-1,Stacy>你治好了他
<28-1,Stacy>You fixed him.

646
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
<28-2,House>这没啥
<28-2,House>De nada.

647
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,660
<28-3,Stacy>谢谢你
<28-3,Stacy>Thank you.

648
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,450
<28-3,Stacy>你说对了
<28-3,Stacy>You were right.

649
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,380
<28-4,House>他会康复的
<28-4,House>He's gonna be fine.

650
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,170
<28-5,Stacy>不  说的是我
<28-5,Stacy>No. About me.

651
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,920
<28-5,Stacy>我还没放下你
<28-5,Stacy>I'm not over you.

652
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,670
<28-5,Stacy>你...一直是我心里那个人
<28-5,Stacy>You were-- you were the one.

653
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,230
<28-5,Stacy>永远都是
<28-5,Stacy>You always will be.

654
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,960
<28-5,Stacy>但我不能跟你在一起
<28-5,Stacy>But I can't be with you.

655
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,540
<28-6,House>那么就是说  你爱的是我
<28-6,House>So I'm the guy,

656
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,290
<28-6,House>却嫁了另一个
<28-6,House>but you want the other guy,

657
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,620
<28-6,House>那个成为你的丈夫  却不会得到你的爱的人
<28-6,House>who, by definition, can never be the guy.

658
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,930
<28-7,Stacy>你最妙的就是这笃定自己没错的神气劲
<28-7,Stacy>What's so great about you is you always think you're right.

659
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,940
<28-7,Stacy>最气人的是
<28-7,Stacy>And what's so frustrating

660
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,270
<28-7,Stacy>大部分时间你还真没错
<28-7,Stacy>about you is you are right so much of the time.

661
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,490
<28-7,Stacy>你才华横溢
<28-7,Stacy>You are brilliant,

662
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,210
<28-7,Stacy>幽默  不单调  还很性感
<28-7,Stacy>funny, surprising, sexy.

663
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,030
<28-7,Stacy>但跟你在一起  我很孤独
<28-7,Stacy>But with you, I was lonely.

664
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,140
<28-7,Stacy>跟马克呢  就还能保留自我
<28-7,Stacy>And with Mark, there's room for me.

665
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,450
<28-8,House>懂了
<28-8,House>Okay.

666
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,150
<29-1,Cuddy>我有事跟你说
<29-1,Cuddy>I want to run something by you.

667
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,310
<29-2,House>我不会再跟你上床了  再也不了
<29-2,House>I will not have sex with you! Not again.

668
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,050
<29-2,House>第一次就够糟的了
<29-2,House>It was miserable that first time.

669
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,310
<29-2,House>你们管理层真是饥不择食
<29-2,House>All that desperate administrative need.

670
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,980
<29-3,Cuddy>史黛西的丈夫
<29-3,Cuddy>Stacy's husband is going

671
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,250
<29-3,Cuddy>需要留院密切观察
<29-3,Cuddy>to need close monitoring at the hospital,

672
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,580
<29-3,Cuddy>而医院肯定用得上她
<29-3,Cuddy>and since we can definitely use her back here,

673
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,910
<29-3,Cuddy>我准备雇她做法律顾问
<29-3,Cuddy>I've offered her a job-- general counsel.

674
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,750
<29-4,House>她答应了吗
<29-4,House>Did she say yes?

675
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,450
<29-5,Cuddy>她说你同意她才来
<29-5,Cuddy>She said only if it was okay with you.

676
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,710
<29-5,Cuddy>你同不同意啊
<29-5,Cuddy>Yes or no?

677
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,910
<29-6,House>行啊  好
<29-6,House>Fine. Good.
