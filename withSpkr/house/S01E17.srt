1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,170
<1-1,Senator>这里唯一的问题
<1-1,Senator>And the only thing wrong-

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,060
<1-1,Senator>美国梦的唯一问题就在于
<1-1,Senator>The only thing wrong with the American dream...

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,750
<1-1,Senator>有这样的人  有太多这样的人
<1-1,Senator>is people- too many people-

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,680
<1-1,Senator>我们中有太多人告诉年轻人
<1-1,Senator>too many of us telling young people

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,700
<1-1,Senator>美国梦已不复存在
<1-1,Senator>that the dream is dead.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,610
<1-1,Senator>当我还在特伦顿的贫民窟时
<1-1,Senator>They told me that

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,450
<1-1,Senator>他们就这样告诫我
<1-1,Senator>when I was growing up in the slums of Trenton.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,290
<1-1,Senator>事实证明他们是错的
<1-1,Senator>And they were wrong.

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,600
<1-1,Senator>当我只有58美元存款
<1-1,Senator>They told me that

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,290
<1-1,Senator>却决定竞选参议员时
<1-1,Senator>when I decided to run for senator,

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,620
<1-1,Senator>他们就这样告诫我
<1-1,Senator>with only $58 in my savings account.

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,690
<1-1,Senator>事实证明他们是错的
<1-1,Senator>And they were wrong.

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,440
<1-1,Senator>而今  他们依然如此告诫我
<1-1,Senator>And they are still telling me that now-

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,130
<1-10,Union Guy>我不可能成功  因为我是黑人
<1-10,Union Guy>that I don't have a chance because I'm black,

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,910
<1-11,Senator>因为我没有高耸的鼻梁
<1-11,Senator>because I don't have the right nose,

16
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,850
<1-1,Senator>因为我依然只有58美元存款
<1-1,Senator>because I still only have $58 in my savings account.

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,700
<1-1,Senator>但有你们在  我们就可以让梦想继续
<1-1,Senator>With your help, we can keep that dream alive.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,140
<1-1,Senator>最后
<1-1,Senator>And in closing,

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,660
<1-1,Senator>我
<1-1,Senator>just...

<1-2,Staffer>我想说  大家都应该行动起来
<1-2,Staffer>Let me say that you should all donate the legal maximum...

<1-2,Staffer>捐出你的最大限额给下一任美国总统
<1-2,Staffer>to the next president of the United States.

<1-2,Staffer>你还好吗  要喝水吗
<1-2,Staffer>Are you okay? Do you need some water or something?

<1-4,Union Guy>I bet you get 70% of the women.

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,510
<1-5,Senator>希望如此吧
<1-5,Senator>Well, here's hoping.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,220
<1-6,Union Guy>肯定会的  再加上您妻子死于癌症
<1-6,Union Guy>Of course, it helps your wife died of cancer.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,020
<1-6,Union Guy>我是说  节哀顺变
<1-6,Union Guy>I mean, I'm sorry,

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,700

<1-9,Senator>我向来很支持工会
<1-9,Senator>I've always been strong on the union.

35
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,760
<1-10,Union Guy>问题是
<1-10,Union Guy>The thing is,

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,140
<1-10,Union Guy>您总是在演讲里反复提到工人
<1-10,Union Guy>you always go on in your speeches about the workers...

<1-10,Union Guy>印尼的  柬埔寨的  马里的
<1-10,Union Guy>in Indonesia, Cambodia, Timbuktu.

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,040
<1-11,Senator>因为我们要有道义上...
<1-11,Senator>Because I think we have a- a moral-

39
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,800
<1-12,Union Guy>我的工会成员们很受伤
<1-12,Union Guy>My union members are hurting.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,080
<1-12,Union Guy>他们不关心这个
<1-12,Union Guy>They don't care about

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,140
<1-12,Union Guy>道义对他们来说一文不值  你还好吗
<1-12,Union Guy>moral this and moral that. Are you all right?

<1-13,Various staffers>参议员

<1-15,Various staffers>请后退  参议员  你还好吗
<1-15,Various staffers>Back off, please! Senator, are you all right?

46
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,820
<2-1,Vogler>参议员感觉恶心
<2-1,Vogler>The senator's suffering from nausea,

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,490
<2-1,Vogler>头疼  神志不清
<2-1,Vogler>headache and mental confusion.

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,770
<2-2,House>吃了变质的寿司也要找我来
<2-2,House>Ah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,010
<2-3,Vogler>别犯傻了
<2-3,Vogler>You're being childish.

50
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,960
<2-3,Vogler>就算这个病例像你想的那样无关紧要
<2-3,Vogler>Look, if his case is as trivial as you think,

51
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,550
<2-3,Vogler>也只需三分钟就能搞定
<2-3,Vogler>it'll take you three minutes to diagnose.

52
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,690
<2-4,House>三分钟我也可以干点别的
<2-4,House>Three minutes that I could

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,840
<2-4,House>坐在马桶上看点带色的东西
<2-4,House>spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,210
<2-5,Vogler>-你对我有意见  -没有
<2-5,Vogler>- You're mad at me. - Nope.

55
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,070
<2-6,House>反正我也不喜欢卡梅隆和福曼
<2-6,House>I never liked Cameron or Foreman.

56
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,610
<2-7,Vogler>知道为什么我要让你解雇他们其中一个吗
<2-7,Vogler>You know why I'm forcing you to fire one of them?

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,970
<2-7,Vogler>因为你必须向我证明你有团队精神
<2-7,Vogler>Because you need to prove to me that you're a team player.

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,000
<2-7,Vogler>如果你接手这个病例
<2-7,Vogler>Now, if you did that,

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,290
<2-7,Vogler>就不必经受这次考验了
<2-7,Vogler>you wouldn't need to go through this exercise.

60
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,540
<2-8,House>好  参议员吐的时候我会托住他的头发
<2-8,House>Fine. I'll hold the senator's hair while he upchucks.

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,280
<2-9,Vogler>还有
<2-9,Vogler>By the way,

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,630
<2-9,Vogler>我要你在全国心脏病学会议上做一次发言
<2-9,Vogler>I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference,

63
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,370
<2-9,Vogler>时间是下周
<2-9,Vogler>um, next week.

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,930
<2-10,House>我不做发言的  我很害羞的
<2-10,House>I don't do speeches. I'm shy.

65
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,580
<2-11,Vogler>东溪制药公司研发出了一种
<2-11,Vogler>Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has developed

66
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,610
<2-11,Vogler>新型血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,210
<2-12,House>东溪制药公司吗
<2-12,House>Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals?

70
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,370
<2-12,House>等等  那是我的公司吗
<2-12,House>Wait a second? Don't I own that company?

71
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,740
<2-12,House>哦不是  那是你的公司
<2-12,House>Oh, no, that's right. You do.

72
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,840
<2-13,Vogler>维普里尔相对于其前身各方面都有极大提升
<2-13,Vogler>Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version.

73
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,800
<2-13,Vogler>其优点都写在研究报告里
<2-13,Vogler>It's all there in the study.

74
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,420
<2-14,House>我只知道它的价格倒是有很大提升
<2-14,House>I know its price tag is significantly improved.

75
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,560
<2-15,Vogler>你有两个选择
<2-15,Vogler>You can either give one

76
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,180
<2-15,Vogler>要么做一个十分钟的报告和三分钟的诊断
<2-15,Vogler>10-minute talk and one three-minute diagnosis,

77
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,020
<2-15,Vogler>要么扔掉一只你的小鸭子
<2-15,Vogler>or you can fire one of your pets.

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,330
<2-15,Vogler>以我看来
<2-15,Vogler>My understanding was that

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,880
<2-15,Vogler>你是一个理智至上的人
<2-15,Vogler>you believed in rationality above all else.

80
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,210
<2-16,House>维普里尔
<2-16,House>Viopril.

81
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,170
<2-17,Senator>很感谢你们没让媒体进来
<2-17,Senator>I appreciate your keeping the media away.

82
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,800
<2-18,Foreman>你的手下也进不来
<2-18,Foreman>We're keeping your staff away as well.

83
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,930
<2-18,Foreman>可以放松点了
<2-18,Foreman>Take it easy now.

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,160
<2-19,Senator>我正在竞选
<2-19,Senator>I'm in the middle of a campaign.

85
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,500
<2-20,Foreman>我们越快把你治好
<2-20,Foreman>The faster we can get you better,

86
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,950
<2-20,Foreman>你才能尽快离开这里
<2-20,Foreman>the faster you can get out of here.

87
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,420
<2-20,Foreman>筹款会上的其他人里有生病的吗
<2-20,Foreman>Anyone else at the fund-raiser get sick?

88
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,580
<2-21,Senator>没有  而且我觉得不是传染病
<2-21,Senator>I don't think so, and I don't think that's it.

89
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,660
<2-21,Senator>几个星期以来我一直感觉不适
<2-21,Senator>I've been under the weather for weeks.

90
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,390
<2-21,Senator>四处奔走所致  我下周还得去苏丹
<2-21,Senator>Lots of traveling. I'm supposed to be in the Sudan next week.

91
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,410
<2-22,House>有助于我集中注意力
<2-22,House>Helps me concentrate.

92
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,660
<2-22,House>比药片还有效
<2-22,House>Even better than drugs.

93
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,430
<2-23,Foreman>请张嘴
<2-23,Foreman>Open your mouth, please.

94
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,610
<2-23,Foreman>这疤痕挺大的
<2-23,Foreman>That's quite a scar.

95
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,060
<2-23,Foreman>那是我六岁的时候
<2-23,Foreman>When I was six,

96
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,390
<2-24,Senator>从秋千上摔下来咬到舌头了
<2-24,Senator>I fell off the swing and bit my tongue.

97
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,220
<2-24,Senator>后来很久说话都不利索
<2-24,Senator>Couldn't talk right for the longest time.

98
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,660
<2-24,Senator>被人嘲笑
<2-24,Senator>Lots of teasing.

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,980
<2-24,Senator>因此我更加坚定地斗争
<2-24,Senator>It just made me fight harder,

100
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,100
<2-24,Senator>为那些无力抗争的人争取权益
<2-24,Senator>speak up for those who can't.

101
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,560
<9-11,Foreman>长鼻子呀长鼻子
<9-11,Foreman>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,170
<2-24,Senator>舌头愈合很快
<2-24,Senator>Tongues heal too fast.

103
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,590
<2-25,House>你的智囊团编的故事挺不错
<2-25,House>Your political consultants have written you a nice story.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
<2-25,House>单靠这个小故事
<2-25,House>In a tight race,

105
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,720
<2-25,House>就能助你在拉锯战中占得先机
<2-25,House>the lispers alone could put you over the top.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,290
<2-26,Senator>你是共和党呢  还是敌视一切政客
<2-26,Senator>You a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?

107
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,360
<2-27,House>我只是觉得被逼着听人胡扯很烦人
<2-27,House>I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.

108
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,470
<2-28,Senator>你觉得真诚很烦人吗
<2-28,Senator>You find sincerity annoying?

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,620
<2-29,House>你是从贫民窟走出来的黑人
<2-29,House>You're a black kid from the ghetto...

110
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,730
<2-29,House>最终进入了耶鲁法学院和美国参议院
<2-29,House>who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate.

111
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,000
<2-29,House>这个故事已经够梦幻了
<2-29,House>That's a sufficiently mythical story.

112
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,570
<2-29,House>不用再拿舌头的故事故弄玄虚了
<2-29,House>You don't need to lie about your tongue.

113
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,380
<2-29,House>肯定敲错位置了
<2-29,House>Must've missed it.

114
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,870
<2-30,Senator>怎么了
<2-30,Senator>What's wrong?

115
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,500
<2-30,Senator>怎么回事
<2-30,Senator>What is it?

116
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
<2-31,House>问题不在吃的东西上  在你的大脑里
<2-31,House>It's not the food. It's your brain.

117
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,090
<2-31,House>安排磁共振成像  还有腰椎穿刺
<2-31,House>Get an M.R.I. And a lumbar puncture.

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,040
<2-31,House>取消你的出行计划
<2-31,House>Cancel your travel plans.

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,560
<3-1,Foreman>腰椎穿刺没发现感染
<3-1,Foreman>The senator's L.P. showed no sign of infection,

120
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,030
<3-1,Foreman>磁共振成像没发现异常
<3-1,Foreman>and the M.R.I. looks fairly clean.

121
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,940
<3-2,House>那我们可以告诉他一切正常  可以出院了
<3-2,House>I guess we can tell him he's fairly healthy and can go home.

122
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,010
<3-3,Foreman>但在布罗卡区有个东西
<3-3,Foreman>Well, there is something in Broca's area,

123
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,790
<3-3,Foreman>很小  也不明显
<3-3,Foreman>but it's small, low intensity.

124
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,650
<3-4,Chase>估计是背景噪音吧
<3-4,Chase>Most likely just background noise.

125
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,080
<3-5,House>愿意用你的工作打包票吗
<3-5,House>Care to bet your job on that?

126
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,560
<3-5,House>那是什么表情
<3-5,House>What was that?

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,640
<3-6,Chase>你说什么啊
<3-6,Chase>What was what?

128
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,390
<3-7,House>你恼怒了  刚才明显是恼怒的表情
<3-7,House>You got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.

129
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,690
<3-8,Chase>你拿我们的未来当儿戏我就会恼怒
<3-8,Chase>I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.

130
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,340
<3-9,House>上周你就没有这样
<3-9,House>Last week you didn't get annoyed.

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,540
<3-9,House>你吓得屁滚尿流  真奇怪
<3-9,House>You made poopie in your pants. It's weird.

132
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,070
<3-9,House>就好像你知道了没什么可担心了一样
<3-9,House>It's almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about.

133
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,530
<3-10,Cameron>奇斯没什么可担心了吗
<3-10,Cameron>Chase has nothing to worry about?

134
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,620
<3-11,House>你们都不用担心了
<3-11,House>None of you has anything to worry about.

135
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,220
<3-12,Cameron>怎么回事
<3-12,Cameron>What happened?

136
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,270
<3-13,House>沃格勒认识到自己办事方法上的错误
<3-13,House>Vogler saw the error of his ways

137
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,090
<3-13,House>已经忏悔了
<3-13,House>and repented.

138
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,660
<3-13,House>这个伤口可能什么也不是
<3-13,House>The lesion could be nothing.

139
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,200
<3-13,House>也可能是脑瘤或是感染
<3-13,House>Also could be a brain tumor or an infection.

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,070
<3-13,House>只有一个办法能确定
<3-13,House>There's only one way to find out which.

141
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,230
<3-14,Foreman>你想开颅吗
<3-14,Foreman>You want to cut into his brain?

142
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,840
<3-15,House>我知道这很危险
<3-15,House>Dangerous, I know.

143
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,340
<3-15,House>尤其他又是个政客
<3-15,House>Especially since he's a politician,

144
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,660
<3-15,House>脑子里肯定曲里拐弯的
<3-15,House>his brain's all twisted.

145
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,420
<3-15,House>但这和午饭之前就中风比起来
<3-15,House>But I weighed that against the risk of him

146
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,430
<3-15,House>总要好一些  通知手术室  安排手术
<3-15,House>stroking out before lunch. Call Surgery. Get it scheduled.

147
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,240
<4-2,Sarah>-你没有怀孕  -早就告诉你了
<4-2,Sarah>- You're not pregnant. - Well, I told you that.

148
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,730
<4-2,Sarah>但我这里一直流血总有个原因吧
<4-2,Sarah>There's got to be some other reason I'm still spotting.

149
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,180
<4-3,House>当然  你怀过孕
<4-3,House>Sure. You were pregnant.

150
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,630
<4-3,House>从你的激素水平看  你流产了
<4-3,House>Based on your hormone levels, you've had a miscarriage.

151
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,290
<4-4,Sarah>我都没有约会
<4-4,Sarah>I haven't even been on a date.

152
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,450
<4-5,House>是啊  没人请你吃饭
<4-5,House>Right. And since it's physically

153
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,990
<4-5,House>你怎么可能跟人做爱呢
<4-5,House>impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner-

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,580
<4-6,Sarah>自从我和丈夫分开以后就没有过性生活
<4-6,Sarah>I haven't had sex since I split up with my husband.

155
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,870
<4-6,Sarah>都已经一年多了
<4-6,Sarah>That was almost a year ago.

156
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,920
<4-7,House>好吧  随你怎么说
<4-7,House>Fine. Have it your way.

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,190
<4-7,House>怀上耶稣了吧
<4-7,House>Immaculate conception.

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,190
<4-7,House>天主教信条谓圣母玛利亚蒙天恩
<4-7,House>而无原罪怀孕的无沾成胎说

159
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,310
<4-8,Sarah>-我怎么办  -还用问吗
<4-8,Sarah>- Um, what do I do? - Well, it's obvious.

160
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,610
<4-9,House>自己建个教呗
<4-9,House>Start a religion.

161
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,430
<4-10,Cuddy>来我办公室
<4-10,Cuddy>In my office.

162
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,540
<4-11,House>午后缠绵  她就是喜欢这根硬棒子
<4-11,House>Afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood.

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,360
<4-12,Cuddy>你不能只因为磁共振成像上的一个斑
<4-12,Cuddy>You're not doing a brain biopsy

164
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,510
<4-12,Cuddy>就进行脑部活检
<4-12,Cuddy>based on a spot on an M.R.I.

165
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,600
<4-13,House>你怎么知道的
<4-13,House>Where'd you get that?

166
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,300
<4-14,Cuddy>至少不能在美国参议员身上
<4-14,Cuddy>Not on a United States senator.

167
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,090
<4-15,House>也就是说  如果他是个看大门的
<4-15,House>Oh, just so I'm clear, if he was a janitor,

168
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,580
<4-15,House>就可以做啦  你能列个名单不
<4-15,House>that would be okay? Do you have a list?

169
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,930
<4-16,Cuddy>脑部活检可能会导致永久的神经损伤
<4-16,Cuddy>A brain biopsy can cause permanent neurological damage.

170
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,100
<4-17,House>对哦  肿瘤对大脑益处多多
<4-17,House>Whereas tumors are really good for brains.

171
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,440
<4-17,House>让它们茁壮成长吧
<4-17,House>Make 'em grow big and strong.

172
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,020
<4-18,Cuddy>-这事我说了算  -你说了不算
<4-18,Cuddy>- It's my call. - No, it's not.

173
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,680
<4-19,House>你要给病人分三六九等吗
<4-19,House>You're pulling rank on patient care?

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,450
<4-20,Cuddy>这事我也做不了主
<4-20,Cuddy>It's not my call either.

175
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,430
<5-1,Cuddy>-你来决定  -要么是肿瘤
<5-1,Cuddy>- It's up to you. - Either it's a tumor

176
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,990
<5-2,House>要么就是腰椎穿刺没有检测出来的感染
<5-2,House>or it's an infection that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up.

177
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,260
<5-2,House>不管是哪种  如果不及时治疗都会致命
<5-2,House>Either way, unless we treat it immediately, it could kill you.

178
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,600
<5-3,Cuddy>也可能什么也不是
<5-3,Cuddy>Or it could be nothing.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,480
<5-3,Cuddy>脑部磁共振成像原本就不精确
<5-3,Cuddy>Reading brain M.R.I.'s is not an exact science.

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,100
<5-4,Senator>那我的症状是由什么导致的
<5-4,Senator>Well, what caused my s-symptoms?

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,980
<5-5,House>这问题问的好
<5-5,House>Wow! Excellent question.

182
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,400
<5-5,House>很多医生都想不到这一层
<5-5,House>Many doctors wouldn't have gone there.

183
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,700
<5-6,Cuddy>可能只是短暂性脑缺血
<5-6,Cuddy>It could be a transient ischemic attack.

184
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,340
<5-6,Cuddy>你可以发表一份声明
<5-6,Cuddy>You could make the argument

185
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,820
<5-6,Cuddy>需要暂时入院观察一段时间
<5-6,Cuddy>for watching carefully for the time being.

186
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,670
<5-7,House>可是只有行政人员遮掩丑闻的时候
<5-7,House>Hmm, but you'd only make that argument

187
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,480
<5-7,House>才会发表这种声明
<5-7,House>if you were an administrator covering your ass.

188
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,150
<5-8,Cuddy>那太可笑了而且有辱斯文
<5-8,Cuddy>That's absurd and insulting.

189
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,180
<5-9,House>辱的就是斯文
<5-9,House>Insulting, yes.

190
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,340
<5-10,Senator>选民们会怎么想
<5-10,Senator>What would the voters think?

191
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,910
<5-10,Senator>要是他们发现我做了脑...脑部活检
<5-10,Senator>If they find out I've had a b-brain biopsy?

192
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,160
<5-11,House>这可能会留下脑...脑部损伤
<5-11,House>This could leave you b-b-b-brain damaged,

193
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,140
<5-11,House>你却还在担心那帮白人乡巴佬
<5-11,House>and you're worried about NASCAR dads?

194
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,800
<6-1,Foreman>这不是脑瘤
<6-1,Foreman>It's not a brain tumor.

195
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,450
<6-2,House>也不是细菌感染
<6-2,House>It's not a bacterial infection either.

196
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,060
<6-3,Cuddy>也就是说活检什么也没检出来
<6-3,Cuddy>So you biopsied his brain for nothing?

197
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,180
<6-4,House>如果真是这样
<6-4,House>If that were true,

198
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,500
<6-4,House>威尔森医生的嘴会张成那副鬼样子吗
<6-4,House>would Dr.Wilson's mouth be contorted into that ugly shape?

199
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,050
<6-5,Wilson>是弓浆虫病
<6-5,Wilson>It's toxoplasmosis.

200
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,230
<6-6,Foreman>你确定吗
<6-6,Foreman>You sure?

201
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,770
<6-7,House>也就是说伟大的黑人福音得了艾滋病
<6-7,House>Which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown AIDS.

202
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,280
<6-7,House>这在迪比克[民主党居多]肯定会引起轰动
<6-7,House>They're gonna love that in Dubuque.

203
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,340
<7-1,Foreman>弓浆虫是一种很常见的真菌
<7-1,Foreman>Toxoplasmosis is a fairly common fungus you can get...

204
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,460
<7-1,Foreman>吃了不熟的肉类
<7-1,Foreman>from eating under-cooked meat

205
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,250
<7-1,Foreman>或是触摸猫粪便都有可能染上
<7-1,Foreman>or touching cat feces.

206
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,060
<7-1,Foreman>在很小的几率下
<7-1,Foreman>In rare cases, the fungi travel

207
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,890
<7-1,Foreman>真菌会随血液流向大脑并附着
<7-1,Foreman>up the bloodstream and latch onto the brain,

208
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,160
<7-1,Foreman>导致损伤或是炎症反应
<7-1,Foreman>causing a lesion or inflammation.

209
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,340
<7-2,Senator>那能不能治愈
<7-2,Senator>So, what's the prognosis?

210
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,040
<7-3,Foreman>弓浆虫通常都可以治愈
<7-3,Foreman>Toxo usually responds to treatment,

211
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,860
<7-3,Foreman>但它只在一种情况下导致脑损伤
<7-3,Foreman>but it only causes a lesion in your brain

212
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,820
<7-3,Foreman>就是你的免疫系统原本已经很羸弱了
<7-3,Foreman>if your immune system is extremely weak to begin with.

213
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,890
<7-4,Senator>参议员先生  恐怕您患上了艾滋病
<7-4,Senator>Senator, I'm afraid you have AIDS.

214
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,370
<7-5,Foreman>我相信
<7-5,Foreman>As I'm sure-

215
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,070
<7-5,Foreman>-不可能  -我相信您知道
<7-5,Foreman>- No! - As I'm sure you know,

216
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,970
<7-5,Foreman>患上艾滋以后也能活很长时间
<7-5,Foreman>people with H.I.V. can live a long time.

217
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,380
<7-6,Senator>还有什么其他的可能
<7-6,Senator>What else could do this to me?

218
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,350
<7-7,Foreman>理论上说  也可能是某种癌症
<7-7,Foreman>Theoretically, certain cancers.

219
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,060
<7-8,House>大脑里有弓浆虫就必然是艾滋病
<7-8,House>If you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS.

220
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,040
<7-9,Senator>我没有得艾滋病
<7-9,Senator>I do not have AIDS.

221
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,170
<7-9,Senator>我从没注...注...注射过毒品
<7-9,Senator>I don't sh- sh- shoot up drugs.

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,290
<7-9,Senator>也从没嫖...嫖过
<7-9,Senator>I don't s-sleep with-

223
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,720
<7-10,House>我知道这是个噩耗  我也很同情你
<7-10,House>This is very bad news. I get that, and I sympathize.

224
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,010
<7-10,House>但你得快点渡过心理抵制期
<7-10,House>But we gotta speed through the denial phase

225
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,280
<7-10,House>因为你需要尽快服用抗逆转录病毒药物
<7-10,House>because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast.

226
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,890
<7-11,Senator>可你们根本没给我做HIV检测
<7-11,Senator>But-you haven't even tested me for H.I.V.!

227
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,650
<7-12,Foreman>-会做的  -但弓浆虫药物会惊扰真菌
<7-12,Foreman>- We will. - But the toxo drugs are gonna piss off your fungi.

228
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,310
<7-13,House>一旦真菌动怒以后
<7-13,House>And when fungi get pissed-

229
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,750
<7-14,Senator>我不会吃这种药
<7-14,Senator>I am not going to take the pills.

230
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,020
<7-15,House>你害怕会传扬出去
<7-15,House>You're afraid word will leak out.

231
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,730
<7-15,House>相信我  不管传不传扬你都当不了总统
<7-15,House>Trust me. You're not gonna be president either way.

232
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,440
<7-15,House>之所以叫白宫可不仅仅是因为墙面的颜色

271
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,520
<9-4,Senator>因为你认定会是阳性结果

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,600
<9-5,Foreman>-以我的经验  -病人总是说谎
<9-5,Foreman>- In my experience - Patients lie.

<9-9,Foreman>你认为我们更高尚一些
<9-9,Foreman>You figure we're morally superior?

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,730
<9-10,Senator>我自有我的理论
<9-10,Senator>I've got my theories.

279
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,520
<9-10,Senator>我们没法逃避
<9-10,Senator>No, we- we just can't get away with it.

282
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,640
<9-10,Senator>如果出现例外  那就不仅是个坏政客了
<9-10,Senator>And when it happens, it's not just a- a bad politician.

283

<9-10,Senator>他将是一个道德败坏典型
<9-10,Senator>It's- it's a bad role model.

284
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,270
<9-10,Senator>这将使
<9-10,Senator>It's a- a dis-

285
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,050
<9-10,Senator>我们种族的名誉受损
<9-10,Senator>discredit to the race.

<9-11,Foreman>-准备好了吗  -是的
<9-11,Foreman>- You ready? - Yeah Yeah

287
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,080
<9-11,Foreman>深呼吸
<9-11,Foreman>Take a deep breath.

288
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,630
<10-1,Cameron>豪斯医生  我只想...
<10-1,Cameron>Dr. House, I just wanted-

<10-3,Cameron>我想让你知道我们有多么...
<10-3,Cameron>I want you to know how much-

291
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,700
<10-4,House>懂了  你们感激涕零
<10-4,House>Got it. You're grateful.

292
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,390
<10-4,House>而且很明显你以为
<10-4,House>Apparently you seem to

293
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,050
<10-4,House>你们的感激之情对我意义重大
<10-4,House>think it will mean a lot to me to know that.

294
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,360
<10-5,Cameron>知道人们为什么向上帝祈祷吗
<10-5,Cameron>Do you know why people pray to God?

295
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,890
<10-6,House>-我以为你不信上帝  -的确如此
<10-6,House>- I thought you didn't believe in God. - I don't.

296
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,130
<10-8,House>但愿你能一语惊人
<10-8,House>Well, then you better be making a very good point.

297
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,740
<10-9,Cameron>你认为人们向他祈祷
<10-9,Cameron>Do you think they pray to him and

298
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,430
<10-9,Cameron>颂扬他是为了让他知道他的伟大吗
<10-9,Cameron>praise him because they want him to know how great he is?

299
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,820
<10-9,Cameron>上帝了解自己的伟大
<10-9,Cameron>God already knows that.

300
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,550
<10-10,House>你是在把我与上帝相提并论吗
<10-10,House>Are you comparing me to God?

301
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,420
<10-10,House>那很不错  不过我得说清楚
<10-10,House>I mean, that's great, but just so you know,

302
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,600
<10-10,House>我可从没创造过树木
<10-10,House>I've never made a tree.

303
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,560
<10-11,Cameron>我感谢你是因为这对我来说意义重大
<10-11,Cameron>I thank you because it means something to me...

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,900
<10-11,Cameron>要为自己所得心怀感恩
<10-11,Cameron>to be grateful for what I receive.

305
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,390
<10-12,House>你是我见过的最天真的无神论者
<10-12,House>You are the most naive atheist I've ever met.

306
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,690
<10-13,Clinic nurse>豪斯医生  有位病人在一号房等你
<10-13,Clinic nurse>Dr. House, you have a patient in room one.

307
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,390
<10-14,House>感谢上帝
<10-14,House>Thank God.

308
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,390
<10-14,House>人们祈祷是为了上帝不把他们捏死
<10-14,House>People pray so that God won't crush them like bugs.

309
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,950
<10-14,House>我不会捏死你的
<10-14,House>I'm not gonna crush you.

310
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,790
<11-1,Sarah>瘀伤
<11-1,Sarah>"Petechial" bruising?

311
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,020
<11-1,Sarah>不知道是不是叫这个
<11-1,Sarah>I don't know if I pronounced that right.

312
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,570
<11-2,House>上帝  互联网真是神通广大
<11-2,House>Gosh, the Internet is such a wonderful tool.

313
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,670
<11-3,Sarah>-可能是白血病  -绝对可能
<11-3,Sarah>- It could be leukemia. - Definitely possible.

314
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,520
<11-4,House>更有可能是吻痕
<11-4,House>The more likely diagnosis is hickey.

315
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,270
<11-5,Sarah>不可能是吻痕
<11-5,Sarah>Well, it can't be a hickey.

316
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,230
<11-6,House>怎么性生活突然变的羞于见人了
<11-6,House>Why is everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?

317
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,130
<11-7,Sarah>我现在没有性生活
<11-7,Sarah>I'm not having sex.

318
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,460
<11-7,Sarah>自从离婚以后我就没想过性生活
<11-7,Sarah>I've barely even thought about sex since my marriage.

319
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,730
<11-8,House>我说你做爱了  你说你没有
<11-8,House>I say you're having sex, you say you're not.

320
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,420
<11-8,House>要么你在说谎  要么是我诊断错误
<11-8,House>Either you're lying or I'm wrong.

321
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,570
<11-9,Sarah>-或者有第三种可能  -你指  口交
<11-9,Sarah>- Or there's some middle ground. - You mean, like, oral?

322
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,970
<11-10,House>我指的是你在不清醒的状态下做爱了
<11-10,House>I mean, you're having sex without knowing it.

323
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,090
<11-10,House>我要给你做酒精  毒品和γ-羟丁酸的检测
<11-10,House>I'm testing you for booze, drugs and G.H.B.

324
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,120
<11-11,Sarah>我不喝酒  什么是γ-羟丁酸
<11-11,Sarah>I don't drink or-what's G.H.B.?

<11-12,House>迷奸药
<11-12,House>The date-rape drug.

326
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,140
<11-12,House>是阳性
<11-12,House>It's positive.

327
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,420
<12-1,House>你的T细胞量只有8
<12-1,House>Your "T" Cell count is eight,

328
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,880
<12-1,House>意味着你很可能会死
<12-1,House>which means there's a good chance you'll die.

329
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,900
<12-1,House>我告诉你这些
<12-1,House>I'm telling you this because

330
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,690
<12-1,House>是因为我们要联系你的性伴侣
<12-1,House>we need to contact your sexual partners.

331
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,500
<12-2,Senator>自我妻子去世以后
<12-2,Senator>I've only had two girlfriends.

332
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,820
<12-2,Senator>我只交过两个女朋友  两个
<12-2,Senator>Two. After my wife died.

333
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,670
<12-2,Senator>我用避孕套的
<12-2,Senator>I used c-condoms.

334
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,510
<12-3,House>你知道戴着避孕套
<12-3,House>You know the chances of you getting H.I.V.

335
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,100
<12-3,House>与异性性交染上艾滋病的几率多低吗
<12-3,House>from heterosexual sex with a condom?

336
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,200
<12-4,Senator>知道
<12-4,Senator>Yes.

337
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,960
<12-5,House>或许有一天黑人会当总统
<12-5,House>Someday there will be a black president.

338
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,010
<12-5,House>或许有一天同性恋会当总统
<12-5,House>Someday there will be a gay president.

339
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,170
<12-5,House>或许有一天同性恋黑人会当总统
<12-5,House>Maybe there'll even be a gay, black president.

340
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,230
<12-5,House>但同性恋黑皮肤死人是肯定没有指望的
<12-5,House>But one combination I do not see happening is gay, black and dead.

341
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,500
<12-5,House>你必须对我说实话
<12-5,House>You need to stop lying to me.

342
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,290
<12-6,Senator>总把人往最阴暗的方面想  你一定很痛苦吧
<12-6,Senator>It must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.

343
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,090
<12-7,House>别废话了  你已经病入膏肓了
<12-7,House>Cut the crap. You're dying.

344
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,100
<12-8,Senator>你聪明  风趣却是懦夫一个
<12-8,Senator>And you're clever, you're witty and you are a coward.

345
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,930
<12-8,Senator>你害怕冒险
<12-8,Senator>You're scared of taking chances.

346
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,950
<12-9,House>我一直都在冒险
<12-9,House>I take chances all the time.

347

<12-9,House>-这是我最糟的特质  -对人也是吗
<12-9,House>- It's one of my worst qualities. - On people?

348
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,720
<12-11,House>对人性本善的愿景并不能使其成为现实
<12-11,House>Wanting to believe the best about people doesn't make it true.

349
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,420
<12-12,Senator>害怕相信也不能磨灭其可能性
<12-12,Senator>Being afraid to believe it doesn't make it false.

350
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,400
<12-13,House>太感人了  真遗憾我没投票
<12-13,House>Well, that's very moving. It's a shame I don't vote.

<12-14,Senator>这就是我  我相信他人
<12-14,Senator>This is who I am. I believe in people.

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,290
<12-14,Senator>我不是愤青
<12-14,Senator>I'm not hiply cynical,

353
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,230
<12-14,Senator>不会信口雌黄
<12-14,Senator>and I don't make easy, snide remarks.

354
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,670
<12-14,Senator>哪怕一次次的失望
<12-14,Senator>I would rather think that

355
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,850
<12-14,Senator>我还是愿意相信人性本善
<12-14,Senator>people are good and be disappointed once and again.

356
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,030
<12-15,House>我要再抽一点血
<12-15,House>I need to draw some more blood.

<14-1,Cuddy>抗逆转录病毒治疗无效
<14-1,Cuddy>The antiretrovirals aren't working.

359
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,640
<14-2,House>意料之中
<14-2,House>That's not surprising.

360
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,060
<14-3,Cuddy>他会持续恶化
<14-3,Cuddy>He's just gonna keep getting worse.

361
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,190
<14-3,Cuddy>你明白的  对吧
<14-3,Cuddy>You realize that, right?

362
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,060
<14-4,House>你干嘛对我的病例探头探脑的
<14-4,House>Why are you spying on my case?

363
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,770
<14-5,Cuddy>那你为什么下周要去做报告
<14-5,Cuddy>Why are you giving that speech next week?

364
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,410
<14-5,Cuddy>我们都只是履行职责而已
<14-5,Cuddy>We're both just doing what we have to do.

365
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,750
<14-6,House>你没看出这里面的问题吗
<14-6,House>You don't see a problem with that?

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,820
<14-7,Cuddy>关注一个病人有问题吗
<14-7,Cuddy>Checking in on a patient?

367

<14-7,Cuddy>是啊  我该如何自处啊
<14-7,Cuddy>Yeah, wow. How do I look myself in the mirror?

368
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,940
<14-8,House>你不会受他人指使
<14-8,House>You're not the one being asked

369
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,670
<14-8,House>而去欺骗美国人民
<14-8,House>to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.

370
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,950
<14-9,Cuddy>只是一个十分钟的报告而已
<14-9,Cuddy>It's a 10-minute speech.

371
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,260
<14-10,House>你们逼我就范
<14-10,House>That I've been ordered to give.

372
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,220
<14-11,Cuddy>-沃格勒的药有疗效  -我不管
<14-11,Cuddy>- Vogler's drug works. - Don't care.

373
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,750
<14-13,Cuddy>为什么你总是小题大作
<14-13,Cuddy>Why do you have to make everything so dramatic?

374
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,360
<14-14,House>我就是条小疯狗
<14-14,House>I'm a very high-strung little lap dog.

375
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,260
<15-1,House>别给他用药了
<15-1,House>No pills.

376
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,880
<15-2,Senator>怎么回事
<15-2,Senator>What's going on?

377
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,830
<15-3,House>抗逆转录病毒药物不起作用
<15-3,House>The antiretrovirals aren't working.

378
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,700
<15-4,Senator>为什么
<15-4,Senator>Why not?

379
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,880
<15-5,House>因为你没有得艾滋病
<15-5,House>Because you don't have AIDS.

380
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,820
<15-5,House>第一次的检测结果是假阳性
<15-5,House>The first test was a false positive.

<15-5,House>5000分之一的发生率
<15-5,House>Happens one time in every 5,000.

<15-6,Senator>你做了第二次吗

00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,310
<15-7,House>你依然危在旦夕
<15-7,House>You're still dying.

385
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,510
<15-7,House>唯一的区别是  现在我们不知道病因
<15-7,House>The only difference is, now we don't know why.

386
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,710
<16-1,Foreman>他的右侧肌力逐渐在丧失
<16-1,Foreman>He's continuing to lose control of the muscles on his right side.

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,770
<16-1,Foreman>大脑意识开始模糊
<16-1,Foreman>His brain is getting foggier,

<16-1,Foreman>T细胞计数仍是个位数
<16-1,Foreman>and his "T" Cells are still in single digits.

389
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,850
<16-2,Chase>我们为何在这里讨论
<16-2,Chase>Why are we doing this here?

390
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,960
<16-3,House>这样卡迪就找不到我们了
<16-3,House>So Cuddy can't find us.

391
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,220
<16-3,House>除非我们能找到潜在的病因
<16-3,House>Unless we figure out the underlying disease,

392
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,090
<16-3,House>这家伙就对他最后的选民撒谎了
<16-3,House>this guy's lied to his last constituent.

<16-9,House>Idiopathic- from the Latin meaning

399
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,650
<16-9,House>"我们是傻瓜"  因为我们找不到病因
<16-9,House>"We're idiots" 'cause we can't figure out what's causing it.

400
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,110
<16-9,House>给他做个全身扫描

<16-10,Cameron>-你讨厌全身扫描的  -因为没用
<16-10,Cameron>- You hate whole body scans. - 'Cause they're useless.

402
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,660
<16-11,House>给我们中任何一个做个扫描
<16-11,House>Could probably scan any one of us

403
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,930
<16-11,House>就能发现5个不同肿瘤疑似物
<16-11,House>and find five different doodads that look like cancer.

404
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,250
<16-11,House>但橄榄球赛中  完成4次进攻

<16-11,House>你不会采取带球从中路突破的战术
<16-11,House>you don't call a running play up the middle,

407
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,450
<16-11,House>除非你是喷气式飞机

<16-12,Cameron>I hate sports metaphors.

409
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,050
<17-1,Wilson>你为何做了第二次艾滋检测
<17-1,Wilson>Why did you order the second AIDS test?

410
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,530
<17-2,House>标准程序
<17-2,House>Standard procedure.

411

<17-3,Wilson>那么  你是"标准程序先生"了
<17-3,Wilson>Oh, well, that's you- Mr. Standard Procedure.

412
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,580
<17-3,Wilson>你怀疑第一次检测结果是假阳性
<17-3,Wilson>You suspected the first test was a false positive?

<17-4,House>我知道他去了非洲
<17-4,House>I knew he was going to Africa,

414
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,350
<17-4,House>我想他接种了甲肝和乙肝的疫苗
<17-4,House>and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep "A" And "B."

415
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,810
<17-4,House>可能导致假阳性
<17-4,House>That could cause a false positive.

416
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,090
<17-5,Wilson>你做第一次检测前就知道了
<17-5,Wilson>You knew that before you ordered the first test.

419
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,510
<17-7,Wilson>你和他聊天后  你就产生了怀疑
<17-7,Wilson>Then you talked to him, then you had doubts.

420
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,040
<17-7,Wilson>他说什么了
<17-7,Wilson>What did he say?

<17-8,House>他说他没有任何危险性行为
<17-8,House>He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.

422
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,570
<17-9,Wilson>你相信他了
<17-9,Wilson>And you believed him.

423
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
<17-10,House>他没必要撒谎
<17-10,House>He didn't have any reason to lie.

<17-12,House>所以你没对她采取行动吗

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,370
<17-13,Wilson>你凭什么以为我没对她采取行动
<17-13,Wilson>What makes you think I haven't put the moves on her?

<17-23,House>If nothing else, it will get you away from your ex for a night.

460
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,920
<18-1,Wilson>左侧腋窝淋巴结略微肿大
<18-1,Wilson>Slightly enlarged lymph node in his left armpit.

461
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,160
<18-3,Wilson>-多略微  -2.5毫米
<18-3,Wilson>- How slightly? - Quarter mil.

462
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,780
<18-4,Cuddy>-淋巴癌吗  -没错
<18-4,Cuddy>- Lymphoma? - Sure.

463
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,790
<18-5,House>不然就是他六个月内得过感冒
<18-5,House>Or he's had a cold in the last six months.

464
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,470
<18-5,House>怎么  你把她设在快速拨号了吗
<18-5,House>What, you got her on speed dial?

465
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,100
<18-6,Cuddy>我是嗅着傲慢的气息来的
<18-6,Cuddy>I just follow the scent of arrogance.

466
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,380
<18-7,Chase>这里有另一个略微肿大的淋巴结
<18-7,Chase>Another slightly enlarged node over here.

467
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,630
<18-7,Chase>外加颈部的两个和腹股沟的一个
<18-7,Chase>Two more in his neck and one in his groin.

468
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,840
<18-8,Wilson>肝区还有个囊肿
<18-8,Wilson>And there's a cyst in his liver.

469
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,250
<18-9,Cameron>看着复杂  中心性坏死吗
<18-9,Cameron>It looks complex. Central necrosis?

470
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,300
<18-10,House>自发性出血  是良性的
<18-10,House>Spontaneous bleeding. It's benign.

471
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,700
<18-10,House>我支持有个很酷的肿瘤
<18-10,House>I was rooting for a really cool tumor.

472
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,630
<18-10,House>不然我们就在这个废物上耗死了
<18-10,House>instead we're stuck with this crap.

473
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,950
<18-11,Cuddy>无所谓  一旦找到它们  就得检查它们
<18-11,Cuddy>Doesn't matter. Once you find 'em, you gotta check 'em.

474
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,540
<18-12,House>把你们累死
<18-12,House>Knock yourselves out.

475
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,650
<18-13,Vogler>我刚见了怀特参议员
<18-13,Vogler>I just saw Senator Wright.

476
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,770
<18-13,Vogler>他看着糟糕透顶
<18-13,Vogler>He looks like hell.

477
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,260
<18-13,Vogler>看来那个寿司比你想的糟得多
<18-13,Vogler>That sushi must've been a lot worse than you thought.

478
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,560
<18-14,House>沃格勒先生  想要来个免费全身扫描吗
<18-14,House>Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan?

479
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,950
<18-14,House>你这体型  一年至少得检查3次
<18-14,House>A man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year.

480
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,560
<18-15,Vogler>这里是一些你在发言中得提到的重点
<18-15,Vogler>Here's a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.

481
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,450
<18-16,House>14页
<18-16,House>Fourteen pages.

482
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,940
<18-16,House>听众听到第二段就要昏昏欲睡了
<18-16,House>The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.

483
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,900
<18-17,Vogler>插个笑话
<18-17,Vogler>Throw in a joke.

484
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,970
<18-18,House>奇斯医生  我们得谈谈
<18-18,House>Dr. Chase, we need to talk.

485
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,660
<19-1,House>-你看这事怎么解决  -什么怎么解决
<19-1,House>- How do you see this ending? - What ending?

486
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,160
<19-3,House>我不能解雇你  所以不用怕我
<19-3,House>I can't fire you, so you have no reason to fear me and,

487
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,470
<19-3,House>因而也没必要对我撒谎
<19-3,House>therefore, no reason to lie to me.

488
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,370
<19-3,House>是你告诉卡迪我在哪里
<19-3,House>You told Cuddy where I was.

489
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,030
<19-3,House>是你告诉沃格勒我在干什么
<19-3,House>You told Vogler what I was doing.

490
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,460
<19-5,House>-对  -那么我还怎么和你共事
<19-5,House>- Yeah. - So how can I work with you?

491
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,100
<19-6,Chase>你别无选择
<19-6,Chase>Well, you don't have a choice.

492
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,150
<20-1,Foreman>可能有点疼
<20-1,Foreman>This might hurt a little.

493
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,310
<20-2,Senator>骗我吧
<20-2,Senator>Lie to me.

494
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,060
<20-3,Foreman>好吧  会像是个柔和的按摩
<20-3,Foreman>Okay. It'll feel like a gentle massage.

495
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,050
<20-3,Foreman>豪斯
<20-3,Foreman>House...

496
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,690
<20-4,Senator>是个差劲的老师
<20-4,Senator>is a lousy teacher.

497
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,510
<20-4,Senator>你不能为了芝麻绿豆大的事撒谎
<20-4,Senator>You can't lie for beans.

498
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,620
<20-5,Foreman>你有撒过弥天大谎吗
<20-5,Foreman>Have you ever told any really big ones?

499
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,130
<20-6,Senator>我可能很糟糕  但还没迷糊到那个份上
<20-6,Senator>I might be messed up, but I'm not that out of it.

500
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,380
<20-7,Foreman>摁下他的手臂
<20-7,Foreman>Strap his arm down.

501
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,290
<20-8,Senator>我会没事吗
<20-8,Senator>Am I going to be okay?

502
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,290
<20-9,Foreman>但愿如此
<20-9,Foreman>I hope so.

503
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,250
<21-1,House>我在出卖我的灵魂
<21-1,House>I am selling my soul.

504
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,640
<21-2,Wilson>就一小块  况且你也不是白白付出
<21-2,Wilson>Just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.

505
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,910
<21-3,House>我说出卖  没说送人了
<21-3,House>I said I was selling it. Didn't say I was giving it away.

506
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,440
<21-3,House>不然我真是缺德愚蠢
<21-3,House>That would be immoral and stupid.

507
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,150
<21-3,House>他们就只加了点抗酸剂
<21-3,House>All they've done is add an antacid.

508
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,170
<21-4,Wilson>-有用吗  -这不是重点
<21-4,Wilson>- Does it work? - That's not the point.

509
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,210
<21-5,House>当然是重点  他一没请你撒谎
<21-5,House>Of course it's the point. He's not asking you to lie.

510
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,000
<21-6,Wilson>二没请你做犯法的事
<21-6,Wilson>He's not asking you to do something illegal.

511
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,500
<21-7,House>他这根本不是在请我做事
<21-7,House>He's not asking me to do anything.

512
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,670
<21-8,Wilson>也不是命令你啊
<21-8,Wilson>He's not ordering you.

513
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,170
<21-8,Wilson>他让你选择  你选择了你的团队
<21-8,Wilson>He gave you a choice. You chose your staff.

514
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,120
<21-8,Wilson>我知道对你来说不容易  你会痛苦
<21-8,Wilson>I know this isn't easy for you. You'll suffer.

515
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,070
<21-8,Wilson>泽西的维科丁销量会增至三倍
<21-8,Wilson>Vicodin sales in Jersey will triple.

516
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,000
<21-8,Wilson>不过你在做好事
<21-8,Wilson>But you are doing a good thing.

517
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,030
<21-8,Wilson>只有你会觉得做好事很不爽
<21-8,Wilson>Only you could feel like crap about doing something good.

518
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,740
<21-9,Foreman>肾脏和肝脏的囊肿都是良性的
<21-9,Foreman>Kidney and liver cysts are both benign,

519
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,730
<21-9,Foreman>而且淋巴结都没有问题
<21-9,Foreman>and the lymph nodes all came back clean.

520
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,870
<21-10,House>他左侧淋巴结CD11抗体阳性
<21-10,House>His left armpit node has antibodies for CD11.

521
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,680
<21-11,Wilson>不足以表明是淋巴癌
<21-11,Wilson>Not enough to indicate lymphoma.

522
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,320
<21-12,House>我们从未检测过毛细胞白血病
<21-12,House>We never tested for hairy cell leukemia.

523
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,050
<21-13,Wilson>没有  但我们会在淋巴以外
<21-13,Wilson>No, but we would have picked it up

524
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,360
<21-13,Wilson>其它地方发现的
<21-13,Wilson>somewhere else besides one lymph node.

525
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,010
<21-14,Chase>而且他的脾脏没有肿大
<21-14,Chase>And his spleen isn't enlarged.

526
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,110
<21-15,House>大小不能代表一切
<21-15,House>Size isn't everything.

527
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,390
<21-15,House>脾脏是毛细胞的主要来源
<21-15,House>The spleen is the mother lode for hairy cells.

528
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,000
<21-15,House>开刀
<21-15,House>Let's cut it open.

529
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,460
<21-16,Chase>不能活检脾脏  会流血不止的
<21-16,Chase>You can't biopsy his spleen. It'll bleed like stink.

530
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,450
<21-17,Cuddy>以参议员的状况
<21-17,Cuddy>In the senator's condition,

531
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,500
<21-17,Cuddy>脾脏活检很容易引发败血症并致死
<21-17,Cuddy>a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him.

532
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,600
<21-18,House>你为何要对我这样
<21-18,House>Why do you do this to me?

533
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,010
<21-18,House>现在要是我杀了他
<21-18,House>Now if I kill him,

534
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,220
<21-18,House>我就不能告诉法官我事先不知道有危险
<21-18,House>I can't tell the judge I had no idea of the risks involved.

535
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,390
<21-19,Foreman>他的大脑在变成浆糊
<21-19,Foreman>His brain is turning into mush,

536
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,510
<21-19,Foreman>而且他有更多感染的危险  我们必须做
<21-19,Foreman>and he's at risk for more infections. We have to do it.

537
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,320
<21-20,House>看见了  在法庭上这么说好多了
<21-20,House>See? That'll sound much better in court.

538
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,810
<21-20,House>行  去告诉我们的人肉针垫
<21-20,House>Okay. Go tell our human pincushion

539
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,480
<21-20,House>我们要再多扎他一次
<21-20,House>we'll be sticking him one more time.

540
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,970
<21-20,House>卡迪
<21-20,House>Cuddy.

541
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,650
<21-20,House>你不是讨厌这么做吗
<21-20,House>Don't you hate doing this?

542
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,530
<21-20,House>讨厌
<21-20,House>Yeah.

543
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,160
<22-1,Cameron>怎么了
<22-1,Cameron>What's up?

544
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,290
<22-2,House>你喜欢我
<22-2,House>You like me.

545
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,370
<22-2,House>为什么
<22-2,House>Why?

546
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,760
<22-3,Cameron>这个问题有点伤感
<22-3,Cameron>That's kind of a sad question.

547
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,950
<22-4,House>我就是想弄明白你看上我哪点
<22-4,House>I'm just trying to figure out what makes you tick.

548
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,240
<22-4,House>我不热情也不迷糊
<22-4,House>I am not warm and fuzzy,

549
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,130
<22-4,House>而你是从小受人呵护的乖宝宝
<22-4,House>and you are basically a stuffed animal made by Grandma.

550
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,660
<22-5,Cameron>你不是因为这个才问的
<22-5,Cameron>I don't think that's why you're asking.

551
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,180
<22-5,Cameron>我想是因为那个发言
<22-5,Cameron>I think this is because of the speech.

552
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,160
<22-6,House>上帝  别把我给分尸了
<22-6,House>God, don't try and pick me apart.

553
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,380
<22-7,Cameron>那么你为何要问
<22-7,Cameron>Then why are you asking?

554
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,800
<22-7,Cameron>你想听什么
<22-7,Cameron>What do you want to hear?

555
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,100
<23-1,Foreman>参议员  我们还要做个脾脏活检
<23-1,Foreman>Hey, Senator. We need to do one more biopsy on your spleen.

556
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,860
<23-2,Senator>我不得不用左手签
<23-2,Senator>I'll have to sign lefty.

557
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,420
<23-2,Senator>我的手指不听使唤
<23-2,Senator>My fingers aren't working.

558
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,230
<23-3,Foreman>你经常咳嗽吗
<23-3,Foreman>Have you been coughing a lot?

559
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,930
<23-3,Foreman>疼吗
<23-3,Foreman>Does it hurt?

560
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,850
<23-4,Senator>像是我无法呼吸
<23-4,Senator>It's like I can't get air.

561
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,630
<23-4,Senator>是弓浆虫导致的吗
<23-4,Senator>Is that from the toxo?

562
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,360
<23-5,Foreman>不  这...这是新症状
<23-5,Foreman>No. This is-This is new.

563
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,750
<23-5,Foreman>你不用签了  不能做活检
<23-5,Foreman>You don't need to sign. We can't do the biopsy.

564
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,580
<23-5,Foreman>参议员的呼吸系统严重受损
<23-5,Foreman>The senator's breathing is severely impaired.

565
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,700
<24-1,Foreman>他的血氧饱和度是89
<24-1,Foreman>His O2 sat levels are at 89.

566
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,890
<24-1,Foreman>银染显示卡氏肺囊虫肺炎
<24-1,Foreman>His silver stain indicates Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

567
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,860
<24-2,Wilson>另一个致死真菌  和毛细胞白血病相符
<24-2,Wilson>Another killer fungus. It's consistent with hairy cell leukemia.

568
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,190
<24-3,Foreman>但我们不能活检脾脏  呼吸窘迫
<24-3,Foreman>But we can't biopsy his spleen. Respiratory distress.

569
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,580
<24-3,Foreman>他的血小板是20  还在下降
<24-3,Foreman>His platelets are 20 and dropping.

570
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,850
<24-3,Foreman>他的凝血系统不能形成有效血栓
<24-3,Foreman>His blood won't clot worth a damn.

571
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,040
<24-4,Cameron>一定有其它方法诊断毛细胞
<24-4,Cameron>There's gotta be another way to diagnose hairy cell.

572
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,630
<24-5,Wilson>不  他的骨髓检测也不能确诊
<24-5,Wilson>No. His bone marrow's indeterminate.

573
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,720
<24-5,Wilson>只能做脾脏活检
<24-5,Wilson>Spleen biopsy's the only way to go.

574
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,400
<24-5,Wilson>你知道
<24-5,Wilson>You know,

575

<24-6,House>因纽特人钓鱼时  他们不找鱼
<24-6,House>when the Inuit go fishing, they don't look for fish.

576
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,280
<24-7,Wilson>为什么呢  豪斯医生
<24-7,Wilson>Why, Dr. House?

577
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,470
<24-8,House>他们找蓝鹭
<24-8,House>They look for the blue heron

578
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,350
<24-8,House>因为没法看到鱼
<24-8,House>because there's no way to see the fish.

579
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,630
<24-8,House>但只要有鱼  就会有鸟抓鱼
<24-8,House>But if there's fish, there's gonna be birds fishing.

580
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,310
<24-8,House>现在  要是他有毛细胞白血病
<24-8,House>Now, if he's got hairy cell,

581
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,390
<24-8,House>那我们能看到什么在上空盘旋呢
<24-8,House>what else should we see circling overhead?

582
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,730
<24-9,Chase>他该有各种少见的病毒

<24-11,House>我们可以检测它们  做病毒评定
<24-11,House>We can test for them. Run the titers.

00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,660
<25-1,House>看  慢波睡眠的突然跳跃
<25-1,House>Now, here it comes. There's an abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep.

587
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,570
<25-1,House>说明你有局部睡眠觉醒
<25-1,House>This indicates partial sleep arousal.

<25-2,Sarah>所以我起床时总觉得疲惫
<25-2,Sarah>That would explain why I'm so tired when I wake up.

<25-7,House>Okay. But he probably didn't know that you were asleep.

596
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,590
<25-7,House>睡眠性交与正常情况无异
<25-7,House>Sexsomniacs can act pretty normal.

<26-3,Foreman>坦白说  我觉得你是个自私自利的混蛋
<26-3,Foreman>Frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,630
<26-5,Foreman>并不表示是毛细胞  两者毫无关联
<26-5,Foreman>It doesn't point to hairy cell. It's irrelevant.

<27-2,House>8岁时  你没有从秋千上摔下来

00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,640
<28-5,Cameron>他用了苯妥因
<28-5,Cameron>He took phenytoin.

639
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,570
<28-5,Cameron>该药和Eb病毒共同作用
<28-5,Cameron>That drug, with the Epstein-Barr virus,

640
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,710
<28-5,Cameron>引发了常见变异型免疫缺陷病
<28-5,Cameron>is associated with common variable immunodeficiency disease.

<28-5,Cameron>T细胞下降  B细胞下降

642
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,620
<28-4,House>导致身体无法产生足够抗体
<28-4,House>Keeps you from forming enough antibodies.

643
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,570
<28-4,House>抗体是防御的根本
<28-4,House>See, the antibodies are basically your defensive line.

644
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,700
<28-3,Foreman>而你的大脑就像是四分卫
<28-3,Foreman>And your brain is like the quarterback.

645
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,900
<28-3,Foreman>然后真菌好比
<28-3,Foreman>And then the fungi are like

646
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,810
<28-3,Foreman>闪电后卫突进到中路
<28-3,Foreman>blitzing linebackers plunging up the middle.

647
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,140

651
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,690
<28-2,House>对  你说的时候是个蠢主意
<28-2,House>Yeah. Well, it was a stupid idea when you said it.

652
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,720
<28-2,House>然后他有了呼吸系统问题
<28-2,House>Then he got the respiratory problem,

653
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,770
<26-4,House>且Eb病毒检测阳性
<26-4,House>and he tested positive for Epstein-Barr.

654
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,630
<28-3,Foreman>那个通常是儿童病吧
<28-3,Foreman>That's pretty much a childhood disease.

655
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,200
<28-4,House>这是另一个说奇斯的建议蠢的缘故
<28-4,House>That's another reason why Chase's suggestion was idiotic.

656
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,650
<28-4,House>他小时候染上该病
<28-4,House>He got it when he was a kid.

657
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,800
<28-4,House>直到现在出现症状  有这种情况
<28-4,House>He didn't get any symptoms until now. It happens.

658
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,730
<28-4,House>由压力引发  比如公开演讲
<28-4,House>It gets triggered by stress- like public speaking.

659
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,220
<28-5,Cameron>那么你的诊断是基于
<28-5,Cameron>So you're basing your diagnosis on a virus

660
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,000
<28-5,Cameron>一个常见的病毒和他30年前用的药
<28-5,Cameron>that's relatively common and a drug he took 30 years ago.

661
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,560
<28-6,House>马上给参议员静注免疫球蛋白
<28-6,House>Start the Senator on I.V. immunoglobulin, stat.

662
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,700
<28-6,House>若他好转  我对

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,110
<30-14,House>就像你说的  我得接受现实
<30-14,House>And like you said, I... have to live with reality.

684
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,670
<30-15,Senator>那么我参选
<30-15,Senator>Well, then I'm running.

685
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,590
<30-16,Foreman>真有你的
<30-16,Foreman>Good for you.

686
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,430
<30-17,Senator>先别激动  他说的对  我赢不了
<30-17,Senator>Now, don't get excited. He's right. I, uh- I won't win.

687
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,400
<30-18,House>那么为什么要参选
<30-18,House>Then why run?

688
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,300
<30-19,Senator>我懂  你的意思是
<30-19,Senator>Oh, I see. Your point being,

689
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,180
<30-19,Senator>唯有赢得每一场战斗才谓之有所作为
<30-19,Senator>the only way to make a difference is to win every fight.

690
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,550
<31-1,Vogler>为何要听我的
<31-1,Vogler>Why listen to me?

691
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,950
<31-1,Vogler>我是公司老总  显然信不过  对吗
<31-1,Vogler>I own the company. I'm certainly not to be trusted, right?

692
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,030
<31-1,Vogler>然而  格雷戈·豪斯医生
<31-1,Vogler>Dr. Greg House, on the other hand,

693
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:13,080
<31-1,Vogler>一直以正直著称
<31-1,Vogler>has a reputation for integrity, among other things.

694
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,110
<31-1,Vogler>女士们先生们  欢迎格雷戈·豪斯医生
<31-1,Vogler>Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Greg House.

<31-2,House>东溪医药有着致力于研发的非凡承诺
<31-2,House>Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals' extraordinary commitment to research excellence...

696
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,670
<31-2,House>如他们的新血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂
<31-2,House>is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor,

697
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,760
<31-2,House>是医学上的突破
<31-2,House>a breakthrough medical approach

698
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,790
<31-2,House>将使数百万人远离心脏疾病
<31-2,House>that will protect millions from heart disease.

699
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,490
<31-3,Vogler>那不是发言
<31-3,Vogler>That's not a speech.

700
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,250
<31-4,House>我觉得很精练
<31-4,House>I thought it was pithy.

701
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,810
<31-4,House>不管怎样  写新闻稿足够了
<31-4,House>You got enough for a press release anyhow.

702
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,650
<31-5,Vogler>福曼还是卡梅隆
<31-5,Vogler>Foreman or Cameron.

703
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,280
<31-5,Vogler>有几点我忘了说了
<31-5,Vogler>A few things I forgot to mention.

704
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,920
<31-6,House>爱德·沃格勒是个出色的商人
<31-6,House>Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessman,

705
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,640
<31-6,House>对人作出英明的评价
<31-6,House>a brilliant judge of people...

706
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,660
<31-6,House>从未失败过
<31-6,House>and a man who has never lost a fight.

707
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,230
<31-6,House>你们知道我是如何知道
<31-6,House>You know how I know

708
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,000
<31-6,House>新血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂有效的吗
<31-6,House>that the new ACE inhibitor is good?

709
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,410
<31-6,House>因为老的就有效
<31-6,House>'Cause the old one was good.

710
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,820
<31-6,House>新的其实一样  就是更贵
<31-6,House>The new one is really the same, just more expensive.

711
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,060
<31-6,House>贵好多
<31-6,House>A lot more expensive.

712
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,740
<31-6,House>你看  又一个例子说明爱德的才华
<31-6,House>You see, that's another example of Ed's brilliance.

713
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,770
<31-6,House>当他的药物要丧失专利保护的时候
<31-6,House>Whenever one of his drugs is about to lose its patent,

714
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,270
<31-6,House>他让他的小喽罗改变
<31-6,House>he has his boys and girls alter

715
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,290
<31-6,House>药物那么一丁点  就又有专利保护了
<31-6,House>it just a tiny bit, patent it all over again,

716
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,570
<31-6,House>不仅制造一个毫无意义的新药
<31-6,House>making not just a pointless new pill,

717
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,050
<31-6,House>还创造了数百万的财富
<31-6,House>but millions and millions of dollars.

718
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,900
<31-6,House>对大家都好  不是吗
<31-6,House>Which is good for everybody, right?

719
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,150
<31-6,House>除了病人  不过  谁在乎呢
<31-6,House>Except the patients. But- who cares?

720
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,420
<31-6,House>他们就是病得太厉害罢了
<31-6,House>They're just so damn sick.

721
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,760
<31-6,House>反正上帝显然从未垂青他们
<31-6,House>God obviously never liked them anyway.

722
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,770
<31-6,House>在座各位健康人士
<31-6,House>All the healthy people in the room,

724
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,270
<31-6,House>我插了个笑话
<31-6,House>I threw in a joke.

725
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,290
<31-6,House>抱歉
<31-6,House>I'm sorry.

726
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,810
<32-1,House>我该多吃几片维科丁的
<32-1,House>I should've taken an extra couple of Vicodin

727
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,960
<32-1,House>好克制住自己
<32-1,House>and just held my nose.

728
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,430
<32-2,Cameron>-我猜你也吃多维科丁了  -没错
<32-2,Cameron>- I'm guessing you did take a couple extra Vicodin. - True.

729
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,970
<32-4,Cameron>你不用担心解雇谁  我走
<32-4,Cameron>You don't need to worry about firing anyone. I'm leaving.

730
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,890
<32-4,Cameron>为什么
<32-4,Cameron>Why?

731
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,770
<32-5,House>又要表现出高尚的自我牺牲的姿态吗
<32-5,House>Is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture?

732
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,100
<32-5,House>-你要保护福曼吗  -不
<32-5,House>- Are you trying to protect Foreman? - No.

733
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,270
<32-7,House>那么就是"不用解雇我  我辞职"吗
<32-7,House>So this is just, "Don't fire me. I quit"?

734
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,630
<32-7,House>我在保护我自己
<32-7,House>I'm protecting myself.

735
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,820
<32-8,Cameron>你问我为何喜欢你
<32-8,Cameron>You asked me why I like you.

736
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,390
<32-8,Cameron>你粗暴无礼
<32-8,Cameron>You're abrasive and rude.

737
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,520
<32-8,Cameron>但我以为  你做的每件事
<32-8,Cameron>But I figured, everything you do,

738
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,870
<32-8,Cameron>都是为了帮助别人
<32-8,Cameron>you do it to help people.

739
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,390
<32-8,Cameron>不过我错了
<32-8,Cameron>But I was wrong.

740
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,330
<32-8,Cameron>你做  是因为那是正确的
<32-8,Cameron>You do it because it's right.

741
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,620
<32-8,Cameron>我处理事情只有两个办法
<32-8,Cameron>There are only two ways that I can deal with things.

742
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,700
<32-8,Cameron>一个是在我控制之中
<32-8,Cameron>One is in my control.

743
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,890
<32-8,Cameron>另一个就是离开
<32-8,Cameron>That's to leave.

744
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,200
<32-8,Cameron>再见  豪斯
<32-8,Cameron>Good-bye, House.
