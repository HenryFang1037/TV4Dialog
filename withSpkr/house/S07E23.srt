1
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,560
<1-1,Cuddy>这样  可以了吗
<1-1,Cuddy>Are we, uh, almost done here?

2
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,640
<1-1,Cuddy>我得给我妈打电话
<1-1,Cuddy>I have to call my mother,

3
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,840
<1-1,Cuddy>接我女儿  通知医院
<1-1,Cuddy>get my daughter, call the hospital.

4
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,670
<1-2,Officer Soltes>那么他没有威胁你是吗
<1-2,Officer Soltes>So he didn't threaten you?

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,570
<1-3,Cuddy>没有
<1-3,Cuddy>No.

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,060
<1-4,Soltes>-也没有动手吗  -不算是吧
<1-4,Soltes>- No fight? - Not really.

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,310
<1-6,Soltes>听着像是有
<1-6,Soltes>Sounds like a yes.

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,470
<1-6,Soltes>有没有任何迹象表明会发生这样的事呢
<1-6,Soltes>Was there any indication that something would happen?

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,930
<1-6,Soltes>有
<1-6,Soltes>Yeah...

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,780
<1-7,Cuddy>我和他度过的每一分钟都是预示
<1-7,Cuddy>Every moment I spent with him.

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,320
<1-7,Cuddy>他总是伺机要惹出些什么事
<1-7,Cuddy>He's always waiting for something to happen.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,730
<1-7,Cuddy>但这次
<1-7,Cuddy>But this...

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,520
<1-8,Soltes>知道他会在哪吗
<1-8,Soltes>And no idea where he is?

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,800
<1-9,Cuddy>不知道
<1-9,Cuddy>No.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,120
<1-10,Soltes>出现这种矛盾
<1-10,Soltes>These domestic situations,

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,430
<1-10,Soltes>你想息事宁人也挺正常的
<1-10,Soltes>it's not uncommon to get cold feet.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,310
<1-11,Cuddy>你是让我提起诉讼吗
<1-11,Cuddy>Are you asking me to file charges?

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,830
<1-11,Cuddy>那赶紧给我那些文件
<1-11,Cuddy>Just give me the paperwork.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,820
<1-11,Cuddy>如果格利高里·豪斯敢再踏入我的医院
<1-11,Cuddy>If Greg House steps foot in my hospital again,

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,640
<1-11,Cuddy>或是在其它任何地方接近我
<1-11,Cuddy>comes anywhere near me.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,770
<1-11,Cuddy>我就让他进监狱
<1-11,Cuddy>I want him thrown in jail.

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,260
<1-11,Cuddy>后期:
<1-11,Cuddy>A.PN

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,120
<1-11,Cuddy>总监：
<1-11,Cuddy>zlean  sephiroth_8

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,100
<1-11,Cuddy>那么
<1-11,Cuddy>So...

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,650
<1-12,Female Patron>我们想用什么都可以吗
<1-12,Female Patron>we can use any of these?

43
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,580
<1-13,Luca>可以
<1-13,Luca>Yeah.

44
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,160
<1-14,Female Patron>然后对她干什么都行吗
<1-14,Female Patron>And just do whatever we want to her?

45
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,810
<1-15,Luca>那就是它们的用处
<1-15,Luca>That's what they're there for.

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,280
<2-1,House>哎  我们正看到精彩处
<2-1,House>Hey. We were just getting to the good part.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,450
<2-2,Chase>有精彩的部分吗  这只是表演艺术
<2-2,Chase>Is there a good part? It was performance art.

48
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,400
<2-3,Thirteen>那是阿夫松·哈米德  她是个天才
<2-3,Thirteen>That's Afsoun Hamidi. She's a genius.

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,160
<2-3,Thirteen>前不久刚得了麦克阿瑟奖
<2-3,Thirteen>She just won the MacArthur,

50
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,190
<2-3,Thirteen>合法证明了这点
<2-3,Thirteen>legally proving it.

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,060
<2-3,Thirteen>还在泰特现代美术馆办了特展
<2-3,Thirteen>Just had a retrospective at the Tate Modern.

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,980
<2-3,Thirteen>-没人读《纽约客》吗  -没有
<2-3,Thirteen>- Nobody reads The New Yorker? - Nope.

54
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,290
<2-4,House>但我订阅了她的患者档案
<2-4,House>But I subscribe to her patient file.

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,850
<2-5,Chase>豪斯  你该休息
<2-5,Chase>House, you should relax.

56
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,600
<2-5,Chase>你今早才手术完
<2-5,Chase>You had surgery this morning.

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,910
<2-6,House>小手术而已  移动一条引流管
<2-6,House>Minor surgery, removing a drain.

58
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,470
<2-7,Chase>是大手术时安装的
<2-7,Chase>Put there during major surgery.

59
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,890
<2-8,House>我医生说只要我不离开病床
<2-8,House>My doctor says it's okay

60
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,380
<2-8,House>就没关系
<2-8,House>as long as I don't leave my hospital bed.

61
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,030
<2-9,Taub>哪个说的  苏斯博士还是J博士
<2-9,Taub>Which doctor was that-- Seuss or J?

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,130
<2-10,House>护士
<2-10,House>Nurse.

64
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,840
<2-11,Nurse>豪拉尼医生在病历里写了
<2-11,Nurse>Dr. Hourani wrote it in his chart.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,490
<2-12,Thirteen>我很惊讶他竟然同意了
<2-12,Thirteen>I'm surprised he approved it.

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,670
<2-12,Thirteen>我更惊讶的是你竟然还问了一下
<2-12,Thirteen>I'm more surprised you actually asked.

67
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,220
<2-13,House>我现在做事就是这样有礼貌
<2-13,House>I do things like that now.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,770
<2-13,House>我要做出一些改变
<2-13,House>I'm making some changes...

69
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,580
<2-13,House>比如跳到第三十七分钟
<2-13,House>like skipping ahead to minute 37.

70
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,990
<2-14,Chase>那是什么  涂料稀释剂吗
<2-14,Chase>What is that-- paint thinner?

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,350
<2-15,Chase>我可不想看一个女人被点燃
<2-15,Chase>I'm not gonna watch a woman get set on fire.

72
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,680
<2-16,House>没教养的
<2-16,House>Philistine.

73
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,210
<2-17,Thirteen>那个拿着笔记本
<2-17,Thirteen>Who's the guy with the notebook

74
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,760
<2-17,Thirteen>内心很纠结的人是谁
<2-17,Thirteen>who can't decide what to do?

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,660
<2-18,House>她的助手
<2-18,House>Her assistant.

76
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,910
<2-18,House>她命令他不得干预
<2-18,House>He's been instructed not to intervene.

77
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,060
<2-18,House>剧透提示  他还是干预了
<2-18,House>Spoiler alert-- he does.

78
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,810
<2-18,House>对她来说  还真是"心碎一地"
<2-18,House>For her, it is literally heartbreaking.

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,840
<2-18,House>游戏开始
<2-18,House>Let the games begin.

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,210
<2-19,Chase>心律失常  红细胞比容升高
<2-19,Chase>Arrhythmia, high hematocrit,

81
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,440
<2-19,Chase>还有非一致性的变异率
<2-19,Chase>and inconsistent RR variability.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,910
<2-20,Foreman>你遗漏了第四个症状
<2-20,Foreman>You forgot about the fourth symptom--

83
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,960
<2-20,Foreman>她就是个疯子
<2-20,Foreman>being completely crazy.

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,880
<2-21,Thirteen>别人笑我太疯癫  我笑他人看不穿
<2-21,Thirteen>One man's crazy is another woman's art.

85
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,310
<2-21,Thirteen>她的作品探索了很多内容
<2-21,Thirteen>Her work explores things

86
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,250
<2-21,Thirteen>比如性别歧视政策和自我形象
<2-21,Thirteen>like gender politics and self-image.

87
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,420
<2-22,House>还有展示带着猴脸面具
<2-22,House>And the pressing issue of shaving your entire body

88
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,290
<2-22,House>剃光整个身体
<2-22,House>in public while wearing a monkey mask.

89
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,300
<2-23,Thirteen>她目睹自己的母亲自杀
<2-23,Thirteen>She saw her mom commit suicide

90
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,680
<2-23,Thirteen>遭继父虐待多年
<2-23,Thirteen>and was abused by her stepdad for years.

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,800
<2-24,Foreman>看来疯狂是事出有因
<2-24,Foreman>Didn't say the crazy wasn't motivated.

92
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,090
<2-25,Thirteen>她把那些痛苦转化为艺术
<2-25,Thirteen>Well, she took that pain and transformed it into art.

93
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,870
<2-25,Thirteen>这比转化成其它形式好多了
<2-25,Thirteen>That's better than a lot of the alternatives.

94
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,930
<2-26,Foreman>我还是认为她就是疯了
<2-26,Foreman>I still vote for nuts.

95
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,270
<2-26,Foreman>我们应该用静息态功能磁共振
<2-26,Foreman>We should run a resting-state functional MRI

96
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,450
<2-26,Foreman>检测背侧接合膜是否更加活跃
<2-26,Foreman>to look for increased activity in the dorsal nexus.

97
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,400
<2-27,House>她没疯
<2-27,House>She's not nuts.

98
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,690
<2-28,Chase>这个带猴脸面具还剃头的人
<2-28,Chase>The monkey-mask-shaving medium

99
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,650
<2-28,Chase>真的很对你的胃口吗
<2-28,Chase>really speaks to you?

100
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,350
<2-29,House>让我感兴趣的是她把一堆垃圾
<2-29,House>What speaks to me is she's elevated

101
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,520
<2-29,House>转变为真正的艺术形式
<2-29,House>being full of crap to a genuine art form

102
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,450
<2-29,House>而且还大赚一笔
<2-29,House>and made a fortune doing it.

103
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,910
<2-29,House>人们会花两万元来买她的影碟
<2-29,House>People that pay 20 grand for one of her video stills.

104
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,280
<2-29,House>另一方面  我们确实需要检察她的背侧接合膜
<2-29,House>On the other hand, really do need their dorsal nexi checked.

105
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,860
<2-30,Thirteen>可能是涂料稀释剂引起的过敏反应
<2-30,Thirteen>Maybe the paint thinner set off an allergic reaction.

106
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,050
<2-31,Chase>但是没有支气管痉挛
<2-31,Chase>Not without bronchospasm.

107
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,690
<2-32,Taub>在画廊里她旁边有个加热器
<2-32,Taub>There was a space heater next to her in the gallery.

108
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,650
<2-33,House>一氧化碳中毒
<2-33,House>Carbon monoxide poisoning.

109
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,560
<2-33,House>推断符合
<2-33,House>It fits.

110
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,630
<2-33,House>带她去高压氧舱
<2-33,House>Put her in a hyperbaric chamber.

111
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,810
<3-1,Jerry>丽莎
<3-1,Jerry>Lisa.

112
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,370
<3-1,Jerry>你是丽莎·卡迪吧
<3-1,Jerry>You're Lisa Cuddy.

113
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,750
<3-2,Cuddy>有事吗
<3-2,Cuddy>What's this about?

114
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,830
<3-3,Jerry>抱歉打扰了  我是杰瑞·巴雷特
<3-3,Jerry>I'm sorry. I'm Jerry Barrett.

115
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,850
<3-3,Jerry>我看过你的照片
<3-3,Jerry>I recognize you from the photos.

116
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,320
<3-3,Jerry>照片根本没能展现出你的魅力
<3-3,Jerry>They barely do you justice.

117
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,950
<3-4,Cuddy>老样子
<3-4,Cuddy>The usual.

118
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,760
<3-5,Jerry>我是你姐姐的朋友
<3-5,Jerry>I'm friends with your sister.

119
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,030
<3-5,Jerry>她给我看过你照片
<3-5,Jerry>She showed me your photos.

120
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,950
<3-5,Jerry>我  在对街的银行工作
<3-5,Jerry>I-I work at the bank across the street.

121
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,870
<3-5,Jerry>茱莉娅是我的客户  她
<3-5,Jerry>Um, Julia's my client. She...

122
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,690
<3-5,Jerry>想要撮合我们两个
<3-5,Jerry>wanted to set us up.

123
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,640
<3-6,Cuddy>我  恐怕是你认错人了
<3-6,Cuddy>Oh, I-I'm afraid you have me mixed up with somebody else.

124
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,700
<3-7,Jerry>不  我没认错
<3-7,Jerry>N-no, I don't think so.

125
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,000
<3-7,Jerry>我  你的照片我看过好多次了
<3-7,Jerry>I-I've seen many pictures of you several times.

126
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,970
<3-7,Jerry>其实我并不是那意思
<3-7,Jerry>That didn't sound the way I wanted--

127
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,250
<3-8,Cuddy>我想大概是因为我长了张大众脸吧
<3-8,Cuddy>I guess I just have one of those faces.

128
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,560
<3-8,Cuddy>很高兴认识你
<3-8,Cuddy>It's nice to meet you.

<3-9,Jerry>when you meet her in the office you share.

131
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,470
<4-1,Cuddy>真是谢天谢地
<4-1,Cuddy>Oh, thank God.

132
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,180
<4-1,Cuddy>重症监护病房没有受到
<4-1,Cuddy>The I.C.U. isn't being attacked by

133
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,730
<4-1,Cuddy>巨型辐射蜘蛛的袭击

134
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,710
<4-2,House>我那么发给你的吗
<4-2,House>Did I text you that?

135
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,700
<4-2,House>那是我的梦境笔记
<4-2,House>That was meant for my dream journal.

<4-2,House>我让我的妻子兼女佣送过来的
<4-2,House>I had my wife-maid bring it over.

<4-3,Cuddy>我的毛衣
<4-3,Cuddy>My sweater,

140
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,400
<4-3,Cuddy>一个咖啡杯
<4-3,Cuddy>a coffee mug,

141
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,840
<4-3,Cuddy>用过还剩半瓶的乳液
<4-3,Cuddy>a half-used bottle of lotion,

142
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,070
<4-3,Cuddy>电影《马利和我》的DVD
<4-3,Cuddy>and a DVD of Marley & Me.

144
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,570
<4-4,House>考虑到你对欧文·威尔逊的那点幻想
<4-4,House>Given your thing for Owen Wilson,

145
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,590
<4-4,House>我以为你会希望尽快拿到最后的两样东西
<4-4,House>I thought you might want those last two back asap.

146
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,200
<4-5,Cuddy>没听明白
<4-5,Cuddy>I don't get it.

147
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,530
<4-6,House>你以欧文·威尔逊为幻想对象自慰过
<4-6,House>You masturbate to Owen Wilson.

148
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,870
<4-7,Cuddy>我是指盒子
<4-7,Cuddy>I meant the box.

149
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,640
<4-8,House>是种象征性的姿态而已
<4-8,House>It's a symbolic gesture.

150
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,010
<4-8,House>我希望一切能恢复到
<4-8,House>I want things to go back to the way they were

151
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,470
<4-8,House>我们未谈恋爱时的样子
<4-8,House>before we started dating--

152
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,580
<4-8,House>不再恶语相向
<4-8,House>no more bad feelings,

153
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,190
<4-8,House>不再藕断丝连  只谈工作
<4-8,House>no more issues, just work.

154
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,320
<4-8,House>谢谢你过来
<4-8,House>Thanks for coming.

155
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,830
<4-9,Cuddy>你自残后  我还没和你谈过
<4-9,Cuddy>I haven't even spoken to you since you hurt yourself.

156
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,350
<4-10,House>我是有点自我毁灭
<4-10,House>I was self-destructive.

157
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,910
<4-10,House>不会有下一次了
<4-10,House>It won't happen again.

158
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,810
<4-10,House>我要洗心革面
<4-10,House>I'm making changes.

159
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,880
<4-10,House>不会再做蠢事了
<4-10,House>I'm gonna stop doing stupid things.

160
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,420
<4-10,House>很好
<4-10,House>Great.

161
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,010
<4-11,Cuddy>谈谈你为什么那么做  会是个明智的决定
<4-11,Cuddy>The smart thing to do would be to talk about why you did it.

162
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,360
<4-11,Cuddy>如果你不明白
<4-11,Cuddy>If you don't understand--

163
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,680
<4-12,House>我想不用谈论我老妈  我也不会
<4-12,House>I think I could avoid putting another hole in my leg

164
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,090
<4-12,House>再往腿上捅个窟窿了
<4-12,House>without talking about my mother.

165
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,760
<4-13,Cuddy>我可不想再接到
<4-13,Cuddy>Well, I don't want to find out you're wrong

166
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,630
<4-13,Cuddy>你躺在血淋淋的浴缸里打来的电话
<4-13,Cuddy>by getting another phone call from you in a bloody bathtub.

167
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,360
<4-14,House>我深信  让过去成为过去
<4-14,House>I'm a big believer that the best way

168
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,790
<4-14,House>的最好方法
<4-14,House>to get past the past is to shoot it in the head,

169
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,290
<4-14,House>就是把它深埋心底  绝口不提
<4-14,House>bury it in a deep pit, and pour lye on it.

170
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,140
<4-15,Cuddy>我只是想请你谈谈这事
<4-15,Cuddy>I'm just asking you to talk about it.

171
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,830
<4-15,Cuddy>这是你欠我的
<4-15,Cuddy>You owe me.

172
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,850
<4-15,Cuddy>不说我救了你性命
<4-15,Cuddy>Forget about saving your life.

173
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,410
<4-15,Cuddy>单单你让我女儿深受那可恶的
<4-15,Cuddy>You exposed my daughter to

174
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,340
<4-15,Cuddy>海盗卡通的荼毒  你也该和我谈谈
<4-15,Cuddy>that obnoxious pirate cartoon.

175
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,130
<4-16,House>明天给我送午饭
<4-16,House>Bring me lunch tomorrow,

176
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,460
<4-16,House>我们再探讨我的内心世界
<4-16,House>and we can plumb my depths.

177
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,820
<5-1,Luca>我早该知道画廊的通风条件不好
<5-1,Luca>I should have known the gallery wasn't ventilated enough.

178
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,150
<5-2,Thirteen>如果不是你阻止了那个人
<5-2,Thirteen>Hey, if it wasn't for you, we'd be treating her

179
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,800
<5-2,Thirteen>我们可能同时要治疗她的三度烧伤了
<5-2,Thirteen>for third-degree burns, too.

180
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,320
<5-3,Afsoun>那是个错误
<5-3,Afsoun>That was a mistake.

181
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,010
<5-3,Afsoun>他不该干涉的
<5-3,Afsoun>He shouldn't have interfered.

182
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,290
<5-4,Luca>我说了  我很抱歉
<5-4,Luca>I told you I'm sorry.

183
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,480
<5-4,Luca>我想像你那样专注于此具有献身精神
<5-4,Luca>I want to share your commitment,

184
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,900
<5-4,Luca>但有时候对我来说太难了
<5-4,Luca>but it's hard for me sometimes.

185
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,560
<5-5,Foreman>譬如她在创新博物馆
<5-5,Foreman>Like when she read your love letters

186
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,690
<5-5,Foreman>大庭广众下读你的情书那会
<5-5,Foreman>in the middle of the New Museum?

187
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,760
<5-5,Foreman>对头  我也读《纽约客》
<5-5,Foreman>Yes, I read The New Yorker.

188
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,870
<5-6,Luca>那是一年前的事了
<5-6,Luca>That was a year ago.

189
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,470
<5-6,Luca>我们  现在已经分手了
<5-6,Luca>And we're-- we're not together anymore.

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,590
<5-7,Foreman>说真的  你不是
<5-7,Foreman>Seriously, you weren't

191
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,600
<5-7,Foreman>真打算让那人在你身上放火吧
<5-7,Foreman>really gonna let that guy set you on fire.

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,690
<5-7,Foreman>他不过是吸引观众的托  对吧
<5-7,Foreman>He was just a plant to get the crowd going, right?

193
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,030
<5-8,Afsoun>如果那是你的理解  我也无所谓
<5-8,Afsoun>If that's your interpretation, I welcome it.

194
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,480
<5-9,Luca>阿夫松认为向他人解释她的工作
<5-9,Luca>Afsoun believes explaining her work

195
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
<5-9,Luca>会限制工作的潜能
<5-9,Luca>limits its potential.

196
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,740
<5-9,Luca>但在常人看来  他就是个彻头彻尾的混蛋
<5-9,Luca>But between us, he was real and a total dick.

197
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,770
<5-10,Foreman>没有哪个疯子会为了艺术
<5-10,Foreman>No sane person would let themselves

198
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,440
<5-10,Foreman>而甘愿被活活烧死
<5-10,Foreman>be burned alive for the sake of art.

199
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,670
<5-11,Afsoun>我的工作  就是要强制观众
<5-11,Afsoun>My work is meant to force the audience

200
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,340
<5-11,Afsoun>打破常规  以新的视角看事情
<5-11,Afsoun>to break with the rational and see things in a new way.

201
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,250
<5-12,Foreman>这样啊  那也没有哪个疯子
<5-12,Foreman>Fine. No sane person

202
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,980
<5-12,Foreman>会甘愿让自己被活活烧死
<5-12,Foreman>would let themselves be burned alive

203
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,510
<5-12,Foreman>只为"打破常规"
<5-12,Foreman>to "Break with the rational."

204
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,820
<5-13,Afsoun>我想
<5-13,Afsoun>I feel...

205
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,530
<5-14,Thirteen>卢卡  把你身后的氧气面罩递给我
<5-14,Thirteen>Luca, hand me the oxygen mask behind you.

206
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,870
<5-14,Thirteen>卢卡
<5-14,Thirteen>Luca!

207
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,010
<6-1,Taub>恭喜
<6-1,Taub>Congratulations.

208
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,380
<6-1,Taub>不过还只是个妊娠囊
<6-1,Taub>It's a gestational sac.

209
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,770
<6-1,Taub>现在太早  看不到什么
<6-1,Taub>Can't see anything this early.

210
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,530
<6-1,Taub>我知道
<6-1,Taub>I know.

211
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,330
<6-2,Ruby>我只是觉得这样能帮我
<6-2,Ruby>I just figured this would help me process

212
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,440
<6-2,Ruby>理出头绪
<6-2,Ruby>what's happening.

213
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,100
<6-2,Ruby>太多事情需要考虑
<6-2,Ruby>There's a lot we got to figure out.

214
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,540
<6-3,Taub>有将近八个月的时间去想呢
<6-3,Taub>We have almost eight months.

215
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,050
<6-3,Taub>你不会改变想法了吧
<6-3,Taub>You're not having doubts, are you?

216
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,990
<6-3,Taub>没有
<6-3,Taub>No.

217
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,980
<6-4,Ruby>你呢
<6-4,Ruby>Are you?

218
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,520
<6-5,Taub>绝对没有
<6-5,Taub>Definitely not.

219
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,790
<6-5,Taub>这就是小鲁本的暖巢了
<6-5,Taub>Nice, cozy home for little Ruben.

220
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,880
<6-5,Taub>这是姓氏
<6-5,Taub>It's a family name.

221
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,920
<6-6,Ruby>这是一种三明治
<6-6,Ruby>It's a sandwich.

222
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,510
<6-7,Taub>以我的家族命名的三明治
<6-7,Taub>Named for my family.

223
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,390
<6-8,Taub>豪斯打来的
<6-8,Taub>It's just House.

224
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,170
<7-1,Cuddy>我对天起誓  你敢再干涉我的生活试试
<7-1,Cuddy>I swear to God, stay out of my personal life.

225
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,700
<7-2,Julia>这有什么不好的
<7-2,Julia>Where is the downside here?

226
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,420
<7-4,Julia>杰瑞多可爱
<7-4,Julia>Huh? Jerry is cute.

227
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,090
<7-4,Julia>他是位高级副总裁
<7-4,Julia>He's a senior V.P.

228
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,440
<7-4,Julia>他每年冬天都去哥斯达黎加玩风筝冲浪
<7-4,Julia>He kite-surfs in Costa Rica every winter,

229
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,380
<7-4,Julia>而且他爱他妈妈
<7-4,Julia>and he loves his mother.

230
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,320
<7-5,Cuddy>只有冬日才爱母吗
<7-5,Cuddy>Seasonally?

231
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,420
<7-5,Cuddy>还是说冬日才冲浪
<7-5,Cuddy>Or is that just the kite-surfing?

232
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
<7-6,Julia>是因为豪斯吗
<7-6,Julia>Is this about House?

233
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,680
<7-6,Julia>你在说什么
<7-6,Julia>What?

234
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,340
<7-7,Cuddy>你觉得我暗地里祈祷自己能够拥有
<7-7,Cuddy>Like I secretly wish I could alter

235
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,970
<7-7,Cuddy>改变世界的力量  来改变我们的性格
<7-7,Cuddy>the laws of the universe, change who we are,

236
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,670
<7-7,Cuddy>然后就能奇迹般的在一起了吗
<7-7,Cuddy>and magically make it work out?

237
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,090
<7-8,Julia>一点没错  我就想问这个
<7-8,Julia>Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking.

238
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,610
<7-9,Cuddy>我刚才的讽刺口吻告诉你  你错了
<7-9,Cuddy>My sarcasm indicated no.

239
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,300
<7-9,Cuddy>不  你的讽刺口吻告诉我
<7-9,Cuddy>No, your sarcasm indicated

240
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,550
<7-10,Julia>你压根不想谈这件事
<7-10,Julia>you wanted to avoid actually saying anything.

241
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,260
<7-10,Julia>听着  丽莎
<7-10,Julia>Look, Lisa...

242
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,730
<7-10,Julia>我只看到你进退两难
<7-10,Julia>All I know is you seem stuck.

243
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,310
<7-10,Julia>而我不想放任你自生自灭
<7-10,Julia>And I don't like seeing you like that.

244
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,650
<8-1,Foreman>接受高压氧治疗后  她的病情反而加重了
<8-1,Foreman>She got worse in the hyperbaric chamber.

245
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,730
<8-1,Foreman>不是一氧化碳中毒
<8-1,Foreman>It's not C.O. poisoning.

246
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,240
<8-2,Thirteen>可能是感染
<8-2,Thirteen>I think we should consider infection

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,520
<8-2,Thirteen>我们应该检查一下她的助手
<8-2,Thirteen>and test the assistant.

248
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,430
<8-2,Thirteen>我无法唤起他的注意  他两眼发直
<8-2,Thirteen>I couldn't get his attention. He was in a daze.

249
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,530
<8-3,Foreman>你认为那是个症状吗  他爱上她了
<8-3,Foreman>You think that's a symptom?  He's in love with her.

250
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,750
<8-3,Foreman>或许已迷失心智  不知该怎么做好
<8-3,Foreman>He was probably overwhelmed, couldn't decide what to do.

251
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,940
<8-4,House>她住院后他都做了什么
<8-4,House>What's he been doing since she was admitted?

252
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,230
<8-4,House>他有没有
<8-4,House>Did he bring anything

253
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,860
<8-4,House>从病房带什么到治疗室
<8-4,House>from the patient room to the treatment room?

254
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,980
<8-5,Foreman>带了一些  一个手袋
<8-5,Foreman>A few things-- a handbag,

255
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,600
<8-5,Foreman>鲜花  毛绒大象
<8-5,Foreman>flowers, stuffed elephant.

256
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,620
<8-6,House>她看上去像那种
<8-6,House>Does she seem like the kind of woman

257
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,510
<8-6,House>需要毛绒玩具的女人吗
<8-6,House>who needs a stuffed animal?

258
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,930
<8-7,Thirteen>你打给谁呢
<8-7,Thirteen>Who are you calling?

259
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,420
<8-7,Thirteen>当我没问
<8-7,Thirteen>Oh, of course.

260
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,070
<8-8,House>你穿的什么
<8-8,House>What are you wearing?

261
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,090
<8-8,House>原来我能看见你穿了什么
<8-8,House>Oh, I can see what you're wearing.

262
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,190
<8-8,House>去她的病房
<8-8,House>Go to her room.

263
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,440
<9-1,House>现在去检查下那只毛绒大象
<9-1,House>Now go address the elephant in the room.

264
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,910
<9-2,Thirteen>是个专门隐藏摄像头的玩具
<9-2,Thirteen>This is a nanny cam.

265
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,210
<9-3,House>卢卡之所以在治疗室里
<9-3,House>The reason Luca couldn't decide

266
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,920
<9-3,House>不知该怎么办
<9-3,House>what to do in the treatment room

267
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,320
<9-3,House>和在画廊时的原因是一样的
<9-3,House>is the same as in the gallery.

268
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,380
<9-3,House>因为他被告知不准介入
<9-3,House>He's been told not to intervene.

269
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,960
<9-3,House>真走运
<9-3,House>Congratulations.

270
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,860
<9-3,House>我们成了她最新的艺术作品
<9-3,House>We've become her latest work of art.

271
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,710
<10-1,Thirteen>我们应该想到的
<10-1,Thirteen>It shouldn't have surprised us.

272
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,730
<10-1,Thirteen>她所有的表演都是基于个人的创伤经历
<10-1,Thirteen>All her work is based on personal traumas.

273
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,640
<10-1,Thirteen>她让卢卡做记录  拍摄她的治疗过程
<10-1,Thirteen>She's had Luca taking notes, videotape her treatments,

274
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,610
<10-1,Thirteen>收集物品  比如尖锐器具和绷带
<10-1,Thirteen>collect things, like sharps and bandages.

275
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,410
<10-1,Thirteen>这些全被用来布置画廊
<10-1,Thirteen>It'll all go into a gallery installation.

276
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,240
<10-2,Taub>我感觉只要是
<10-2,Taub>Well, then I guess as long as

277
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,040
<10-2,Taub>用于正当目的  就没什么问题
<10-2,Taub>the exploitation is properly motivated, it's all okay.

278
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,690
<10-3,Chase>超声显示在她的胰腺处有个囊肿
<10-3,Chase>Ultrasound showed a cyst

279
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,930
<10-3,Chase>我们做了穿刺引流
<10-3,Chase>on her pancreas-- we drained it.

280
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,480
<10-4,Taub>我们干嘛还要讨论这个病例
<10-4,Taub>Why are we even discussing this case?

281
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,540
<10-4,Taub>她骗了我们
<10-4,Taub>She lied to us.

282
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,260
<10-4,Taub>我们可能因此卷入医疗过失纠纷
<10-4,Taub>It's opening us up to malpractice.

283
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,810
<10-5,House>只有我们的医疗行为才会让我们陷入医疗过失纠纷
<10-5,House>Our practice opens us up to malpractice.

284
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,510
<10-6,Foreman>我们要怎么知道她是否真的病了
<10-6,Foreman>How do we know she's actually sick?

285
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,460
<10-7,House>线索之一就是  她病了
<10-7,House>Her being sick is a clue.

286
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,450
<10-8,Foreman>为了工作  她愿意让那人
<10-8,Foreman>She would have let that guy

287
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,070
<10-8,Foreman>以艺术的名义在她身上放火
<10-8,Foreman>set her on fire for the sake of her work.

288
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,010
<10-8,Foreman>你觉得她还会怕小小的心律失常吗
<10-8,Foreman>You think she's scared of a little arrhythmia?

289
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,110
<10-8,Foreman>或许她是吸入了油漆稀释剂
<10-8,Foreman>She probably huffed paint thinner.

290
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,390
<10-9,Thirteen>她会让他在她身上放火
<10-9,Thirteen>She would have let him set her on fire

291
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,220
<10-9,Thirteen>就是为了保持作品的真实性
<10-9,Thirteen>because of the honesty of her work.

292
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,480
<10-9,Thirteen>-装病不符合这条原则  -十三是对的
<10-9,Thirteen>- Faking an illness doesn't fit. - Thirteen's right.

293
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,020
<10-10,House>至少她的结论是对的
<10-10,House>At least her conclusion was.

294
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,710
<10-10,House>其它部分就错得太可笑了
<10-10,House>Everything else was laughably wrong.

295
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,040
<10-10,House>如果病人自己诱发了胰腺炎和心脏病
<10-10,House>If the patient induced pancreatitis and a heart attack,

296
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,880
<10-10,House>那她就是在自杀
<10-10,House>she'd be suicidal.

297
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,360
<10-11,Chase>一点没错  她一直都在拿性命冒险
<10-11,Chase>Exactly. She's risking her life all the time.

298
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,220
<10-12,House>一点没错  如果她想死
<10-12,House>Exactly. If she wanted to be dead,

299
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,710
<10-12,House>那她早就死了
<10-12,House>she'd be dead a long time ago.

300
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,370
<10-12,House>假装死里逃生比被抹水彩更卖座
<10-12,House>Pretending to cheat death pays better than water colors.

301
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,010
<10-12,House>符合科萨奇B组病毒的症状
<10-12,House>Coxsackie B fits.

302
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,950
<10-12,House>给她的胆道系统做个螺旋CT
<10-12,House>But do a spiral C.T. of her biliary tree

303
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,760
<10-12,House>来排除胆结石
<10-12,House>to rule out gallstones.

304
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,120
<10-13,Foreman>好  我去做CT
<10-13,Foreman>Fine. I'll get the C.T.

305
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,130
<10-14,House>好  我很高兴和你同去
<10-14,House>Sure. I'd be happy to come with you.

306
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,390
<10-14,House>谢谢邀请我
<10-14,House>Thanks for asking.

307
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,720
<10-15,Foreman>你应该躺在床上
<10-15,Foreman>You're supposed to stay in bed--

308
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,940
<10-15,Foreman>这是医生的嘱咐
<10-15,Foreman>doctor's orders.

309
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,670
<10-16,House>如果你真的关心我
<10-16,House>If you really cared about me,

310
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,450
<10-16,House>你打着推翻我理论的小算盘时
<10-16,House>you wouldn't be so obvious

311
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,100
<10-16,House>就应该含蓄点
<10-16,House>when you scheme to prove me wrong.

312
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,080
<10-16,House>你主动请缨是因为你想做CT扫描她的肺
<10-16,House>You volunteered because you want to C.T. her lungs,

313
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,290
<10-16,House>而不是她的胆道系统
<10-16,House>not her biliary tree.

314
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,810
<10-16,House>你想发现纤维化
<10-16,House>You want to find fibrosis

315
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,120
<10-16,House>来证明你的"吸入油漆稀释剂"理论
<10-16,House>and prove your "Paint thinner" theory.

316
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,010
<10-16,House>如果我不跟着你  一旦你失败了
<10-16,House>If I don't come with, when you fail,

317
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,750
<10-16,House>你就会假装你没做过
<10-16,House>you'll pretend you never tried.

318
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,970
<10-16,House>我必须得去  是吧
<10-16,House>I don't really have a choice, now, do I?

319
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,580
<11-1,House>我已经看过你的工资单了
<11-1,House>Since I've seen your paycheck,

320
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,530
<11-1,House>也许这不太应该
<11-1,House>I probably shouldn't.

321
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,700
<11-1,House>罐头豆子也没那么差
<11-1,House>Canned beans aren't so bad...

322
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,330
<11-1,House>在桥下的火堆上煮着
<11-1,House>as long as they're cooked over an oil-drum fire

323
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,500
<11-1,House>和丐帮帮主一起吃还是不错的
<11-1,House>under a bridge with the king of the hobos.

324
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,270
<11-2,Afsoun>我头晕
<11-2,Afsoun>I feel dizzy.

325
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,330
<11-3,Foreman>皮肤苍白  湿冷
<11-3,Foreman>Pale, diaphoretic,

326
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,670
<11-3,Foreman>心动过速
<11-3,Foreman>tachycardic,

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,070
<11-3,Foreman>血压80/40
<11-3,Foreman>B.P., 80 over 40.

328
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,450
<11-3,Foreman>内出血吗
<11-3,Foreman>Internal bleeding?

329
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,950
<11-4,House>马上把她拉出去做内窥镜
<11-4,House>Get her out of here and scope her.

330
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,890
<12-1,Chase>很抱歉
<12-1,Chase>I'm so sorry.

331
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,600
<12-2,Afsoun>结肠镜没有发现出血点
<12-2,Afsoun>The colonoscopy didn't find the bleed,

332
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,780
<12-3,Chase>所以我们只能从肝脏这方面来找找了
<12-3,Chase>so we got to look by your liver.

333
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,380
<12-4,Afsoun>拜托了  卢卡
<12-4,Afsoun>Luca, please.

334
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,400
<12-4,Afsoun>我们必须把一切都记录下来
<12-4,Afsoun>We need to document everything.

335
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,470
<12-5,Foreman>拿一下
<12-5,Foreman>Hold this.

336
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,670
<12-6,Foreman>我正看到腹主动脉的下面
<12-6,Foreman>I'm just below the celiac artery.

337
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,700
<12-7,Foreman>没有血
<12-7,Foreman>No blood.

338
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,770
<12-8,Chase>有没有可能漏进她的大腿里去了呢
<12-8,Chase>Could it be leaking into her thighs?

339
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,810
<12-9,Foreman>没有肿胀和外形改变
<12-9,Foreman>No swelling, no asymmetry.

340
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,430
<12-10,Chase>那血去哪里了呢
<12-10,Chase>So where's the blood going?

341
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,930
<12-10,Chase>你检查那里干什么
<12-10,Chase>Why are you looking down there?

342
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,730
<12-11,Foreman>因为我不喜欢吃豆子
<12-11,Foreman>Cause I don't like beans.

343
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,210
<13-1,Cuddy>-你放我鸽子  -抱歉
<13-1,Cuddy>- You stood me up. - Sorry.

344
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,490
<13-2,House>应该安排我的病人
<13-2,House>Should have scheduled my patient's

345
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,810
<13-2,House>周四再内出血
<13-2,House>internal bleeding for Thursday.

346
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,330
<13-3,Cuddy>你又在玩小肚鸡肠
<13-3,Cuddy>You're still playing the same petty,

347
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,620
<13-3,Cuddy>消极反抗的游戏了
<13-3,Cuddy>passive-aggressive games.

348

<13-4,House>of a building you work in.

350
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,340
<13-4,House>天啊  我真是狠狠地耍了你啊
<13-4,House>Boy, did I screw with you.

351
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,460
<13-5,Cuddy>是你说你要改变的
<13-5,Cuddy>You said you were going to change.

352
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,600
<13-6,House>看看那个标志
<13-6,House>Check the sign.

353
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,870
<13-6,House>它说你需要对我特别护理
<13-6,House>It says you got to treat me with intensive care.

354
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,360
<13-7,Cuddy>我在表达我的愤怒  你也该试试
<13-7,Cuddy>I'm expressing my anger. You should try it.

355
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,260
<13-7,Cuddy>此时此地  我们好好吵一架吧
<13-7,Cuddy>Right now, let's finally have our fight.

356
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,750
<13-8,House>我们一直都在吵
<13-8,House>All we do is fight.

357
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,930
<13-9,Cuddy>不  你一直都只会恶作剧
<13-9,Cuddy>No, all you've done is pull pranks

358
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,540
<13-9,Cuddy>或者冲威尔森发脾气  从不冲我
<13-9,Cuddy>or have temper tantrums with Wilson, never me,

359
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,070
<13-9,Cuddy>娶了一个来路不明的妓女
<13-9,Cuddy>marry mail-order prostitutes,

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,010
<13-9,Cuddy>还强迫我去参加你的婚礼
<13-9,Cuddy>make me go to your wedding...

361
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,410
<13-10,House>多米尼卡是位有执照的美容师
<13-10,House>Dominika is a licensed aesthetician.

362
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,440
<13-11,Cuddy>你切开了自己的腿
<13-11,Cuddy>You cut open your own leg.

363
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,590
<13-12,House>所以你想说这些都是因为你吗
<13-12,House>So all this was about you?

364
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,160
<13-13,Cuddy>你觉得这之间没有关系吗
<13-13,Cuddy>You don't think it was even related?

365
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,860
<13-13,Cuddy>豪斯  我们甚至都没
<13-13,Cuddy>House, we've never even

366
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,610
<13-13,Cuddy>谈论过我们的分手问题
<13-13,Cuddy>had a conversation about our breakup.

367
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,760
<13-13,Cuddy>你显然还对我很生气
<13-13,Cuddy>You are obviously still angry at me.

368
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,960
<13-13,Cuddy>而这让我俩都倍受煎熬
<13-13,Cuddy>And it's hurting both of us.

369
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,390
<13-14,House>没想到
<13-14,House>Wow, I hadn't realized

370

<13-14,House>午餐有这么大的疗伤效力啊
<13-14,House>the incredible healing power of lunch.

371
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,810
<13-15,Cuddy>我知道一次谈话不能解决所有问题
<13-15,Cuddy>I know one conversation isn't gonna solve everything,

372
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,330
<13-15,Cuddy>但它是个开端
<13-15,Cuddy>but it is a start.

373
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,900
<13-15,Cuddy>这帘子是用来保护隐私的
<13-15,Cuddy>It's a privacy curtain.

374
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,150
<13-16,Foreman>没有用
<13-16,Foreman>It wasn't working.

375
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,580
<13-17,House>明天一点  在餐厅吃午餐
<13-17,House>Lunch at 1:00, tomorrow in the cafeteria.

376
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,450
<13-17,House>这下满意了吧
<13-17,House>You happy?

377
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,950
<13-18,Foreman>你今天吃了多少片了啊
<13-18,Foreman>How many of those have you had today?

378
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,330
<13-19,House>不知道  "尼玛"算个数字吗
<13-19,House>I don't know. Is "Your mother" a number?

379
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,460
<13-20,Foreman>那病人是个骗子
<13-20,Foreman>The patient is a fraud.

380
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,760
<13-20,Foreman>我在她左侧的足背静脉上发现了注射针孔
<13-20,Foreman>I found a puncture in the dorsal vein of her left foot.

381
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,290
<13-21,House>注射海洛因无法解释
<13-21,House>Shooting up heroin wouldn't explain--

382
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:43,900
<13-22,Foreman>不是海洛因
<13-22,Foreman>Not heroin.

383
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,260
<13-22,Foreman>她在给自己注射自己的血红细胞
<13-22,Foreman>She was injecting herself with her own red blood cells.

384
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,480
<13-22,Foreman>这造成了她的心脏问题
<13-22,Foreman>It caused her heart issues,

385
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,500
<13-22,Foreman>当她红细胞压积持平时
<13-22,Foreman>and when her hematocrit evened out,

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,900
<13-22,Foreman>我们将其误诊为内出血
<13-22,Foreman>we mistook it for internal bleeding.

387
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,860
<13-23,House>你能得出这么多结论
<13-23,House>It must have been a very distinctively shaped

388
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,470
<13-23,House>那针孔肯定形状独特且异常健谈
<13-23,House>and awfully talkative puncture for you to get all of that.

389
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,450
<13-24,Foreman>她电脑上的浏览器历史记录帮了大忙
<13-24,Foreman>Browser history on her laptop helped.

390
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
<13-24,Foreman>她专门研究了血液回输技术
<13-24,Foreman>She was researching blood doping

391
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,600
<13-24,Foreman>还有其它一些事情
<13-24,Foreman>among other things.

392
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,180
<13-25,House>-她在研究我  -好几个月了
<13-25,House>- She was researching me? - For months.

393
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,770
<13-26,Foreman>这与创造瞬时艺术无关
<13-26,Foreman>This isn't about creating art in the moment.

394
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,810
<13-26,Foreman>都是为了你
<13-26,Foreman>It's about you.

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,410
<13-26,Foreman>她给你设了个套
<13-26,Foreman>She set you up.

396
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,730
<14-1,Soltes>我们派了一支队伍去他家和医院
<14-1,Soltes>We sent a uni over to his apartment and the hospital.

397
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,400
<14-2,Wilson>他不会在那里的
<14-2,Wilson>Yeah, he won't be there.

398
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,890
<14-3,Soltes>那会在哪
<14-3,Soltes>Any ideas?

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,180
<14-4,Wilson>你要是找到他会逮捕他吗
<14-4,Wilson>When you find him, you're gonna arrest him?

400
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,000
<14-5,Soltes>有任何你觉得我不该那么做的理由吗
<14-5,Soltes>Is there some reason you think I shouldn't?

401
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,170
<14-6,Wilson>依我的了解  他会去酒吧
<14-6,Wilson>Knowing him, he'll be in a bar.

402
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,680
<14-6,Wilson>他会找到一家契合他内心感受的酒吧
<14-6,Wilson>He'll find one that matches how he feels inside.

403
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,660
<14-6,Wilson>那会是你在新泽西能找到
<14-6,Wilson>It'll be the most dark,

404
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,220
<14-6,Wilson>最阴暗抑郁的角落
<14-6,Wilson>depressing hole you can find in New Jersey.

405
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,180
<15-1,House>你这次真把我惹毛了
<15-1,House>Now you're just pissing me off.

406
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,880
<15-2,Luca>我很抱歉  我不知道她在调查你
<15-2,Luca>I'm really sorry. I-I didn't know she researched you.

407
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,960
<15-2,Luca>我真的不知道...
<15-2,Luca>I had no idea she--

408
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,580
<15-3,House>如果你对此一无所知你还插什么话
<15-3,House>If you don't know anything, then why are you talking?

409
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,210
<15-4,Afsoun>请不要怪罪卢卡
<15-4,Afsoun>Please don't take it out on Luca.

410
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,550
<15-5,House>怎么做最能惹毛你我就怎么做
<15-5,House>I'll take it out on whoever I think will irritate you the most.

411
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,420
<15-6,Afsoun>我以为你能理解我这种通过工作
<15-6,Afsoun>I thought you would understand someone who uses their work

412
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,540
<15-6,Afsoun>应对疼痛的人
<15-6,Afsoun>to deal with pain.

413
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,060
<15-7,House>我还真不知道搜索引擎
<15-7,House>I didn't realize that search engines

414
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,090
<15-7,House>可以看透人的灵魂
<15-7,House>could look within the soul.

415
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,390
<15-8,Afsoun>你正穿着病号服站在我面前
<15-8,Afsoun>You're standing in front of me in a hospital gown.

416
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,860
<15-9,House>那又怎样
<15-9,House>What the hell was the point of this?

417
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,150
<15-9,House>你究竟是想利用哪种创伤
<15-9,House>What personal trauma are you exploiting--

418
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,100
<15-9,House>不好意思  应该是挖掘其艺术潜质
<15-9,House>Sorry--mining for its artistic potential?

419
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,300
<15-10,Afsoun>我自己的病
<15-10,Afsoun>My illness.

420
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,420
<15-10,Afsoun>我是用血液回输骗了你
<15-10,Afsoun>I did the blood doping to intrigue you,

421
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,690
<15-10,Afsoun>但我本来已经病了
<15-10,Afsoun>but I was already ill.

422
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,230
<15-11,Luca>等等  你真的病了吗
<15-11,Luca>Wait. You're really sick?

423
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,220
<15-12,House>为什么选我
<15-12,House>Why me?

424
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,730
<15-13,Luca>-你知道自己得了什么病吗  -知道
<15-13,Luca>- Do you know what you have? - Yes.

425
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,400
<15-15,Luca>那告诉他
<15-15,Luca>So tell him.

426
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,130
<15-16,Afsoun>如果我这么做了  对他就没有谜题可言
<15-16,Afsoun>If I do, there won't be any game for him,

427
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,880
<15-16,Afsoun>对我们也没有任何艺术可言了
<15-16,Afsoun>and then there won't be any art for us.

428
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,310
<15-17,House>为什么是我
<15-17,House>Why me?

429
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,800
<15-18,Afsoun>我不会回答那些问题的
<15-18,Afsoun>I don't answer those questions.

430
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,060
<15-19,House>你知道我有的是谜题可解
<15-19,House>You know, there's a lot of games

431
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,780
<15-19,House>而不用对付你这种
<15-19,House>I could play that don't involve dealing

432
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,560
<15-19,House>自恋装模作样的操纵狂
<15-19,House>with narcissistic, manipulative poseurs.

433
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,290
<15-20,Afsoun>但这是为你量身定做的谜题
<15-20,Afsoun>But this is a puzzle tailor-made for you.

434
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,620
<15-20,Afsoun>你不知道我哪些症状是真的
<15-20,Afsoun>You don't know which of my symptoms are real,

435
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,670
<15-20,Afsoun>哪些是假的
<15-20,Afsoun>which are fake,

436
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,380
<15-20,Afsoun>哪些是我根本没告诉你的
<15-20,Afsoun>which ones I'm not even telling you about.

437
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,140
<15-20,Afsoun>我知道这能激起你的好奇心
<15-20,Afsoun>I know that intrigues you.

438
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,150
<15-20,Afsoun>你真的打算现在就结束吗
<15-20,Afsoun>Do you really want to end it now?

439
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,990
<15-20,Afsoun>不
<15-20,Afsoun>No.

440
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,320
<16-1,Chase>你想让她浪费我们一个床位吗
<16-1,Chase>You want us to waste a bed on her?

441
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,410
<16-2,House>你发过誓
<16-2,House>You took an oath...

442
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,410
<16-2,House>发誓要很酷
<16-2,House>an oath to be cool.

443
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,750
<16-2,House>至少当时在别人念那老一套誓词的时候
<16-2,House>At least that was the one I mumbled under my breath

444
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,390
<16-2,House>我是小声这么说的
<16-2,House>while everyone else was doing the boring one.

445
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,100
<16-3,Foreman>就算她真的病了  反正我是不相信
<16-3,Foreman>Even if she is sick, which I don't believe,

446
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,070
<16-3,Foreman>她还说她知道诊断结果
<16-3,Foreman>she also says she has a diagnosis.

447
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,460
<16-3,Foreman>所以这要么是个谎言要么是个游戏
<16-3,Foreman>So it's either just a lie, or it's just a game.

448
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,120
<16-4,House>那又怎样
<16-4,House>So what?

449
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,700
<16-4,House>我喜欢游戏  很有趣  去做血液培养
<16-4,House>I like the game. It's fun. Go get a blood culture.

450
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
<16-4,House>检查寄生虫和细菌
<16-4,House>Check for parasites and bacteria.

451
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,760
<16-5,Foreman>这就是新生的豪斯吗
<16-5,Foreman>This is the new House--

452
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
<16-5,Foreman>只剩半条腿却双倍的不负责任
<16-5,Foreman>half the leg power, twice the irresponsibility?

453
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,200
<16-6,House>新生的豪斯是说要让我的生活更加健康
<16-6,House>The new House is about making my life healthier.

454
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,080
<16-6,House>和你们无关
<16-6,House>Never said anything about yours.

455
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,210
<16-6,House>去抽血吧
<16-6,House>Go get her blood.

456
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,380
<16-7,Thirteen>我去
<16-7,Thirteen>I'll do it.

457
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,130
<16-7,Thirteen>他最近过得很不好
<16-7,Thirteen>He's going through a tough patch right now.

458
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,560
<16-7,Thirteen>如果这能转移他的注意力
<16-7,Thirteen>If this is the distraction he needs

459
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,850
<16-7,Thirteen>让他老实呆在病床上的话
<16-7,Thirteen>to keep him in his hospital bed,

460
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,850
<16-7,Thirteen>我肯定这比其它任何选择都好
<16-7,Thirteen>I'm sure it's better than any of the alternatives.

461
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,490
<16-8,House>这话真是太屈尊俯就了
<16-8,House>That was incredibly condescending.

462
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,810
<16-8,House>有用吗
<16-8,House>Did it work?

463
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,470
<17-1,Foreman>你为什么一直拒接你老婆的电话
<17-1,Foreman>Why do you keep ducking your wife's calls?

464
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,170
<17-2,Taub>前妻
<17-2,Taub>Ex-wife.

465
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,870
<17-3,Foreman>我肯定她只是想祝贺你
<17-3,Foreman>I'm sure she just wants to congratulate you

466
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,050
<17-3,Foreman>搞大了二十二岁女护士的肚子
<17-3,Foreman>about knocking up a 22-year-old nurse.

467
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,390
<17-4,Taub>我还没跟她说
<17-4,Taub>I haven't told her yet.

468
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,920
<17-5,Foreman>但是你跟她说过
<17-5,Foreman>But you have told her

469
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,420
<17-5,Foreman>你不会再跟她同归于床了  是吧
<17-5,Foreman>you're not gonna sleep with her anymore, right?

470
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,040
<17-5,Foreman>你准备咋知会她啊
<17-5,Foreman>How are you planning on letting her know?

471
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,630
<17-5,Foreman>直接请她来参加你儿子的割礼吗
<17-5,Foreman>Just invite her to the bris?

472
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,050
<17-6,Taub>我正研究怎么说能让她少受点打击
<17-6,Taub>I'm trying to let her down easy.

473
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,160
<17-6,Taub>瑞秋一直都不想要小孩
<17-6,Taub>Rachel never wanted to have kids.

474
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
<17-6,Taub>我不想伤害她的感情
<17-6,Taub>I don't want to hurt her feelings.

475
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,350
<17-7,Foreman>是啊  你好重感情啊
<17-7,Foreman>Yeah. You are all about feelings.

476
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,110
<17-8,Taub>我爱瑞秋爱了二十年
<17-8,Taub>I've loved Rachel for 20 years.

477
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,240
<17-8,Taub>要是她因为这事再也不理我了怎么办
<17-8,Taub>What if she never speaks to me again?

478
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,970
<17-9,Foreman>她早晚都会知道
<17-9,Foreman>She's gonna find out.

479
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,970
<17-9,Foreman>最好是你告诉她的
<17-9,Foreman>It better be from you.

480
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,440
<17-9,Foreman>这事儿你真蒙不过去
<17-9,Foreman>You can't cheat your way out of this one.

481
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,710
<18-1,Thirteen>怎么了
<18-1,Thirteen>What is it?

482
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,020
<18-2,Afsoun>就是有点恶心
<18-2,Afsoun>Oh, just the nausea.

483
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,740
<18-3,Luca>之前她说她后背疼来着
<18-3,Luca>She said her back was hurting earlier.

484
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,730
<18-4,Thirteen>要是痛感分十度  你背疼达到多少
<18-4,Thirteen>What's the pain level on a scale of one to ten?

485
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,630
<18-5,Afsoun>五度
<18-5,Afsoun>Five.

486
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,940
<18-6,Chase>怎么确定她说的是实话
<18-6,Chase>How do we know we can take her word for it?

487
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,780
<18-7,Thirteen>不能  好玩吧
<18-7,Thirteen>We can't. Fun, huh?

488
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,540
<18-7,Thirteen>转过身
<18-7,Thirteen>Roll on your side.

489
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,250
<18-8,Chase>Grey Turner症[胰腺炎典型体征]
<18-8,Chase>Grey Turner's sign.

490
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,780
<18-9,Thirteen>游戏玩够了
<18-9,Thirteen>We're done playing.

491
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,800
<18-9,Thirteen>你的胰腺正在释放消化酶
<18-9,Thirteen>Your pancreas is releasing corrosive enzymes.

492
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,170
<18-9,Thirteen>它会把周围的脏器都消化光
<18-9,Thirteen>It'll eat away at the surrounding organs.

493
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,070
<18-10,Chase>这点你肯定知道
<18-10,Chase>But you must know that.

494
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,010
<18-10,Chase>给你做诊断的大夫应该跟你说过
<18-10,Chase>The doctor who diagnosed you would have said

495
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,530
<18-10,Chase>不做治疗会出现什么后果
<18-10,Chase>what will happen if you don't get treatment.

496
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,120
<18-10,Chase>告诉他们吧
<18-10,Chase>Just tell them.

497
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,650
<18-10,Chase>如果你知道自己到底怎么了
<18-10,Chase>If you know what's wrong with you,

498
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,210
<18-11,Afsoun>告诉他们好让他们治好你
<18-11,Afsoun>tell them so they can fix it.

499
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,230
<18-11,Afsoun>我们一起合作过多少作品了
<18-11,Afsoun>How many projects have we done together?

500
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,570
<18-11,Afsoun>你总是那么担心
<18-11,Afsoun>You're always so worried.

501
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,400
<18-11,Afsoun>有哪次你相信了我而出错的吗
<18-11,Afsoun>Have you ever gone wrong trusting me?

502
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,500
<19-1,Thirteen>咱们引流过的那个胰腺囊肿
<19-1,Thirteen>That pancreatic cyst we drained--

503
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,290
<19-1,Thirteen>它又长回来了  而且病人毫不在意
<19-1,Thirteen>it's back, and she doesn't care at all.

504
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,870
<19-2,House>你觉得她就是想寻死
<19-2,House>You think she actually is suicidal.

505
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,280
<19-3,Thirteen>我是这么想
<19-3,Thirteen>I would,

506
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,380
<19-3,Thirteen>但她是怎么让自己长出囊肿的
<19-3,Thirteen>but how did she give herself the cysts?

507
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,720
<19-3,Thirteen>毒物筛检是阴性的
<19-3,Thirteen>Tox screen was negative,

508
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,480
<19-3,Thirteen>而且也没有外伤迹象
<19-3,Thirteen>and there's no sign of trauma.

509
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,230
<19-4,House>还有一种解释
<19-4,House>There is another explanation.

510
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,200
<19-4,House>她对此毫无反应
<19-4,House>The reason she didn't react

511
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
<19-4,House>不是因为她一心想死
<19-4,House>isn't 'cause she wants to die.

512
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,420
<19-4,House>而是因为她无计可施
<19-4,House>It's 'cause she knows she can't do anything about it.

513
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,390
<19-4,House>不管她得的是什么  都是致命的
<19-4,House>Whatever she has is fatal.

514
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,040
<19-4,House>这应该能缩小范围了
<19-4,House>That should narrow it down.

515
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,730
<19-4,House>我们在这里干什么
<19-4,House>What are we doing here?

516
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,380
<20-1,Luca>验证一个理论
<20-1,Luca>Testing a theory.

517
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,840
<20-2,House>基于一些你不懂的东西
<20-2,House>It's based on some stuff you can't understand,

518
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,440
<20-2,House>比如说变异率
<20-2,House>like RR variability,

519
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,860
<20-2,House>还有些你能懂的
<20-2,House>and some stuff you can,

520
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,560
<20-2,House>比如四个月前她的一场行为艺术
<20-2,House>like the fact that she shaved her head

521
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,130
<20-2,House>给自己削了发
<20-2,House>in an art piece four months ago.

522
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,120
<20-3,Luca>那是一种诠释社会的...
<20-3,Luca>That was a commentary on society's--

523
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,340
<20-4,House>那是一种诠释
<20-4,House>It was a commentary on the fact

524
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,180
<20-4,House>她的头发不剃也得全掉光
<20-4,House>that it was gonna fall out anyway,

525
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,960
<20-4,House>而她这么做是想掩盖其原因
<20-4,House>and she wanted to hide why.

526
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,370
<20-5,Luca>癌症吗
<20-5,Luca>Cancer?

527
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,490
<20-5,Luca>你  你确定吗
<20-5,Luca>Are--are you sure about that?

528
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,130
<20-6,House>看到她的脑仁旁边那个
<20-6,House>See that tumor-ish thingamajig

529
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,490
<20-6,House>像肿瘤一样的玩意了吗
<20-6,House>near her "Brainamabob"?

530
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,160
<20-7,Luca>哦  上帝
<20-7,Luca>Oh, God.

531
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,640
<20-8,House>你的明白
<20-8,House>Are you getting this?

532
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,250
<20-8,House>游戏结束  本人胜出
<20-8,House>Game's over. I won.

533
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,450
<20-8,House>原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤
<20-8,House>Primary CNS lymphoma

534
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,100
<20-8,House>伴相关副肿瘤综合征
<20-8,House>with associated paraneoplastic syndrome.

535
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,050
<20-9,Luca>真的是这样吗
<20-9,Luca>Is that really what it is?

536
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,020
<20-9,Luca>是
<20-9,Luca>Yes.

537
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,750
<20-10,Afsoun>四个月之前
<20-10,Afsoun>Four months ago,

538
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,020
<20-10,Afsoun>我出现了视觉和平衡障碍
<20-10,Afsoun>I had some vision and balance problems,

539
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,250
<20-10,Afsoun>在纽约仁爱医院确诊
<20-10,Afsoun>and New York Mercy diagnosed me.

540
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,950
<20-10,Afsoun>肿瘤太靠近脑干无法切除
<20-10,Afsoun>The tumor was too close to the brain stem to cut out,

541
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,780
<20-10,Afsoun>所以他们给我做了几个疗程的放疗
<20-10,Afsoun>so they did a few rounds of radiation.

542
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,650
<20-10,Afsoun>但是没有效果  就让我出院了
<20-10,Afsoun>But it didn't work, and they sent me home.

543
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,750
<20-11,Luca>你就是那段时间跟我分手的
<20-11,Luca>That was around the time you broke up with me.

544
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,950
<20-12,Afsoun>我们在图一时的欢愉
<20-12,Afsoun>We were having a fling.

545
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,260
<20-12,Afsoun>把你卷进来对你不公平
<20-12,Afsoun>It wouldn't have been fair to involve you.

546
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,780
<20-13,Luca>我现在卷进来了
<20-13,Luca>I'm involved now.

547
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,060
<20-13,Luca>你就是不愿对我敞开心扉
<20-13,Luca>You just didn't want to open up.

548
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,900
<20-14,Afsoun>卢卡  我当时意识不清晰
<20-14,Afsoun>Luca, my mind was not clear then.

549
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,050
<20-15,House>然后你觉醒了
<20-15,House>And then you cleared it.

550
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,560
<20-15,House>你觉得可以利用你的行将死去
<20-15,House>Then you realized you could use your death

551
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,710
<20-15,House>来完成一个巨作
<20-15,House>to make your magnum opus.

552
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,900
<20-15,House>也许你是想证明没人能逃过一死
<20-15,House>Maybe you wanted to show that no one can cheat death,

553
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,480
<20-15,House>即使一群拥有无限资源的医生也束手无策
<20-15,House>even an entire team of doctors with unlimited resources.

554
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,970
<20-15,House>或者是最初确诊你的医生
<20-15,House>Or maybe your first doctors

555
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,700
<20-15,House>没把你当人看  而是看成了一堆病症
<20-15,House>didn't treat you like a person-- just a series of symptoms.

556
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,310
<20-15,House>你想要重现这种非人性行为
<20-15,House>You wanted to re-create that depersonalization.

557
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,160
<20-15,House>而我是你的实验对象
<20-15,House>And I was the man to see.

558
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,190
<20-16,Afsoun>如果我以前那么想过
<20-16,Afsoun>If that was what I thought,

559
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,190
<20-16,Afsoun>在也不再这样认为了
<20-16,Afsoun>I don't any longer.

560
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,510
<20-16,Afsoun>你花时间和我在一起
<20-16,Afsoun>You spent time with me.

561
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,480
<20-16,Afsoun>带入了个人情感
<20-16,Afsoun>You took this personally.

562
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,090
<20-16,Afsoun>不  我没有
<20-16,Afsoun>No, I didn't.

563
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,410
<20-17,House>而且我一点不觉得你的作品有什么意义
<20-17,House>And I don't actually think your piece is about anything.

564
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,060
<20-17,House>我觉得  你不过是发现人生难逃一死
<20-17,House>I think you just figured out that you're mortal.

565
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,230
<20-17,House>自己不过是一堆细胞与代谢废物
<20-17,House>You're just a bag of cells and waste

566
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,240
<20-17,House>最终将化为坟中的一掊土
<20-17,House>with an expiration date.

567
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,700
<20-17,House>你要出格的表演  想引起人们注意
<20-17,House>You wanted to act out. You wanted people to notice.

568
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,690
<20-17,House>可能你还祈祷这次的结果会不一样
<20-17,House>Maybe you even prayed for a different answer this time.

569
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,780
<20-17,House>我给你的作品起了个名字
<20-17,House>I got a title for your piece--

570
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,260
<20-17,House>味同嚼蜡
<20-17,House>"It Doesn't Mean Anything".

571
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,790
<21-1,Wilson>你又伪造我的签名开处方了
<21-1,Wilson>You're forging my name on prescriptions again.

572
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
<21-1,Wilson>错
<21-1,Wilson>No.

573
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,020
<21-2,House>你说的好像我有哪次不是这么干似的
<21-2,House>What you just said implies that I stopped at some point.

574
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,410
<21-3,Wilson>二十分钟前  我通知了所有本地药房
<21-3,Wilson>20 minutes ago, I put a notice out to all local pharmacies

575
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,460
<21-3,Wilson>在给我的处方开药前
<21-3,Wilson>to require verbal authorization

576
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,800
<21-3,Wilson>都需要我的口头授权
<21-3,Wilson>before filling my prescriptions.

577
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,520
<21-4,House>你这就是给自己找麻烦
<21-4,House>You have any idea how much extra work you've just given yourself?

578
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,350
<21-4,House>连一周你都坚持不了
<21-4,House>You're not gonna last a week.

579
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,350
<21-5,Wilson>你的这种行为我容忍了很多年
<21-5,Wilson>I've been dealing with this for years.

580
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,480
<21-5,Wilson>但现在我不干了
<21-5,Wilson>But it's over--

581
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,570
<21-5,Wilson>这有害于你的肝脏  听力
<21-5,Wilson>your liver, your hearing,

582
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,980
<21-5,Wilson>更别说你冒名签的每个处方
<21-5,Wilson>never mind the fact that each scrip you write

583
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,170
<21-5,Wilson>都是一项重罪
<21-5,Wilson>is a separate felony.

584
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,710
<21-5,Wilson>你会坐牢的  我也会被牵连
<21-5,Wilson>You will serve time, so could I.

585
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,390
<21-6,House>你选择在这个时候
<21-6,House>You've chosen this moment

586
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,790
<21-6,House>来埋怨我嗑维可丁吗
<21-6,House>to give me crap about my Vicodin use?

587
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,460
<21-7,Wilson>你三天前才开的药
<21-7,Wilson>You filled this three days ago.

588
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,760
<21-7,Wilson>现在一半都没了
<21-7,Wilson>Now it's almost half gone.

589
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,690
<21-8,House>我的腿不也是这样
<21-8,House>So is my leg.

590
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,560
<21-9,Wilson>这是一个月的用量
<21-9,Wilson>It's a month supply.

591
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,780
<21-9,Wilson>你现在服用的剂量
<21-9,Wilson>The amount you're taking has nothing to do

592
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,610
<21-9,Wilson>-对缓解躯体疼痛没有作用  -好吧
<21-9,Wilson>- with physical pain.  - Okay.

593
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,150
<21-10,House>也许我是想让自己麻木一点
<21-10,House>So maybe I am trying to numb myself a little,

594
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,060
<21-10,House>因为我在尝试改变
<21-10,House>because I'm trying to change,

595
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,090
<21-10,House>尝试不要自我毁灭
<21-10,House>trying to stop being self-destructive.

596
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,170
<21-11,Wilson>你就一定要用自残的方式
<21-11,Wilson>So you can only handle not self-destructing

597
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,390
<21-11,Wilson>来缓解你的自我毁灭倾向吗
<21-11,Wilson>by being self-destructive?

598
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
<21-12,House>你想让我怎么样
<21-12,House>What do you want from me?

599
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,160
<21-13,Wilson>我不知道  豪斯  但我担心你
<21-13,Wilson>I don't know, House, but I'm worried about you.

600
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,570
<21-13,Wilson>我不想再这样
<21-13,Wilson>I don't know how many times I can watch you

601
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,010
<21-13,Wilson>看着你自我摧残
<21-13,Wilson>cut off pieces of yourself.

602
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,720
<21-13,Wilson>这次是重症监护病房  下次可能是停尸房
<21-13,Wilson>Now it's the I.C.U. Next time it'll be the morgue.

603
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,930
<21-13,Wilson>你感到痛苦
<21-13,Wilson>You're miserable.

604
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,350
<21-13,Wilson>也很愤怒
<21-13,Wilson>And you're angry.

605
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,460
<21-13,Wilson>而我希望你能直面这些问题
<21-13,Wilson>And I want you to actually deal with that

606
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,320
<21-13,Wilson>而不是通过嗑药来逃避
<21-13,Wilson>and not just try to medicate the issue away.

607
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,870
<21-13,Wilson>不
<21-13,Wilson>No.

608
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
<21-14,House>你知道我现在的感觉吗
<21-14,House>You know what I feel right now?

609
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,150
<21-14,House>我不痛苦  也不愤怒
<21-14,House>I don't feel miserable or angry.

610
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,300
<21-14,House>感觉不好  也不坏
<21-14,House>I don't feel good or bad.

611
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,020
<21-14,House>我感觉无所谓
<21-14,House>I feel nothing...

612
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,470
<21-14,House>这种感觉不错
<21-14,House>which feels great.

613
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,710
<21-15,Wilson>你要干什么
<21-15,Wilson>What are you doing?

614
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,870
<21-16,House>继续生活
<21-16,House>Moving on.

615
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,420
<21-16,House>回自己家去  我还藏了不少药
<21-16,House>In the direction of my house, where I got some more pills.

616
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,540
<22-1,Nurse>如果你不遵医嘱坚持要出院的话
<22-1,Nurse>If you're discharging yourself against doctor's orders,

617
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,320
<22-1,Nurse>你得在那里打勾
<22-1,Nurse>you've got to check that box.

618
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,530
<22-2,House>我是名医生
<22-2,House>I'm a doctor.

619
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,890
<22-2,House>所以  技术上讲
<22-2,House>So, technically--

620
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,630
<22-3,Nurse>打个勾不比说这么多来得简单吗
<22-3,Nurse>Wouldn't it be easier if you just checked the box?

621
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,890
<23-1,House>你怎么还在这
<23-1,House>Why are you still here?

622
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,990
<23-2,Afsoun>等护士给我拿来
<23-2,Afsoun>I'm going as soon as the nurse brings me

623
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,960
<23-2,Afsoun>治疗湿疹的药我就走
<23-2,Afsoun>something for my eczema.

624
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,950
<23-2,Afsoun>我觉得这是在画廊时
<23-2,Afsoun>I figured it was irritated by the paint thinner

625
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,700
<23-2,Afsoun>倒在我身上的颜料引起的
<23-2,Afsoun>poured on me in the gallery.

626
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,230
<23-3,Luca>有什么问题吗
<23-3,Luca>Does this mean something?

627
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,040
<23-4,House>那不是湿疹
<23-4,House>It's not eczema.

628
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,120
<23-4,House>你得的也不是癌症
<23-4,House>And it's not cancer.

629
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,100
<24-1,Chase>是韦格纳肉芽肿
<24-1,Chase>It's Wegener's granulomatosis.

630
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,150
<24-1,Chase>活检证实  你所认为的湿疹
<24-1,Chase>Biopsy confirmed that what you thought was eczema

631
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,740
<24-1,Chase>其实是皮下血管膨胀
<24-1,Chase>was actually a swelling of the blood vessels in your skin.

632
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,310
<24-1,Chase>也解释了你的胰腺炎
<24-1,Chase>It also explains the pancreatitis

633
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,240
<24-1,Chase>和脑部的团块
<24-1,Chase>and the mass in your brain.

634
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,240
<24-1,Chase>是可以治疗的
<24-1,Chase>And it's treatable.

635
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,850
<24-2,Luca>治疗方案是什么
<24-2,Luca>What's the treatment?

636
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,530
<24-3,Chase>可以单用激素
<24-3,Chase>We could do steroids alone

637
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,260
<24-3,Chase>减缓你大脑中团块的生长
<24-3,Chase>to shrink the growth in your brain,

638
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,880
<24-3,Chase>但是再做一个疗程的放疗效果会更好
<24-3,Chase>but it's much better to add another course of radiation.

639
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,110
<24-3,Chase>放疗
<24-3,Chase>Radiation?

640
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,910
<24-4,Afsoun>在我的大脑上吗
<24-4,Afsoun>On my brain?

641
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,690
<24-4,Afsoun>上次放疗就让我头脑不清醒
<24-4,Afsoun>But it made me fuzzy last time.

642
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,070
<24-4,Afsoun>很难去工作
<24-4,Afsoun>It was harder to work.

643
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,600
<24-4,Afsoun>现在还没完全恢复
<24-4,Afsoun>I am still slowed down from it.

644
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,760
<24-5,House>这次会更糟
<24-5,House>And it'll get worse.

645
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,320
<24-5,House>但是死亡会让你失去思考的能力
<24-5,House>But, you know, dying can also do a number on your ability to think.

646
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,640
<24-6,Afsoun>抱歉  我不能接受放疗
<24-6,Afsoun>I'm sorry. I can't do the radiation.

647
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,430
<24-7,Luca>他们刚才说这是更好的治疗方案
<24-7,Luca>They just said it was a better treatment.

648
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,820
<24-7,Luca>可以救你一命
<24-7,Luca>It could save your life.

649
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,920
<24-8,Afsoun>倘若不能创作  我的生命又有何意义
<24-8,Afsoun>My life's not worth anything if I can't do my art.

650
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,770
<24-9,Luca>你还有朋友
<24-9,Luca>You have friends,

651
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,450
<24-9,Luca>关心你的人们
<24-9,Luca>people who care about you.

652
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,050
<24-10,Afsoun>这是我的大脑  我的工作
<24-10,Afsoun>This is my brain, my work,

653
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,990
<24-10,Afsoun>我的人生  卢卡
<24-10,Afsoun>and my life, Luca.

654
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,050
<24-11,Luca>你拥有的岂止于此
<24-11,Luca>You have more.

655
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,000
<24-11,Luca>这不再是什么伟大的表演作品了
<24-11,Luca>This is not some great performance piece anymore.

656
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,910
<24-11,Luca>只是纯粹的疯狂
<24-11,Luca>This is just crazy.

657
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,690
<24-12,Afsoun>对不起
<24-12,Afsoun>I'm sorry.

658
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,520
<24-13,Luca>我无法眼睁睁看着你死去
<24-13,Luca>I can't watch you die...

659
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,130
<24-13,Luca>尤其在明知你可以活下去的情况下
<24-13,Luca>not when you can save yourself.

660
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,620
<24-13,Luca>再见  阿夫松
<24-13,Luca>Good-bye, Afsoun.

661
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,320
<24-14,House>你够狠的
<24-14,House>Good for you.

662
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
<25-1,House>-那么  -那么
<25-1,House>- So. - So.

663
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,130
<25-2,Cuddy>我当年为什么要禁止餐厅售酒呢
<25-2,Cuddy>Why did I ever ban alcohol from the cafeteria?

664
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,740
<25-2,Cuddy>差点忘了  还有把梳子
<25-2,Cuddy>Before I forget, there's a brush.

665
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,040
<25-2,Cuddy>玳瑁柄  鬃毛梳
<25-2,Cuddy>Tortoise-shell handle, natural bristles--

666
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,920
<25-2,Cuddy>没在盒子里
<25-2,Cuddy>wasn't in the box.

667
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,430
<25-2,Cuddy>如果你能找找的话
<25-2,Cuddy>If you could look for it...

668
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,520
<25-3,House>无故失踪了
<25-3,House>Like the Lindbergh baby.

670
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,090
<25-3,House>你有在约会吗
<25-3,House>You dating anyone?

671
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,480
<25-4,Cuddy>我们没必要...
<25-4,Cuddy>We don't have to--

672
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,480
<25-5,House>人们吃饭时不都聊这种话题嘛
<25-5,House>Look, it's just standard lunch conversation.

673
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,680
<25-6,Cuddy>我们不适用
<25-6,Cuddy>Not for us.

674
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,600
<25-7,House>好吧  如果你认为
<25-7,House>Okay, well, if you've gone over

675
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,640
<25-7,House>我们"什么都不能聊"的话
<25-7,House>to the "We don't talk about things" side,

676
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,890
<25-7,House>我还有其它事等着做呢
<25-7,House>then I've got a pot roast in the oven.

677
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,800
<25-7,House>没有
<25-7,House>No.

678
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,510
<25-8,Cuddy>分手之后我还没约会过
<25-8,Cuddy>I haven't dated anyone since you.

679
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,330
<25-9,House>人们常说  一朝瘸腿
<25-9,House>Well, you know what they say-- once you go gimp...

680
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,690
<25-10,Cuddy>来谈谈你的腿吧
<25-10,Cuddy>We s-should talk about your leg.

681
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,680
<25-11,House>你觉得我有解不开的心结
<25-11,House>You think I have unresolved issues,

682
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,690
<25-11,House>而你就是我的心结
<25-11,House>and you are the unresolved issues.

683
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,640
<25-11,House>没错
<25-11,House>Yes.

684
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,260
<25-12,Cuddy>但是  我觉得还不仅如此
<25-12,Cuddy>But it's--it's-- I think it's more than that.

685
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,610
<25-12,Cuddy>还有你的人生  你的选择
<25-12,Cuddy>It's your life, your choices.

686
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,420
<25-13,House>我这么做是为了让人生走上正轨
<25-13,House>I did it to fix my life.

687
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,140
<25-13,House>不对  等等
<25-13,House>No, wait.

688
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,650
<25-13,House>不  我这么做是因为我极度抑郁
<25-13,House>No, I did it because I'm a deeply unhappy person.

689
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,890
<25-13,House>不不  我这么做是为了博取你的同情
<25-13,House>No--no, I did it to get sympathy from you.

690
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,750
<25-13,House>我这么做是为了惹毛你
<25-13,House>I did it to piss you off.

691
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,170
<25-13,House>是因为我忘不了你
<25-13,House>I did it because I'm not over you.

692
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,240
<25-13,House>或者我已经忘了  我要继续生活
<25-13,House>Or I was over you, and I was moving on.

693
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,490
<25-13,House>我这么做是因为我想知道
<25-13,House>I did it because I wanted to know

694
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,050
<25-13,House>没有痛苦是什么感觉
<25-13,House>what it's like not to be in pain.

695
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,190
<25-13,House>我这么做是因为我想更痛苦
<25-13,House>I did it because I want to feel more pain.

696
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,530
<25-13,House>不管理由是什么
<25-13,House>Whatever the reason,

697
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,400
<25-13,House>都不成理由  是个错误的决定
<25-13,House>it was a bad reason and a bad idea.

698
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,780
<25-13,House>这才是关键
<25-13,House>That's all that matters.

699
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,480
<25-13,House>你好好吃吧
<25-13,House>Good lunch.

700
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,840
<25-14,Cuddy>豪斯
<25-14,Cuddy>House.

701

<25-14,Cuddy>跟我聊聊
<25-14,Cuddy>Talk to me!

702
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,370
<25-15,House>已经说过了
<25-15,House>I already did.

703
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,810
<25-16,Cuddy>不  你只是回放了一遍
<25-16,Cuddy>No, you just parroted back

704
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,550
<25-16,Cuddy>过去几天我和威尔森跟你说过的话
<25-16,Cuddy>what Wilson and I've been saying to you the last few days.

705
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,290
<25-17,House>-让开  -不
<25-17,House>- Get out of my way. - No.

706
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,040
<25-18,Cuddy>你把缝线扯开了
<25-18,Cuddy>Oh, you pulled a stitch.

707
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,730
<25-18,Cuddy>豪斯  求你和我说说话
<25-18,Cuddy>House, please just talk to me.

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,740
<25-19,House>你想知道我现在的感受吗
<25-19,House>You want to know how I feel?

709
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,740
<25-19,House>我很受伤
<25-19,House>I feel hurt.

710
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,090
<25-20,Cuddy>我知道
<25-20,Cuddy>I know.

711
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,100
<25-20,Cuddy>对不起
<25-20,Cuddy>I'm sorry.

712
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,170
<25-21,House>不是你的错
<25-21,House>It's not your fault.

713
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,880
<26-1,Afsoun>我是不是做错了
<26-1,Afsoun>Did I make the wrong choice?

714
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,900
<26-1,Afsoun>五年了
<26-1,Afsoun>Five years,

715
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,030
<26-1,Afsoun>每次开幕  每次布置展场
<26-1,Afsoun>through every opening, every installation,

716
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,260
<26-1,Afsoun>每一天每一夜
<26-1,Afsoun>every day and every night,

717
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,040
<26-1,Afsoun>他一直都在我身边
<26-1,Afsoun>he was there the whole time.

718
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,120

<26-2,Thirteen>Except the first time you were diagnosed.

719
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,590
<26-2,Thirteen>你和他分了手
<26-2,Thirteen>You broke up with him,

720
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,700
<26-2,Thirteen>那你就得独自承担那一切
<26-2,Thirteen>and you had to go through all of that alone.

721
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,370
<26-2,Thirteen>也许你创作这个作品的真正原因
<26-2,Thirteen>Maybe that's the real reason you're doing this piece--

722
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,730
<26-2,Thirteen>是为了让他陪着你
<26-2,Thirteen>so that this time you can have him with you.

723
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,060
<26-2,Thirteen>你还有机会
<26-2,Thirteen>You still could.

<27-1,Cuddy>我  最近的生活诸事不顺
<27-1,Cuddy>I...there were some personal things going on in my life,

728
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,720
<27-1,Cuddy>那天状态不是很好
<27-1,Cuddy>and I wasn't at my best.

729
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,200
<27-2,Jerry>回想一下
<27-2,Jerry>Well, in retrospect,

730
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,590
<27-2,Jerry>我的做法也确实有点唐突
<27-2,Jerry>my approach could've come off as a little creepy.

731
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,610
<27-2,Jerry>没有
<27-2,Jerry>No.

732
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,920
<27-3,Cuddy>如果打个分
<27-3,Cuddy>On a scale from one to creepy,

733
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,850
<27-3,Cuddy>至多算是令人紧张吧
<27-3,Cuddy>you were maybe mildly unnerving.

750
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,620
<30-4,Afsoun>因为还有更重要的东西...
<30-4,Afsoun>Because there are more important things than...

751
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,490
<30-5,House>比什么重要  你的头脑
