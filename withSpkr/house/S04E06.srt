352
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,940

<19-8,ERIC FOREMAN>但 回到医学讨论上来行吗?
<19-8,ERIC FOREMAN>But can we get back to the medicine?

364
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,380
<19-9,ERIC FOREMAN>你们最不在乎的就是医学
<19-9,ERIC FOREMAN>The last thing any of you give/a damn about is the medicine!

365

<19-10,ERIC FOREMAN>除了他有乐子 谁都占不到好处
<19-10,ERIC FOREMAN>And none of it works/for anyone except him.

<19-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>谁赢都一样
<19-11,AMBER VOLAKIS>And whoever wins.

372
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,180
<19-12,CHRIS TAUB>考虑到病情恶化速度之快/很可能是肉毒杆菌中毒
<19-12,CHRIS TAUB>Given its quick progression,we/gotta assume botulism.

<19-14,TRAVIS BRENNAN>It's not botulism.It's polio.

375

<29-2,GREG HOUSE>- 你傲慢!/- 没必要大吼
<29-2,GREG HOUSE>- You're arrogant!/- There's no need to yell.

537

<29-3,SIDNEY CURTIS>你有可能害死那个人
<29-3,SIDNEY CURTIS>You may have cost that man his life.

<29-4,GREG HOUSE>他正在做放射病的治疗

<30-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>自我指责帮不了她
<30-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Self-recriminations won't help her.

552
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,310
<30-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>没什么能帮她 她得了脊髓灰质炎
<30-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Nothing's gonna help/her.She's got polio.

563
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,750
<30-11,ERIC FOREMAN>那是因为维生素C不可能治愈脊髓灰质炎
<30-11,ERIC FOREMAN>That's because there's no logical/reason vitamin c would cure polio.

564
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,350
<30-12,TRAVIS BRENNAN>有人觉得可能
<30-12,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Well,someone thought there was.

<30-16,TRAVIS BRENNAN>If there's anything you learn today,

570
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,400

<31-5,GREG HOUSE>可能
<31-5,GREG HOUSE>Probably.

577
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,950
<32-1,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我们要尝试一种实验疗法

<32-2,LOU ALFONSO>- 新药?/- 旧的 维生素C
<32-2,LOU ALFONSO>- A new drug?/- An old one.Vitamin c.

<32-3,TRAVIS BRENNAN>大剂量的维生素C能杀死脊髓灰质炎病毒/修复神经损伤
<32-3,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Ultra-high doses have been shown to destroy/the polio virus and heal nerve damage.

580
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,860
<32-4,LOU ALFONSO>那她的腿就能动了
<32-4,LOU ALFONSO>She could regain use of her legs.

581
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,970
<32-5,ERIC FOREMAN>不太可能
<32-5,ERIC FOREMAN>It's unlikely.

582
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,570
<32-6,TRAVIS BRENNAN>但我们会尝试 别放弃
<32-6,TRAVIS BRENNAN>But we're gonna try.Don't give up.

583
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,810
<32-6,TRAVIS BRENNAN>恶心的感觉...
<32-6,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Nausea's...

584

<33-2,GREG HOUSE>放射病有潜伏期
<33-2,GREG HOUSE>Radiation sickness has a latency period.

586

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,440
<33-5,JOHN>叫作恶魔之舞

593
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,350
<33-6,GREG HOUSE>不好玩
<33-6,GREG HOUSE>Not interesting.

594

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,210
<33-7,JOHN>她答应告诉我一些事...
<33-7,JOHN>She agreed to tell me stuff...

600
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,850
<33-8,GREG HOUSE>这半截故事还算有趣
<33-8,GREG HOUSE>Okay,we have half a good story there.

601
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,600
<33-9,JOHN>因果报应
<33-9,JOHN>Karma.

602

<33-10,GREG HOUSE>摆脱负罪感最好的办法就是忏悔罪行
<33-10,GREG HOUSE>Best way to rid yourself of that/guilt is to confess your sins.

603
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,690
<33-11,JOHN>这疼痛是...对的
<33-11,JOHN>This pain is...right.

604
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,170
<33-11,JOHN>是种宽慰
<33-11,JOHN>It's comforting.

605
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,910
<33-11,JOHN>让我觉得...某种程度上 万物皆有因果
<33-11,JOHN>It makes me think/that...Somehow,it all makes sense.

606
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,440
<33-12,GREG HOUSE>为什么是40天?
<33-12,GREG HOUSE>What do you mean,40 days?

607
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,200
<33-13,JOHN>是他们发现
<33-13,JOHN>When they found out.

608
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,750
<33-13,JOHN>她告诉了我机密的时候
<33-13,JOHN>What she...told me.

609

<33-14,GREG HOUSE>玻利维亚的狂欢节只有8天
<33-14,GREG HOUSE>Carnival in bolivia's only eight days.

<33-14,GREG HOUSE>你知道栗子长什么样吗?
<33-14,GREG HOUSE>You have any idea what/a chestnut looks like?

611
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,770
<34-1,GREG HOUSE>你这白痴

612
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,350
<34-2,SAMIRA TERZI>你说谁是白痴?
<34-2,SAMIRA TERZI>Who are you calling an idiot?

613
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,400
<34-3,GREG HOUSE>那些知道John在巴西活动/而不是玻利维亚的人
<34-3,GREG HOUSE>Whoever knew that john/was stationed in brazil,

614
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,080
<34-3,GREG HOUSE>- 巴西?
<34-3,GREG HOUSE>- not bolivia./- Brazil?

615
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,020
<34-5,GREG HOUSE>我猜该叫你白痴
<34-5,GREG HOUSE>Well,then,I guess I'm/talking to you,idiot.

616
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,130
<34-6,AGENT SMITH>那在同一地区
<34-6,AGENT SMITH>It's the same region.

617
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,140
<34-6,AGENT SMITH>是同种寄生物 同样的病
<34-6,AGENT SMITH>It's the same parasite,same diseases.

618
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,360
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>但不是同种语言
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>But not the same language.

619
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,060
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>在玻利维亚 栗子是栗子
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>In bolivia,chestnuts are chestnuts.

620
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,560
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>然而巴西是hascastanhas-do-para
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>Brazil,on the other/hand,hascastanhas-do-para,

621
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,940
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>字面意思是 "来自帕拉树的栗子"
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>literally,"chestnuts from para."

622
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,040
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>因为没有巴西人会笨到叫它们
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>Because it would be stupid/for people from brazil

623
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,810
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>巴西坚果!
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>to call them brazil nuts!

624
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,480
<34-8,AGENT SMITH>就算他吃了巴西坚果 有什么大不了
<34-8,AGENT SMITH>So he ate brazil nuts.Big deal.

625
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,160
<34-9,GREG HOUSE>不 他吃了很多巴西坚果
<34-9,GREG HOUSE>No,he ate a lot of brazil nuts.

626
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,460
<34-9,GREG HOUSE>这重要得很 因为含硒
<34-9,GREG HOUSE>Which is a big deal,because/they contain selenium.

627
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,480
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>大量的硒会导致疲劳
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>Which,in high doses,causes fatigue,

628
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,000
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>呕吐 皮肤刺痒 指甲脱落 脱发
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>vomiting,skin irritation,discharge/from the fingernail beds,

629
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,910
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>听起来耳熟吗?
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>and hair loss.Any of/that sounding familiar?

630
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,860
<34-11,AGENT SMITH>你能治疗吗?
<34-11,AGENT SMITH>Can you treat it?

631
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,610
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>已经开始治了
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>We've already started.

632
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,050
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>治疗方法是螯合 和放射病一样
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>Treatment's chelation,same/as for radiation sickness.

633
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,920
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>唯一的区别是 治疗坚果中毒效果好得多
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>The only difference is it works/a lot better on nut poisoning.

634
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,330
<34-13,AGENT SMITH>那还有什么问题?
<34-13,AGENT SMITH>So what's the problem?

635
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,640
<34-14,SAMIRA TERZI>你真是个白痴
<34-14,SAMIRA TERZI>You're an idiot.

636
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,400
<35-1,LOU ALFONSO>她为什么在抖?
<35-1,LOU ALFONSO>Why is she shivering?

637
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,990
<35-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>血清低钙是这个疗法的副作用
<35-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Low serum calcium is a side/effect of the treatment.

638
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,850
<35-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我可以给她补充钙
<35-2,TRAVIS BRENNAN>I can give her a calcium supplement.

<35-4,TRAVIS BRENNAN>只有滴注率高 治疗才会有效
<35-4,TRAVIS BRENNAN>Infusion rate has to remain/high for the treatment to work.

<35-7,CASEY ALFONSO>It hurts.

644
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,460
<35-8,TRAVIS BRENNAN>起效了
<35-8,TRAVIS BRENNAN>It's working.

<36-2,SAMIRA TERZI>我知道怎么动动拇指杀人
<36-2,SAMIRA TERZI>I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

650
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,820
<36-3,GREG HOUSE>实际上 我在委婉地说上床的事
<36-3,GREG HOUSE>Actually,I was just trying to/make another euphemism for sex.

651

<37-3,ALLISON CAMERON>when you were dying,you/tried to infect me.

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,770
<37-3,ALLISON CAMERON>因为你知道我会竭尽全力治你
<37-3,ALLISON CAMERON>Because you knew i'd fight for you

665
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,400
<37-3,ALLISON CAMERON>如果我以为自己也快死了
<37-3,ALLISON CAMERON>if I thought I was dying too.

666
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,730
<37-4,ERIC FOREMAN>现在提这个/是为了让我原谅你搅局我的病人?
<37-4,ERIC FOREMAN>You bringing this up now so I'll/forgive you for messing with my patient?

<37-5,ALLISON CAMERON>But I know I'll never/have that sort of...

669

<37-6,ERIC FOREMAN>- 兴奋的感觉/- 你怀念有人想要杀你?

<37-7,ALLISON CAMERON>我怀念...不惜一切做好工作的人
<37-7,ALLISON CAMERON>I miss...people doing whatever/it takes to get the job done.

672
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,000
<37-7,ALLISON CAMERON>我猜那就是我很难放弃这工作的原因
<37-7,ALLISON CAMERON>I guess that's why I'm/having trouble giving it up.

673
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,690
<37-7,ALLISON CAMERON>我不该帮他们搅你的局
<37-7,ALLISON CAMERON>I shouldn't have helped/them mess with your patient.

674
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,020
<37-8,ERIC FOREMAN>他们必须这么做
<37-8,ERIC FOREMAN>They had to screw with me.

675

<37-9,ALLISON CAMERON>你不会...
<37-9,ALLISON CAMERON>You're not...

00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,000
<37-9,ALLISON CAMERON>全都对
<37-9,ALLISON CAMERON>Gonna get everything right.

679
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,870
<37-9,ALLISON CAMERON>但你也不会"全"错
<37-9,ALLISON CAMERON>But you're never gonna/get everything wrong.

680
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,740
<38-1,GREG HOUSE>早上好!
<38-1,GREG HOUSE>Morning!

681
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,290
<38-2,CHRIS TAUB>你前两天干嘛去了?
<38-2,CHRIS TAUB>Uh,where have you/been the last two days?

682
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,440
<38-4,TRAVIS BRENNAN>- 睡过了/- 我们救了赛车手
<38-4,TRAVIS BRENNAN>- Overslept./- We saved speed racer.

683
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,580
<38-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>她得了脊髓灰质炎
<38-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>She had polio.

684
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,660
<38-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我们用维生素C治好了
<38-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>We cured it with vitamin c.

685
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,750
<38-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>对啊
<38-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Yeah.

686
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,440
<38-6,GREG HOUSE>我还曾经用奎宁水治好抑郁症
<38-6,GREG HOUSE>I cured depression/with tonic water once.

687
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,520
<38-6,GREG HOUSE>事实上 里面还有点杜松子酒
<38-6,GREG HOUSE>Actually,I think there/was some gin in it too.

688
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,880
<38-7,CHRIS TAUB>6小时共150克剂量
<38-7,CHRIS TAUB>150 grams over six hours.

689
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,890
<38-8,ERIC FOREMAN>- 有效/- 不 没用
<38-8,ERIC FOREMAN>- It worked./- No,it didn't.

690
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,620
<38-9,ERIC FOREMAN>我说过脊髓灰质炎不能治愈
<38-9,ERIC FOREMAN>I told you you can't cure polio.

691
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,680
<38-9,ERIC FOREMAN>说明她不是没痊愈就是根本没得这病
<38-9,ERIC FOREMAN>That means either she's not/cured or she never had it.

692
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,010
<38-9,ERIC FOREMAN>既然她康复出院了
<38-9,ERIC FOREMAN>Since she's walking out of here...

693
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,130
<38-10,ERIC FOREMAN>我查了她入院时抽的血
<38-10,ERIC FOREMAN>I tested her blood from admittance.

694
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,720
<38-10,ERIC FOREMAN>没有脊髓灰质炎病毒
<38-10,ERIC FOREMAN>no polio.

695
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,480
<38-10,ERIC FOREMAN>说明Brennan搞砸了检测
<38-10,ERIC FOREMAN>that means brennan/screwed up the lab tests.

696
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,130
<38-11,TRAVIS BRENNAN>或者你搞砸了
<38-11,TRAVIS BRENNAN>or you screwed up your lab tests.

697
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,620
<38-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>肯定是你 她好转了
<38-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>you must have.she got better.

698
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,590
<38-13,ERIC FOREMAN>那就是病情反复 或间歇发作
<38-13,ERIC FOREMAN>so it's relapsing and remitting.

699
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,900
<38-13,ERIC FOREMAN>也许是...卟啉病
<38-13,ERIC FOREMAN>maybe...porphyria.

700
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,000
<38-14,GREG HOUSE>那有点牵强
<38-14,GREG HOUSE>nah,that's a stretch.

701
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,350
<38-14,GREG HOUSE>如果她得了卟啉病 尿是紫色的
<38-14,GREG HOUSE>if she had porphyria,you/would have seen purple urine.

702
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,310
<38-15,ERIC FOREMAN>你觉得他治愈了脊髓灰质炎可能性更大?
<38-15,ERIC FOREMAN>you think it's more/likely he cured polio?

703
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,080
<38-15,ERIC FOREMAN>他们相信
<38-15,ERIC FOREMAN>they believe it.

704
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,740
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>她的症状完全符合
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>her symptoms fit perfectly.

705
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,510
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>而另一种解释太复杂曲折
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>and the alternative is/unbelievably convoluted.

706
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,650
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>某些医生用安定下毒
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>some doctor would have/to poison her with valium

707
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,220
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>看起来就像脊髓灰质炎的症状/再伪造检测结果
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>so it looks like/polio,then fake a lab test,

708
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,430
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>然后给她用维生素C 停止下毒
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>then give her vitamin/c and stop the poison

709
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,490
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>她就神奇地痊愈了
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>so she magically gets better.

710
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,500
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>这是可行的 对吧?
<38-16,GREG HOUSE>actually...it is kind of doable,right?

711
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,870
<38-17,GREG HOUSE>你怎么想?
<38-17,GREG HOUSE>so what do you think?

712
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,190
<38-17,GREG HOUSE>在你联系斯德哥尔摩之前/我们给她检测一下铊中毒 怎么样?
<38-17,GREG HOUSE>should we test her for thallium/before you contact stockholm?

713
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,360
<38-17,GREG HOUSE>你给她下毒?
<38-17,GREG HOUSE>you poisoned her?

714
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,070
<38-18,GREG HOUSE>其实 Foreman认为是中暑 才是正确的
<38-18,GREG HOUSE>the really shocking thing is that/Foreman was right about the heatstroke.

715
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,280
<38-19,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我亲眼见到过维生素C治愈脊髓灰质炎
<38-19,TRAVIS BRENNAN>vitamin c cures polio.I've seen it.

716
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,240
<38-20,GREG HOUSE>对...在什么丛林诊所
<38-20,GREG HOUSE>yeah...in some bush clinic.

717
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,620
<38-20,GREG HOUSE>你需要一例正规实验室里的/脊髓灰质炎病例
<38-20,GREG HOUSE>you need polio in a/place with a proper lab.

718
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,140
<38-20,GREG HOUSE>问题是有正规实验室的地方/没有脊髓灰质炎
<38-20,GREG HOUSE>the only problem is that places/with proper labs don't have polio.

719
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,690
<38-21,TRAVIS BRENNAN>那些只害死穷人的病
<38-21,TRAVIS BRENNAN>there is no money in finding cures

720
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,700
<38-21,TRAVIS BRENNAN>总是没有钱资助研究治疗方法
<38-21,TRAVIS BRENNAN>for diseases that only kill poor people.

721
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,290
<38-21,TRAVIS BRENNAN>这会让他们做研究
<38-21,TRAVIS BRENNAN>this will make them do research.

722
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,670
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我是不是伪造了检测结果 重要吗?
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>and what do you care/if I faked a lab test

723
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,770
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>数千性命能够被挽救
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>if it saves a few thousand lives?

724
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,810
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>我非这么做不可
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>I did what I had to do.

725
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,620
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>这不就是你雇我们的原因?
<38-22,TRAVIS BRENNAN>isn't that what you hired us for?

726
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,480
<38-23,GREG HOUSE>所以我也不会炒你
<38-23,GREG HOUSE>which is why I'm not gonna fire you.

727
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,770
<38-24,GREG HOUSE>而让你辞职
<38-24,GREG HOUSE>you're gonna quit.

728
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,790
<38-25,GREG HOUSE>快点 走吧
<38-25,GREG HOUSE>go on,get out of here.

729
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,990
<38-26,ERIC FOREMAN>你就这么让他走了?
<38-26,ERIC FOREMAN>so you're just gonna let him go?

730
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,350
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>毫无疑问
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>absolutely.

731
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,010
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>在你叫警察前 我得让他走的越远越好
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>I'm gonna let him get as far away/as possible before you call the cops.

732
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,220
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>这家伙疯了
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>guy's a nut job.

733
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,660
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>我留谁管事呢?
<38-27,GREG HOUSE>who the hell did I leave in charge?

734
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,470
<38-29,GREG HOUSE>- Foreman./- 那么做自有道理
<38-29,GREG HOUSE>- Foreman./- there was a reason for that.

<39-2,GREG HOUSE>顺便说一下 我的一个手下--
<39-2,GREG HOUSE>by the way,one/of my employees--

739
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,140
<39-3,LISA CUDDY>要么你让中情局的人打电话来证实你的故事
<39-3,LISA CUDDY>either you're gonna have/to get someone from the CIA

<39-4,GREG HOUSE>I was helping some rich hedge/fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.
