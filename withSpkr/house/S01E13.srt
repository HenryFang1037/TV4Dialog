<5-10,House>我又不是万事通
<5-10,House>I never could master all that.

<5-14,House>疹子极其无聊
<5-14,House>The rash is a total snooze,

76
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,330
<5-14,House>但并发肺炎情况就大不一样了
<5-14,House>unless it's connected to the pneumonia,

77
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,280
<5-14,House>热闹了
<5-14,House>Then it's party time.

<6-9,House>Their mistake.

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,490
<6-9,House>说完了吗  没别的可能性了吗
<6-9,House>That's it? Other possibilities?

90
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,530
<6-10,Chase>或许我们该倒过来想想
<6-10,Chase>What if we're thinking about this backwards?

91
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,980
<6-11,House>先出现皮疹  继而引发肺炎
<6-11,House>The rash came first, caused the pneumonia.

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,460
<6-13,Foreman>那些疹子可能就是脓包
<6-13,Foreman>Rash would be more pustular.

97
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,720
<6-14,Chase>不一定  只有一种皮疹症状与其相符
<6-14,Chase>Not always, and there's only one rash, which fits.

98

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,350
<6-16,House>就算我们找不到病因
<6-16,House>Even if we don't learn what's causing this,

104
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,510
<6-16,House>也必须要了解

<7-5,Jeffrey>如果我上周就带他...
<7-5,Jeffrey>If I had had him last week-

112
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,710
<7-6,Sarah>少叨叨了
<7-6,Sarah>This isn't helping.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,930
<7-7,Cameron>我们在检查他是否被蜱叮咬
<7-7,Cameron>We're checking to see if your son has a tick bite.

<8-11,Gabe>你知道孩子们玩的通灵游戏吗
<8-11,Gabe>This seance thing the kids did?

151
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,510
<8-11,Gabe>拼出了我的名字
<8-11,Gabe>It spelled out my name.

<8-11,Gabe>他们说我今年会死
<8-11,Gabe>Said I was gonna die.

153
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,460
<8-12,Chase>拼出的是名还是姓
<8-12,Chase>First name and last name?

154

<8-12,Chase>楼上有个叫盖布的已年衰岁暮  病入膏肓
<8-12,Chase>We've got a Gabe upstairs who's very old, very sick.

<8-13,Gabe>不是别人  就是我  一直倒霉的孩子
<8-13,Gabe>No. It's me. I have the worst luck.

<8-13,Gabe>有次我把镜子打碎了
<8-13,Gabe>One time I broke this mirror,

157

<8-13,Gabe>结果第二周我父母就分居了
<8-13,Gabe>the next week my parents got separated.

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,990
<8-14,Chase>我的父母也分开了
<8-14,Chase>My parents split up too.

159
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,070
<8-14,Chase>孩子们都将其归咎于自己  其实不然
<8-14,Chase>Every kid feels like it's his fault. It never is.

160
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,050
<8-14,Chase>那你还遇见过什么倒霉事啊
<8-14,Chase>So, what about the rest of the stuff?

161
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,130
<8-14,Chase>有没有过背着父母在外面偷偷玩啊
<8-14,Chase>Any playing outside your parents don't know about?

162
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,370
<8-14,Chase>诸如此类的
<8-14,Chase>Anything like that?

163
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,220
<8-14,Chase>或者去了一些不该去的地方

164
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,500
<8-15,Gabe>天哪

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,390
<9-7,House>这些菜鸟医生  就不会以人为本
<9-7,House>These young doctors. It's like they don't care about people.

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,640
<9-8,Rowan>-目无尊长  -或许是我的错
<9-8,Rowan>- No manners. - My fault, probably.

<11-2,Wilson>可我还得出门诊哎

<11-8,Wilson>如果想追根究底
<11-8,Wilson>You want to get to the bottom of this,

201
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,160
<11-8,Wilson>这倒是条正路
<11-8,Wilson>you're doing it exactly right

202
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,840
<11-8,Wilson>别和当事人谈

206
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,960
<11-9,House>不会  因为他们会用化学小嘴撒谎
<11-9,House>No. They're gonna lie through their lying little chemical teeth.

207
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,290
<11-9,House>所以把他们扔进烧杯里  加热就行
<11-9,House>Throw them in a beaker and apply heat.

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,400
<13-11,Chase>纵隔膜看起来不对劲
<13-11,Chase>Well, the mediastinum doesn't look right.

236
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,750
<13-12,Cameron>有点宽
<13-12,Cameron>Slightly widened.

237
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,300
<13-12,Cameron>天哪
<13-12,Cameron>Oh, god.

238
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,050
<13-12,Cameron>它可以通过动物皮毛传染
<13-12,Cameron>It can be transmitted through infected animal hair.

239
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,090
<13-12,Cameron>-但是革兰氏染色检测时应该会发现啊  -不
<13-12,Cameron>- But the gram's stain would have shown - No.

240
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,920
<13-13,House>头孢呋辛会杀死部分病菌
<13-13,House>The cefuroxime would have killed some of it,

241
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,810
<13-13,House>导致结果产生偏差
<13-13,House>clouded the result.

242
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,740
<13-14,Cameron>我们得对他用左氧沙星
<13-14,Cameron>We've gotta get this kid on levaquin.

243
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,990
<13-15,Foreman>他得的是什么病
<13-15,Foreman>What does he have?

244
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,800
<13-16,House>炭疽  这屋子是老侯赛因的吗[暗示萨达姆]
<13-16,House>Anthrax. This house belong to old man Hussein?

245
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,980
<13-17,Chase>或许他确实被诅咒了
<13-17,Chase>Maybe he is cursed.

246
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,010
<14-1,Jeffrey>炭疽  你是说那间阁楼曾住过恐怖分子吗
<14-1,Jeffrey>Anthrax. So, what-you think there were terrorists in that attic?

247
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,160
<14-2,Chase>这是一种天然产生的细菌
<14-2,Chase>It's a naturally occurring bacteria.

248
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,950
<14-2,Chase>我们认为它存在于绝缘材料里
<14-2,Chase>We believe it was in the insulation.

249
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,890
<14-3,Sarah>他的病情有多严重
<14-3,Sarah>How sick is he?

250
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,920
<14-4,Chase>炭疽非常危险
<14-4,Chase>Anthrax is very dangerous,

251
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,270
<14-4,Chase>不过我们及时发现
<14-4,Chase>but we've caught it early.

252
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,350
<14-4,Chase>我们对他用了左氧沙星
<14-4,Chase>He's on levaquin.

253
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,790
<14-4,Chase>这是医院里最好的抗生素
<14-4,Chase>It's the best antibiotic we have.

254
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,320
<14-5,Jeffrey>丽莎  你相信吗
<14-5,Jeffrey>Lisa, you buy this?

255
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,170
<14-6,Cuddy>杰弗  你对我们医院做出了巨大的贡献
<14-6,Cuddy>Jeff, you've helped our hospital a lot.

256
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,360
<14-6,Cuddy>如果对豪斯医生没有信心的话
<14-6,Cuddy>I wouldn't have assigned Dr.House to your case

257
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,830
<14-6,Cuddy>我是不会让他治疗令郎的
<14-6,Cuddy>if I didn't have every confidence in him.

258
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,650
<14-7,Jeffrey>-那他是谁  -杰弗里
<14-7,Jeffrey>- Then who's this guy? - Jeffrey!

259
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,060
<14-8,Sarah>很多怪病都可能会引发皮疹
<14-8,Sarah>There's all these weird diseases that can cause a rash.

260
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,370
<14-9,Jeffrey>你们考虑过利什曼病和丝虫病吗
<14-9,Jeffrey>What about leishmaniasis or filariasis?

261
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,990
<14-11,Jeffrey>-你从哪里听来的  -网上  我做了些调查
<14-11,Jeffrey>- Where'd you hear about those? - Internet. I did some research.

262
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,970
<14-12,Cuddy>那些病极其罕见
<14-12,Cuddy>Well, those are very rare conditions.

263
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,890
<14-13,Jeffrey>难道炭疽病四处蔓延吗
<14-13,Jeffrey>Oh, and anthrax grows along the interstate?

264
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,960
<14-14,Chase>利什曼病不会引发肺炎  而丝虫病...
<14-14,Chase>Leishmaniasis doesn't cause pneumonia, and filariasis-

265
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,940
<14-15,Jeffrey>希望你们能面面俱到  这可是我儿子
<14-15,Jeffrey>Just look into everything. This is my son, all right?

266
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,400
<14-15,Jeffrey>我儿子不好
<14-15,Jeffrey>And I'm gonna stay on top of you

267
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,440
<14-15,Jeffrey>你们一个都跑不了
<14-15,Jeffrey>until I know he's safe.

268
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,790
<14-16,Cuddy>我也希望他能康复
<14-16,Cuddy>I wouldn't expect anything else.

269
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,350
<14-16,Cuddy>医生满地爬啊
<14-16,Cuddy>Everyone's a doctor.

270
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,920
<15-1,Sarah>呼吸  宝贝  没事的  呼吸
<15-1,Sarah>Breathe, baby. It's okay. Breathe. I need you to breathe.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,590
<15-2,Jeffrey>-他喘不动气  -吸气困难
<15-2,Jeffrey>-His breathing - It's on the inhale.

272
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,810
<15-4,Cuddy>-什么意思  -他的呼吸道痉挛
<15-4,Cuddy>- What does that mean? - It means his airway's closing up.

273
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,500
<15-5,Jeffrey>是炭疽病导致的吗
<15-5,Jeffrey>Is the anthrax doin' it?

274
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,170
<15-6,Chase>别动  盖布
<15-6,Chase>All right. Hold still, Gabe.

275
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,590
<15-6,Chase>可能会有些不舒服
<15-6,Chase>This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.

276
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,680
<15-7,Cuddy>我们会治好你的  别担心
<15-7,Cuddy>We've got you. It's okay.

277
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,450
<15-8,Chase>-喉咙里有结节  -气道堵塞吗
<15-8,Chase>- Nodules in his throat. - Airway's occluded?

278
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,730
<15-10,Chase>-需要插管  注射氯羟安定  -注射3毫升
<15-10,Chase>- We've got to intubate. Ativan! - Pushing 3 C.C.'s.

279
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,910
<15-11,Cuddy>气道痉挛
<15-11,Cuddy>Airway's too tight.

280
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,880
<15-13,Jeffrey>怎么回事  怎么回事
<15-13,Jeffrey>What's wrong? What's wrong?

281
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,660
<15-13,Jeffrey>住手  你们这群凶手
<15-13,Jeffrey>No, you're killing him!

282
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,390
<15-14,Sarah>-杰弗里  别插手  -气道痉挛
<15-14,Sarah>- Jeffrey! Let them do their job. - Airway's too tight.

283
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,160
<15-15,Foreman>小号的气管插管
<15-15,Foreman>Get me a smaller tube.

284
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,750
<15-17,Foreman>-气管切开吧  -拿根小号的
<15-17,Foreman>- We're traching. - Smaller tube.

285
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,380
<15-18,Cuddy>-他的嘴唇发紫  -他呼吸停止了
<15-18,Cuddy>- His lips are cyanotic. - He's not breathing.

286
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,760
<15-20,Chase>福曼  气管切开吧
<15-20,Chase>Foreman, we're traching.

287
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,010
<15-21,Foreman>不  我能行  我能插进去
<15-21,Foreman>No. I can do it. I'll get it.

288
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,940
<15-22,Chase>-福曼  你插不进去的  -他已经缺氧了
<15-22,Chase>- Foreman, you're not getting through. - He's not getting air.

289
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,080
<15-23,Cuddy>现在就得气管切开
<15-23,Cuddy>We have to trach him right now.

290
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,170
<15-24,Foreman>不  我能插进去
<15-24,Foreman>No, I can do it.

291
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,100
<15-25,Chase>碘酒
<15-25,Chase>Betadine.

292
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,230
<15-25,Chase>我要切了
<15-25,Chase>I'm doing this.

293
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,910
<15-26,Foreman>好了
<15-26,Foreman>Got it.

294
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,100
<15-26,Foreman>他没事了
<15-26,Foreman>He's okay.

295
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,070
<16-1,House>对抗生素过敏吗
<16-1,House>Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?

296
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,940
<16-1,House>我觉得不是
<16-1,House>I don't think so.

297
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,400
<16-2,Cameron>我们给他换成利福平了
<16-2,Cameron>We switched him to rifampin,

298
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,130
<16-2,Cameron>肿胀也没有消失
<16-2,Cameron>and there was no change in the swelling.

299
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,340
<16-3,Chase>我们应该试试其他的抗生素
<16-3,Chase>We should try another antibiotic.

300
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,550
<16-4,Foreman>真的会同时对两种抗生素过敏吗
<16-4,Foreman>You really think he's allergic to two antibiotics?

301
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,520
<16-5,House>我想听听奇斯医生的想法
<16-5,House>I wanna know what Dr. Chase thinks.

302
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,810
<16-6,Chase>他对两种抗生素过敏是...
<16-6,Chase>It's possible he's allergic

303
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,960
<16-7,House>抱歉  没说你
<16-7,House>Oh! I'm sorry. Not you.

304
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,100
<16-7,House>不怪你  不过我说的是另一位奇斯医生
<16-7,House>Understandable mistake. The other Dr. Chase.

305
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,810
<17-1,Rowan>一名男童得了炭疽并同时对两种抗生素过敏
<17-1,Rowan>Boy gets anthrax and happens to be allergic to two antibiotics.

306
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,810
<17-1,Rowan>无意冒犯任何人
<17-1,Rowan>Hate to step on anybody's toes,

307
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,880
<17-1,Rowan>不过会不会是你们之前的诊断有误呢
<17-1,Rowan>but is it possible your guys got this one wrong?

308
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,970
<17-2,Chase>皮疹是炭疽病的一个主要症状
<17-2,Chase>The rash is classic anthrax.

309
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,090
<17-3,Rowan>你忘记考虑颜色了
<17-3,Rowan>Except the color.

310
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,160
<17-4,Cameron>皮疹还没变黑  没有坏死就不是炭疽
<17-4,Cameron>The rash hasn't turned black yet. No necrosis, no anthrax.

311
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,350
<17-5,Chase>理论上来说  坏死要两周
<17-5,Chase>Necrosis can theoretically take as long as two weeks.

312
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,220
<17-6,House>伙计们  诊断第一  比赛第二
<17-6,House>Guys, it's not a competition. It's a diagnosis.

313
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,240
<17-6,House>谁赞同小奇斯
<17-6,House>Okay. Who thinks junior wins?

314
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,190
<17-6,House>4比1  不是炭疽
<17-6,House>Four to one. It's not anthrax.

315
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,120
<17-6,House>重来  什么变了  结节说明了什么
<17-6,House>So we start over. What's changed? What do the nodules tell us?

316
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,560
<17-8,House>-肉状瘤病  -很好  给你打个A
<17-8,House>- Sarcoidosis. - Excellent. Send an ace level.

317
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,640
<17-8,House>如果检查结果呈阳性  给他用甲氨蝶呤
<17-8,House>If it comes back positive, put him on methotrexate.

318
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,660
<18-1,Foreman>一些检验结果表明是肉状瘤病
<18-1,Foreman>We ran some tests and the results point toward sarcoidosis.

319
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,670
<18-1,Foreman>从而导致一些身体组织肿胀
<18-1,Foreman>It makes the body's tissues swell up.

320
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,930
<18-1,Foreman>看来蔓延到了盖布的皮肤和肺部
<18-1,Foreman>It seems to have gone after Gabriel's skin and lungs

321
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,310
<18-1,Foreman>进而导致他发烧
<18-1,Foreman>and given him this fever.

322
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,000
<18-2,Sarah>医生
<18-2,Sarah>Doctor.

324
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,250
<18-3,Chase>目前我们还不知道病因
<18-3,Chase>We don't know what causes it.

325
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,210
<18-4,Jeffrey>不过你确定他得的是这个病吗
<18-4,Jeffrey>But you're sure he has this one?

326
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,260
<18-5,Chase>我们这里有一名世界级的名医做顾问
<18-5,Chase>We have a world-renowned doctor consulting.

327
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,700
<18-6,Sarah>-他坚信这是肉状瘤病  -那这病有治吗
<18-6,Sarah>- He's convinced this is sarcoidosis. - Is it treatable?

328
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,170
<18-7,Foreman>很简单  这是静脉注射甲氨蝶呤
<18-7,Foreman>Very, actually. See, this is I.V.Methotrexate.

329
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,140
<18-7,Foreman>这是一种消炎药
<18-7,Foreman>It's an anti-inflammatory.

330
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,290
<18-7,Foreman>它可以消肿
<18-7,Foreman>It should make all the swelling go down and,

331
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,630
<18-7,Foreman>治好你的病
<18-7,Foreman>uh, get you all better.

332
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,360
<18-8,Chase>等等
<18-8,Chase>Stop.

333
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,520
<18-9,Sarah>天哪  变黑了
<18-9,Sarah>My god, it's black.

334
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,880
<18-10,Chase>坏死
<18-10,Chase>Necrosis.

335
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,470
<19-1,Foreman>表面症状肯定是炭疽
<19-1,Foreman>It's definitely anthrax,

336
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,150
<19-1,Foreman>综合起来也肯定不是炭疽
<19-1,Foreman>and it definitely can't be anthrax.

337
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,700
<19-1,Foreman>炭疽不会导致喉咙结节
<19-1,Foreman>It doesn't cause throat nodules.

338
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,450
<19-2,Rowan>唯一合理的解释
<19-2,Rowan>Only explanation is,

339
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,980
<19-2,Rowan>这个孩子同时得了炭疽病和肉瘤
<19-2,Rowan>this kid's got anthrax and sarcoidosis.

340
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,630
<19-3,Chase>是啊  两种罕见疾病
<19-3,Chase>Right, two incredibly rare diseases...

341
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,320
<19-3,Chase>同时发在一个人身上
<19-3,Chase>just happening to strike at once.

342
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,170
<19-4,Rowan>你还有其他高见吗
<19-4,Rowan>Unless you've got a better theory.

343
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,080
<19-5,Chase>炭疽并发过敏反应
<19-5,Chase>Anthrax plus an allergic reaction.

344
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,670
<19-6,Rowan>打电话给《柳叶刀》  这里有一项罕见病症
<19-6,Rowan>Call The Lancet, because that's one bizarre allergic reaction.

346
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,990
<19-7,House>别这样  你俩总得有一个是对的吧
<19-7,House>Come on. There's no reason you both can't be wrong.

347
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,840
<19-7,House>不是过敏也不是巧合
<19-7,House>It's not allergy, but it's not coincidence either.

348
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,200
<19-7,House>疾病一引发了疾病二
<19-7,House>Disease number one set off disease number two.

349
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,800
<19-8,Cameron>炭疽破坏了他的免疫系统
<19-8,Cameron>Anthrax weakened his immune system.

350
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,860
<19-9,House>同时引发了潜在肉状瘤
<19-9,House>And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis.

351
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,170
<19-9,House>继续使用抗生素对付炭疽
<19-9,House>Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax,

352
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,360
<19-9,House>再加上治疗肉瘤的甲氨蝶呤
<19-9,House>and start the methotrexate for the sarcoidosis.

353
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,100
<19-10,Chase>看看结果如何
<19-10,Chase>See what happens.

354
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,060
<19-10,Chase>好吧
<19-10,Chase>Fine.

355
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,990
<19-11,House>最好跟着他
<19-11,House>Better go with him.

356
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,830
<19-11,House>以防他草率行事  伤及无辜
<19-11,House>Make sure he doesn't snap and hurt somebody.

357
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,260
<20-1,Jeffrey>你们同时治疗两种病
<20-1,Jeffrey>Yeah, but y-you're treating him for both diseases.

358
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,820
<20-2,Foreman>我们得面面俱到
<20-2,Foreman>We're covering all the bases.

359
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,300
<20-3,Jeffrey>把东西都砸向墙上  看哪个能粘上去吗
<20-3,Jeffrey>What? Throw everything against the wall and see what sticks?

360
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,590
<20-4,Chase>意大利面能粘上去
<20-4,Chase>Works for spaghetti.

361
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,880
<21-1,Jeffrey>你在开玩笑吗
<21-1,Jeffrey>A-are you being funny?

362
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,980
<21-2,House>显然不是
<21-2,House>Apparently not.

363
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,880
<21-3,Jeffrey>知道我为什么给这家医院捐款吗
<21-3,Jeffrey>You know why I give money to this hospital?

364
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,430
<21-3,Jeffrey>唯有此才能引人重视  瞧这儿
<21-3,Jeffrey>It's the only way to get attention. See this?

365
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,090
<21-4,House>你这是在变魔术吗
<21-4,House>Is this a magic trick?

366
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,480
<21-4,House>我可是大卫·科波菲尔的忠实粉丝
<21-4,House>'cause I am a total David Copperfield fan.

367
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,340
<21-4,House>不过我觉得《火旋风》那个魔术
<21-4,House>Although I thought that

368
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,350
<21-4,House>做的有点假
<21-4,House>tornado of fire- that seemed a little fake.

369
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,840
<21-5,Jeffrey>我的手腕疼痛了几个月
<21-5,Jeffrey>Pain in the wrist. It won't go away for months.

370
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,840
<21-5,Jeffrey>6名医生的高见是没毛病
<21-5,Jeffrey>Six doctors' brilliant conclusion is to take it easy.

371
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,740
<21-5,Jeffrey>我捐款后  立刻榜上有名
<21-5,Jeffrey>I write a check, name goes on a plaque,

372
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
<21-5,Jeffrey>48小时后
<21-5,Jeffrey>And 48 hours later

373
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,310
<21-5,Jeffrey>我做了两次核磁共振  一次骨扫描
<21-5,Jeffrey>I've got two M.R.I.'s, a bone scan

374
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,140
<21-5,Jeffrey>被确诊为腕管综合征
<21-5,Jeffrey>and a diagnosis: carpal tunnel.

375
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,130
<21-5,Jeffrey>当天下午我就进了手术室
<21-5,Jeffrey>I'm in surgery that afternoon.

376
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,660
<21-6,House>真是曲折离奇啊
<21-6,House>Fascinating story.

377
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,600
<21-6,House>有没有想过改编成舞台剧啊
<21-6,House>Have you thought of adapting it for the stage?

378
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,140
<21-7,Jeffrey>我爱我...  听我说  我爱我的儿子
<21-7,Jeffrey>I love my look at me. I love my son.

379
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,910
<21-7,Jeffrey>我对他的爱无可取代
<21-7,Jeffrey>I love him more than anything else in the world.

380
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,780
<21-7,Jeffrey>你必须重视这个病例
<21-7,Jeffrey>And you are gonna start paying attention to this case,

381
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,790
<21-7,Jeffrey>否则我会让你痛不欲生
<21-7,Jeffrey>or I'm gonna make things miserable

382
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,160
<21-8,House>-回你儿子的病房  -在引起你重视前
<21-8,House>-Go back to your son's room. -I'm not leaving here

383

<21-9,Jeffrey>-我是不会...  -有情况了
<21-9,Jeffrey>- until you get your ass - There's a problem.

384
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,970
<22-1,Jeffrey>怎么回事
<22-1,Jeffrey>What is it?

385
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,810
<22-2,Foreman>不知道
<22-2,Foreman>I don't know.

386
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,260
<22-2,Foreman>皮肤损害蔓延至全身
<22-2,Foreman>Skin lesions are spreading all over his body.

387
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,590
<22-2,Foreman>损伤破裂  脂肪组织液化
<22-2,Foreman>They're opening up, and the fatty tissues are oozing out.

388
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,990
<23-1,Foreman>不假时日  他会皮肤溃烂
<23-1,Foreman>He'll be septic in a matter of days.

389
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,500

391
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:43,990
<23-5,House>不用了
<23-5,House>No, he doesn't.

392

<23-5,House>我重新安排了你们的日程  你们没事了
<23-5,House>I rescheduled you guys so you'd be free.

393
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,720
<23-6,Cameron>不过  他又重新安排了自己的日程
<23-6,Cameron>Yeah, but he re-rescheduled himself.

394
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,580
<24-1,Patient>-现在还不疼  -继续
<24-1,Patient>-It doesn't hurt yet. - Keep going.

395
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,020
<24-3,House>你呼我了吗
<24-3,House>You page me?

396
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,540
<24-4,Chase>-没啊  这里不需要你  -别这样
<24-4,Chase>- No, I don't need you. - Come on.

397
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,930
<24-5,House>独木难支  孤掌难鸣啊
<24-5,House>We all need help now and again.

398
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,370
<24-5,House>我们要对你进行会诊
<24-5,House>You're getting a consult.

399
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,900
<24-5,House>病人新发皮肤病变
<24-5,House>Okay. We've got new skin lesions,

400
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,420
<24-5,House>范围扩散  情况也更严重
<24-5,House>bigger and uglier.

401
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,300
<24-6,Patient>-病因是什么  -我的手疼
<24-6,Patient>- What would cause that? - My hand hurts.

402
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,620
<24-7,Rowan>如果他的身体努力去抵御炭疽病毒
<24-7,Rowan>What if his body worked so hard attacking

403
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,030
<24-7,Rowan>而产生的抗体又攻击他的身体
<24-7,Rowan>the anthrax that it started attacking itself?

404
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,660
<24-9,Chase>-自身免疫  -不会如此严重
<24-9,Chase>- Autoimmune. - Wouldn't present this aggressively.

405
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,640
<24-10,Cameron>看上去是不像  但是有这个可能
<24-10,Cameron>It's not likely, but it is possible.

406
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,040
<24-11,Chase>是吗  一个12岁的男孩会得这种病
<24-11,Chase>What, in a twelve-year-old male?

407
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,140
<24-12,Patient>你们说的不是我吧
<24-12,Patient>This isn't about me, is it?

408
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,110
<24-13,Chase>盖布的爸爸昨天在网上搜到利什曼病和丝虫病
<24-13,Chase>Gabe's dad found  leishmaniasis and filariasis on the internet yesterday.

409
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,250
<24-13,Chase>那时的症状不符  不过现在症状与之相符
<24-13,Chase>They didn't fit then, but now they kind of do.

410
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,280
<24-14,House>是啊  除了结节
<24-14,House>Sure, except for the nodules,

411
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,260
<24-14,House>我们又不是在加尔各答工作
<24-14,House>and we're not working out of Calcutta General.

413
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,240
<24-15,Chase>多发性神经纤维瘤病
<24-15,Chase>Multiple neurofibromatosis.

414
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,800
<24-16,Foreman>你认为他的病因是神经性的吗
<24-16,Foreman>You think this is neurological?

415
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,710
<24-17,Chase>你认为是免疫系统的问题
<24-17,Chase>The only reason you're thinking

416
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,860
<24-17,Chase>仅仅是因为你是风湿病学家
<24-17,Chase>autoimmune is because you're a rheumatologist.

417
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,270
<24-17,Chase>如果是直肠病学家  你会诊断为直肠癌
<24-17,Chase>If you were a proctologist, you'd think rectal cancer.

418
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,980
<24-18,House>得听老奇斯的
<24-18,House>Gotta go with senior.

419
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,520
<24-18,House>他曾为此写了本书
<24-18,House>He literally wrote the book on this one.

420
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,340
<24-19,Cameron>免疫系统纷繁复杂
<24-19,Cameron>Autoimmune is a big universe.

421
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,020
<24-19,Cameron>从硬皮病到变应性肉芽肿  均有可能
<24-19,Cameron>It could be anything from scleroderma to churg-strauss.

422
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,630
<24-20,Foreman>无论病因是什么
<24-20,Foreman>Whatever it is,

423
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,600
<24-20,Foreman>我们应该给他用类固醇消肿
<24-20,Foreman>we should start him on steroids, keep the swelling down.

424
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,200
<24-21,Cameron>100毫克的环磷酰胺能极大的修复免疫系统
<24-21,Cameron>A hundred milligrams of cytoxan it treats most autoimmunes.

425
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,300
<24-22,House>好  赶在脂肪从他的眼中溢出前给他用药吧
<24-22,House>Well, give it to him now before the fat starts dripping out his eyeballs.

426
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,310
<24-23,Patient>我的手指麻木了
<24-23,Patient>Hey, my fingers are numb.

427
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,500
<24-24,House>表戴得太紧了
<24-24,House>Your watch is on too tight.

428
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,760
<25-1,Chase>你让我很混乱
<25-1,Chase>You're messing with my head.

429
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,930
<25-2,House>你和你爸的关系
<25-2,House>Your relationship with your dad is

430
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,590
<25-2,House>使你的工作大受干扰
<25-2,House>messing with your ability to do your job.

431
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,860
<25-3,Chase>那是你让我爸参与我的工作中
<25-3,Chase>Only because you made my dad part of my job.

432
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,790
<25-4,House>说的好  你们多年未见
<25-4,House>Good point. You haven't seen him in years,

433
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,540
<25-4,House>他为看你不远万里  横跨大西洋
<25-4,House>he flies across the Atlantic to see you

434
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,030
<25-5,Chase>是太平洋
<25-5,Chase>Pacific.

436
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,080
<25-6,House>可你对他避之不及
<25-6,House>You breeze by him like he's a Hare Krishna at the airport,

437
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,060
<25-6,House>该会徒经常在机场和公共场所乞求施舍或者卖花
<25-6,House>卖他们的印刷刊物

438
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,040
<25-6,House>你甚至都没问他此行的目的
<25-6,House>You don't even ask why he's in town.

439
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,170
<25-7,Chase>可能是来参会议吧
<25-7,Chase>It's probably a conference.

440
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,780
<25-7,Chase>可能
<25-7,Chase>Probably.

441
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,880
<25-8,House>本来我想一手包办
<25-8,House>I was hoping to do this through sheer manipulation,

442
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,450
<25-8,House>可如果你坚持对话  好吧  说吧
<25-8,House>but if you insist on talking, fine. Talk.

443
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,110
<25-8,House>他曾经对你做过什么
<25-8,House>What did he do to you?

444
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,630
<25-9,Chase>如果我干涉你的私生活  你做何感想
<25-9,Chase>How would you feel if I interfered in your personal life?

445
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,600
<25-10,House>我非常痛恨  所以我没私生活
<25-10,House>I'd hate it- that's why I cleverly have no personal life.

446
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,790
<25-11,Chase>我要替他的皮肤病灶做活检
<25-11,Chase>I'm gonna biopsy his skin lesions.

447
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,100
<25-12,House>有想法  想办法证明你爸错了
<25-12,House>Good thinking. Prove your dad wrong.

448
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,810
<25-12,House>那就解决所有事了
<25-12,House>That'll solve everything.

449
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,120
<26-1,Chase>-谁替他拔了管  -我拔的
<26-1,Chase>- Who extubated him? - I did.

450
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,920
<26-2,Rowan>体温下降了两度
<26-2,Rowan>Temperature's down two degrees,

451
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,530
<26-2,Rowan>皮肤肿胀也几乎消失了
<26-2,Rowan>and the swelling's almost gone.

452
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,030
<26-3,Sarah>他的皮肤看上去也好多了
<26-3,Sarah>And his skin looks better too.

453
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,500
<26-4,Rowan>环磷酰胺起作用了
<26-4,Rowan>Cytoxan is working.

454
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,060
<26-5,Chase>-感觉好多了吗  盖布  -好多了
<26-5,Chase>- Feeling better, Gabe? - Yep, a lot.

455
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,780
<26-5,Chase>奇斯医生  借一步说话
<26-5,Chase>Dr. Chase, can you and I have a word?

456
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,050
<26-5,Chase>你的诊断错误  不是自身免疫性疾病
<26-5,Chase>Your diagnosis is wrong. No autoimmune disease.

457
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,470
<27-1,Chase>肿胀消失
<27-1,Chase>The swelling's probably just down

458
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,740
<27-1,Chase>可能是因为类固醇起作用了
<27-1,Chase>because we've got him on steroids.

459
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,290
<27-1,Chase>掩盖了真正的病因
<27-1,Chase>It's masking whatever's really wrong.

460
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,900
<27-2,Rowan>A.N.A.结果可能有误
<27-2,Rowan>A.N.A.'s are unreliable.

462
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,750
<27-3,Chase>抗心磷脂抗体检测结果是阴性
<27-3,Chase>Phospholipid antibodies are negative,

463
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,180
<27-3,Chase>不是狼疮  也不会是变应性肉芽肿血管炎
<27-3,Chase>so no lupus. Same for churg-strauss.

464
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,680
<27-4,Rowan>你在和一名风湿病学家辩论
<27-4,Rowan>You're arguing with a rheumatologist.

465
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,930
<27-4,Rowan>大概有20种独特的自身免疫性疾病
<27-4,Rowan>There's about 20 distinct autoimmune diseases-

466
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,970
<27-5,Chase>你为什么来这里
<27-5,Chase>Why are you here?

467
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,350
<27-6,Rowan>来参加红斑狼疮学术会议
<27-6,Rowan>S.L.E. Conference.

468
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,270
<27-7,Chase>去年你去纽约参加硬皮病研究会议
<27-7,Chase>You were in New York last year for the scleroderma conference.

469
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,500
<27-7,Chase>那时你可没来探望我啊
<27-7,Chase>I didn't hear anything from you.

470
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,530
<27-8,Rowan>这次只是过来跟你打声招呼
<27-8,Rowan>Just wanted to say hi this time.

471
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,430
<27-9,Chase>说完了  怎么还不走
<27-9,Chase>You said it. You're still here.

472
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,710
<27-10,Rowan>我想你
<27-10,Rowan>I miss you.

473
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,060
<27-11,Chase>你离家那年我才15岁
<27-11,Chase>I was 15 years old when you walked out.

474
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,250
<27-11,Chase>现在你又想回来吗
<27-11,Chase>Now you're walking back in?

475
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,400
<27-12,Rowan>我离开了你母亲  可我没有离开你
<27-12,Rowan>I left your mother. I didn't leave you.

476
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,350
<27-13,Chase>你走后妈妈每天喝的酩酊烂醉
<27-13,Chase>Mum was living on gin and tonics.

477
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,080
<27-13,Chase>那时我根本无力照顾她
<27-13,Chase>How was I supposed to take care of her?

478
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,600
<27-14,Rowan>这不是你的责任
<27-14,Rowan>She wasn't your responsibility.

479
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,050
<27-15,Chase>是的  照顾她是你的责任
<27-15,Chase>I know! She was yours.

480
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,020
<27-16,Rowan>对于她的去世我很抱歉
<27-16,Rowan>I'm sorry she died.

481
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,960
<27-16,Rowan>我很抱歉让你独自面对这一切
<27-16,Rowan>I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

482
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,680
<27-16,Rowan>但是很久之前  她就精神失常了
<27-16,Rowan>But she was falling apart long before-

483
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,610
<27-17,Chase>我得去和豪斯讨论治疗方案
<27-17,Chase>I've got to talk to House about this treatment.

484
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,640
<28-1,House>但是病人逐渐好转
<28-1,House>But the patient's getting better.

485
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,970
<28-2,Chase>尽管用的是环磷酰胺
<28-2,Chase>In spite of the cytoxan.

486
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,300
<28-3,House>另一方面  他已有所好转
<28-3,House>On the other hand getting better.

487
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,520
<28-4,Chase>环磷酰胺导致他更易被感染
<28-4,Chase>Cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection.

488
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,310
<28-4,Chase>炭疽可能会故态复萌  变本加厉
<28-4,Chase>The anthrax could relapse and be more resistant.

489
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,980
<28-5,House>好转了啊
<28-5,House>Better!

490
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,570
<28-6,Chase>你希望所有与自身免疫性疾病相关的
<28-6,Chase>You want a negative test

491
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,420
<28-6,Chase>化验结果都为阴性吗
<28-6,Chase>for every autoimmune disease known to man?

492
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,120
<28-6,Chase>好  我会让你称心的
<28-6,Chase>Fine. I'll get 'em.

493
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,560
<28-7,House>午夜前不回家  这周末就不给你车
<28-7,House>Be home by midnight or you can't have the car this weekend.

494
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,320
<28-7,House>父子俩叙旧没
<28-7,House>You guys talk?

495
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,530
<28-7,House>他有没有告诉你他此行的目的
<28-7,House>Did he tell you why he's here?

496
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,250
<28-8,Chase>他来参加红斑狼疮研讨会
<28-8,Chase>The S.L.E. Conference.

497
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,480
<29-1,House>回去参加会议去吗
<29-1,House>Going back to the conference?

498
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,720
<29-2,Rowan>是下午的会议  但愿别睡着
<29-2,Rowan>Afternoon panel. I hope I can stay awake.

499
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,750
<29-2,Rowan>但愿你能进场
<29-2,Rowan>I hope you can get in.

500
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,470
<29-2,Rowan>参会人员上没有你的名字
<29-2,Rowan>You're not registered.

501
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,590
<29-3,House>我懂的  你得编造一个谎言
<29-3,House>I get it. You had to make up a lie.

502
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,300
<29-3,House>因为你不能告诉奇斯你是来看他的
<29-3,House>Can't just tell your kid you're here to see him.

503
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,230
<29-3,House>哪个当爹的会这么做啊
<29-3,House>I mean, what father does that?

504
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,970
<29-3,House>你领子下面的那个小蓝点
<29-3,House>That little blue dot under your collar-

505
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,060
<29-3,House>说明你在做放疗
<29-3,House>It's a tattoo for guiding radiation treatment.

506
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,780
<29-3,House>看你早上吃糙米和蔬菜后
<29-3,House>I was looking for it after I saw what

507
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,510
<29-3,House>我就在找寻它
<29-3,House>you had for breakfast: brown rice, vegetables.

508
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,210
<29-3,House>这种延寿饮食的簇拥者
<29-3,House>It's a macrobiotic diet

509
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,650
<29-3,House>主要遍布于好莱坞明星以及...
<29-3,House>popular with Hollywood starlets and...

510
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,110
<29-3,House>癌症患者
<29-3,House>Cancer patients.

511
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,350
<29-4,Rowan>晚期肺癌
<29-4,Rowan>Lungs. Stage iv.

512
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,780
<29-5,House>-你看上去挺不错  -其实不好
<29-5,House>- You look good. - I'm not.

513
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,450
<29-6,Rowan>我来美国是为了去斯隆－凯特琳癌症中心
<29-6,Rowan>Came to the States to go to Sloan-Kettering

515
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,700
<29-6,Rowan>以及拜访威尔森医生
<29-6,Rowan>and see Dr. Wilson.

516
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,480
<29-8,Rowan>-他怎么说  -我还有三个月
<29-8,Rowan>- What'd he say? - Three months.

517
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,930
<29-9,House>可你对罗伯特却只字未提
<29-9,House>But you haven't told Robert.

518
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,600
<29-9,House>你不想给他平添负担
<29-9,House>You don't want to burden him,

519
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,550
<29-9,House>因为你是个不称职的父亲
<29-9,House>because you were such a lousy dad.

520
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,180
<29-10,Rowan>请别告诉他
<29-10,Rowan>I'd prefer you not tell him.

521
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,950
<29-11,House>是啊  这样好点
<29-11,House>Yeah. That's better.

522
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,540
<29-11,House>想象的出当他得知他父亲死讯时的心情
<29-11,House>I'll get to see his face when he reads his dad's obituary.

523
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,690
<29-12,Rowan>这与你无关
<29-12,Rowan>It's not your business.

524
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,030
<29-13,House>是与我无关
<29-13,House>I suppose it isn't.

525
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,730
<30-1,Gabe>你肯定做过不少化验吧
<30-1,Gabe>You sure do a lot of tests.

526
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,860
<30-2,Chase>如能查明你的病因
<30-2,Chase>If we figure out exactly which autoimmune condition it is,

527
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,070
<30-2,Chase>你就能尽早恢复了
<30-2,Chase>we can get you better quicker.

528
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,310
<30-3,Gabe>-之前那个人是你爸吗  -是的
<30-3,Gabe>- Was that your dad before? - Yeah.

529
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,150
<30-5,Gabe>太酷了  你们经常一起工作吗
<30-5,Gabe>That's so cool. Do you guys work together a lot?

530
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,250
<30-6,Chase>不是
<30-6,Chase>Not really.

531
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,280
<30-7,Gabe>我什么时候才能回家呀
<30-7,Gabe>When can I go home?

532
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,330
<30-7,Gabe>看情况吧
<30-7,Gabe>We'll see.

533
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,210
<30-8,Chase>看来你的胃口恢复了  这是个好现象
<30-8,Chase>Looks like you got your appetite back. That's a good sign.

534
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,410
<30-8,Chase>-喝水吗 -恩
<30-8,Chase>- Want some water? - Yes.

535
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,210
<30-9,Gabe>拿着
<30-9,Gabe>Here you go.

536
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,080
<30-10,Chase>啊哦  没关系  水不值钱
<30-10,Chase>Whoops. That's all right. Water's cheap.

537
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,340
<30-11,Gabe>-天哪  -怎么了
<30-11,Gabe>- Oh, god. - What?

538
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,650
<30-13,Gabe>手不能动了
<30-13,Gabe>I can't- I can't move my hand.

539
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,720
<31-1,Chase>能抓住我的手指吗  盖布
<31-1,Chase>Can you squeeze my fingers for me, Gabe?

540
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,940
<31-1,Chase>他的病情恶化了
<31-1,Chase>He's getting worse.

541
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,180
<32-1,Chase>他的右手和前臂都已失去知觉
<32-1,Chase>Now his entire right hand and forearm are paralyzed.

542
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,050
<32-2,Cameron>他又发烧了  体温高达华氏105度
<32-2,Cameron>And his fever's back. It's up over 105.

543
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,360
<32-3,Foreman>如果我们不能尽快阻止神经退化
<32-3,Foreman>If we don't stop the nerve deterioration quickly,

544
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,680
<32-3,Foreman>他将会终身残废
<32-3,Foreman>he'll be paralyzed for life.

545
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,300
<32-4,House>幸运的是
<32-4,House>Well, luckily,

546
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,030
<32-4,House>以此恶化速度  他活不过一周
<32-4,House>at this rate that should only last about a week.

547
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,950
<32-4,House>那么...
<32-4,House>Okay. So

548
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,910
<32-5,Chase>我说过我们应该放弃使用环磷酰胺
<32-5,Chase>I told you we should get him off the cytoxan.

549
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,110
<32-5,Chase>这是神经中毒
<32-5,Chase>This is toxic neuropathy.

550
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,160
<32-5,Chase>我们随意给他用药
<32-5,Chase>We've been shoving drugs into his system

551
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,360
<32-5,Chase>去治疗莫须有的病
<32-5,Chase>for a disease he doesn't have.

552
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,760
<32-6,Foreman>但它可能是神经性的
<32-6,Foreman>Well, it could be neurological.

553
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,050
<32-7,Cameron>哪种脑部疾病会导致手部麻痹
<32-7,Cameron>What kind of brain process would cause a paralyzed hand,

554
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,840
<32-7,Cameron>皮肤病变以及喉咙肿结节
<32-7,Cameron>skin lesions and swollen throat nodules?

555
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,920
<32-8,Rowan>罗伯特先前说的对
<32-8,Rowan>Robert was right.

556
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,180
<32-8,Rowan>是多发性神经纤维瘤病
<32-8,Rowan>You said multiple neurofibromatosis.

557
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,360
<32-9,House>这么说是为了家庭的和谐美满
<32-9,House>Are you saying that for the chance at a beautiful family moment,

558
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,060
<32-9,House>还是理性的医疗建议
<32-9,House>or is there some medicine involved?

559
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,980
<32-10,Rowan>-症状更加符合啊  -真遗憾
<32-10,Rowan>- Fits better. - Too bad.

560
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,460
<32-11,House>我还以为你是为了家庭美满呢
<32-11,House>I was hoping for the other reason.

561
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,060
<32-11,House>我正要去拿摄像机拍下这激动人心的一刻
<32-11,House>I was gonna go get my camera.

562
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,530
<32-11,House>这次去做脑扫描
<32-11,House>Get a C.T. Scan- his brain this time.

563
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,970
<33-1,Blonde>你觉得三份就够了  是吗
<33-1,Blonde>You'd think three copies would be enough, right?

564
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,710
<33-2,Wilson>一份我都觉得绰绰有余
<33-2,Wilson>One's always been more than enough for me.

565
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,530
<33-3,House>你为什么没有告诉我罗文·奇斯是来找你的
<33-3,House>Why didn't you tell me that Rowan Chase was in to see you?

566
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,210
<33-4,Wilson>失陪
<33-4,Wilson>Excuse me.

567
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,300
<33-4,Wilson>职业道德  病人保密条约
<33-4,Wilson>Ethics, confidentiality-

568
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,760
<33-4,Wilson>这些都能成为理由吧
<33-4,Wilson>does any of this ring a bell?

569
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,130
<33-5,House>你本可以叫我来会诊以掩护你自己
<33-5,House>You could have covered yourself, called me in for a consult.

570
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,440
<33-6,Wilson>这又不是什么热门八卦
<33-6,Wilson>It is a juicy piece of gossip.

571
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,530
<33-6,Wilson>知道吗
<33-6,Wilson>You know what happened?

572
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,760
<33-6,Wilson>我全神贯注检查他的癌症没想那么多
<33-6,Wilson>I got all focused on his cancer and lost perspective.

573
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,790
<33-7,House>你不能告诉奇斯  但我可以
<33-7,House>You can't tell Chase, but I can.

574
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,480
<33-7,House>我该怎么做呢
<33-7,House>What should I do?

575
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,170
<33-8,Wilson>貌似是到我得给你建议
<33-8,Wilson>This is where I give you advice and

576
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,140
<33-8,Wilson>并假装你会听这一环节了
<33-8,Wilson>pretend you're gonna listen to it.

577
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,770
<33-8,Wilson>我喜欢这一环节
<33-8,Wilson>I like this part.

578
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,110
<33-8,Wilson>罗文让你别说了吗
<33-8,Wilson>Did Rowan ask you not to tell?

579
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,880
<33-9,House>我答应替他保守秘密
<33-9,House>I promised I wouldn't.

580
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,350
<33-9,House>我是答应他了  不过我现在我又反悔了
<33-9,House>My fingers were crossed, though, so I'm wide open.

581
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,940
<33-10,Wilson>我错了  原来这是自娱自乐环节
<33-10,Wilson>I was wrong. This is the musing-out-loud part.

582
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,950
<33-10,Wilson>-貌似我的存在都是多余的  -告诉他
<33-10,Wilson>- Do I actually need to be here? - Telling him.

583
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,280
<33-11,House>这就相当的具有娱乐性了
<33-11,House>Now, that's got real entertainment value.

584
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,950
<33-12,Wilson>是啊  他可能会声泪俱下
<33-12,Wilson>He might even cry.

585
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,080
<33-12,Wilson>有种东西叫做  己所不欲  勿施于人
<33-12,Wilson>On the other hand, there is the do-unto-others thingy.

586
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,550
<33-13,House>那我更应该告诉他  因为我就很想知道
<33-13,House>Well, then I should definitely tell him. I'd wanna know.

587
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,780
<33-14,Wilson>你什么都想知道
<33-14,Wilson>You wanna know everything.

588
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,920
<33-14,Wilson>还有一种东西就是做人要守信用
<33-14,Wilson>There's also the keeping-your-promises thingy.

589
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,690
<33-15,House>您身边可是金发东西团团转啊
<33-15,House>You never run out of thingies like that blonde thingy you were chatting up.

590
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,700
<33-16,Wilson>是医院的会计师
<33-16,Wilson>She's the hospital accountant.

591
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,400
<33-16,Wilson>我们在讨论账单的问题
<33-16,Wilson>We were going over billing procedures.

592
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,050
<33-17,House>泡妞专用的复式记账法吗
<33-17,House>Double-entry bookkeeping?

593
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,530
<33-18,Wilson>你打算怎么做
<33-18,Wilson>What are you gonna do?

594
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,690
<33-19,House>账单的问题  真复杂  对吧
<33-19,House>Billing procedures. They're so complicated, aren't they?

595
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,090
<34-1,Cameron>父母通常没有孩子们想的那么坏
<34-1,Cameron>You know, parents are never as bad as kids think they are.

596
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,340
<34-2,Chase>那么喜欢我爸  约他出去好了
<34-2,Chase>If you like my dad so much, ask him out.

597
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
<34-3,Cameron>我肯定会是个好后妈
<34-3,Cameron>I'd make an excellent stepmom.

598
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,200
<34-3,Cameron>我宽宏大度
<34-3,Cameron>I'm very lenient.

599
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,600
<34-3,Cameron>他是你爸
<34-3,Cameron>He's your father.

600
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,910
<34-3,Cameron>你不曾有机会了解他  可他现在就这里
<34-3,Cameron>You never see him, and he's here.

601
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,610
<34-3,Cameron>若非他曾做过一些不堪入目的事
<34-3,Cameron>Unless he's done some unspeakable thing,

602
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,240
<34-3,Cameron>你应该释怀
<34-3,Cameron>you should lighten up.

603
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,920
<34-4,Chase>很好  多谢提醒
<34-4,Chase>Great. Thanks for the tip.

604
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,480
<34-4,Chase>好吧
<34-4,Chase>Okay.

605
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,810
<34-5,Cameron>他对你妈施暴  对你施暴
<34-5,Cameron>He beat your mom. He beat you.

606
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,170
<34-5,Cameron>-他到底做了什么  -说真的  别逼我
<34-5,Cameron>- What did he do? - Really, don't push it.

607
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,940
<34-7,Cameron>由怨生恨  终噬己身
<34-7,Cameron>All this hate. It's toxic.

608
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,140
<34-8,Chase>那离我远点
<34-8,Chase>Then stay away.

609
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,710
<34-8,Chase>没有发现
<34-8,Chase>There's nothing there.

610
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,920
<35-1,Chase>没有包块  没有纤维缠结  什么都没有
<35-1,Chase>No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing.

611
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,310
<35-1,Chase>不是神经纤维瘤
<35-1,Chase>It's not neurofibromatosis.

612
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,240
<35-2,House>奇斯医生们屡战屡败
<35-2,House>Drs. Chase are 0 for 3.

613
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,820
<35-2,House>即便他们达成一致了  他们也错
<35-2,House>Even when they agree, they're wrong.

614
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,150
<35-2,House>那么什么病会导致神经损伤和结节一样
<35-2,House>So, next, what else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules?

615
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,060
<35-3,Cameron>伯格氏病
<35-3,Cameron>Berger's disease.

616
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,270
<35-4,Foreman>他不曾出国
<35-4,Foreman>He's never been out of the country.

617
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,410
<35-5,Rowan>父母呢
<35-5,Rowan>Have his parents?

618
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,290
<35-5,Rowan>他们可能是传染源
<35-5,Rowan>They could have brought it back.

619
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,820
<35-6,Foreman>-我可不这么认为  -没关系
<35-6,Foreman>- I don't think so. - It doesn't matter.

620
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,480
<35-7,Chase>他的脓包不该出现在那里
<35-7,Chase>His lesions are in the wrong place.

621
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,810
<35-7,Chase>他的双脚却没有病变
<35-7,Chase>His feet are the one clear spot.

622
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,180
<35-8,House>孩子他爸曾提及利什曼病
<35-8,House>Kid's dad mentioned leishmaniasis.

623
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,330
<35-9,Chase>还提了丝虫病
<35-9,Chase>Yeah, and filariasis.

624
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,190
<35-9,Chase>可喉部的结节与病症不符啊
<35-9,Chase>But the throat nodules still don't fit with that.

625
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,570
<35-10,House>这两种病几乎仅现于东南亚
<35-10,House>That's two diseases pretty much exclusive to Southeast Asia.

626
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,260
<35-10,House>如果第二种疾病不是由炭疽引发的呢
<35-10,House>What if the anthrax didn't set off the second disease?

627
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,700
<35-11,Foreman>-又回到巧合上面来了吗  -不是
<35-11,Foreman>- We're back at coincidence again? - No.

628
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,950
<35-12,House>如果导火索是其他病呢
<35-12,House>What if something else was the trigger?

629
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,160
<35-13,Cameron>-没有其他症状  -我们做过些治疗
<35-13,Cameron>- Nothing else happened. - We happened.

630
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,610
<35-15,Rowan>-抗生素吗  -我们已经讨论过了
<35-15,Rowan>- Antibiotics? - We've been through this.

631
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,890
<35-16,Chase>这不是过敏
<35-16,Chase>It's not an allergy.

632
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,450
<35-17,House>我要去撒尿
<35-17,House>I gotta pee.

633
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,280
<36-1,Jeffrey>-你们从CT扫描中得知什么  -一无所获
<36-1,Jeffrey>- What did the C.T. Scan tell you? - Nothing.

634
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,780
<36-4,House>十分制  你的疼痛程度有几分
<36-4,House>Ow! Scale from one to 10- how painful?

635
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,910
<36-5,Jeffrey>肯定没有打你一拳的一半疼
<36-5,Jeffrey>Not half as painful as when I punch you in the face.

636
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,650
<36-6,House>别这样  你也会疼的
<36-6,House>Don't do that. It'll hurt you.

637
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,800
<36-6,House>腕管综合症手术显然没有奏效
<36-6,House>Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn't work.

638
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,450
<36-7,Gabe>你是谁
<36-7,Gabe>Who are you?

639
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,850
<36-8,House>小孩子们都叫我格雷戈叔叔
<36-8,House>The little ones call me uncle Greg.

640
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,780
<36-8,House>你爸从未得过腕管综合症
<36-8,House>Your dad never had carpal tunnel.

641
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,010
<36-8,House>你之前向奇斯医生提过两种怪病
<36-8,House>You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase.

642
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,960
<36-8,House>你从何得知
<36-8,House>How did you know about them?

643
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,410
<36-9,Jeffrey>在网上看到的
<36-9,Jeffrey>I read about them on the internet.

644
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,390
<36-10,House>那你的搜索关键词是?
<36-10,House>What did you search for-

645
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,960
<36-10,House>"不符我儿子病症的亚洲疾病"吗
<36-10,House>" Diseases from Asia that don't match my son's symptoms"?

646
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,500
<36-10,House>你曾在亚洲耳闻这些疾病
<36-10,House>You heard about them in Asia.

647
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,300
<36-11,Jeffrey>我从未去过那里
<36-11,Jeffrey>I've never been there.

648
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,290
<36-12,House>估计你忘了  提醒你一下吧
<36-12,House>Well, you probably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory:

649
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,950
<36-12,House>偏远肮脏的村庄  狭窄的住所
<36-12,House>Some remote, dusty village, close quarters,

650
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,510
<36-12,House>我猜待了至少有一年吧
<36-12,House>at least a year?

651
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,150
<36-13,Jeffrey>-想起来没  -我要去叫卡迪医生
<36-13,Jeffrey>- Starting to come back? - I'm calling Dr. Cuddy.

652
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,520
<36-14,Sarah>请问这和我儿子的病情有关吗
<36-14,Sarah>Excuse me, what does this have to do with our son?

653
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,260
<36-15,House>你爸毛了  不过他理应如此
<36-15,House>Your dad's pissed off. He should be.

654
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,490
<36-15,House>他希望我们尽十一分力替你治病
<36-15,House>Comes here expecting us to do an extra-good job

655
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,190
<36-15,House>就因为他捐赠巨款给医院
<36-15,House>Because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital.

656
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,790
<36-16,Jeffrey>别那么对我儿子说
<36-16,Jeffrey>Don't talk to my son like that!

657
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,510
<36-17,House>我只是向他阐述我的工作职责
<36-17,House>Just telling him my job and my obligation-

658
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,610
<36-18,Sarah>住嘴  怎么回事
<36-18,Sarah>Stop! What's going on?

659
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,730
<36-19,House>你们别无选择
<36-19,House>There's only one thing you guys have gotta do.

660
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,950
<36-19,House>唯有说实话  否则你儿子就没命了
<36-19,House>Tell the truth, or your son will die.

661
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,970
<36-19,House>你在亚洲待了多久
<36-19,House>How long were you in Asia?

662
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,450
<36-20,Sarah>杰弗  这问题不难啊
<36-20,Sarah>Jeff, it's a simple question.

663
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,640
<36-21,Jeffrey>在印度待了两年
<36-21,Jeffrey>Two years, in India.

664
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,050
<36-22,Sarah>你为何向我们隐瞒
<36-22,Sarah>Why would you lie about something like that?

665
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,080
<36-23,Jeffrey>那是87年和88年
<36-23,Jeffrey>It was '87 and '88.

666
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:42,120
<36-23,Jeffrey>我本以为
<36-23,Jeffrey>This, uh, this Guru-

667
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,920
<36-23,Jeffrey>古鲁能给予我启示
<36-23,Jeffrey>I-I thought he had some answers.

669
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,130
<36-23,Jeffrey>我曾拜访他的静修处[印度教]
<36-23,Jeffrey>I went to his ashram...

670
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,820
<36-23,Jeffrey>结果我赔了夫人又折兵
<36-23,Jeffrey>And, um, ended up with no money and no answers.

671
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,520
<36-23,Jeffrey>我无地自容  不想让别人知道
<36-23,Jeffrey>I was embarrassed. I didn't want anyone to know.

672
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,920
<36-23,Jeffrey>不会的
<36-23,Jeffrey>No.

673
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,400
<36-24,Gabe>不会的  你是一名空军试飞员
<36-24,Gabe>No. You were a test pilot.

674
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,920
<36-25,Jeffrey>很抱歉  盖布
<36-25,Jeffrey>I'm so sorry, Gabe.

675
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,200
<36-26,Sarah>这和我儿子的病情有何关联
<36-26,Sarah>What does this have to do with my son?

676
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,760
<37-1,House>提示一  如果我是耶稣
<37-1,House>Clue number one If I were Jesus,

677
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,930
<37-1,House>治好这个孩子如将水变酒那般容易
<37-1,House>curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine.

679
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,230
<37-2,Foreman>他是被鬼附体吗
<37-2,Foreman>Demonic possession?

681
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,170
<37-3,House>接近答案  不过没有圣饼
<37-3,House>Close, but no wafer.

682
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,450
<37-3,House>提示二  风湿病学家罗文的观点基本正确
<37-3,House>Clue number two Rheumatology Rowan was almost right.

683
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,000
<37-3,House>这引发了自身免疫性疾病症状
<37-3,House>It causes autoimmune symptoms.

684
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,400
<37-4,Chase>麻风吗
<37-4,Chase>Leprosy?

685
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,920
<37-5,Foreman>是啊  这在新泽西州郊区还真是多见啊
<37-5,Foreman>Yeah, that's real big in the Jersey suburbs.

686
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,690
<37-6,House>的确是麻风  做个Fite染色
<37-6,House>It's leprosy. Run a Fite stain.

687
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,340
<37-6,House>结果肯定是阳性
<37-6,House>It'll be positive.

688
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,920
<37-6,House>老爸曾长期泡在不正规的印度静修处
<37-6,House>Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram.

689
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,040
<37-7,Foreman>但显然是潜伏在父亲体内
<37-7,Foreman>But it's obviously dormant in the dad.

690
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,270
<37-7,Foreman>孩子怎么会染上
<37-7,Foreman>How could the kid catch it?

691
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,370
<37-8,House>不是潜伏在父亲体内  只是缓慢发作而已
<37-8,House>It's not dormant in the dad. It's just slow.

692
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,080
<37-8,House>他的尺骨神经因此受损
<37-8,House>Damaged his ulnar nerves.

693
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,240
<37-8,House>可被误诊为腕管综合症
<37-8,House>Was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.

694
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,350
<37-8,House>永远别信医生  做个Fite染色
<37-8,House>Never trust doctors. Run a Fite stain.

695
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,080
<37-9,Rowan>他会得炭疽也是顺理成章
<37-9,Rowan>No wonder he got anthrax.

696
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,310
<37-9,Rowan>麻风破坏了他的免疫系统
<37-9,Rowan>The leprosy weakened his immune system.

697
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,190
<37-10,House>恶性循环  麻风增加了他感染炭疽的风险
<37-10,House>Vicious circle: The leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax,

698
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,600
<37-10,House>而治疗炭疽又加重麻风
<37-10,House>and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive.

699
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,660
<37-11,Chase>-但是给他施用的抗生素会治好麻风  -是啊
<37-11,Chase>- But the antibiotics we gave him they cure leprosy. - Yeah.

700
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,050
<37-12,House>那就是麻烦的起因
<37-12,House>That's where the trouble starts.

701
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,900
<37-12,House>抗生素损伤了神经纤维
<37-12,House>The antibiotics hit the nerve strands.

702
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,670
<37-12,House>杀灭麻风病菌
<37-12,House>They kill the leprosy bacteria,

703
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,450
<37-12,House>而病菌残余进入体内循环系统
<37-12,House>and the corpses get tossed into the system.

704
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,900
<37-12,House>我们的身体构造惊奇神秘  但他们其实很蠢
<37-12,House>And as fascinating as our bodies are, they're also stupid.

705
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,130
<37-12,House>他们会产生抗体对抗已死的病菌
<37-12,House>They produce antibodies to beat dead bacteria.

706
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,590
<37-12,House>然而这些抗体绝非善类
<37-12,House>And these aren't the polite antibodies.

707
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,340
<37-12,House>他们不安分守己  当身体稍有懈怠便发动攻击
<37-12,House>They're the ones that won't sit still, kick during nap time.

708
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,450
<37-12,House>攻击他的神经和脂肪细胞
<37-12,House>They attack his neural and fat cells,

709
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,260
<37-12,House>从而引发炎症以及其他一些症状
<37-12,House>Causing inflammation and all the rest of his symptoms.

710
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,970
<37-13,Rowan>也就是说我们的治疗反而伤害了他
<37-13,Rowan>So the cure's killing him.

711
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,810
<37-14,House>给美国本土48州里最后一个麻风隔离所打电话
<37-14,House>I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana,

712
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,140
<37-14,House>它位于路易斯安那的卡维尔
<37-14,House>home of the last leper colony in the lower 48.

713
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,570
<37-14,House>让他们送些反应停过来
<37-14,House>Get 'em to send up some thalidomide.

714
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,140
<37-15,Cameron>-反应停  -他是12岁的处男吧
<37-15,Cameron>- Thalidomide? - Twelve-year-olds don't have sex, right?

715
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,020
<37-15,Cameron>原用作妊娠妇女的镇静药
<37-15,Cameron>但后来发现会引起胎儿四肢畸形而被禁用

716
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,010
<37-16,House>所以不可能会怀孕嘛
<37-16,House>So he can't be pregnant.

717
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,630
<37-16,House>打电话去
<37-16,House>Make the call.

718
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,970
<37-16,House>我要和你儿子单独谈谈
<37-16,House>I need to speak to your boy.

719
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,090
<37-17,Chase>为什么人人都要管我的闲事
<37-17,Chase>Why does everybody need to know my business?

720
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,970
<37-18,House>人都爱嚼舌根
<37-18,House>People like talking about people.

721
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,220
<37-18,House>觉得自己高人一等  一切尽在掌握之中
<37-18,House>Makes us feel superior, makes us feel in control,

722
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,240
<37-18,House>有些时候  对于有些人
<37-18,House>And sometimes, for some people,

723
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,550
<37-18,House>了解情况可以引起他们的关心
<37-18,House>knowing some things makes them care.

724
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,000
<37-19,Chase>告诉你我爸弃我们而去  我妈酗酒致死
<37-19,Chase>I tell you my dad left, my mum drank herself to death,

725
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,720
<37-19,Chase>你就会加倍关心我了吗
<37-19,Chase>You gonna care about me more?

726
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,940
<37-20,House>卡梅隆会更加关心你
<37-20,House>Cameron would.

727
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,460
<37-20,House>而我就是好奇心强而已
<37-20,House>Me, I just like knowing stuff.

728
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,560
<37-20,House>我知道你恨你爸
<37-20,House>I know you hate your dad.

729
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,050
<37-20,House>-我得跟你说说  -我不恨他
<37-20,House>- Now, I'm gonna tell you something- - I don't hate him.

730
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,550
<37-21,Chase>当我发现不在意他反而不容易受伤后
<37-21,Chase>I loved him until I figured out

731
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,300
<37-21,Chase>我就不爱他了
<37-21,Chase>that it hurts a lot less to just not care.

732
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,630
<37-21,Chase>不期望他会在你的足球赛上出现
<37-21,Chase>You don't expect him to turn up to your football match,

733
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,010
<37-21,Chase>不会感到失望
<37-21,Chase>no disappointments.

734
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,440
<37-21,Chase>不期望在生日时接到他的电话
<37-21,Chase>You don't expect a call on your birthday,

735
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,650
<37-21,Chase>不期望见到他  没有失望
<37-21,Chase>Don't expect to see him for months, no disappointments.

736
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,870
<37-21,Chase>你希望我们重归于好
<37-21,Chase>You want us to go make up-

737
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,480
<37-21,Chase>杯酒言欢  嘘寒问暖吗
<37-21,Chase>sink a few beers together, nice family hug?

738
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,610
<37-21,Chase>我对他抱有过多的希望
<37-21,Chase>I've given him enough hugs.

739
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,000
<37-21,Chase>可他给了我太多的失望
<37-21,Chase>He's given me enough disappointments.

740
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,760
<37-22,House>好吧
<37-22,House>Okay.

741
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,540
<37-22,House>-说完了吗  -说完了
<37-22,House>- That's it? - That's it.

742
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,100
<38-1,Chase>深呼吸
<38-1,Chase>Breathe.

743
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,710
<38-1,Chase>深呼吸
<38-1,Chase>Breathe again.

744
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,460
<38-1,Chase>深呼吸
<38-1,Chase>Breathe again.

745
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,810
<38-2,Gabe>你会告诉我的朋友们我得了麻风吗
<38-2,Gabe>Are you gonna have to tell my friends I'm a leper?

746
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,120
<38-3,Chase>已经对你施用了抗生素
<38-3,Chase>You had the antibiotics.

747
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,330
<38-3,Chase>不会传染给别人的
<38-3,Chase>You're not contagious anymore.

748
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,600
<38-4,Gabe>如果他们已经得了呢
<38-4,Gabe>Well, what if they already caught it?

749
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,050
<38-5,Chase>麻风极其罕见  即便你妈都没得过
<38-5,Chase>Leprosy is incredibly hard to catch. Even your mum didn't get it.

750
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,710
<38-5,Chase>好了  握拳试试
<38-5,Chase>Right. I want you to make a fist.

751
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,040
<38-6,Gabe>还是有点僵硬
<38-6,Gabe>It's still kinda stiff.

752
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,660
<38-7,Chase>一两个月后就能恢复正常了
<38-7,Chase>It'll get back to normal in a month or two.

753
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,890
<38-7,Chase>你的皮肤两三周就能好
<38-7,Chase>Your skin, two or three weeks.

754
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,650
<38-7,Chase>你一直没询问你父亲的情况
<38-7,Chase>You haven't asked about your dad.

755
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,630
<38-8,Gabe>他满嘴谎言
<38-8,Gabe>He lied about everything.

756
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,650
<38-8,Gabe>他欺骗了我妈  欺骗了他的上司
<38-8,Gabe>He lied to my mom. He lied to his boss.

757
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,310
<38-8,Gabe>他是个彻头彻尾的骗子
<38-8,Gabe>He's just a liar.

758
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,210
<38-9,Chase>他爱你
<38-9,Chase>He loves you.

759
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,940
<38-10,Gabe>我不爱他
<38-10,Gabe>I don't love him.

760
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,720
<38-11,Chase>你爱他
<38-11,Chase>Yeah, you do.

761
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,970
<38-11,Chase>这是既定的事实  他是你爸
<38-11,Chase>Nothing you can do about it. He's your dad.

762
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,900
<38-11,Chase>无论他做了什么  你都爱他
<38-11,Chase>It doesn't matter what he does. You're gonna love him.
