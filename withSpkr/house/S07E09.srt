<7-2,Chase >Are you asking?

195
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,200
<7-3,Masters >对  是提问
<7-3,Masters >Yes, I'm asking.

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
<7-3,Masters >我只在书上学过操作步骤
<7-3,Masters >I've only read how to do it.

197
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,460
<7-3,Masters >但理论和实际是两回事
<7-3,Masters >Practice is different than theory.

198
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,650
<7-3,Masters >告诉我该怎么做就好
<7-3,Masters >Just tell me how to do it.

199
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,530
<7-4,Chase >在眼动脉分支处
<7-4,Chase >You're going to inject dye

200
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,210
<7-4,Chase >注射造影剂
<7-4,Chase >just past the takeoff for the optic artery.

201
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,340
<7-5,Masters >好  现在吗
<7-5,Masters >Right. Now?

202
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,830
<7-6,Chases >血压在上升
<7-6,Chases >His B.P.'s going up.

203
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,660
<7-6,Chases >身体对操作有不良反应
<7-6,Chases >The procedure's stressing his body.

204
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,820
<7-7,Masters >那我该怎么办
<7-7,Masters >Well, what do I do?

205
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,450
<7-8,Chase >暂停操作
<7-8,Chase >Hold on a minute.

206
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,860
<7-8,Chase >给他点时间平复
<7-8,Chase >Just give him a chance to regain equilibrium.

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,900
<7-8,Chase >血压升高  心率180
<7-8,Chase >B.P.'s up, heart rate's 180.

208
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,700
<7-9,Masters >我该怎么办
<7-9,Masters >W-what should I do?

209
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,630
<7-9,Masters >导管给我  去推急救车
<7-9,Masters >Give me the catheter. Get a crash cart.

210
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,730
<7-9,Masters >他心跳骤停了
<7-9,Masters >He's in cardiac arrest.

211
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,140
<7-9,Masters >或许你下次实践会好一点儿
<7-9,Masters >Maybe your second time will go better.

212
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,180
<8-1,House >终于有机会看到真人大小的陶博
<8-1,House >So we finally know what Taub would look like

213
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,420
<8-1,House >是个什么样子了
<8-1,House >if he were life-size.

214
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,510
<8-2,Taub >可以回办公室了吗
<8-2,Taub >Can we go back to the office now?

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,310
<8-3,House >开什么玩笑
<8-3,House >You kidding?

216
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,830
<8-3,House >我们还要做鉴别诊断呢
<8-3,House >We got a differential to run.

217
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,260
<8-3,House >心律失调
<8-3,House >Cardiac arrhythmia.

218
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,680
<8-4,Taub >我昨晚凭这海报春宵一度
<8-4,Taub >That poster got me laid when I got home last night,

219
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,190
<8-4,Taub >爱怎么画随你
<8-4,Taub >so do your worst.

220
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,950
<8-5,Masters >心律失调证明了我的观点
<8-5,Masters >Arrhythmia proves I was right.

221
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,710
<8-5,Masters >杰克的病灶在心脏  不在脑部
<8-5,Masters >Jack's problem is his heart, not his brain.

222
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,160
<8-6,House >你没上广告的时候  在外面睡小护士
<8-6,House >So when you're not on a billboard, you sleep with nurses.

223
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,670
<8-6,House >上了广告之后  回家跟老婆睡
<8-6,House >But when you are, you sleep with your wife.

224
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,970
<8-6,House >我觉得你把顺序弄反了
<8-6,House >I think you got that backwards.

225
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,500
<8-7,Chase >旁边那胳膊肘是我的
<8-7,Chase >That's my elbow in the corner.

226
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,130
<8-7,Chase >你老婆今天有空吗
<8-7,Chase >What's your wife doing later?

227
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,210
<8-8,Masters >居然剪掉奇斯留了你
<8-8,Masters >Huh. They chose you and cut out Chase?

228
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,250
<8-9,Taub >显然市场部认为
<8-9,Taub >Apparently, marketing thinks my face

229
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,510
<8-9,Taub >我这张脸最值得信赖
<8-9,Taub >is the most trustworthy.

230
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,450
<8-10,Foreman >真的假的
<8-10,Foreman >For real?

231
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,210
<8-11,Masters >病人两次心脏骤停
<8-11,Masters >Both of our patients' cardiac incidents

232
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,350
<8-11,Masters >都出现在身体应激之后
<8-11,Masters >happened after physical stress.

233
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,130
<8-11,Masters >我猜可能是血管迷走神经晕厥
<8-11,Masters >I'm guessing vasovagal syncope?

234
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,100
<8-12,House >无聊
<8-12,House >Buzzkill.

235
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,510
<8-13,Taub >血管迷走神经晕厥该在病人年轻时有所显现
<8-13,Taub >Vasovagal syncope would manifest at a much younger age.

236
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,370
<8-14,Masters >-有可能是药物引起  -毒检结果正常
<8-14,Masters >- Could be drugs. - Tox screen was clean.

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,900
<8-15,Foreman >会不会是植物神经功能紊乱
<8-15,Foreman >What about autonomic nervous system dysfunction?

238
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,440
<8-15,Foreman >可能引起心律失调和昏迷
<8-15,Foreman >It could cause arrhythmia and fainting.

239
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,660
<8-16,House >冒犯你了吗
<8-16,House >Inappropriate?

240
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,450
<8-16,House >我是指  你们犹太人会不会很介意
<8-16,House >I mean, 'cause of the Jew thing?

241
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,830
<8-15,Foreman >自主神经功能紊乱
<8-15,Foreman >Autonomic nervous system dysfunction...

242
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,480
<8-16,House >我喜欢
<8-16,House >I like it.

243
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,340
<8-16,House >做脑垂体活检
<8-16,House >Let's biopsy his pituitary gland.

244
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,230
<8-17,Masters >肾上腺静脉抽样才更合道理
<8-17,Masters >Adrenal venous sampling makes more sense

245
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,950
<8-17,Masters >而且侵袭性更小
<8-17,Masters >and is a less invasive procedure...

246
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,040
<8-17,Masters >可你毫不在意
<8-17,Masters >Which you don't care about,

247
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,290
<8-17,Masters >因为你就是想检查脑垂体
<8-17,Masters >because you just want to check the pituitary,

248
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,240
<8-17,Masters >因为你还是认为
<8-17,Masters >because you still think

249
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,920
<8-17,Masters >他的脑子有问题
<8-17,Masters >there's something wrong with the guy's brain?

250
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,930
<8-18,House >瞒不过你呀
<8-18,House >Can't fool you.

251
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,230
<8-19,Chase >他没有其它脑垂体病变的症状
<8-19,Chase >He has no other symptoms for pituitary disease.

252
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,800
<8-19,Chase >我们不能因为你不相信英雄主义
<8-19,Chase >We can't stick a needle in his brain

253
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
<8-19,Chase >就用探针刺人家脑子
<8-19,Chase >because you don't believe in heroism.

254
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
<8-20,House >好  按你们说的做
<8-20,House >Fine, do it your way.

255
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,620
<8-20,House >白白浪费半天时间
<8-20,House >You'll waste half a day,

256
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,870
<8-20,House >反正我看他也不急着恢复康复
<8-20,House >but I'm sure he's in no hurry to get better.

257
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,480
<9-1,Chase >自主神经系统
<9-1,Chase >The autonomic nervous system

258
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,470
<9-1,Chase >控制人体的非自主行为  比如心跳
<9-1,Chase >controls involuntary actions, like your heartbeat.

259
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,360
<9-1,Chase >如果推测正确  病症可以控制
<9-1,Chase >If we're right, it's manageable,

260
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,270
<9-1,Chase >但仍会恶化
<9-1,Chase >but will progress.

261
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,910
<9-1,Chase >我们可以请他来会诊一下吗
<9-1,Chase >Do you think we can consult with him?

262
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,540
<9-2,Chase >原来你认识陶博医生
<9-2,Chase >I didn't know you knew Dr. Taub.

263
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,110
<9-3,Eva >我不认识他
<9-3,Eva >I don't.

264
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,790
<9-4,Chase >你看见广告了
<9-4,Chase >You saw the ADs.

265

266
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,780
<9-5,Eva >而且如果他医术不高明的话
<9-5,Eva >And they wouldn't have made him the face of the hospital

267
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,940
<9-5,Eva >医院也不会用他做形象代言是吧

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,190
<11-1,Eva >杰克不是爱逞英雄的人
<11-1,Eva >Jack's not exactly the hero type.

293
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,790
<11-1,Eva >上大学的时候他组建了这个乐队
<11-1,Eva >He started this band in college.

<11-4,Taub >杰克昨天的作为令人佩服

301
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,500
<11-4,Taub >以至于我们老板认为
<11-4,Taub >our boss assumed his illness

302
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,150
<11-4,Taub >他可能是疾病的影响才有此举
<11-4,Taub >had something to do with his behavior.

<11-4,Taub >但如果事实并非如此

304
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:59,620
<11-4,Taub >那对他而言就比你想象中意义更大
<11-4,Taub >there's more to him than you think.

305
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,870
<12-1,Chase >你觉得陶博能算院里
<12-1,Chase >You think Taub really comes across

313
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,290
<12-4,Chase >也没找你当可靠医生
<12-4,Chase >looking for Dr. Trustworthy.

314
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,550
<12-5,Foreman >那是因为我是黑人
<12-5,Foreman >That's 'cause I'm black.

<13-2,Foreman >白人两种都有
<13-2,Foreman >White works with both demographics.

323
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,640

<13-3,Chase >So race is your excuse,

324
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,050
<13-3,Chase >没选你是因为种族歧视
<13-3,Chase >not the fact that you usually look

325
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,820
<13-3,Chase >而不是你脸上老一副要揍人一拳的表情
<13-3,Chase >like you're about to punch someone in the face?

326
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,320
<13-3,Chase >一切正常

331
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,050
<13-7,Chase >有点怪

332
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,510
<13-8,Foreman >肺部有积液

<13-9,Chase >Pneumonitis?

334
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,730
<13-9,Chase >这和谁的推测都不符合

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,080
<14-1,Masters >测试终于排除了大脑的问题
<14-1,Masters >Our tests finally rule out the brain.

336
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,120
<14-1,Masters >那就剩下心脏和肺部
<14-1,Masters >That leaves the heart and the lungs.

337
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,930
<14-2,Chase >肺炎可能是由细菌
<14-2,Chase >Pneumonitis can be caused by bacteria,

338
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,240
<14-2,Chase >寄生虫  或某种阻塞引起

<14-3,House >铁轨上的女孩是谁
<14-3,House >Who was the girl on the tracks?

340

<14-4,Foreman >新闻报道上说她叫克洛伊·杰弗里斯
<14-4,Foreman >News story said her name was Chloe Jeffries.

341
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,900
<14-4,Foreman >问这个干嘛
<14-4,Foreman >Why does that matter?

342
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,620
<14-5,House >如果不是他有病
<14-5,House >'Cause there's another reason besides being sick

343
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,770
<14-5,House >那他为个陌生人冒生命危险就另有原因
<14-5,House >that he'd risk his life for a stranger.

344
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,340
<14-5,House >她不是个陌生人
<14-5,House >She's not a stranger.

<14-5,House >这位可怜的少女是癫痫病患者
<14-5,House >The damsel in distress is an epileptic.

346
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,270
<14-5,House >所以我们以为她是癫痫发作
<14-5,House >So we assumed she was having an epileptic seizure,

347
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,310
<14-5,House >如果不是呢
<14-5,House >but what if she wasn't?

348
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,470
<14-6,Chase >-如果她也病了呢  -杰克常巡演在外
<14-6,Chase >- What if she's sick too? - Jack is away a lot on tour.

349
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,240
<14-6,Chase >但他估计不会向我们透露半点实情
<14-6,Chase >What happens on the road stays on the road.

350
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,680
<14-7,Masters >最有可能是感染引起的肺炎
<14-7,Masters >The most likely cause of pneumonitis is infection.

351
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,510
<14-7,Masters >我们不该做个痰栓培养吗
<14-7,Masters >Shouldn't we be getting a sputum culture?

352
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,590
<14-8,House >白细胞数
<14-8,House >There's no significant elevation

353
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,110
<14-8,House >没有明显升高
<14-8,House >of white blood cell count.

354
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,700
<14-8,House >这更像是中毒
<14-8,House >This is more like toxic exposure.

355
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,400
<14-9,Foreman >他说得有道理
<14-9,Foreman >He's got a point.

356
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,530
<14-10,Masters >凭什么你假设他愧疚
<14-10,Masters >Why is your assumption of his guilt more valid

357
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,270
<14-10,Masters >比我假设他无私更合理
<14-10,Masters >than my assumption of his selflessness?

358
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,630
<14-11,House >因为我的假设
<14-11,House >Because my assumption is backed up

359
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,880
<14-11,House >由无数男人验证  还有陶博
<14-11,House >by millions of men, and Taub,

360
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,490
<14-11,House >因为他们对自己的妻子不忠
<14-11,House >who've cheated on their wives.

361
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,840
<14-11,House >去找那个姑娘  搜搜他们的爱巢吧
<14-11,House >Find the girl and the love nest.

<15-1,Chase >有人吗
<15-1,Chase >Hello?

364
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,250
<15-2,Taub >我们在这儿私闯民宅
<15-2,Taub >So we're breaking into this girl's apartment

365
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,630
<15-2,Taub >就因为豪斯认为
<15-2,Taub >because House thinks that two people,

366
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,000
<15-2,Taub >两个在地铁站里相距30英尺的人
<15-2,Taub >standing 30 feet apart on a subway platform

<15-3,Chase >你今天可有够无聊的
<15-3,Chase >God, you're a drag today.

369
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,670
<15-3,Chase >让我猜猜  又和老婆吵架了
<15-3,Chase >Let me guess. Back to fighting with the wife?

370
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,680
<15-4,Taub >没  我们昨晚做爱来着
<15-4,Taub >No. We had sex again last night...

<15-6,Taub >瑞切尔已经很久没和我
<15-6,Taub >Rachel hasn't wanted this much intimacy

374
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,990
<15-6,Taub >这么亲密了
<15-6,Taub >in a long time.

375
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,090
<15-6,Taub >我觉得她迷恋的不是我
<15-6,Taub >I don't think it's me she's hot for.

376
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,300
<15-6,Taub >而是网上那个家伙
<15-6,Taub >It's this Internet guy.

377
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,910
<15-6,Taub >她开心了
<15-6,Taub >She's just happy,

378
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
<15-6,Taub >让她充满激情
<15-6,Taub >and that's turning her on.

379
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,060
<15-7,Chase >她没有对你不忠
<15-7,Chase >So she's not cheating on you,

380
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,640

<24-17,House >where the message is actually coming from.

615
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,940
<24-17,House >会不会是甲状腺
<24-17,House >What about his thyroid?

616
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,760
<24-18,Chase >甲状腺功能亢进可以解释他的所有症状
<24-18,Chase >Hyperthyroidism would explain all his symptoms.

617
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,080
<24-19,House >也有可能是肝脏的原因
<24-19,House >Or it could be his liver.

618
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,090
<24-20,Foreman >那我们就都查一查
<24-20,Foreman >Good. We'll take a look at both.

619
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,850
<24-21,Masters >声明一下  牵涉性疼痛并不能排除感染
<24-21,Masters >For the record, referred pain does not rule out infection--

620
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,700
<24-22,House >你在攻读数学学位的时候
<24-22,House >Were you like this when you were working

621
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,750
<24-22,House >就已经这样了吗
<24-22,House >for your math degree?

622
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,240
<24-22,House >假如欧几里德来做客座讲座
<24-22,House >If Euclid had been a guest lecturer,

623
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,180
<24-22,House >你会不会直接坐到第一排大声说
<24-22,House >would you have been the kid sitting in the front row going,

624
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,730
<24-22,House >不好意思  你还没证明勾股定理呢
<24-22,House >"Actually, you haven't proven the pythagorean theorem"?

625
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,440
<24-22,House >喂
<24-22,House >Hello?

626
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,440
<25-1,Cuddy >好了
<25-1,Cuddy >All right.

627
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,830
<25-1,Cuddy >妈妈
<25-1,Cuddy >Mom...

628
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,400
<25-2,Arlene >谢谢你  亲爱的
<25-2,Arlene >Thank you, sweetie.

629
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,860
<25-2,Arlene >假设你们两个结婚了
<25-2,Arlene >So say you two got married,

630
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,110
<25-2,Arlene >你会皈依犹太教吗
<25-2,Arlene >would you convert to Judaism?

631
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,850
<25-1,Cuddy >我们还没发展到这程度呢  妈妈
<25-1,Cuddy >We haven't gotten that far, mom.

632
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,040
<25-2,Arlene >这确实是个十分有意思的问题
<25-2,Arlene >That's actually a really interesting question.

633
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,140
<25-3,House >我是个无神论者
<25-3,House >I'm an atheist.

634
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,170
<25-4,Arlene >亲爱的  我认识的犹太人中有一半不信神
<25-4,Arlene >Honey, half the Jews I know are atheists.

635
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,770
<25-4,Arlene >主要是种归属感
<25-4,Arlene >It's about community.

636
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,320
<25-5,Cuddy >豪斯对归属感没什么兴趣
<25-5,Cuddy >House isn't that big on community.

637
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,810
<25-6,Arlene >你为什么老叫他豪斯
<25-6,Arlene >And why do you call him "House"?

638
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,920
<25-6,Arlene >他的名字叫格雷戈
<25-6,Arlene >The man's name is Greg.

639
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,970
<25-6,Arlene >直呼其名会显得你们两个很亲密
<25-6,Arlene >It makes it seem like you're not serious.

640
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,160
<25-6,Arlene >我只是提醒你该为将来考虑了
<25-6,Arlene >I'm just trying to help you think about the future.

641
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,960
<25-6,Arlene >你已经...你已经老大不小了
<25-6,Arlene >You're-- you're a certain age now.

642
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,880
<25-6,Arlene >你找到的男朋友的质量只能越来越差
<25-6,Arlene >The parade of boyfriends can't be as amusing as it was.

643
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,570
<25-6,Arlene >是该安定下来的时候了  像你妹妹那样
<25-6,Arlene >You need to settle down, like your sister.

644
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,930
<25-7,Wilson >安定下来  说来好听  其实就是浮云
<25-7,Wilson >Settling down isn't all it's cracked up to be.

645
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,470
<25-7,Wilson >下周萨姆过生日
<25-7,Wilson >Next week is Sam's birthday.

646
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,850
<25-7,Wilson >我本想带她去波科诺山
<25-7,Wilson >I was gonna take her to the Poconos and--

647
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,310
<25-8,Arlene >有点伤感
<25-8,Arlene >That's very sad.

648
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,230
<25-8,Arlene >这个话题也许并不适合这种喜庆的场合
<25-8,Arlene >Perhaps not the best choice of topic for a festive occasion.

649
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,700
<25-8,Arlene >我不想让瑞秋
<25-8,Arlene >I just don't want Rachel

650
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,060
<25-8,Arlene >长大以后以为你是个荡妇
<25-8,Arlene >growing up thinking you're a slut.

651
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,450
<25-8,Arlene >好吧  该我说点什么了
<25-8,Arlene >Okay, I got this.

652
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,400
<25-9,Cuddy >首先  岳母大人
<25-9,Cuddy >First of all, mom...

653
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,460
<25-9,Cuddy >哦  天呐
<25-9,Cuddy >Oh, my God.

654
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,390
<25-9,Cuddy >你难道...
<25-9,Cuddy >Did you...

655
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,770
<25-9,Cuddy >给我妈用了镇静剂
<25-9,Cuddy >Sedate my mother?

656
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,140
<25-10,House >药力发挥的时机恰到好处
<25-10,House >Kicked in just in time.

657
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,340
<25-10,House >她过一两个小时之后就能醒
<25-10,House >She'll wake up in a couple of hours,

658
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,560
<25-10,House >好像什么都没发生过
<25-10,House >be good as new.

659
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,860
<25-10,House >就当是我送给你的生日礼物
<25-10,House >Think of it as my birthday gift to you.

660
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,730
<25-10,House >你不让我说话
<25-10,House >You told me to keep my mouth shut.

661
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,020
<25-10,House >这就是我唯一的办法了
<25-10,House >It's the only way I had a chance.

662
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,770
<25-10,House >且不说豪斯有社交障碍
<25-10,House >Leaving aside the fact that House is a sociopath,

663
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,090
<25-10,House >我必须承认...  我确实有种解放的感觉
<25-10,House >I have to admit that I'm-- I'm honestly relieved.

664
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,270
<25-10,House >你妈妈确实...  确实不好对付
<25-10,House >Your mom is quite a h-- quite a handful.

665
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,240
<25-10,House >什么
<25-10,House >What?

666
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,190
<27-1,Jack >我感觉...
<27-1,Jack >I feel f--

667
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,220
<25-8,Arlene >你不是在耍我吧
<25-8,Arlene >Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

668
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,890
<25-9,Cuddy >你也给我下药了
<25-9,Cuddy >You drugged me too?

669
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,310
<25-10,House >对不起
<25-10,House >Sorry.

670
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,510
<25-11,House >原以为你会胡说八道些什么的
<25-11,House >I honestly thought you'd be worse.

671
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,200
<25-11,House >就算是送给我自己的礼物
<25-11,House >That was my gift to myself.

672
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,610
<26-1,Taub >看起来杰克的甲状腺功能还算正常
<26-1,Taub >I take it Jack's thyroid levels are normal.

673
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,170
<26-2,Masters >福曼正在做肝脏活检
<26-2,Masters >Foreman is doing a liver biopsy now.

674
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,400
<26-3,Taub >很好
<26-3,Taub >Good.

675
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,680
<26-4,Masters >你怎么了
<26-4,Masters >What's up with you?

676
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,800
<26-4,Masters >没什么
<26-4,Masters >Nothing.

677
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,850
<26-5,Taub >我感觉很好
<26-5,Taub >I'm peachy.

678
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,290
<26-5,Taub >感觉自己被别人取代了是不好受
<26-5,Taub >It's hard when you feel like you've been replaced.

679
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,710
<26-5,Taub >我们家有次新买了只小狗崽
<26-5,Taub >We got a new puppy once,

680
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,320
<26-6,Taub >原来的那条可卡长毛狗
<26-6,Taub >and our old cocker spaniel

681
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,620
<26-6,Taub >抑郁了好几个礼拜
<26-6,Taub >just moped for weeks.

682
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,090
<26-6,Taub >你有过性经历吗
<26-6,Taub >Have you even had sex?

683
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,340
<26-7,Masters >我们不是在讨论我的问题
<26-7,Masters >We're not talking about me.

684
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,400
<26-7,Masters >讨论的是你的问题
<26-7,Masters >We're talking about you.

685
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,950
<26-7,Masters >对  你刚才在讲小狗崽的事
<26-7,Masters >No, you're talking about puppies,

686
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,360
<26-8,Taub >我走神了
<26-8,Taub >and I'm not listening.

687
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,310
<26-8,Taub >她总是不停地想做
<26-8,Taub >She wants to do it all the time,

688
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,690
<26-8,Taub >却并不是因为我
<26-8,Taub >but it has nothing to do with me.

689
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,160
<26-8,Taub >我成了她发泄的工具
<26-8,Taub >I'm just a piece of meat.

690
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,840
<26-9,Masters >她喜欢上了别人
<26-9,Masters >Well, she likes someone else,

691
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,030
<26-9,Masters >你也跟别人上过床
<26-9,Masters >and you've slept with other people.

692
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,260
<26-9,Masters >你们为什么还没离婚
<26-9,Masters >Uh, why are you still together?

693
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,220
<26-10,Taub >我爱她
<26-10,Taub >I love her.

<26-10,Taub >我从没爱上过除她以外的任何人
<26-10,Taub >I've never loved anybody else.

696
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,750
<26-10,Taub >我不知道...
<26-10,Taub >I don't know how to...

697
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,450
<26-10,Taub >离开她要怎么办
<26-10,Taub >Not be with her.

698
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,110
<26-11,Masters >那你以后会对她忠贞不贰吗
<26-11,Masters >So you're never gonna cheat again.

699
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,510
<26-12,Taub >我不知道
<26-12,Taub >I don't know.

700
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,140
<26-13,Masters >那就有点自私了吧
<26-13,Masters >Well, that seems kind of selfish, doesn't it?

701
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,930
<26-13,Masters >福曼发现他肝脏里有弥散性炎症
<26-13,Masters >Foreman found diffuse inflammation in Jack's liver.

702
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,930
<26-13,Masters >看起来像自身免疫肝炎
<26-13,Masters >Looks like autoimmune hepatitis...

703
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,790
<26-13,Masters >要马上给他用激素
<26-13,Masters >Starting him on steroids.

704
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,250
<26-13,Masters >这样多好
<26-13,Masters >Isn't this nice?

705
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,510
<27-1,Jack >这是什么音
<27-1,Jack >What's this note?

706
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,760
<27-1,Jack >听起来像不像A
<27-1,Jack >Does that sound like an "A"?

707
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,360
<27-1,Jack >记住了  手指这样按
<27-1,Jack >Remember, I put my finger like this

708
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,100
<27-1,Jack >把那个东西抬起来  就是F了
<27-1,Jack >without this doohickey on it, it's an "F."

709
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,600
<27-1,Jack >明白了吗
<27-1,Jack >See?

<27-2,Daisy >我们能不能看书啊
<27-2,Daisy >Can we read a book instead?

<28-1,Taub >We got him stabilized, but barely.

718
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,630
<28-2,House >就算最开始的时候他的大脑没有问题
<28-2,House >If there was nothing wrong with his brain before,

719
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,800
<28-2,House >现在看来问题不小

725
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,590
<28-5,Chase >你犯什么错了
<28-5,Chase >What did you do?

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
<28-6,Taub >昨晚还高烧了
<28-6,Taub >developed a raging fever overnight.

728
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,770
<28-6,Taub >这说明马斯特斯早先的判断是对的
<28-6,Taub >That means Masters was right all along.

729
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,760
<28-6,Taub >确实是感染
