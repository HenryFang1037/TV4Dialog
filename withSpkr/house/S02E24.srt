<1-1,House>he's got a temperature of 103.

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,580
<1-2,Foreman>我们何需关心?
<1-2,Foreman>And why do we care?

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,540
<1-3,House>因为我们是人. 就该关心
<1-3,House>Because we're human beings. It's what we do.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,180
<1-3,House>他说正参加一个午宴
<1-3,House>He said he was at a luncheon memeeting.

<1-4,Cameron>你看了他的历史记录?
<1-4,Cameron>You took his history?

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,860
<1-5,House>那家伙有点像 Harpo(美国著名谐星),值得参观
<1-5,House>Guy looks like harpo. You should see him.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,210
<1-6,Chase>你问他正读什么书
<1-6,Chase>You asked him what book he's currently reading.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,450
<1-7,House>看他试着讲话真是好玩极了
<1-7,House>it's hilarious to watch him try and talk.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,270
<1-7,House>我问他我能想到的一切
<1-7,House>I asked him anything i could think of.

<2-1,House>最喜爱的
<2-1,House>Favorite

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,390
<2-1,House>甜点上的点缀?

<2-1,House>Trust me,you never know what fact may prove the key to saving your life.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,650
<2-2,Vince>鲜奶油
<2-2,Vince>Whipped cweam.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,640
<2-2,Vince>我问他肯定吗
<2-2,Vince>I asked him if he was sure.

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,120
<2-2,Vince>你去哪?
<2-2,Vince>Where are you going?

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,490
<3-1,House>你是个混蛋
<3-1,House>You're an ass.

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,480
<3-2,Foreman>我知道
<3-2,Foreman>I know.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,360
<3-3,House>我问你去哪?
<3-3,House>Where are you going?

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,610
<3-4,Foreman>这要么是中毒, 要么是感染,或过敏反应
<3-4,Foreman>This is either a toxin,an infection,or an allergic reaction.

22
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,970
<3-4,Foreman>猜你已经做了上皮细胞镜检,所以排除过敏
<3-4,Foreman>I assume you gave him epi,so that rules out allergies.

23
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,260
<3-4,Foreman>使用抗生素以防是感染
<3-4,Foreman>Put him on antibiotics in case it's an infection.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,950
<3-4,Foreman>如果是中毒, 留他待上一夜
<3-4,Foreman>And if it's a toxin,we'll keep him here overnight,

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,650
<3-4,Foreman>等肿退了, 就遣他回家
<3-4,Foreman>let the swelling go down,send him home.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,050
<3-4,Foreman>我去看电影了
<3-4,Foreman>I'm going to the movies.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,130
<3-5,Jack>你们当中谁是 House ?
<3-5,Jack>Which one of you is house?

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,480
<3-6,House>瘦瘦的皮肤浅黑的女士
<3-6,House>The skinny brunette.

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,010
<3-7,Jack>不, 那是 Cameron 医生
<3-7,Jack>No,that's dr. Cameron.

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,540
<3-8,House>我也瘦. 你怎么知道她名字的?
<3-8,House>I'm skinny. How do you know her name?

31
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,190
<3-9,Jack>我曾是你的病人
<3-9,Jack>I was a patient of yours.

32
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,550
<3-10,House>噢, 嗯, 如果你想送巧克力, 放在楼下--
<3-10,House>Oh,well,if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs--

33
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,420
<3-11,Jack>别动!
<3-11,Jack>Stay!

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,940
<3-11,Jack>离他远点
<3-11,Jack>Stay away from him.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,890
<3-11,Jack>震惊, 不是吗?
<3-11,Jack>Shocking,isn't it?

36
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,640
<3-11,Jack>怎么会有人想伤害你呢?
<3-11,Jack>Who'd want to hurt you?

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,020
<4-1,House>你真可怜
<4-1,House>You're pathetic.

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,110
<4-1,House>根据(胡子)的生长情况
<4-1,House>Judging by the growth,

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,250
<4-1,House>猜我已经不省人事两天了
<4-1,House>I'd say I've been unconscious for two days.

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,940
<4-1,House>你一直坐在那里?
<4-1,House>Have you been sitting there the whole time?

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,780
<4-2,Cameron>没有
<4-2,Cameron>No.

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,600
<4-3,House>根据你发油累积的情况看
<4-3,House>Judging by the oily buildup in your hair,

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,780
<4-3,House>你说谎
<4-3,House>I'd say you're lying.

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,530
<4-4,Cameron>我很害怕
<4-4,Cameron>I was scared.

45
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,080
<4-4,Cameron>原谅我是出于关心
<4-4,Cameron>Pardon me for caring.

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,640
<4-5,House>我有没有失去什么器官?
<4-5,House>Did I lose any organs?

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,410
<4-6,Cameron>射向你腹部的子弹打穿了你的胃
<4-6,Cameron>The bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach,

48
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,270
<4-6,Cameron>伤到了肠子, 最后停在背部肋骨
<4-6,Cameron>nicked the bowel,lodged in the posterior rib.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,090
<4-7,House>唔, 我一直都说, 如果你要中枪
<4-7,House>Well,I always say,if you're gonna get shot,

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,700
<4-7,House>最好是在医院里
<4-7,House>do it in a hospital.

51
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,500
<4-8,Cameron>你脖子上那枪--
<4-8,Cameron>The one in your neck--

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,400
<4-9,House>那枪我不记得了
<4-9,House>I don't remember that one.

53
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,390
<4-10,Cameron>从右侧穿了过去, 对颈静脉造成了严重伤害
<4-10,Cameron>Went right through,severed your jugular.

54
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,050
<4-10,Cameron>开枪的原来是--
<4-10,Cameron>The shooter turns out to be a guy--

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,140
<4-11,House>不想知道
<4-11,House>don't care.

56
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,740
<4-12,Cameron>你不想知道为什么有人走进医院,向一名医生开枪?
<4-12,Cameron>You don't care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor?

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,890
<4-12,Cameron>向你开枪?
<4-12,Cameron>Shot you?

58
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,330
<4-13,House>我想他的论据是错误的
<4-13,House>I assume his reasoning was faulty.

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
<4-13,House>怎么样了?
<4-13,House>So what was it?

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,450
<4-13,House>是感染吗?
<4-13,House>Infection?

61
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,690
<4-14,Cameron>手术做得很好
<4-14,Cameron>The surgery went fine.

62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,800
<4-14,Cameron>你没有术后--
<4-14,Cameron>You've had no post-op--

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,460
<4-15,House>不是我, 那个病人
<4-15,House>not me. Patient.

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,370
<4-15,House>Harpo.
<4-15,House>Harpo

65
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,540
<4-16,Cameron>你刚刚受了枪伤, House. 你应该休息
<4-16,Cameron>You just got shot,house. You should rest.

66
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,240
<4-17,House>我中了枪, 诊断起来无趣
<4-17,House>I got shot. Diagnostically boring.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,110
<4-17,House>肥大的舌头, 换个角度看...无比有趣
<4-17,House>Big fat tongue,on the other hand... endlessly entertaining.

68
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,660
<4-18,Cameron>活检了他的舌头
<4-18,Cameron>We biopsied his tongue.

69
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,840
<4-19,House>结果是阴性
<4-19,House>and it was negative.

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,350
<4-19,House>验血结果也是阴性
<4-19,House>And the blood tests were negative.

71
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,180
<4-20,Cameron>我没说验了血
<4-20,Cameron>I didn't say we did blood tests.

72
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,800
<4-21,House>不会对舌头进行活检, 除非必须那样做
<4-21,House>You don't biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue.

73
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,250
<4-21,House>本不需要对舌头活检
<4-21,House>And you don't have to biopsy a tongue

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,810
<4-21,House>除非已进行了一系列常规检查, 却无结果
<4-21,House>unless you've already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests

75
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,310
<4-21,House>那些不会使你的病人痛苦的检查
<4-21,House>which don't involve torturing your patient.

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,640
<4-21,House>有新症状吗?
<4-21,House>Any new symptoms?

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,800
<4-21,House>除了颅内压的升高?
<4-21,House>Other than the increased intracranial pressure?

78
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,620
<4-21,House>有没有猜出我是怎么知道那个的?
<4-21,House>Any guesses on how i figured that one out?

79
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,560
<4-22,Cameron>你知道下一步会是腰椎穿刺
<4-22,Cameron>You knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,090
<4-22,Cameron>腰椎穿刺肯定会得出确定答案
<4-22,Cameron>A lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer.

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,740
<4-22,Cameron>既然现在还没有肯定的答案
<4-22,Cameron>Since we don't have a definitive answer,

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,080
<4-22,Cameron>就还没有做穿刺
<4-22,Cameron>we must not have done an lp,

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,750
<4-22,Cameron>而不能做腰穿, 最通常的原因
<4-22,Cameron>and the most common reason to not do an lp

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,970
<4-22,Cameron>就是颅内压升高
<4-22,Cameron>is increased intracranial pressure.

85
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,550
<4-22,Cameron>他被保安枪击了, 他想--
<4-22,Cameron>He was shot by security trying to--

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,260
<4-22,Cameron>House, 你要--
<4-22,Cameron>house,what are you--

87
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,040
<4-23,House>house.
<4-23,House>House

88
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,610
<4-23,House>我去和 Cuddy 谈谈
<4-23,House>I'm talking to cuddy.

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,780
<4-24,Cameron>躺下
<4-24,Cameron>Lie down.

90
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,230
<4-24,Cameron>你会疼死的
<4-24,Cameron>You've got to be in pain.

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,710
<4-25,House>今天不会
<4-25,House>Not today.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,650
<4-25,House>今天用着吗啡
<4-25,House>Today I'm on morphine.

93
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,460
<4-26,Cameron>会把你缝好的伤口撕裂的
<4-26,Cameron>You're going to rip your stitches out.

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,920
<4-27,House>查查 Harpo 的垃圾
<4-27,House>Check harpo's trash.

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,230
<4-28,Cameron>别管那个病人了
<4-28,Cameron>Forget about the patient.

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,380
<4-29,House>算了吧
<4-29,House>Come on.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,210
<4-29,House>你有点好奇
<4-29,House>You're curious.

98
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,650
<4-29,House>垃圾?
<4-29,House>Trash?

99
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,950
<4-29,House>你不知道我指什么
<4-29,House>You don't know what I'm talking about

100
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,050
<4-29,House>但知道我准没错
<4-29,House>but you know it's good.

101
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,720
<4-30,Cameron>你不能就这样四处走
<4-30,Cameron>You can't just be walking around.

102
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,780
<4-31,House>那你阻止我啊
<4-31,House>Well,then stop me.

103
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,330
<4-33,House>- 你失血--,- 挡住我吧
<4-33,House>- You've lost blood-- - physically stop me.

104
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,870
<4-34,Cameron>- 你会损害--,- 你不会
<4-34,Cameron>- You could damage-- - you can'T.

105
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,830
<4-35,House>因为会接触到我身体
<4-35,House>Because that would involve physically touching me,

106
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,650
<4-35,House>会触发性欲--
<4-35,House>and then things would t so sexually charged--

107
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,020
<4-35,House>我体型是你两倍
<4-35,House>I'm twice your size.

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,810
<4-35,House>把手拿开
<4-35,House>Get your hands off me.

109
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,860
<4-36,Cameron>每个活物都得进食
<4-36,Cameron>Everything that lives,eats.

110
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,930
<4-36,Cameron>吃了东西都会产生废物
<4-36,Cameron>Everything that eats,poops.

111
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,010
<4-36,Cameron>所以每个器官都有卫生部门
<4-36,Cameron>That's why every organ has a sanitation department.

112
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,780
<4-36,Cameron>淋巴系统
<4-36,Cameron>The lymph system.

113
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,400
<4-36,Cameron>不管是什么造成了损害,都会在那倾倒排泄物
<4-36,Cameron>Whatever's doing the damage is dumping its waste in there.

114
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,890
<4-36,Cameron>那就是你所说的垃圾
<4-36,Cameron>That's what you meant by trash.

115
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,020
<4-37,House>活检颌下淋巴结
<4-37,House>Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.

116
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,440
<5-1,Cuddy>很抱歉, 是不近情理, 可实在没别的地方
<5-1,Cuddy>I'm sorry,I know it's crazy,but there's no other place.

117
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,210
<5-1,Cuddy>那里是重症监护中心
<5-1,Cuddy>It's the icu.

118
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,480
<5-1,Cuddy>表明提供特别护理
<5-1,Cuddy>It stands for intensive care.

119
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,230
<5-1,Cuddy>他需要重症特别护理, 你也是
<5-1,Cuddy>He needs intensive care,so do you.

120
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,590
<5-2,House>他该再中一枪
<5-2,House>He needs to be shot again.

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,230
<5-3,Cuddy>他被拷在床上
<5-3,Cuddy>He is handcuffed to his bed.

122
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,080
<5-3,Cuddy>对他用了镇静剂
<5-3,Cuddy>He is sedated.

123
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,870
<5-3,Cuddy>不会再伤到你的了
<5-3,Cuddy>He's not going to hurt you.

124
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,510
<5-4,House>如果你的保安有一点用的话
<5-4,House>If your security was any good,

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,120
<5-4,House>我当初就不会挨枪子儿
<5-4,House>I wouldn't have been shot in the first place.

126
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,020
<5-5,Cuddy>他应当在那里
<5-5,Cuddy>He is where he's supposed to be.

127
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,010
<5-6,House>- 你也该待在那里--,- 谁给我做的手术?
<5-6,House>- Where you're supposed to be-- - who did my surgery?

128
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,800
<5-7,Cuddy>Gillick, 怎么了?
<5-7,Cuddy>Gillick,why?

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,460
<5-7,Cuddy>要给他送水果蓝吗?
<5-7,Cuddy>You going to send him a fruit basket?

130
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,250
<5-8,House>他搞砸了
<5-8,House>He screwed up.

131
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,670
<5-9,Cuddy>你对唯寇锭(止痛药)成瘾已经够我烦的了
<5-9,Cuddy>It's annoying enough dealing with your vicodin habit.

132
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,580
<5-9,Cuddy>别再对吗啡上瘾了
<5-9,Cuddy>Quit upping your morphine.

133
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,970
<5-9,Cuddy>我没有
<5-9,Cuddy>I'm not.

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,630
<5-10,House>我正在减少剂量
<5-10,House>I'm reducing it.

135
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,130
<5-11,Cuddy>而你不感到疼痛?
<5-11,Cuddy>And you're not in pain?

136
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,420
<5-12,House>我感觉好多了
<5-12,House>I'm feeling better.

137
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
<5-13,Cuddy>Gillick 真是太棒了
<5-13,Cuddy>Gillick is very good.

138
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,390
<5-13,Cuddy>你的康复期--
<5-13,Cuddy>Your recovery time--

139
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,150
<5-14,House>我的胃疼的要死
<5-14,House>my stomach kills me,

140
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,930
<5-14,House>脖子悸痛
<5-14,House>my neck is throbbing,

141
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
<5-14,House>但腿却感觉好多了
<5-14,House>but my leg feels better.

142
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,170
<5-15,Cuddy>这太神奇了
<5-15,Cuddy>That's amazing.

143
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,540
<5-15,Cuddy>让人难以置信
<5-15,Cuddy>It's unbelievable.

144
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,380
<5-16,House>因为食品药监局不核准枪击用于任何治疗
<5-16,House>Since getting shot is not an fda approved treatment for anything,

145
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,030
<5-16,House>说明手术中一定出了问题
<5-16,House>it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery.

146
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,330
<5-17,Cuddy>是的, 可怕的... 悲剧性的错误
<5-17,Cuddy>Yes,terribly...tragically wrong.

147
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,290
<5-17,Cuddy>享受这个错误吧
<5-17,Cuddy>Enjoy the mistake.

148
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,730
<5-18,House>他肯定弄伤了我的外周神经系统
<5-18,House>He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system.

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,960
<5-18,House>如果它减轻了疼痛, 天知道还影响什么?
<5-18,House>If it's alleviating pain,who knows what else it's doing?

150
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,480
<5-18,House>回重症监护中心去
<5-18,House>Get back to the icu

151
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,110
<5-19,Cuddy>在你的缝线断裂之前
<5-19,Cuddy>before you rip out your stitches,

152
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,260
<5-19,Cuddy>我会不得不把你拷在床上的
<5-19,Cuddy>and I have to chain you to your bed.

153
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,660
<6-1,House>为什么你想杀了我?
<6-1,House>Why did you try to kill me?

154
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,840
<6-2,Jack>我没有
<6-2,Jack>I didn'T.

155
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,940
<6-3,House>枪击难道是个误会
<6-3,House>Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.

156
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,190
<6-4,Jack>如果我打算杀了你, 早做到了
<6-4,Jack>If I'd have killed you,it would have been over.

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,920
<6-4,Jack>我要你活着
<6-4,Jack>I needed you to live.

158
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,330
<6-4,Jack>因为要看着你被痛苦折磨
<6-4,Jack>Because I want to see you suffer.

159
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,620
<7-1,Foreman>把针移开
<7-1,Foreman>Get the needle out of there.

160
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,050
<7-2,Chase>他不能呼吸了
<7-2,Chase>He can't breathe.

161
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,510
<7-2,Chase>House.
<7-2,Chase>House

162
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,090
<7-2,Chase>检查结果是阴性
<7-2,Chase>The test was negative.

163
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,600
<7-2,Chase>你这样行么?
<7-2,Chase>Are you sure you want to be doing this?

164
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,570
<8-1,Cameron>我很好
<8-1,Cameron>I'm fine.

165
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,640
<8-2,Chase>我想
<8-2,Chase>I think

166
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,330
<8-3,House>Cameron, 你有我的病历吗?
<8-3,House>cameron,you got my records?

167
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,440
<8-4,Cameron>一般不公开病人手术记录的
<8-4,Cameron>They don't like to release patient's operative notes.

168
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,100
<8-5,House>但你手上拿的不正是吗
<8-5,House>And yet you're holding them.

169
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,130
<8-5,House>还这么小声说话
<8-5,House>And whispering.

170
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,840
<8-6,Cameron>因为他在睡觉
<8-6,Cameron>He's sleeping.

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,070
<8-6,Cameron>是啊
<8-6,Cameron>Yeah.

172
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,360
<8-7,House>杀手也需要休息
<8-7,House>Killer needs his rest.

173
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,520
<8-7,House>不然, 他会暴躁一整天
<8-7,House>Otherwise. he's grumpy all day.

174
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,540
<8-7,House>嘿! 醒醒
<8-7,House>Hey! Wake up.

175
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,690
<8-7,House>看看我是怎么救人的
<8-7,House>Watch me save a life

176
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,960
<8-8,Foreman>可以肯定是某种感染
<8-8,Foreman>almost for sure it's some sort of infection.

177
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,730
<8-8,Foreman>给他使用了广谱抗菌素
<8-8,Foreman>We've got him on broad spectrum antibiotics,

178
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,400
<8-8,Foreman>但是病情还在恶化
<8-8,Foreman>but it's not even slowing the thing down.

179
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,160
<8-8,Foreman>除非找出是哪种感染
<8-8,Foreman>Unless we figure out what type of infection,

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,020
<8-8,Foreman>要不就无法治疗
<8-8,Foreman>we can't treat,

181
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,060
<8-8,Foreman>而我们无法确定感染类型
<8-8,Foreman>and we can't figure out what type

182
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,510
<8-9,House>因为不能做腰穿
<8-9,House>because we can't do an lp.

183
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,380
<8-9,House>做腰穿
<8-9,House>Do an lp.

184
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,740
<8-9,House>看到我在干什么了吗?
<8-9,House>See what I did there?

185
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,150
<8-9,House>你杀了我, 我就没法治病救人了
<8-9,House>Couldn't have done that if you'd killed me.

186
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,710
<8-10,Foreman>能做的话, 两天前就做了
<8-10,Foreman>We would have done an lp two days ago if we could have.

187
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,580
<8-10,Foreman>可是颅内压太高
<8-10,Foreman>But that much pressure,

188
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,510
<8-10,Foreman>- 会并发--,- 本该两天前就做腰穿
<8-10,Foreman>- something's bound to go-- - we would have done an lp two days ago

189
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,340
<8-11,Chase>但当时刺穿明显弊大于利
<8-11,Chase>if the risks hadn't so obviously outweighed the benefits.

190
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,150
<8-11,Chase>但我们刚刚在他喉咙上戳了一个洞
<8-11,Chase>We just cut a hole in his throat.

191
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,840
<8-11,Chase>利弊的天平倾斜了
<8-11,Chase>The equation has changed.

192
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,880
<8-12,House>说得比我还好
<8-12,House>Couldn't have put it better myself.

193
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,730
<8-12,House>压力...
<8-12,House>pressure...

194
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,500
<9-1,Foreman>120毫米水柱
<9-1,Foreman>120 millimeters h2o,

195
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,480
<9-1,Foreman>微弱的变动, 呼吸和脉搏造成的
<9-1,Foreman>with small visible excursions related to respiration and pulse.

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,160
<9-2,Chase>正常范围内, 不错
<9-2,Chase>Well within normal,that's good.

197
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,010
<9-3,Foreman>不, 那才奇怪
<9-3,Foreman>No,that's weird.

198
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,340
<9-3,Foreman>想听个故事吗?
<9-3,Foreman>You want to hear a story?

199
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,410
<10-1,Jack>我有个原则
<10-1,Jack>I have a rule.

200
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,100
<10-2,House>开枪打我的人就丧失了权利去--
<10-2,House>People who shoot me forfeit the right--

201
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,470
<10-3,Jack>我妻子病了
<10-3,Jack>my wife was sick.

202
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,860
<10-3,Jack>没有医生知道为什么
<10-3,Jack>None of the doctors could figure out why.

203
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,260
<10-4,House>噢, 我知道那个故事
<10-4,House>Oh,I know this story.

204
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,690
<10-4,House>她死了
<10-4,House>She died.

205
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,450
<10-4,House>所以你选中一名她的治疗医生来枪杀
<10-4,House>So you selected one of her doctors to kill,

206
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,820
<10-4,House>因为那会使一切又恢复正常
<10-4,House>because that would make everything right again.

207
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,380
<10-5,Jack>她没死
<10-5,Jack>She lived.

208
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,230
<10-5,Jack>你把她治好了
<10-5,Jack>You cured her.

209
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,860
<10-6,House>治好了她我真遗憾
<10-6,House>I'm truly sorry i did that.

210
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,080
<10-7,Jack>在调查她病因的过程中
<10-7,Jack>In the course of investigating her illness,

211
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,350
<10-7,Jack>你让我相信一切事情都是有关的
<10-7,Jack>you convinced me that everything was relevant.

212
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,770
<10-7,Jack>你需要知道事实
<10-7,Jack>You needed the truth.

213
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,140
<10-7,Jack>于是我向你坦白我有外遇
<10-7,Jack>I confessed to you that I'd had an affair.

214
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,980
<10-7,Jack>但那被证明和她的病一点关系都没有
<10-7,Jack>But it turns out that it had nothing to do with why she was sick.

215
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,950
<10-7,Jack>遗传性易患大脑动脉瘤体质
<10-7,Jack>Genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms.

216
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,510
<10-7,Jack>你告诉了她
<10-7,Jack>You told her that.

217
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,170
<10-7,Jack>你还告诉她我有外遇
<10-7,Jack>You also told her about my affair.

218
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,280
<10-8,House>所以你被戳穿了
<10-8,House>And you caught crap,

219
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,730
<10-8,House>她离开了你
<10-8,House>she left you,

220
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,450
<10-8,House>现在要我来付出代价
<10-8,House>and now I've got to pay

221
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,570
<10-8,House>就因为你不能把你的小杀手留在裤子里
<10-8,House>because you couldn't keep your little killer in your pants.

222
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,310
<10-9,Jack>她自杀了
<10-9,Jack>She killed herself.

223
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,670
<11-1,House>哪一类医院会有玻璃墙?
<11-1,House>What sort of hospital has glass walls?

224
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,630
<11-2,Woman>那是我丈夫
<11-2,Woman>That's my husband.

225
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,350
<11-3,House>真的?
<11-3,House>Really?

226
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,330
<11-4,Woman>你以为我只是喜欢看人被针在后背上戳?
<11-4,Woman>You thought I just liked watching people get needles poked in the back?

227
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
<11-4,Woman>不是
<11-4,Woman>Nope.

228
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,690
<11-5,House>我以为是同事或姐妹
<11-5,House>I figured a coworker or a sister.

229
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,910
<11-5,House>没想到是妻子
<11-5,House>Not wife.

230
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,950
<11-6,Woman>为什么?
<11-6,Woman>Why?

231
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,050
<11-7,House>别担心. 我没有羞辱你的意思
<11-7,House>Don't worry. It's not insulting.

232
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,360
<11-7,House>至少没有对你
<11-7,House>At least not to you.

233
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,370
<11-7,House>你对那个回答感到满意?
<11-7,House>You're satisfied by that answer?

234
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,470
<11-8,Woman>你是 House 医生, 是吗?
<11-8,Woman>You're dr. House,aren't you?

235
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,010
<11-9,House>你不会朝我开枪吧?
<11-9,House>You're not going to shoot me,are you?

236
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,150
<11-10,Woman>你治好了我的一位朋友
<11-10,Woman>You treated a friend of mine.

237
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,950
<11-10,Woman>她告诉我你只和必须交谈的人交谈
<11-10,Woman>She told me you only talk to people if you have to.

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,320
<11-10,Woman>然后你向他们展示你的见解有多么深刻,并以此羞辱他们
<11-10,Woman>And then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.

239
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,240
<11-11,House>7分嫁7分
<11-11,House>Sevens marry sevens.

240
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,600
<11-11,House>9分配9分
<11-11,House>Nines marry nines.

241
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,410
<11-11,House>4分凑4分
<11-11,House>Fours marry fours.

242
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,110
<11-11,House>也许还有变动的机会比如有足够多的钱
<11-11,House>Maybe there's some wiggle room if there's enough money,

243
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,160
<11-11,House>或者某人怀孕了
<11-11,House>or somebody got pregnant.

244
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,160
<11-11,House>但是你比你老公至少多得了三分
<11-11,House>But you've got at least three points on ur husband,

245
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,420
<11-11,House>而你的上衣说明你嫁给他并不是为了钱
<11-11,House>and your frock says you didn't do it for the money.

246
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,000
<11-11,House>你的胸部又表明你并没有养育过小孩
<11-11,House>And your breasts say that you haven't had any kids.

247
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,120
<11-12,Woman>所以你得出结论,我的婚姻是个数学上的错误?
<11-12,Woman>So you figure my marriage is a mathematical error?

248
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,750
<11-13,House>数字不会撒谎
<11-13,House>Numbers don't lie.

249
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,780
<11-13,House>我们无法确定你丈夫是何种感染
<11-13,House>We're having trouble finding out what infection your husband has.

250
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,570
<11-13,House>最有可能的病因是一种性传染病
<11-13,House>The most likely culprit is an std.

251
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,030
<11-14,Woman>你想知道我是不是,和我分数相近的人有外遇
<11-14,Woman>You want to know if I've had an affair with someone closer to my integer.

252
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,890
<11-14,Woman>而我必须告诉你事实, 否则我丈夫就会死
<11-14,Woman>And I have to tell you the truth,or my husband will die.

253
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,740
<11-15,House>你朋友是单身吗?
<11-15,House>Is your friend single?

254
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,240
<11-15,House>不是
<11-15,House>No.

255
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,270
<11-16,Woman>我对婚姻很忠诚
<11-16,Woman>And I've always been faithful.

256
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,710
<12-1,Foreman>哇
<12-1,Foreman>wow.

257
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,260
<12-1,Foreman>我觉得没什么大问题
<12-1,Foreman>I would've bet money something would go wrong.

258
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,940
<12-1,Foreman>我们把他翻过来
<12-1,Foreman>Let's rotate him back.

259
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,260
<12-1,Foreman>他眼眶出血
<12-1,Foreman>he's bleeding into his ocular orbit.

260
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,050
<12-2,Chase>腰穿不会导致这样的情况
<12-2,Chase>Lp wouldn't do this.

261
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,820
<12-2,Chase>后部有太大的压力
<12-2,Chase>Lots of pressure behind.

262
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,190
<12-2,Chase>必须得降低压力
<12-2,Chase>Gotta relieve it.

263
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,450
<12-3,Woman>发生什么了? 他们--他们在干什么?
<12-3,Woman>What's going on? What--what are they doing?

264
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,100
<12-4,House>我该走了
<12-4,House>I should go.

265
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,980
<12-4,House>创口好像被我撕裂了
<12-4,House>I seem to have torn my stitches.

266
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,240
<12-4,House>你在大厅里晕倒了
<12-4,House>You collapsed in the hall.

267
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,910
<13-1,Jack>你的创口被撕裂
<13-1,Jack>Tore your stitches.

268
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,670
<13-2,House>我都记得. 我在那
<13-2,House>I remember. I was there.

269
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,360
<13-3,Jack>你肠子怎么样? 疼不疼?
<13-3,Jack>How's your gut? It's hurting?

270
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,600
<13-4,House>你朝那个卖枪给你妻子的家伙开枪了?
<13-4,House>You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?

271
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,740
<13-5,Jack>她把她自己锁在车库里
<13-5,Jack>She locked herself in the garage,

272
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,760
<13-5,Jack>然后她发动了汽车
<13-5,Jack>and she started the car.

273
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,260
<13-6,House>你朝卖开车库门装置给你妻子的人开枪了?
<13-6,House>You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener?

274
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,970
<13-6,House>你是个蠢货
<13-6,House>You're an ass.

275
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,220
<13-7,Jack>口气很硬啊, 对一个开枪打过你的人
<13-7,Jack>That is a bold position to take,given that I shot you.

276
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,330
<13-8,House>枪击只会使你变成白痴
<13-8,House>The shooting just makes you an idiot.

277
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,320
<13-8,House>你是个蠢货, 因为拉起一面大旗
<13-8,House>You're an ass because you're trying to wrap it in the flag,

278
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,500
<13-8,House>好像在做什么伟大的事
<13-8,House>like you did a good thing.

279
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,230
<13-9,Jack>你是一个蠢货和伪君子
<13-9,Jack>You're an ass and a hypocrite.

280
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,420
<13-9,Jack>你不守常规
<13-9,Jack>You don't believe in rules.

281
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,000
<13-9,Jack>只要你认为是对的, 你什么都会做
<13-9,Jack>You do whatever you think is right.

282
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,420
<13-9,Jack>我也是那么干的
<13-9,Jack>That's all I did.

283
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,800
<13-9,Jack>你是我的榜样
<13-9,Jack>You were my role model.

284
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,080
<13-10,House>当心点. 你的旗沾上面包渣了
<13-10,House>Watch out.You're getting crumbs on the flag.

285
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,360
<13-10,House>要她脸上添光的人不是我
<13-10,House>I didn't commit to honor her.

286
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,110
<13-10,House>答应永不欺骗她的人不是我
<13-10,House>I didn't commit to never lie to her.

287
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,600
<13-11,Jack>那么, 如果你当时闭嘴的话
<13-11,Jack>Well,if you'd kept your mouth shut,

288
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,120
<13-11,Jack>她就不会死, 你也不会挨枪子
<13-11,Jack>she'd be alive,and you wouldn't be shot.

289
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,990
<13-12,House>如果你当时把你的"手枪"留在裤子里--
<13-12,House>If you'd kept your pistols in your pants--

290
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,170
<13-13,Jack>她的死是我的错
<13-13,Jack>it's my fault she's dead.

291
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,950
<13-13,Jack>我知道的
<13-13,Jack>I know it.

292
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,180
<13-13,Jack>但你为什么就不承认
<13-13,Jack>But why can't you admit

293
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,000
<13-13,Jack>你也许哪怕有那么一丁点的责任呢?
<13-13,Jack>that it's maybe just a little bit yours too?

294
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,050
<13-13,Jack>也许不光是是医学上的错误才会坏事
<13-13,Jack>That maybe it's not just medical mistakes that screw things up.

295
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,390
<13-14,House>生活是这样的
<13-14,House>Here's how life works.

296
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,820
<13-14,House>要么向别人要求道歉
<13-14,House>You either get to ask for an apology,

297
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,800
<13-14,House>要么你开枪泄愤
<13-14,House>or you get to shoot people.

298
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,480
<13-14,House>不可两样都做
<13-14,House>Not both.

299
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,690
<14-1,House>感染不会让你眼珠子弹出来
<14-1,House>infections don't make your eyes pop out.

300
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,740
<14-2,Chase>我们该回去
<14-2,Chase>we should get back.

301
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,120
<14-2,Chase>你不是被铐在床上么
<14-2,Chase>You're supposed to be chained to your bed.

302
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,390
<14-3,House>还没吃完
<14-3,House>I'm not done eating.

303
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,260
<14-3,House>肯定有什么出血紊乱
<14-3,House>There's got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.

304
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,980
<14-4,Cameron>太蠢了
<14-4,Cameron>This is really stupid.

305
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,870
<14-5,House>瞧, 要是我缝线撑开了
<14-5,House>Look,if my stitches pop out again,

306
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,920
<14-5,House>有三个医生能救我
<14-5,House>I got three doctors to save me.

307
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,340
<14-5,House>可能是眼球血管内层薄弱
<14-5,House>Could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins.

308
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,730
<14-5,House>好, 我替你们说
<14-5,House>Okay,I'll be you guys.

309
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,370
<14-5,House>不可能, 伙计
<14-5,House>No way,mate.

310
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,440
<14-5,House>这么多血, 不可能是静脉
<14-5,House>Too much blood to just be a vein.

311
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,590
<14-5,House>不可能, 老兄
<14-5,House>No way,hizzie.

312
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,700
<14-5,House>如果是动脉, 他会血流不止
<14-5,House>If it was an artery,he'd still be bleeding.

313
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,750
<14-5,House>事实上, 他会死
<14-5,House>Actually,he'd be dead.

314
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,590
<14-6,Cameron>他出血的瘘里可能长了肉芽瘤
<14-6,Cameron>He could have had a granuloma in his sinuses that bled,

315
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,340
<14-6,Cameron>可能是 wegener 肉芽肿造成的,(血管炎, 发生于呼吸道和肾)
<14-6,Cameron>which could have been caused by wegener'S.

316
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,040
<14-7,Chase>当把眼球装回去时,如有肿瘤会注意到
<14-7,Chase>I think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth,while they were sticking the eyeball back in.

317
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,710
<14-8,House>舌头和眼睛病了
<14-8,House>Tongue and eyes are sick.

318
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,800
<14-8,House>鼻子怎么样?
<14-8,House>What about the nose?

319
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,120
<14-8,House>在两者之间, 它为什么没病?
<14-8,House>It's right in between. Why isn't it sick?

320
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,320
<14-9,Foreman>不是扩散性的, 是同一病源
<14-9,Foreman>So it's not spreading. It's got a common source.

321
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,910
<14-10,House>只有什么可能?
<14-10,House>Which can only be what?

322
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,480
<14-11,Foreman>脑, 但CT没有发现
<14-11,Foreman>The brain,except the ct was clean.

323
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,220
<14-12,House>检查脑部垃圾, 看藏了什么
<14-12,House>Check the brain's trash,see what it's hiding.

324
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,600
<14-13,Chase>脑可没有淋巴系统
<14-13,Chase>The brain doesn't have a lymph system.

325
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,450
<14-13,Chase>我知道
<14-13,Chase>I know.

326
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,930
<14-14,House>它的垃圾扔出来
<14-14,House>All its garbage just blows off,

327
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,980
<14-14,House>被路边的防雪栅栏挡住
<14-14,House>gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road.

328
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,370
<14-15,Foreman>你指血脑屏障
<14-15,Foreman>You're referring to the blood-brain barrier.

329
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,060
<14-16,House>还能是什么？
<14-16,House>What else?

330
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,210
<14-16,House>检查屏障
<14-16,House>Biopsy the barrier.

331
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,950
<14-17,Cameron>先根据事实推测, 岂不可靠些?
<14-17,Cameron>Wouldn't it be safer to make a few educated guesses first?

332
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,980
<14-17,Cameron>试一些安全的治疗
<14-17,Cameron>Try some relatively safe treatments?

333
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,130
<14-16,House>检查血脑屏障
<14-16,House>Biopsy the barrier.

334
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,330
<14-18,House>先给他用甲苯哒唑, 以防是寄生虫
<14-18,House>But first,start him on mebendazole in case it's a worm.

335
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,930
<14-19,Foreman>还有左旋氧氟沙星,以防是逃过第一波抗生素的感染
<14-19,Foreman>And levofloxacin in case it's an infection that slipped by the first antibiotic.

336
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,280
<14-20,Chase>再用阿奇霉素, 以防是性病
<14-20,Chase>And azithromycin for stds.

337
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,200
<14-21,House>我倒不认为妻子会放任厮混
<14-21,House>I really don't think the wife is the kind to be messing around.

338
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,020
<14-21,House>我要是娶了她, 肯定不会
<14-21,House>If I was married to her,I certainly wouldn't--

339
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,050
<14-21,House>house.
<14-21,House>house

340
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,330
<14-22,Cameron>这病人没结婚, 他是个鳏夫
<14-22,Cameron>The patient isn't married. He's a widower.

341
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,390
<15-1,Wilson>说真的, 得你自己做复健才有用呢
<15-1,Wilson>Really,it's more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.

342
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,160
<15-2,House>我身体没事
<15-2,House>My body is fine.

343
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,160
<15-2,House>脑子, 却...
<15-2,House>My mind,on the other hand...

344
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,790
<15-3,Wilson>也许她是女友
<15-3,Wilson>maybe she was a girlfriend.

345
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,010
<15-3,Wilson>也许她是耍你
<15-3,Wilson>Maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.

346
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,160
<15-4,House>我问过那层所有的护士了
<15-4,House>I spoke to every one of the nurses on that floor.

347
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,820
<15-4,House>病人只有6名探视者
<15-4,House>The patient had only had six visitors.

348
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,230
<15-4,House>2个女子, 没有爱人
<15-4,House>Two females,no babes.

349
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,410
<15-4,House>他妈妈和阿姨
<15-4,House>His mother and his aunt.

350
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,580
<15-5,Wilson>也许他们漏掉了谁
<15-5,Wilson>So they missed someone.

351
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,590
<15-5,Wilson>他们可不是警卫
<15-5,Wilson>They're not security.

352
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,110
<15-6,House>我手下可没看见我和她在玻璃对面说话
<15-6,House>My posse never saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.

353
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,050
<15-7,Wilson>他们忙着救命呢
<15-7,Wilson>They were a little busy trying to save the guy's life.

354
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,160
<15-8,House>只有一个解释
<15-8,House>There's on one possible conclusion.

355
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,690
<15-8,House>是幻觉
<15-8,House>It was a hallucination.

356
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,000
<15-8,House>这你看起来是什么?
<15-8,House>What does that look like to you?

357
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,320
<15-8,House>Point-six?
<15-8,House>0.6?

358
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,770
<15-9,Wilson>麻醉剂量?
<15-9,Wilson>Anesthesia?

359
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,500
<15-9,Wilson>不是
<15-9,Wilson>No.

360
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,290
<15-9,Wilson>应该是6和一个污点
<15-9,Wilson>It's got to be six and a smudge.

361
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,470
<15-9,Wilson>就算你是对的
<15-9,Wilson>Let's say you'reight.

362
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,460
<15-9,Wilson>在外伤后不也很正常么
<15-9,Wilson>It wouldn't be that uncommon after trauma.

363
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,640
<15-9,Wilson>在失血过多后?
<15-9,Wilson>After that much blood loss?

364
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,070
<15-10,House>我的感觉如果被损害了
<15-10,House>If my perceptions are compromised,

365
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,220
<15-10,House>那我的判断也受损
<15-10,House>then my judgment is compromised.

366
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,220
<15-10,House>要是他妻子告诉我
<15-10,House>What if his wife told me

367
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,550
<15-10,House>病人刚被狂怒的越南麻风病人咬了如何?
<15-10,House>that the patient just got bit by a rabid vietnamese leper?

368
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,390
<15-11,Wilson>别介入这个案例了
<15-11,Wilson>So pull yourself off the case.

369
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,490
<15-12,House>下一个案例呢？
<15-12,House>And the next case?

370
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,750
<15-13,Wilson>你休息两个星期
<15-13,Wilson>You take two weeks.

371
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,150
<15-13,Wilson>会恢复
<15-13,Wilson>You recover.

372
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,410
<15-14,House>要是不呢？
<15-14,House>What if I don't?

373
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,330
<15-14,House>也许不是枪击造成？
<15-14,House>What if it wasn't the shooting?

374
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,260
<15-15,Wilson>洞察所有关联的人
<15-15,Wilson>The guy who sees connections between everything

375
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,880
<15-15,Wilson>怎么看不出枪伤和轻微脑部紊乱的联系？
<15-15,Wilson>sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruptions?

376
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,140
<15-16,House>也许是手术？
<15-16,House>What if it was the surgery?

377
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,510
<15-17,Wilson>也许是你撑破了缝线, 失2品脱的血?
<15-17,Wilson>What if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?

378
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,090
<15-18,House>gillick为什么在手术中给我用K他命?,(一种可致迷幻的麻醉剂)
<15-18,House>Why did gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?

379
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,820
<16-1,Cuddy>工作中
<16-1,Cuddy>Working.

380
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,540
<16-2,House>得谈谈
<16-2,House>We need to talk.

381
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,490
<16-3,Cuddy>回去重症护理室, 谁给你松铐的?
<16-3,Cuddy>Get back to the icu. Who un-cuffed you?

382
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,400
<16-4,House>外科医生为什么要用K他命?
<16-4,House>Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?

383
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,550
<16-5,Cuddy>谁让你看你的手术记录?
<16-5,Cuddy>Who showed you your surgical file?

384
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,510
<16-6,House>怎么知道是我的?
<16-6,House>How do you know it's mine?

385
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,140
<16-7,Cuddy>因为你的病人没做手术
<16-7,Cuddy>Because your patient hasn't had surgery,

386
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,720
<16-7,Cuddy>你也不关心其他人
<16-7,Cuddy>and you don't care about anybody else.

387
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,810
<16-8,House>我未被施麻醉手术
<16-8,House>My anesthesia was almost nonexistent,

388
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,170
<16-8,House>却不清醒
<16-8,House>and yet I wasn't awake.

389
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,240
<16-8,House>出于什么原因
<16-8,House>For some reason,

390
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,840
<16-8,House>有人将我置于分离性昏迷
<16-8,House>somebody decided to put me in a dissociative coma

391
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,430
<16-8,House>而不是仅仅让我昏过去
<16-8,House>instead of just putting me out.

392
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,790
<16-9,Cuddy>有充足的理由使用
<16-9,Cuddy>There are plenty of reasons to use--

393
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,390
<16-9,Cuddy>好吧
<16-9,Cuddy>fine.

394
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,020
<16-10,House>我自己去问手术医生真相
<16-10,House>I'll go beat the truth out of my surgeon.

395
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,280
<16-10,House>Gillick, 对吗?
<16-10,House>Gillick,right?

396
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,410
<16-10,House>奏效了
<16-10,House>It worked.

397
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,730
<16-11,Cuddy>在德国有一个医疗机构
<16-11,Cuddy>There's a clinic in germany.

398
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,370
<16-11,Cuddy>他们诱发昏迷来治疗慢性疼痛
<16-11,Cuddy>They've been treating chronic pain by inducing comas,

399
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,650
<16-11,Cuddy>让脑子能重新启动
<16-11,Cuddy>and letting the mind basically reboot itself.

400
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,840
<16-11,Cuddy>有50%的可能, 你的疼痛会回来
<16-11,Cuddy>There's about a 50% chance your pain will come back.

401
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,730
<16-11,Cuddy>意味着还有50%机会, 不会
<16-11,Cuddy>Which of course means there is a 50% chance that it won'T.

402
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,120
<16-12,House>你没有权利--
<16-12,House>You had no right--

403
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,530
<16-13,Cuddy>来治好你?
<16-13,Cuddy>to heal you?

404
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,860
<16-14,House>你摆弄我的脑子
<16-14,House>You messed with my brain.

405
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,480
<16-15,Cuddy>你为什么心烦?
<16-15,Cuddy>Why are you so upset?

406
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,910
<16-15,Cuddy>你有什么神经症状吗?
<16-15,Cuddy>Are you experiencing any neurological symptoms?

407
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,460
<16-15,Cuddy>晕眩, 震颤, 幻觉?
<16-15,Cuddy>Dizziness,tremors,hallucinations?

408
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,380
<16-15,Cuddy>没有
<16-15,Cuddy>No.

409
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,850
<16-16,House>这是原则问题
<16-16,House>It's a point of principle.

410
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,340
<17-1,Foreman>检查呈阴性
<17-1,Foreman>Test was negative.

411
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,800
<17-2,Cameron>栅栏处没有垃圾
<17-2,Cameron>No trash against the fence.

412
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,070
<17-2,Cameron>你的腿真的好了?
<17-2,Cameron>Is your leg really better?

413
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,230
<17-3,House>别担心, 总有地方坏了
<17-3,House>Don't worry,I'm sure something else is wrong.

414
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,620
<17-4,Chase>确实找到了血
<17-4,Chase>We did find blood.

415
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,190
<17-5,House>在那一边?
<17-5,House>On which side?

416
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,170
<17-6,Chase>错的那边
<17-6,Chase>The wrong side.

417
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,600
<17-7,House>第一桩有意义的发现
<17-7,House>First thing that makes sense.

418
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,890
<17-6,Chase>错的一边是错的
<17-6,Chase>The wrong side's the wrong side.

419
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,910
<17-8,Chase>没有意义
<17-8,Chase>It can't make sense.

420
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,080
<17-9,Cameron>搅乱脑子
<17-9,Cameron>It'd mess with his brain.

421
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,730
<17-9,Cameron>不会导致高烧
<17-9,Cameron>Wouldn't cause fever.

422
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,600
<17-9,Cameron>他最近睡得很多
<17-9,Cameron>He's been sleeping a lot lately.

423
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,160
<17-10,House>你担心了?
<17-10,House>You worried?

424
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,090
<17-10,House>我给他换了点药
<17-10,House>I marked a change of meds on his chart.

425
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,660
<17-11,Cameron>异物
<17-11,Cameron>Foreign object.

426
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,880
<17-10,House>身体想摆脱掉
<17-10,House>Body wants to get rid of it.

427
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,090
<17-10,House>导致高烧
<17-10,House>It causes the fever.

428
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,270
<17-11,Cameron>血液中的异物?
<17-11,Cameron>Blood's a foreign object?

429
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,800
<17-12,Foreman>在大脑内皮层里, 即
<17-12,Foreman>in the brain lining,it is.

430
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,340
<17-12,Foreman>血恶液质说明有癌症
<17-12,Foreman>Blood dyscrasia means cancer.

431
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,240
<17-13,House>找到它
<17-13,House>Find it.

432
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,990
<17-14,Cameron>- 所有的检查,- 都是阴性
<17-14,Cameron>- All the tests-- - have been negative.

433
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,020
<17-15,House>你家的垃圾桶满了怎么办?
<17-15,House>What do you do if your trash cans are full?

434
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,750
<17-15,House>用邻居的垃圾桶
<17-15,House>You use your neighbors' trash cans.

435
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,740
<17-15,House>可要是外面灯亮着
<17-15,House>Except it's still light outside.

436
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,160
<17-15,House>邻居会看到
<17-15,House>Your neighbor will see you.

437
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,000
<17-15,House>所以你走后门, 跑进小巷
<17-15,House>So you go out the back way,into an alley,

438
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,920
<17-15,House>把垃圾扔在邻家车库旁
<17-15,House>and drop off your trash by their garage.

439
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,030
<17-16,Chase>去检查胸腔的淋巴系统
<17-16,Chase>We'll check the lymphatic system in the chest.

440
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,400
<17-17,House>你从巷子里的垃圾桶就推导出了?
<17-17,House>You got that from trash cans in the alley?

441
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,050
<17-18,Chase>舌头的唾液腺
<17-18,Chase>The saliva glands from the tongue

442
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,530
<17-18,Chase>和肺部的淋巴系统相连
<17-18,Chase>are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs.

443
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,340
<17-18,Chase>这是下一个邻近的淋巴系统
<17-18,Chase>It's the next lymphatic system over.

444
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,140
<17-18,Chase>是的
<17-18,Chase>Yeah.

445
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,600
<17-19,House>去查肺淋巴液
<17-19,House>Go get lung lymph.

446
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,670
<17-20,Jack>他怎么会想到的
<17-20,Jack>How did he know that?

447
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,060
<17-21,House>他要是不聪明, 我就不会雇用他了
<17-21,House>I uldn't have hired him if he wasn't smart.

448
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,510
<17-21,House>是
<17-21,House>Right.

449
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,830
<17-22,Jack>你只是敬重他
<17-22,Jack>Because you have nothing but respect for him.

450
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,390
<17-22,Jack>或许他知道答案
<17-22,Jack>Maybe he knew the answer

451
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,220
<17-22,Jack>因为提问
<17-22,Jack>because the question

452
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,400
<17-22,Jack>不如你想的那么狡猾
<17-22,Jack>wasn't nearly as tricky as you thought.

453
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,670
<17-22,Jack>或许不是他变聪明了
<17-22,Jack>Maybe he's not getting smarter.

454
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,700
<17-22,Jack>而是你变笨了
<17-22,Jack>You're getting dumber.

455
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,600
<18-1,Jack>你假装颠覆体制
<18-1,Jack>You pretend to buck the system.

456
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,940
<18-1,Jack>你假装做个叛逆者
<18-1,Jack>Pretend to be a rebel.

457
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,870
<18-1,Jack>声称仇恨规则
<18-1,Jack>You claim to hate rules.

458
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,510
<18-1,Jack>但你所做所为不过是,用你的规则来替代这个社会的
<18-1,Jack>But all you do is substitute your own rules for society'S.

459
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,780
<18-1,Jack>这是个简单美妙的规则
<18-1,Jack>And it's a nice,simple rule.

460
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,320
<18-1,Jack>说出直率正直的真相
<18-1,Jack>Tell the blunt,honest truth

461
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,670
<18-1,Jack>用最赤裸裸, 黑暗的方式
<18-1,Jack>in the starkest,darkest way.

462
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,120
<18-1,Jack>会怎样就怎样
<18-1,Jack>And what will be will be.

463
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,750
<18-1,Jack>该怎样就怎样
<18-1,Jack>What will be should be.

464
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,800
<18-1,Jack>所有其他人都是懦夫
<18-1,Jack>And everyone else is a coward.

465
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,170
<18-1,Jack>但你错了
<18-1,Jack>But you're wrong.

466
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,020
<18-1,Jack>不把别人当傻瓜并不是怯懦
<18-1,Jack>It's not cowardly to not call someone an idiot.

467
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,990
<18-1,Jack>人们不仅仅出于友善而表现得谨慎礼貌
<18-1,Jack>People aren't tactful or polite just because it's nice.

468
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,860
<18-1,Jack>他们这样, 因为尚有一丝的谦恭在
<18-1,Jack>They do it because they've got an ounce of humility.

469
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,260
<18-1,Jack>因为他们知道会犯错误
<18-1,Jack>Because they know that they will make mistakes,

470
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,830
<18-1,Jack>知道他们的行为会有后果
<18-1,Jack>and they know that their actions have consequences.

471
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,890
<18-1,Jack>他们知道后果是自己的错误造成
<18-1,Jack>And they know that those consequences are their fault.

472
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,500
<18-1,Jack>你为什么如此不人性, house?
<18-1,Jack>Why do you want so bad not to be human,house?

473
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,690
<21-10,House>噢, 他醒着
<21-10,House>Oh,he's awake.

474
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,320
<18-2,Cameron>House, 得跟你谈谈
<18-2,Cameron>House,we need to talk to you.

475
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,300
<18-3,House>你怎知道我醒着?
<18-3,House>How the hell did you know i was awake?

476
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,420
<18-4,Jack>你睡着时鼻孔喷火
<18-4,Jack>Your nostrils flare when you sleep.

477
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,680
<18-5,House>不, 才没有
<18-5,House>No,they do not.

478
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,990
<18-6,Jack>好, 我说谎了
<18-6,Jack>Fine,I'm lying.

479
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,580
<18-7,House>检查都是阴性
<18-7,House>Test was negative.

480
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,230
<18-8,Cameron>你知道?
<18-8,Cameron>You knew?

481
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,260
<18-9,House>习惯的力量
<18-9,House>Force of habit.

482
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,140
<18-10,Foreman>未发现癌症
<18-10,Foreman>showed no cancer.

483
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,980
<18-10,Foreman>没道理他高烧到103度
<18-10,Foreman>No reason why he's got a fever of 103,

484
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,830
<18-10,Foreman>没道理他的舌头放不进嘴里
<18-10,Foreman>and no reason why his tongue won't fit in his mouth.

485
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,080
<18-11,Cameron>他做完手术. Chase 照看他
<18-11,Cameron>He's post-op.Chase is getting him up and around.

486
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,010
<19-1,Chase>你手术后起来动动很重要
<19-1,Chase>It's important that you're up asap after surgery.

487
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,050
<19-1,Chase>觉得你能小便？
<19-1,Chase>You think you can urinate?

488
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,350
<19-2,Vince>涨大了!
<19-2,Vince>It's getting bigger!

489
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,300
<19-2,Vince>什么, 你...
<19-2,Vince>What,you're...

490
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,830
<19-3,Chase>你勃起了?
<19-3,Chase>getting aroused?

491
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,700
<19-4,Vince>不! 不是那一部分
<19-4,Vince>No!Not that part.

492
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,060
<19-4,Vince>哦, 天, 很疼
<19-4,Vince>Oh,god,it hurts.

493
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,440
<19-4,Vince>停不下来
<19-4,Vince>It's not stopping.

494
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,380
<20-1,Chase>手术没有发现动脉破裂
<20-1,Chase>surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery.

495
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,900
<20-2,House>这么多血不会无缘无故
<20-2,House>The blood had to come from somewhere.

496
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,890
<20-2,House>你被喷了一身
<20-2,House>You took a shower in it.

497
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,380
<20-3,Chase>创伤?
<20-3,Chase>Trauma?

498
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,740
<20-4,House>你觉得有人溜进来踢他的蛋蛋
<20-4,House>You think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels?

499
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,540
<20-4,House>戳他的眼睛, 还吹大他的舌头?
<20-4,House>And poke out his eye,and swell up his tongue?

500
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,990
<20-4,House>继续骑
<20-4,House>Keep riding.

501
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,140
<20-4,House>我和理疗师打赌说我周五前能骑100公里
<20-4,House>I got a bet with my physio that I can do 100 klicks by friday.

502
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,590
<20-4,House>肾脏出血?
<20-4,House>What about blood from the kidneys?

503
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,130
<20-5,Cameron>血从肾脏进入膀胱, 然后流入尿道
<20-5,Cameron>Kidneys drain into the bladder,which drains into the ureter.

504
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,440
<20-5,Cameron>不可能灌到阴囊里
<20-5,Cameron>There's no way it would mess with the scrotum.

505
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,550
<20-5,Cameron>是啊
<20-5,Cameron>Yeah.

506
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,120
<20-6,House>基本人体构造
<20-6,House>Basic human anatomy.

507
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,850
<20-6,House>换言之, 我认为问题在别处
<20-6,House>Therefore,I think it's safe to assume that the problem lies elsewhere.

508
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,290
<20-6,House>这个病例反正也不符合常理
<20-6,House>But given that this case doesn't make any kind of sense whatsoever,

509
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,620
<20-6,House>也许应该怀疑他的基本构造
<20-6,House>maybe we should even question the basics.

510
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,030
<20-7,Chase>也许他不是人类
<20-7,Chase>Maybe he's not human.

511
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,640
<20-8,House>应该说解剖结构缺陷, 不过..,也不除他是非人
<20-8,House>an anatomical defect would seem more likely,but let's not rule that one out.

512
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,470
<20-9,Foreman>更合理的说法, 他是人
<20-9,Foreman>Even more likely,he is human,

513
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,900
<20-9,Foreman>解剖结构也正常, 但他有睾丸癌
<20-9,Foreman>his anatomy is where it's supposed to be,but he has testicular cancer.

514
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,630
<20-10,Cameron>检查过癌症
<20-10,Cameron>we tested for cancer.

515
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,490
<20-11,Foreman>我们检查了胸部的淋巴系统
<20-11,Foreman>we tested the lymph system in his chest.

516
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,700
<20-12,Chase>手术未发现增大
<20-12,Chase>surgeons found no growth.

517
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,640
<20-13,Foreman>手术人员并不会留意这些
<20-13,Foreman>surgeons were just trying to put everything back where it was.

518
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,160
<20-13,Foreman>他们不是每项都做
<20-13,Foreman>They weren't doing an inventory.

519
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,800
<21-1,Wilson>他走运了也说不定
<21-1,Wilson>May have been lucky.

520
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,460
<21-1,Wilson>如果不能早期发现睾丸癌, 会死人的
<21-1,Wilson>If you don't catch testicular cancer early,it kills.

521
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,290
<21-1,Wilson>可能侵蚀了某些血管
<21-1,Wilson>Probably eroded some vessel.

522
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,400
<21-2,House>是, 我知道
<21-2,House>Yeah,I know.

523
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,970
<21-2,House>问题是为何我没想到
<21-2,House>The question is why i didn't think of it.

524
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,110
<21-3,Wilson>眼球弹出是个奇怪的表征
<21-3,Wilson>Eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation.

525
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,690
<21-4,House>反之, 阴囊爆炸就...
<21-4,House>Sack blowing up,on the other hand...

526
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,850
<21-5,Wilson>如果都能自己想出来,你就不需要折磨团队了
<21-5,Wilson>if you could think of everything yourself,you wouldn't need a team to annoy.

527
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,990
<21-6,House>我没注意到基本的解剖
<21-6,House>I screwed up some basic anatomy.

528
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,190
<21-6,House>没有把睾丸爆炸和睾丸联系起来
<21-6,House>And I missed connecting a testicular explosion with a testicular problem.

529
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,440
<21-6,House>以前我不可能这样,都是cuddy乱搞我的大脑
<21-6,House>You think there's any way i would have done that before cuddy messed with my brain?

530
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,690
<21-7,Wilson>她只是在帮你, 而且奏效了
<21-7,Wilson>She was trying to help you,and it worked.

531
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,510
<21-8,House>是啊, 我跑的像一阵风
<21-8,House>Yeah,I can run like the wind,

532
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,900
<21-8,House>却失去了思考
<21-8,House>but I can't think.

533
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,780
<21-8,House>现在转行当运动员也太老了点
<21-8,House>And seeing as how i'm too old to become a professional athlete,

534
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,630
<21-8,House>好像是多年蓄意的恶作剧
<21-8,House>it looks to me as if she screwed me over big time.

535
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,460
<21-9,Wilson>你不想要健康的腿
<21-9,Wilson>You don't want a healthy leg.

536
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,100
<21-10,House>又来了
<21-10,House>Oh,here we go.

537
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,040
<21-11,Wilson>如果你生活美满, 身体健康
<21-11,Wilson>If you've got a good life,if you're healthy,

538
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,150
<21-11,Wilson>你就没借口愤世, 没借口憎恨生活
<21-11,Wilson>you've got no reason to bitch.No reason to hate life.

539
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,600
<21-12,House>逻辑有漏洞
<21-12,House>Here's the flaw in your argument.

540
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,700
<21-12,House>如果我享受憎恨生活,说明我不恨生活, 我享受生活
<21-12,House>If I enjoy hating life,I don't hate life.I enjoy it.

541
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,890
<21-12,House>你不能按正常逻辑
<21-12,House>I didn't say it was rational.

542
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,050
<21-13,Wilson>艾滋病测试的准确率为99%
<21-13,Wilson>Hiv testing is 99% accurate,

543
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,850
<21-13,Wilson>意思是有些人测试阳性
<21-13,Wilson>which means there are some people who test positive

544
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,390
<21-13,Wilson>在末日的恐惧中生活数月
<21-13,Wilson>who live with their own impending doom for months,

545
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,630
<21-13,Wilson>甚至数年, 然后发现自己没事
<21-13,Wilson>or years,before finding out everything's okay.

546
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,750
<21-13,Wilson>奇怪的是, 大多数人没有欣喜,甚至也不生气
<21-13,Wilson>Weirdly,most of them don't react with happiness.Or even anger.

547
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,590
<21-13,Wilson>他们只是沮丧
<21-13,Wilson>They get depressed.

548
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,820
<21-13,Wilson>并非他们想死
<21-13,Wilson>Not because they wanted to die,

549
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,600
<21-13,Wilson>而是他们已经根据疾病把自己归类
<21-13,Wilson>but because they've defined themselves by their disease.

550
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,510
<21-13,Wilson>突然, 用来归类的依据失效了
<21-13,Wilson>Suddenly,what made them them isn't real.

551
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,730
<21-14,House>我没把自己归为瘸子
<21-14,House>I don't define myself by my leg.

552
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,750
<21-15,Wilson>不, 你的归类更过分
<21-15,Wilson>No,you have taken it one step further.

553
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,630
<21-15,Wilson>你对待残疾的办法是
<21-15,Wilson>The only way you could come to terms with your disability

554
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,380
<21-15,Wilson>让它显得无足轻重
<21-15,Wilson>was to somehow make it mean nothing.

555
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,770
<21-15,Wilson>这样你就得重新归类
<21-15,Wilson>So you had to redefine everything.

556
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,360
<21-15,Wilson>你放弃了一切生理的-
<21-15,Wilson>You have dismissed anything physical.

557
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,940
<21-15,Wilson>只留下冰冷的, 可以计算的信息
<21-15,Wilson>Anything not coldly,calculatingly intellectual.

558
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,860
<21-16,House>为什么帮她说话?
<21-16,House>Why are you protecting her?

559
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,370
<21-17,Wilson>因为她没做错什么
<21-17,Wilson>Because she's done nothing wrong.

560
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,440
<21-18,House>你觉得她对我所做的没什么?
<21-18,House>You're completely comfortable with what she did to me?

561
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,070
<21-19,Wilson>是的
<21-19,Wilson>Yeah,I am.Yeah.

562
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,430
<21-20,House>你对道德抉择从不轻松
<21-20,House>You agonize over moral choices.

563
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,850
<21-18,House>你不会对任何东西无所谓
<21-18,House>You're not completely comfortable with anything

564
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,030
<21-20,House>除非你先考虑到方方面面
<21-20,House>until you've taken days to get your head around every possible side.

565
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,400
<21-20,House>我6小时前才发现她对我做的
<21-20,House>I've known what she did for six hours.

566
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,520
<21-20,House>你好像知道好几天了?
<21-20,House>How come you're acting like you've known for days?

567
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,990
<22-1,House>我得了什么?
<22-1,House>What do I have?

568
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,830
<22-2,Cuddy>你没病
<22-2,Cuddy>You're not sick.

569
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,970
<22-1,House>我得了什么?
<22-1,House>What do I have?

570
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,230
<22-4,Cuddy>你要冷静
<22-4,Cuddy>You need to calm down.

571
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,910
<22-5,House>我的大脑废了! 就是这样!
<22-5,House>I have my brain!And that's it!

572
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,090
<22-6,Wilson>我们试图帮你
<22-6,Wilson>We were trying to help you.

573
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,180
<22-7,House>没人"试图"捣乱, 直接动手即可
<22-7,House>Yeah,nobody tries to screw up!They just do.

574
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,770
<22-8,Cuddy>你失控了, 你在用吗啡--
<22-8,Cuddy>You were out of control.You were shooting morphine--

575
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,650
<22-9,House>我有能力帮助别人!
<22-9,House>I can make people better!

576
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,500
<22-9,House>你们俩决定用跑步能力来交换
<22-9,House>And you two decide to trade that for jogging shoots.

577
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,040
<22-10,Wilson>如果有副作用, 我们可以查个清楚--
<22-10,Wilson>If you're suffering from side effects,then we can look at that--

578
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,950
<22-11,House>你太注重肉体
<22-11,House>you value the physical so much.

579
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,090
<22-11,House>我们用简单易懂的语言
<22-11,House>Let me put this in terms you can understand.

580
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,990
<22-11,House>你真行
<22-11,House>You're unbelievable.

581
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,720
<22-12,Wilson>甚至在愤怒和恐惧的时候
<22-12,Wilson>Even when you're out of your mind with anger and fear,

582
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,050
<22-12,Wilson>还是有条有理
<22-12,Wilson>you still couch it in logical terms.

583
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,520
<22-14,Wilson>你产生幻觉?
<22-14,Wilson>Are you hallucinating?

584
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,850
<22-13,House>是的, 我有幻觉!
<22-13,House>Yeah,I'm hallucinating!

585
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,790
<22-14,Wilson>不, 我说现在
<22-14,Wilson>No,I mean right now.

586
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,060
<22-14,Wilson>你有幻觉?
<22-14,Wilson>Are you hallucinating?

587
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,420
<23-1,House>你怎么知道我...
<23-1,House>How did you know I was...

588
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,040
<23-2,Jack>你对我大叫大嚷
<23-2,Jack>you were yelling at me.

589
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,390
<23-2,Jack>你叫我wilson
<23-2,Jack>You were calling me wilson.

590
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,710
<23-3,House>没有
<23-3,House>No.

591
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,380
<23-4,Jack>你现在醒了, house.
<23-4,Jack>You're losing it,house.

592
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,820
<23-5,House>我从没叫过wilson名字
<23-5,House>I never call wilson by his name.

593
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,780
<23-6,Jack>噢, 是啊
<23-6,Jack>Oh,yeah,right.

594
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,210
<23-6,Jack>幻觉的人要告诉他的幻觉对象,发生了什么
<23-6,Jack>The hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened.

595
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,690
<23-7,House>你没出现在幻觉中, Wilson才是
<23-7,House>You're not the hallucinatee.Wilson was the hallucinatee.

596
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,590
<23-8,Jack>你这是不是有点避重就轻?
<23-8,Jack>You think maybe you're focusing on the wrong thing here?

597
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,530
<23-9,House>Cuddy的办公室
<23-9,House>Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.

598
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,540
<23-9,House>还有洗手间
<23-9,House>The bathroom was the hallucinatee.

599
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,870
<23-10,Jack>洗手间, 明白了
<23-10,Jack>Bathroom.It figures.

600
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,470
<23-11,House>明白什么?
<23-11,House>What figures?

601
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,040
<23-12,Jack>你尿床了
<23-12,Jack>You wet your bed.

602
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,790
<23-13,House>妈的
<23-13,House>Damn it.

603
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,240
<23-14,Cameron>测试阴性
<23-14,Cameron>Test was negative.

604
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,310
<23-15,House>不
<23-15,House>No.

605
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,300
<23-16,Foreman>Afp蛋白和β-HCG检查排除睾丸癌
<23-16,Foreman>Afp and beta hcg say no testicular cancer.

606
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,230
<23-17,House>从头来, 我们排除了每一种可能
<23-17,House>So,let's recap.We've just ruled out everything.

607
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,200
<23-17,House>不符合常理
<23-17,House>Which doesn't make sense.

608
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,750
<23-17,House>所以, 答案必然也不符合常理
<23-17,House>So the answer has to be something that doesn't make sense.

609
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,400
<23-17,House>做膀胱镜检查, 并且确保他是人类
<23-17,House>Do a cystoscopy. Make sure he's human.

610
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,860
<24-1,Chase>检查结果是否定的
<24-1,Chase>Test was negative.

611
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,460
<24-2,House>他不是人类?
<24-2,House>For him being human?

612
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,310
<24-3,Chase>各个部位都在正常的位置
<24-3,Chase>Everything was right where it's supposed to be.

613
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,220
<24-3,Chase>所有的通道都通向正常的位置
<24-3,Chase>All the tubes go where they're supposed to go.

614
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,750
<24-4,Foreman>最可能的是细菌性前列腺炎
<24-4,Foreman>Most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis.

615
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,510
<24-5,House>查查他父亲是不是弓着背
<24-5,House>Find out if his father hunche

616
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,410
<24-5,House>尿尿有麻烦?
<24-5,House>his father have trouble peeing?

617
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,950
<24-5,House>他父亲和亲生母亲上床?
<24-5,House>His father have sex with his own mother?

618
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,510
<24-5,House>任何一条被言中, 就可以假设你是对的
<24-5,House>If the answers to any of these questions is yes,assume you're right.

619
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,340
<24-5,House>如果都没有说中
<24-5,House>If the answers are no,

620
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,080
<24-5,House>还是假设你对,但要检查前列腺淋巴以防万一
<24-5,House>assume you're right,but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to be sure.

621
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,940
<24-5,House>可是...
<24-5,House>But...

622
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,290
<24-6,Cameron>那只能切开他的腹部
<24-6,Cameron>then we'd have to cut through his stomach.

623
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,220
<24-6,Cameron>明显他有出血的问题, 这种手术可能--
<24-6,Cameron>And since he's clearly got a bleeding problem,this kind of surgery might--

624
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,440
<24-7,Foreman>他不是"明显"有问题
<24-7,Foreman>he doesn't clearly have anything.

625
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,160
<24-8,House>我怎么到这里的?
<24-8,House>How did I get here?

626
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,140
<24-9,Chase>你说什么?
<24-9,Chase>What are you talking about?

627
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,300
<24-10,House>我起先在icu.
<24-10,House>I was in the icu.

628
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,040
<24-10,House>然后就和你们一起下楼梯
<24-10,House>And then I was coming down these stairs with you guys.

629
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,410
<24-10,House>中间发生了什么?
<24-10,House>What happened in between?

630
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,350
<24-10,House>我不记得怎么到这里
<24-10,House>I don't remember how I got here.

631
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,970
<25-1,House>我不能继续跟病例
<25-1,House>I'm taking myself off my case.

632
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,090
<25-2,Cuddy>你的病人在深度监护, 连续两天发烧--
<25-2,Cuddy>Your patient's in critical care.He's had a fever unabated for two--

633
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,310
<25-3,House>我变的糊涂
<25-3,House>I'm losing my mind.

634
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,990
<25-3,House>有时头昏
<25-3,House>I'm having blackouts.

635
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,940
<25-4,Cuddy>你说了没有--
<25-4,Cuddy>You said you weren't having any--

636
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,210
<25-5,House>我撒谎了
<25-5,House>I lied.

637
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,150
<25-6,Cuddy>如果你想这样来吓唬我, 你得逞了
<25-6,Cuddy>If you are doing this to scare me,you made your point.

638
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,060
<25-6,Cuddy>下次你被枪打, 我保证只管治枪伤
<25-6,Cuddy>Next time you get shot,I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.

639
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,440
<25-6,Cuddy>我放弃病例
<25-6,Cuddy>I'm off the case.

640
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,490
<25-7,House>我进来的时候为什么跳起来?
<25-7,House>Why did you jump up when I came in?

641
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,390
<25-8,Cuddy>我以为你又来找我麻烦
<25-8,Cuddy>I thought you were going to attack me again.

642
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,630
<25-9,House>又来?
<25-9,House>Again?

643
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,640
<25-10,Cuddy>是, 你对我破口大骂
<25-10,Cuddy>Yeah,you were in my face.

644
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,260
<25-10,Cuddy>- 你还--,- 不, 我没有
<25-10,Cuddy>You were-- --no,I wasn'T.

645
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,900
<25-12,Cuddy>你和Wilson一起进来--
<25-12,Cuddy>You came in here with wilson and--

646
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,080
<25-13,House>那是幻觉
<25-13,House>that was a hallucination.

647
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,320
<25-14,Cuddy>不, 你--
<25-14,Cuddy>No,you--

648
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,740
<25-15,House>说明这也是幻觉
<25-15,House>which means this is a hallucination.

649
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,550
<25-15,House>怎样才能分辨是不是真实的?
<25-15,House>how can I tell what's real and what's not?

650
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,070
<26-1,House>看上去都一样
<26-1,House>Everything looks the same.

651
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,090
<26-1,House>听起来一样
<26-1,House>Sounds the same.

652
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,940
<26-1,House>尝起来也一样
<26-1,House>Tastes the same.

653
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,630
<26-2,Jack>看来你根本不想问我
<26-2,Jack>Seems like I'd be the last person you'd want to ask.

654
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,140
<26-3,House>当然不想
<26-3,House>Why not?

655
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,020
<26-3,House>明显你不在这里
<26-3,House>You're obviously not here.

656
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,760
<26-3,House>我也不在这里
<26-3,House>I'm obviously not here.

657
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,660
<26-3,House>这些都是我头脑里的
<26-3,House>Which means this is a creation of my mind,

658
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,900
<26-3,House>所以我其实在自问自答
<26-3,House>which means I'm really just asking myself.

659
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,900
<26-4,Jack>如果你是在跟自己说话,那些解释都不必要
<26-4,Jack>Well,if you're talking to yourself,that's a lot of unnecessary explanation.

660
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,950
<26-5,House>嘿, 我是想搞清楚
<26-5,House>Hey,I'm trying to work this out.

661
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
<26-5,House>有予有求才行, 即使在我脑子里
<26-5,House>That requires give and take,even in my own mind.

662
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,800
<26-6,Jack>有什么问题?
<26-6,Jack>What was the question?

663
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,300
<26-7,House>怎样才能分辨是不是真的?
<26-7,House>How can I tell what's real?

664
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,000
<26-8,Jack>有所谓吗?
<26-8,Jack>Does it matter?

665
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,550
<26-9,House>我没问这个问题
<26-9,House>That doesn't sound like something I'd ask.

666
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,270
<26-9,House>好吧
<26-9,House>All right.

667
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,800
<26-10,Jack>你担心的是在真实的世界里,根据不真实的信息行动
<26-10,Jack>Your concern is at if you act in the real world based on information that's not real,

668
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,890
<26-10,Jack>造成后果的不可预料
<26-10,Jack>the results are impossible to foresee.

669
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,840
<26-11,House>你不就是
<26-11,House>With you so far.

670
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,410
<26-12,Jack>但是信息本身并非有害
<26-12,Jack>But information is incapable of harm in and of itself.

671
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,300
<26-12,Jack>不管一个念头是好是坏
<26-12,Jack>Ideas are neither good nor bad,

672
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,180
<26-12,Jack>只有当我们实施才有用
<26-12,Jack>but merely as useful as what we do with them.

673
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,440
<26-12,Jack>只有行动能造成伤害
<26-12,Jack>Only actions can cause harm.

674
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,890
<26-13,House>这像我说的话
<26-13,House>That sounds like me.

675
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,580
<26-14,Jack>所以你不要做任何事
<26-14,Jack>So you do nothing.

676
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,550
<26-14,Jack>控制自己不要行动
<26-14,Jack>You refrain from taking any actions.

677
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,400
<26-14,Jack>继续像往常一样冒出主意
<26-14,Jack>Continue to throw out your ideas as you always would,

678
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,790
<26-14,Jack>如果这些主意是基于错误前提
<26-14,Jack>but if they're based on faulty assumptions,

679
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,240
<26-14,Jack>你的团队会指正你
<26-14,Jack>your team will point that out.

680
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,990
<26-14,Jack>不会对他们造成伤害
<26-14,Jack>They won't do anything that could hurt him.

681
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,640
<26-15,House>所以我要信任团队
<26-15,House>So I trust my team.

682
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,570
<27-1,Chase>检查都是否定的
<27-1,Chase>Test was negative.

683
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,850
<27-2,Cameron>前列腺没有出血
<27-2,Cameron>No blood in the prostate.

684
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,410
<27-3,Foreman>没有构造异常
<27-3,Foreman>No structural abnormalities.

685
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,570
<27-3,Foreman>如果某事无法解释
<27-3,Foreman>If something doesn't make sense,

686
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,560
<27-4,House>这表示什么?
<27-4,House>what does that mean?

687
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,030
<27-4,House>不是玩修辞
<27-4,House>It's not rhetorical.

688
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,690
<27-4,House>我需要你们回答我的问题,不管它多么的明显
<27-4,House>I need your input on everything I ask,no matter how obvious it might seem.

689
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,510
<27-5,Foreman>表示你错了
<27-5,Foreman>It means you're wrong.

690
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,720
<27-6,House>表示你的前提假设是错的
<27-6,House>It means one of your assumptions is wrong.

691
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,740
<27-6,House>因为如果某事无法解释, 它就不是真实的
<27-6,House>Because if something doesn't make sense,it can't be real.

692
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,300
<27-6,House>我们的前提条件是?
<27-6,House>So,what are our assumptions?

693
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,610
<27-7,Foreman>我们没有前提, 只是猜测然后检查
<27-7,Foreman>We don't have any.We're just guessing on testing.

694
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,130
<27-8,Cameron>我们假设检查结果都是正确的
<27-8,Cameron>We assume the tests are right.

695
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,700
<27-9,Chase>我们重新检查了两次
<27-9,Chase>We've already redone them.

696
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,330
<27-10,House>从更基本的地方考虑
<27-10,House>Twice.Let's go more basic.

697
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,390
<27-11,Foreman>有什么比检查结果还要基本的?
<27-11,Foreman>What's more basic than the test results?

698
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,900
<27-12,House>检查本身
<27-12,House>The tests themselves.

699
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,210
<27-12,House>活组织切片检查包括那些环节?
<27-12,House>What does a biopsy consist of?

700
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,340
<27-13,Chase>取样
<27-13,Chase>You take a sample.

701
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,060
<27-14,House>什么叫样本?
<27-14,House>Define sample.

702
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,090
<27-15,Chase>你认为有问题部位的一小片代表性组织
<27-15,Chase>It's a small representative piece of whatever you think is the problem.

703
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,610
<27-16,House>走到岸边, 舀一杯水
<27-16,House>you go down to the shore,you fill a cup of water.

704
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,900
<27-16,House>杯子里没有鱼
<27-16,House>It's got no fish in it.

705
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,180
<27-16,House>难道可以证明海里没有鱼?
<27-16,House>Does that mean no fish in the ocean?

706
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,520
<27-17,Cameron>我们可以再做一次检查
<27-17,Cameron>We can do another biopsy.

707
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,310
<27-18,House>那样我们只会舀起另一杯水,我们需要潜到海底
<27-18,House>We could fill another cup of water.We gotta dive in.

708
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,720
<27-18,House>我们必须找到里面到底有什么
<27-18,House>We gotta see what's actually in there.

709
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,620
<27-20,Foreman>不能动手术, 他有出血问题
<27-20,Foreman>We can't operate.He's got a bleeding problem.

710
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,260
<27-20,Foreman>我们假设他有出血问题
<27-20,Foreman>We assume he's got a bleeding problem.

711
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,870
<27-21,Chase>因为他从不该出血的地方出血
<27-21,Chase>Yeah,because he bled from where he wasn't supposed to bleed,

712
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,960
<27-21,Chase>导致身体的一部分爆裂
<27-21,Chase>causing parts of his body to blow up.

713
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,160
<27-21,Chase>如果我们这个假设是正确的
<27-21,Chase>Assuming that crazy assumption is correct,

714
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,140
<27-21,Chase>动手术等于杀死他
<27-21,Chase>if we operate on him,we'll kill him.

715
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,840
<27-22,House>那如果我们能找到一个办法
<27-22,House>What if we could find a way to do this surgery

716
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,190
<27-22,House>可以只开一个小口?
<27-22,House>without giving him more than a paper cut?

717
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:18,320
<28-1,Vince>你们想让机器人给我做手术?
<28-1,Vince>You want to let a robot operate on me?

718
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,240
<28-2,Cameron>科技发展很快
<28-2,Cameron>The technology is amazing.

719
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,590
<28-2,Cameron>机器能放大十倍, 那就是十倍的精确
<28-2,Cameron>It magnifies everything ten times.It's ten times the accuracy.

720
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,730
<28-3,Vince>不行, 我更信任人
<28-3,Vince>No way.I want a person.

721
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,140
<28-4,Cameron>会有人来操纵...
<28-4,Cameron>A person will be controlling--

722
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,820
<28-5,House>人类靠不住
<28-5,House>people suck.

723
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,070
<28-5,House>是人使你从一个大舌头变得
<28-5,House>People have turned you from a guy with a swollen tongue

724
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,380
<28-5,House>一只眼, 一个蛋蛋,还有一张打满纱布的脸
<28-5,House>into a guy with one eye,one ball,and a stapled-on face.

725
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,470
<28-5,House>如果你希望有人在你哭泣入眠时抱着你
<28-5,House>If you want someone to hold you while you cry yourself to sleep at night,

726
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,490
<28-5,House>找个暖和一点, 温柔一点的
<28-5,House>choose warm and soft.

727
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,360
<28-5,House>如果要人给你作首诗
<28-5,House>If you want someone to write you a poem,

728
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,450
<28-5,House>找个更为敏感的独行者
<28-5,House>pick the sensitive loner.

729
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,470
<28-5,House>如果想找个能做好事的
<28-5,House>But if all you care about is that something's done right,

730
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,960
<28-5,House>请找铁头人
<28-5,House>pick the guy with the metal head.

731
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,910
<28-6,Vince>没门
<28-6,Vince>No way.

732
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,210
<28-7,House>你说没门也不行
<28-7,House>No way,no way.

733
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,130
<28-7,House>在你说没门前你得看看,它是怎么工作的, 来吧
<28-7,House>You gotta see this thing in action before you say no way.Come on.

734
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,500
<28-8,Cameron>House, 你想干嘛?
<28-8,Cameron>House.What are you doing?

735
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,860
<28-8,Cameron>没想干嘛
<28-8,Cameron>Nothing.

736
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,770
<28-9,House>我不会做任何事情
<28-9,House>I'm not doing anything.

737
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,560
<28-9,House>只是发表看法
<28-9,House>Just throwing out ideas.

738
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,780
<28-9,House>我想你该找个轮椅, 把他推到手术室去
<28-9,House>I think you should put him in a wheelchair,take him down to the O.R.

739
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,840
<28-9,House>可能我是有点疯了
<28-9,House>But I may be out of my mind.

740
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,900
<28-9,House>放松, Cameron
<28-9,House>Relax,cameron.

741
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,040
<28-9,House>我不会伤到你的
<28-9,House>I'm not going to cut you.

742
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,150
<29-1,House>只是想演示下它的能力
<29-1,House>I just want to show what this puppy can do.

743
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,410
<29-1,House>它可以切开只有一毫米的口子
<29-1,House>It can make one-millimeter incisions.

744
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,380
<29-1,House>你知道这有多小么?
<29-1,House>You know how small that is?

745
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,790
<29-1,House>在米制单位里已经很小了
<29-1,House>It's small even in metric.

746
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,660
<29-1,House>如果我做了什么奇怪的事
<29-1,House>If I do something that doesn't make sense,

747
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,510
<29-1,House>对你做了的话, 阻止我
<29-1,House>even to you,stop me.

748
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,610
<29-1,House>很精巧, 不是么?
<29-1,House>Delicate,no?

749
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,460
<29-2,Cameron>House.
<29-2,Cameron>House

750
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,940
<29-3,House>痛吗?
<29-3,House>Does that hurt?

751
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,370
<29-3,House>看够了没?
<29-3,House>Seen enough?

752
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,470
<29-4,Vince>还没
<29-4,Vince>No.

753
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,760
<29-5,House>这可不是个问句
<29-5,House>That wasn't a question.

754
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,470
<29-5,House>你要么做手术, 要么去死
<29-5,House>You either do this,or you die.

755
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,570
<30-1,Jack>你浪费了你的生命
<30-1,Jack>You've wasted your life.

756
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,040
<30-1,Jack>没错
<30-1,Jack>Yeah.

757
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:53,620
<30-2,House>我应该多花点时间去找个值得射杀的人
<30-2,House>If only I'd spent more time dedicating myself to finding someone worthy to shoot.

758
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,530
<30-3,Jack>如果我那时杀了你, 也不在乎么?
<30-3,Jack>If I had killed you,would it have mattered?

759
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,800
<30-4,House>对我来说, 不
<30-4,House>Not to me.

760
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,020
<30-4,House>有笔么?
<30-4,House>Have you got a pen?

761
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,500
<30-5,Jack>你不在乎生死?
<30-5,Jack>You don't care if you live or die?

762
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,680
<30-6,House>我还活着所以在乎
<30-6,House>I care because I live.

763
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,800
<30-6,House>我死了想在乎也不可能了
<30-6,House>I can't care if I'm dead.

764
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,040
<30-7,Jack>我不想和你玩文字游戏
<30-7,Jack>I don't want to hear semantics.

765
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,090
<30-8,House>你这个不懂语义学的混蛋
<30-8,House>You anti-semantic bastard.

766
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,560
<30-9,Jack>如果世界没有了你这种智慧,会有人在乎么?
<30-9,Jack>Would anybody care that the world lost that wit?

767
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,660
<30-10,House>我正忙着呢
<30-10,House>Working here.

768
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,640
<30-11,Jack>没关系, 你什么也不用说
<30-11,Jack>That's all right.You don't have to say anything.

769
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,000
<30-11,Jack>让我进入你的潜意识
<30-11,Jack>Just let me soak into your subconscious.

770
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,870
<30-11,Jack>你认为唯一有意义的真理是
<30-11,Jack>You think that the only truth that matters

771
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,160
<30-11,Jack>那些可以衡量的真理
<30-11,Jack>is the truth that can be measured.

772
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,380
<30-11,Jack>好意可不算
<30-11,Jack>Good intentions don't count.

773
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,710
<30-11,Jack>心里想的不算
<30-11,Jack>What's in your heart doesn't count.

774
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,040
<30-11,Jack>关爱也不算
<30-11,Jack>Caring doesn't count.

775
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,850
<30-11,Jack>但是一个男人一生的价值可以用
<30-11,Jack>But a man's life can be measured

776
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,760
<30-11,Jack>他死时有多少人落泪来衡量
<30-11,Jack>by how many tears are shed when he dies.

777
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,320
<30-11,Jack>只是因为你不能衡量它们
<30-11,Jack>Just because you can't measure them,

778
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,790
<30-11,Jack>只是因为你不想衡量它们
<30-11,Jack>just because you don't want to measure them,

779
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,680
<30-11,Jack>并不代表那不存在
<30-11,Jack>doesn't mean it's not real.

780
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,630
<30-12,House>这解释不通
<30-12,House>That does not make sense.

781
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,430
<30-13,Jack>即是我是错的
<30-13,Jack>And even if I'm wrong,

782
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,350
<30-13,Jack>你还是那么痛苦
<30-13,Jack>you're still miserable.

783
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,110
<30-13,Jack>你真的认为生命的目的
<30-13,Jack>Did you really think that your life's purpose

784
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,230
<30-13,Jack>是牺牲自己而不求回报
<30-13,Jack>was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return?

785
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,070
<30-13,Jack>这不对
<30-13,Jack>No.

786
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:21,460
<30-13,Jack>你相信做任何事情都不该有目的
<30-13,Jack>You believe there's no purpose to anything.

787
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,270
<30-13,Jack>包括你拯救的生命, 以及不能拯救的
<30-13,Jack>Even the lives you save,you dismiss.

788
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:33,260
<30-13,Jack>你做了件高尚的事, 可你贬低它,说没有任何意义
<30-13,Jack>You turn the one decent thing in your life,and you taint it,strip it of all meaning.

789
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,800
<30-13,Jack>你只是徒然地痛苦
<30-13,Jack>You're miserable for nothing.

790
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,240
<30-13,Jack>我不知道你为什么还想活着
<30-13,Jack>I don't know why you'd want to live.

791
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,940
<30-14,House>我很抱歉
<30-14,House>I'm sorry.

792
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,900
<30-14,House>我知道问题在哪了
<30-14,House>I know what's wrong.

793
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,790
<31-1,Cameron>House, 快出去, 你没有消过毒
<31-1,Cameron>House,get out of here.You're not sterile.

794
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,280
<31-2,House>他会好起来的
<31-2,House>He'll be fine.

795
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,500
<31-3,Chase>太好了
<31-3,Chase>great.

796
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,770
<31-3,Chase>他得了什么病?
<31-3,Chase>What's he got?

797
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,300
<31-4,House>为什么你们从来没试着,让我不接手这个病例?
<31-4,House>How come you guys have never tried to yank me off this case?

798
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,220
<31-4,House>我一直存在幻觉
<31-4,House>I'm having hallucinations.

799
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,130
<31-4,House>思维空白
<31-4,House>Blackouts.

800
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,170
<31-5,Foreman>你总有点疯狂, 但你总是对的
<31-5,Foreman>But you're always insane,and you're always right.

801
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,030
<31-6,House>我总是到最后才是正确的
<31-6,House>I'm almost always eventually right.

802
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,830
<31-6,House>你不可能知道什么时候是"最后"
<31-6,House>You have no way of knowing when "eventually" is.

803
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,370
<31-6,House>每次我有什么想法了
<31-6,House>Every time I've had an epiphany on this one,

804
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,470
<31-6,House>你们唯命是从
<31-6,House>you guys were right on board.

805
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,630
<31-6,House>不挑战我的观点, 也不做任何辩解
<31-6,House>No challenges,no need to explain.

806
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,510
<31-6,House>没什么恶意, 但是
<31-6,House>No offense,but

807
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,170
<31-6,House>要么你们越来越聪明了,要么就是我越来越笨了
<31-6,House>either you guys are getting smarter,or I'm getting dumber.

808
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,110
<31-7,Chase>我们和你工作那么久了, 知道...
<31-7,Chase>We've worked with you long enough to know--

809
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,850
<31-8,House>我在你们进门前就知道检查结果了
<31-8,House>I know the test results even before you enter the room.

810
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,220
<31-8,House>我们存在一样的意识
<31-8,House>We have identical knowledge.

811
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,970
<31-8,House>这怎么可能?
<31-8,House>How is that possible?

812
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,830
<31-9,Cameron>你错了
<31-9,Cameron>You're wrong.

813
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,670
<31-10,House>如果有什么事情说不通
<31-10,House>If something doesn't make sense,

814
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,060
<31-10,House>一定是你们的某个假设错了
<31-10,House>one of your assumptions has to be wrong.

815
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,140
<31-10,House>因为如果解释不通, 现实中就不可能发生
<31-10,House>Because if something doesn't make sense,it can't be real.

816
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,860
<31-10,House>如果假设这并不是现实, 会怎样?
<31-10,House>But what if the faulty assumption is that it's real?

817
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,800
<31-11,Foreman>House, 你有点迷糊了
<31-11,Foreman>House,you're losing it.

818
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,570
<31-12,House>我早迷糊了
<31-12,House>I've lost it.

819
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,790
<31-12,House>为什么阻止我?
<31-12,House>Why did you stop me?

820
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,420
<31-13,Chase>因为我觉得你要杀了他
<31-13,Chase>Because I think you're going to kill him.

821
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,700
<31-13,Chase>不, 你不是觉得
<31-13,Chase>No,you don't think that.

822
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,800
<31-14,House>而是知道我要这么做
<31-14,House>You know it.

823
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,330
<31-14,House>因为你存在于我的思维中
<31-14,House>Because you're in my head.

824
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,760
<31-14,House>只要错觉有合理的解释,我就不会醒来
<31-14,House>As long as the delusion makes sense,my mind lets it go on.

825
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,760
<31-14,House>我必须要让一切没法解释
<31-14,House>I have to make it not make sense.I have to...

826
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,480
<31-14,House>使这些不再能欺骗我的大脑
<31-14,House>push it past the point where it can trick my mind.

827
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,190
<31-15,Foreman>喂, 喂
<31-15,Foreman>Hey,hey.

828
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,440
<31-15,Foreman>如果这是个噩梦的话, 你会醒过来
<31-15,Foreman>If this is a nightmare,you're gonna wake up.

829
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,190
<31-15,Foreman>如果是现实, 你可是在杀人
<31-15,Foreman>If it's real,you're killing a man.

830
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,510
<31-16,House>还有一种可能是我已经死了
<31-16,House>It's also possible that I may already be dead.

831
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,620
<31-16,House>但我不相信死后有什么灵魂
<31-16,House>But I don't believe in the after life.

832
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,660
<31-17,Cameron>House, 回到病房去
<31-17,Cameron>House,go back to your room.

833
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,610
<31-17,Cameron>如果这是幻觉, 也挺好的
<31-17,Cameron>If this is a hallucination,it's a good one.

834
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,100
<31-17,Cameron>你能感受到疼痛, 你能走路...
<31-17,Cameron>You're pain free,you can walk--

835
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,630
<31-17,Cameron>这不是真实的, 所以, 这些都没什么意义
<31-17,Cameron>it's not real.Therefore,it's meaningless.

836
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,490
<31-18,House>我需要有意义的东西
<31-18,House>I want meaning.

837
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,370
<31-18,House>我的上帝
<31-18,House>Oh,god.

838
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,960
<31-18,House>再见
<31-18,House>Goodbye.

839
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,020
<32-1,Foreman>- 他中枪了,- 两发
<32-1,Foreman>he was shot.--Twice.

840
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,020
<32-3,Chase>腹部一枪, 脖子一枪
<32-3,Chase>Once in the abdomen,once in the neck.

841
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,750
<32-4,House>-嗨,-没事的
<32-4,House>Hello.--It's going to be okay.

842
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,280
<32-5,Cameron>你会没事的
<32-5,Cameron>You're gonna be okay.

843
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,340
<32-5,Cameron>你什么都不知道
<32-5,Cameron>You don't know nothing.

844
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,800
<32-6,House>告诉Cuddy
<32-6,House>Tell cuddy...

845
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,300
<32-6,House>给我用K他命
<32-6,House>I want ketamine.
