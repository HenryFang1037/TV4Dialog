00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,620
<3-12,Cameron>对不起 来一下
<3-12,Cameron>Sorry.Need you.

117
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,070
<3-13,Arlene>谢谢
<3-13,Arlene>Thank you.

118
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,480
<3-14,Cameron>我们在做脑电图,插导电针的时候出了状况
<3-14,Cameron>We were doing the emg,but we never got past the insertionof the conduction pin.

119
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,340
<3-14,Cameron>她刚才说谢谢?
<3-14,Cameron>Did she just say"thank you"?

120
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,920
<3-15,House>我借钱给她 哪里出错了?
<3-15,House>I loaned her some money.What went wrong?

121
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,300
<3-16,Cameron>没出错
<3-16,Cameron>Nothing went wrong.

122
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,310
<3-17,House>如果没出错 就应该做对
<3-17,House>If nothing went wrong,then something went right.

123
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,090
<3-18,Cameron>你不说她为什么感谢你?
<3-18,Cameron>You're not gonna tell mewhy she thanked you?

124
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,510
<3-19,House>你不说做对了什么?
<3-19,House>You're not gonna tell mewhat went right?

125
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,350
<3-20,Cameron>你为她做了些事 她感谢你,这让你...
<3-20,Cameron>You did somethingfor which she is grateful, and you're...

126
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,340
<3-20,Cameron>窘迫?
<3-20,Cameron>embarrassed?

127
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,260
<3-20,Cameron>因为你
<3-20,Cameron>For you.

128
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,930
<3-21,House>她看你走上来 以为你是个14岁小男生,我纠正了她
<3-21,House>She saw you coming up, thought you werea 14-year-old boy.I set her straight.

129
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,480
<3-21,House>我不告诉你出了什么问题,或做对了什么
<3-21,House>I am not telling youwhat went wrong.Or right.

130
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,110
<3-22,Cameron>除非你告诉我她为什么谢你
<3-22,Cameron>Until you tell mewhy she said thank you.

131
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,400
<3-22,Cameron>抓住我弱点了
<3-22,Cameron>Oh, you've got me.

132
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,530
<3-23,House>你知道我很想知道 我一定认输
<3-23,House>You know I need to know.I am so gonna fold.

133
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,080
<3-23,House>但你不知道我还有一招
<3-23,House>Except you're forgettingthere's one thing I can do now.

134
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,330
<4-1,Foreman>这个 或者是神经反射的问题
<4-1,Foreman>It's either thator a reflex response or--

135
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,690
<4-2,House>怎么了?
<4-2,House>what happened?

136
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,790
<4-2,House>好吧
<4-2,House>Okay.

137
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,050
<4-3,Foreman>这是House医生
<4-3,Foreman>This is dr.House.

138
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,690
<4-3,Foreman>- House 这位是Caren,- 荣幸之至 怎么了?
<4-3,Foreman>-House, this is caren.-Pleasure's all mine.What happened?

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,500
<4-5,Chase>当我们插入导电针 她抖动了
<4-5,Chase>When we insertedthe conduction pin,she flinched.

140
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,660
<4-6,House>她动了! 听见了?
<4-6,House>She flinched!Did you hear?

141
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,850
<4-7,Caren>是不是意味着好转了
<4-7,Caren>Does that mean I'm getting better?

142
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,110
<4-8,House>抖了多大一下
<4-8,House>How big is a flinch?

143
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,450
<4-8,House>比抽动大 比痉挛小?
<4-8,House>Bigger than a twitch?Smaller than a spasm?

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,110
<4-8,House>你抽烟吗?
<4-8,House>You smoke?

145
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,580
<4-9,Caren>应酬型的 抽的不多
<4-9,Caren>Socially.Not a lot.

146
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,260
<4-10,House>你做瑜珈 还抽烟?
<4-10,House>You do yogaand you smoke?

147
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,690
<4-11,Caren>我知道 我是两面人
<4-11,Caren>I know.It's hypocritical.

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,360
<4-12,House>没关系 大家都在看你的腿
<4-12,House>Not at all.The world sees your legs.

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,450
<4-12,House>没人检查你的肺
<4-12,House>No one's checking out your lungs.

150
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,600
<4-13,Cameron>- 吸烟怎么会导致...- 不会
<4-13,Cameron>-How would smoking--,-it wouldn'T.

151
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,910
<4-14,House>我只是找火机
<4-14,House>I just needed a lighter.

152
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,020
<4-15,Cameron>House!
<4-15,Cameron>House!

153
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,120
<4-16,Caren>我的天
<4-16,Caren>Oh, my god!

154
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,840
<4-17,House>症状很像那么回事
<4-17,House>The case was lookingso promising.

155
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,990
<4-18,Caren>我不是假装的
<4-18,Caren>Hey, I'm not faking.

156
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,290
<4-19,House>你动了 说明你没瘫
<4-19,House>You moved.Therefore, you can move.

157
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,290
<4-19,House>趁早把这个疯子弄出去吧
<4-19,House>Get this lunaticout of here before she bores again.

158
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,420
<4-20,Caren>我不是假装的
<4-20,Caren>I'm not faking!

159
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,390
<4-21,Wilson>我听说你刚才跟病人家属一起看手术
<4-21,Wilson>I heard youwere watching surgery with a patient's family.

160
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,640
<4-21,Wilson>还跟病人家属谈话了
<4-21,Wilson>Talking to a patient's family.

161
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,210
<4-21,Wilson>是你的幻觉影响了你吧?,被枪击后的阴影
<4-21,Wilson>It's because of yourhallucination, isn't it?After you were shot.

162
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,790
<4-21,Wilson>你重新选择生活 选你想要的生活
<4-21,Wilson>You chose life.You decidedyou wanted meaning.

163
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,280
<4-21,Wilson>所以你挑了个没什么挑战性的病例
<4-21,Wilson>So you took a casewith no mystery.

164
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,570
<4-21,Wilson>任何医生都会治的那种
<4-21,Wilson>Something any doctor could do.

165
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:38,880
<4-21,Wilson>除了可以治好那个病人,这病例并没有什么突破性
<4-21,Wilson>A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helpinganother human being.

166
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,060
<4-22,House>她感谢我
<4-22,House>She thanked me.

167
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,430
<4-23,Wilson>但是 你感觉不到什么
<4-23,Wilson>And...you felt nothing.

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,430
<4-24,House>我也不知道应该有什么感觉
<4-24,House>I wasn't even surewhat I was supposed to feel.

169
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,830
<4-25,Wilson>这就跟你的腿一样 它萎缩了
<4-25,Wilson>It's like your leg.It's atrophied.

170
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,360
<4-25,Wilson>多试几次 感觉就回找回来的
<4-25,Wilson>Keep working it.The feeling will come.

171
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,400
<4-26,Cameron>不好意思
<4-26,Cameron>Sorry.

172
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,850
<4-26,Cameron>还是要你来
<4-26,Cameron>Need you.Again.

173
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,080
<4-27,House>我说了赶她走
<4-27,House>I told youto get rid of her.

174
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,780
<4-28,Cameron>还好没赶走 她胸部受到压迫
<4-28,Cameron>It's a good thing we didn'T.Tightness in her chest.

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
<4-28,Cameron>呼吸困难 可能有胸膜渗出液
<4-28,Cameron>She can't breathe.It could bea pleural effusion.

176
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,390
<4-28,Cameron>恩
<4-28,Cameron>Right.

177
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,340
<4-29,House>不然的话她就是故意像小朋友一样屏气
<4-29,House>Either thator she's holding her breath like a four-year-old.

178
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,440
<4-25,Wilson>放松点
<4-25,Wilson>RelaX.

179
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,280
<4-26,Cameron>我不会再烧你了
<4-26,Cameron>I'm not gonnaburn you again.

180
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,510
<5-1,House>我要戳你!
<5-1,House>I'm going to stab you!

181
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,890
<5-1,House>听着 如果你不是假装的话,就是有胸膜渗出液了
<5-1,House>Look, either you're faking or you've gota pleural effusion.

182
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,480
<5-1,House>是由肺周围的体液形成的 这很严重
<5-1,House>That's a buildup of fluidaround the lungs,which is very serious,

183
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,910
<5-1,House>我只能用这个针头戳进你的背,把它们吸出来
<5-1,House>and I'd have no choice but to stab you in the backwith this needle and suck all the fluidout of you.

184
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,910
<5-2,Cameron>-所以,- 应该做局麻
<5-2,Cameron>-So.-we should give her a local.

185
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,850
<5-3,House>那跟我恶劣的形象就不相符了
<5-3,House>That would defeat the pointof me being nasty.

186
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,550
<5-3,House>准备好了?
<5-3,House>Ready?

187
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,730
<5-4,Foreman>-躺下,-她躺下就不能呼吸了
<5-4,Foreman>-Down.-She can't breathe if she's down.

188
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,680
<5-4,Foreman>-躺下,-她不能...
<5-4,Foreman>-Down.-She can't--

189
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,460
<5-7,House>快 快 快!让她躺下!
<5-7,House>down, down, down!Come on!

190
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,070
<5-8,Foreman>那不是胸膜渗出液
<5-8,Foreman>That's nota pleural effusion.

191
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,300
<5-9,Cameron>是她心脏有问题
<5-9,Cameron>The problem's in her heart.

192
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,260
<5-10,House>这是装不出来的
<5-10,House>Can't fake that.

193
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,470
<6-1,Chase>过去两小时我已经三次给她减压了
<6-1,Chase>I've had to relievethe pressure three times In the last two hours.

194
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,790
<6-1,Chase>要么我们就查清楚心脏周围出血的原因
<6-1,Chase>So either we figure out what's causing blood to build uparound her heart,

195
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,440
<6-1,Chase>要么我就拿着针头追着她整个下半辈子
<6-1,Chase>or I follow her aroundwith a needle for the rest of her life.

196
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,550
<6-2,Cameron>没有心脏杂音 也没有器质性病变
<6-2,Cameron>Echo was clean.No structural abnormalities.

197
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,800
<6-3,Foreman>可能是个感染的过程 比如结核
<6-3,Foreman>Could be aninfectious process, tb.

198
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,850
<6-4,Cameron>或者系统性血管炎 这可以解释渗出液
<6-4,Cameron>Or vasculitis would alsoplain the effusion.

199
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,540
<6-5,House>但是不能解释她双脚的瘫痪
<6-5,House>but not the paralysis.

200
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,930
<6-5,House>我们假设她不是装的
<6-5,House>Let's assumethat she wasn't faking it.

201
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,850
<6-6,Cameron>她动了 就是说 她可以活动
<6-6,Cameron>she moved.Therefore, she could move.

202
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,020
<6-6,Cameron>她没有瘫痪
<6-6,Cameron>She wasn't paralyzed.

203
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,230
<6-7,House>那不一定是装的 可能是一种错觉
<6-7,House>Doesn't mean she was faking.Could have been a delusion.

204
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,890
<6-7,House>也可能她是装的
<6-7,House>Either she was faking

205
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,540
<6-7,House>碰巧她有心脏病 在同一时间发作,或者仍然是错觉
<6-7,House>and coincidentallygot a real cardiac problem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion.

206
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,850
<6-7,House>这种瘫痪的假象是种神经学症状
<6-7,House>And the fake paralysisis a real neurological symptom.

207
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,970
<6-8,Foreman>你认为她脊柱里有血管瘤?
<6-8,Foreman>You thinking vascular tumorin her spine?

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,030
<6-9,Cameron>她的血小板数正常
<6-9,Cameron>Her platelets are normal.

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,140
<6-10,Chase>她全身上下都扫描过了 没发现什么
<6-10,Chase>And she's been scannedup and down.It was all clean.

210
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,520
<6-11,House>那就打开她身体去找
<6-11,House>So open her up and find it.

211
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,190
<6-12,Foreman>你想让我们做什么?
<6-12,Foreman>so what do you want us to do?

212
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,960
<6-12,Foreman>从颈部开始一节节脊椎找 直到发现异物?
<6-12,Foreman>Start at her neck and just keep cuttingdown her spine until we stumble on something?

213
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,490
<6-13,House>应该行得通的
<6-13,House>That should work.

214
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,640
<6-14,House>心率偏高
<6-14,House>His heart rate'sa little high.

215
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,660
<6-15,Arlene>很严重吗?
<6-15,Arlene>Should I be worried?

216
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,270
<6-16,House>可能他只是还没有从手术从恢复过来
<6-16,House>Probably just meanshe's still in discomfort from the surgery.

217
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,320
<6-16,House>我会调高他的吗啡用量
<6-16,House>I'm gonna up his morphinea little.

218
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,080
<6-17,Arlene>你对我们真好
<6-17,Arlene>You've been so nice to us.

219
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,980
<6-18,House>这是医生该做的
<6-18,House>That's the job.

220
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,360
<6-19,Arlene>不 我的意思是 其他的医生
<6-19,Arlene>No, I mean,all the other doctors,

221
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,550
<6-19,Arlene>他们只关心病情 治疗方案 损伤情况
<6-19,Arlene>all they did was obsess on the cancer, the treatment, the damage.

222
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,960
<6-19,Arlene>只是为了救他
<6-19,Arlene>Just trying to fix him.

223
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,760
<6-19,Arlene>你是第一个真正关心他的生命质量的医生
<6-19,Arlene>You're the first doctor that's ever given a damnabout the quality of his life.

224
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,440
<6-20,House>他的心率下来了
<6-20,House>His heart rate'scome down.

225
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,050
<6-20,House>吗啡起作用了 我做对了
<6-20,House>Morphine worked.I was right.

226
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,240
<6-21,Cameron>真是感人的一幕
<6-21,Cameron>What a touching moment.

227
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,260
<6-21,Cameron>这就是我们做医生的原因
<6-21,Cameron>That's whywe become doctors.

228
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,030
<6-21,Cameron>一个这样的场面就能让我们倍感温暖
<6-21,Cameron>One of those rare momentswhen our hearts are warmed--

229
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,260
<6-22,House>想喝点什么吗?
<6-22,House>would you liketo get a drink?

230

<9-9,House>那可不是一个性感的大脚趾
<9-9,House>That is not a sexy big toe.

<11-23,House>让他背朝下躺下
<11-23,House>Lay him back down.

345
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,840
<11-24,House>再做一次
<11-24,House>Do that again.

346
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,450
<11-24,House>发出那个声音
<11-24,House>Make that sound.

347
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,330
<11-25,Arlene>那是什么?

348
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,880
<11-24,House>那...

<11-26,House>是在说话
<11-26,House>was talking.

350
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,030
<11-27,House>你们这群无能的医生
<11-27,House>you guysare lousy doctors.

351
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,850
<11-27,House>一个个都忙着让病人好受点,却忘了查出到底是什么病因
<11-27,House>You're in such a rush to make the patient feel better, you forgot to checkwhat was wrong.

352
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,580
<11-28,Chase>瑜珈女孩2小时前走着离开医院,你治好了她
<11-28,Chase>Yoga girl walked out of heretwo hours ago.You fixed her.

353
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,360
<11-29,House>不是她 是别人
<11-29,House>Not her.The other guy.

354
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,060
<11-30,Cameron>他患了脑瘤 8年前切除了
<11-30,Cameron>He had brain canceR.They removed iteight years ago.

355
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,930
<11-30,Cameron>从那时起他的状况就一直这样
<11-30,Cameron>His condition's been the sameever since.

356
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,140
<11-31,House>直到昨晚 他说话了
<11-31,House>Until last night.He spoke.

357
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,020
<11-32,Foreman>他说什么了?
<11-32,Foreman>What'd he say?

358
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,770
<11-34,Chase>他...只发出了咕噜声?
<11-34,Chase>He...grunted?

359
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,360
<11-35,Cameron>你要我们把8年来所有有咕噜症状,的病人仔细研究一遍?
<11-35,Cameron>You want us to dissect eight years of medical historywith grunting in the differential?

360
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,130
<11-36,House>看来不错 做好了叫我
<11-36,House>Sounds good.Call me when you're done.

361
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,450
<12-1,Wilson>你很无聊地捏造了一个秘密
<12-1,Wilson>You're fabricating a mysterybecause you're bored.

362
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,800
<12-2,House>我才不无聊呢
<12-2,House>I am not bored.

363
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,550
<12-2,House>该死
<12-2,House>Damn it.

364
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,340
<12-3,Wilson>你不会告诉他妻子那只是个咕噜声吧?
<12-3,Wilson>You didn't tell the wifeit was only a grunt?

365
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,180
<12-4,House>当然不会
<12-4,House>Of course not.

366
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,640
<12-4,House>否则她就不会同意做一连串危险的检查了
<12-4,House>Because then she neverwould have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests.

367
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,650
<12-4,House>你几时这么爱管闲事了
<12-4,House>I don't remember youbeing this bitchy.

368
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,010
<12-5,Wilson>维柯丁(止痛药)让你行动迟钝,在白天清醒的光芒下 我是乐趣杀手
<12-5,Wilson>The vicodin dulled it.In the sober light of day,I'm a buzz-kill.

369
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,480
<12-5,Wilson>你给一个可怜的家庭虚假的希望
<12-5,Wilson>You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked.

370
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,420
<12-5,Wilson>别再折磨他们了
<12-5,Wilson>Don't torture them.

371
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,190
<12-5,Wilson>随他去吧 告诉他妻子那只是一声咕噜,让她回家
<12-5,Wilson>Let it go.Tell the wifeit was only a grunt.Tell her to go home.

372
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,660
<12-6,House>我不能看着她就这么绝望
<12-6,House>I can't let her downlike that.

373
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,010
<12-6,House>要用多多虚假的希望把她拉上来
<12-6,House>Pumped her upwith too much false hope.

374
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,480
<12-6,House>瞧 我做得多漂亮!
<12-6,House>Oh, I stuck that primo!

375
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,960
<12-6,House>我真是太出色了!
<12-6,House>How rad am I?

376
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,150
<13-1,Foreman>2002年 病人患了干眼症
<13-1,Foreman>2002, patient had dry eyes.

377
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,210
<13-2,Chase>干眼症并发咕噜
<13-2,Chase>Dry eyes plus a grunt.

378
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,430
<13-2,Chase>都可能是病因
<13-2,Chase>It all makes sense.

379
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,550
<13-3,Foreman>也可能是神经问题
<13-3,Foreman>Could bea neurological issue.

380
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,420
<13-4,Cameron>我得花粉热 滴眼药水的时候,可不会去找神经科医生
<13-4,Cameron>I get hay fever,I put drops in my eyes.I don't goto a neurologist.

381
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,480
<13-5,Foreman>干眼症可能表明自主性神经官能障碍
<13-5,Foreman>Dry eyes could indicatean autonomic dysfunction.

382
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,390
<13-5,Foreman>写到白板上
<13-5,Foreman>Goes on the board.

383
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,250
<13-6,Chase>会不会是咳嗽?
<13-6,Chase>What about coughing?

384
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,220
<13-6,Chase>或者是鼻屎?,不应该把鼻屎也包括进来吗?
<13-6,Chase>Or boogers?Should we include boogers?

385
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,900
<13-7,Foreman>我很高兴我们在做这个
<13-7,Foreman>I'm happy we're doing this.

386
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,350
<13-7,Foreman>比起延长某人的肌腱,我更愿意干这个
<13-7,Foreman>I'd much rather do this than lengthensome guy's tendon.

387
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,690
<13-7,Foreman>病人的头痛更严重了
<13-7,Foreman>Patient's headachesincreased.

388
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,520
<13-7,Foreman>医生扫描了他的头部,发现了一个肿瘤
<13-7,Foreman>Doc scanned his head,found a tumor.

389
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,000
<13-8,Cameron>你喜欢浪费你的时间?
<13-8,Cameron>You like wasting your time?

390
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,910
<13-9,Foreman>- 我正在学,- 学了干什么?
<13-9,Foreman>-I'm learning.-To do what?

391
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,550
<13-10,Cameron>重新考虑已经解决的病例,因为你不想面对现实世界吗?
<13-10,Cameron>Reconsider solved cases because you don't want to deal with the real world?

392
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,100
<13-10,Cameron>他正在把我们推向死胡同
<13-10,Cameron>He's pushingwhere there's nothing.

393
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,320
<13-11,Foreman>Cameron 你是一名杰出的医生
<13-11,Foreman>Cameron, you arean excellent doctor.

394
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,950
<13-11,Foreman>会有许多感激涕零的病人向你泣谢
<13-11,Foreman>You'll get lotsof tearful thank-yous from grateful patients.

395
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,000
<13-12,Cameron>我还没那么渴望感谢
<13-12,Cameron>Yeah, am I such a bitchfor wanting that?

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,720
<13-13,Foreman>得了吧 那又不坏,不过这不是我为什么在这里的原因
<13-13,Foreman>Well, it's not a bad thing.But it's not why I'm here.

397
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,580
<13-13,Foreman>我得到了这个向 House 学习的机会
<13-13,Foreman>I took this fellowshipto learn from house.

398
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,270
<13-14,Cameron>他在教你怎样成为一个受虐狂
<13-14,Cameron>He's teaching youto be a masochist.

399
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,320
<13-15,Chase>把干眼症写上白板
<13-15,Chase>Dry eyes goes on the board.

400
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,160
<13-16,Foreman>在8年里 记录到214种症状,多种重复出现
<13-16,Foreman>in eight years, the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.

401
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,770
<13-17,House>有没有什么模式?
<13-17,House>Any patterns?

402
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,890
<13-18,Chase>发热伴发尿频可能意味着前列腺炎
<13-18,Chase>fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis.

403
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
<13-19,Foreman>或者是尿道感染
<13-19,Foreman>Or a urinary tract infection.

404
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,810
<13-20,Chase>- 白细胞计数正常,- 无感染
<13-20,Chase>-White count was normal.-No infection.

405
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,460
<13-21,Foreman>如果再加上疼痛 发热
<13-21,Foreman>if you add pain into the mix, fever,

406
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,390
<13-21,Foreman>尿频可能意味着肾有问题
<13-21,Foreman>frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.

407
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,210
<13-22,House>我喜欢这个想法
<13-22,House>I like it.

408
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,310
<13-23,Chase>不会的 肌酐和尿素氮都很正常
<13-23,Chase>No.Creatinine and bunwere both normal.

409
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
<13-24,House>不是说肾 是说疼痛
<13-24,House>Not the kidney part.The pain part.

410
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,790
<13-24,House>腹部疼痛加上那些症状可能就是胰腺囊肿
<13-24,House>Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal pancreatic cysts.

411
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,720
<13-25,Cameron>漂亮 你们成功找出了一个,他从没有过的症状
<13-25,Cameron>perfect.You've managed to pick the one symptom he never had.

412
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,080
<13-27,Cameron>腹部疼痛
<13-27,Cameron>Abdominal pain.

413
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,200
<13-26,House>那是白板上的第一个症状 咕噜
<13-26,House>It's the first symptomon the board.Grunt.

414
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,600
<13-27,Cameron>咕噜又不能确诊为腹部疼痛
<13-27,Cameron>Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.

415
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,300
<13-27,Cameron>不
<13-27,Cameron>No.

416
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,720
<13-28,House>传统的标志性症状是横膈膜的压缩
<13-28,House>The traditionaldiagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm

417
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,600
<13-28,House>和喉部的震动 发出我们能听见的声音
<13-28,House>and vibration of the larynx, leading to the audible sound.

418
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,170
<13-28,House>"我感到腹部好痛"
<13-28,House>"I have a painin my abdomen.

419
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,200
<13-29,Cameron>Richard 的症状是从8年的,病例里面精选出来的
<13-29,Cameron>"richard's symptoms are culled from eight yearsof medical history.

420
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,940
<13-29,Cameron>没有模式 这些只是8年间随机的,个体的病例
<13-29,Cameron>They're not patterned.These are random, individual events over time.

421
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,200
<13-30,House>疾病有潜伏期
<13-30,House>Illnesses haveincubation periods.

422
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,960
<13-30,House>做个上呼吸道超声内镜检查
<13-30,House>Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.

423
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,340
<13-31,Foreman>他的咽喉会被毁掉的
<13-31,Foreman>his throat will collapse.

424
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,880
<13-31,Foreman>他颈部肌肉退化,无法承受这种程度的检查
<13-31,Foreman>Muscle degenerationin his neck won't tolerate the scope.

425
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,020
<13-31,Foreman>那可是个自动软管
<13-31,Foreman>It's an automatic trach.

426
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,900
<13-32,House>听你们说他好像是个残疾人
<13-32,House>You're talking about himlike he's an invalid.

427
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,180
<13-33,Chase>我们没啥感觉
<13-33,Chase>We're insensitive.

428
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,710
<13-34,House>他淌口水吗? 他能直起自己的脖子吗?
<13-34,House>Does he drool?Can he hold his neck straight?

429
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,260
<13-34,House>他吃东西时呛吗?
<13-34,House>Does he chokeon his food?

430
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,150
<13-34,House>他脖子没问题 他的咽喉不会被毁掉的
<13-34,House>His neck's fine.His throat'snot gonna collapse.

431
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,100
<13-34,House>Cameron 去征得他妻子的同意
<13-34,House>Cameron, get consentfrom the wife.

432
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,400
<13-34,House>张嘴
<13-34,House>Open.

433
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,770
<14-1,Chase>我需要你做吞咽动作
<14-1,Chase>I need you to swallow.

434
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,780
<14-1,Chase>抱歉
<14-1,Chase>Sorry about that.

435
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,160
<14-1,Chase>开始
<14-1,Chase>Here we go.

436
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,860
<14-1,Chase>经过食道括约肌到达胃腔
<14-1,Chase>Passing through the loweresophageal sphincter,,into the antrum of the stomach.

437
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,930
<14-1,Chase>胰腺的后部
<14-1,Chase>There's the tail of the pancreas.

438
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,130
<14-2,Foreman>没有病变
<14-2,Foreman>Looks clean.

439
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,260
<14-3,Chase>向中间移动 胰腺的中部和头部也无病变
<14-3,Chase>Moving medially,the body and the headof,the pancreas look clean--

440
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,970
<14-4,Foreman>拿出来
<14-4,Foreman>get it out.Get it out.

441
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,290
<14-5,Chase>卡住了 动不了
<14-5,Chase>It's stuck.I can't move it.

442
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,700
<14-5,Chase>他喉咙塌陷了
<14-5,Chase>His throat's collapsed.

443
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,270
<14-6,Foreman>心跳呼吸都成问题 情况紧急
<14-6,Foreman>Vitals are all overthe place.We're losing him.

444
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,380
<14-7,Chase>切开
<14-7,Chase>I'm cutting.

445
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,360
<15-1,Chase>插入导管 用内窥镜法移出了探针,他才恢复呼吸
<15-1,Chase>We trached him,endoscopicallyremoved the probe,,and he's breathing again.

446
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,250
<15-1,Chase>总体来说 好主意
<15-1,Chase>So,all in all,great idea.

447
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,460
<15-2,House>在世界末日前观察到胰腺了吗?
<15-2,House>Did you get a lookat the pancreas,before the world ended?

448
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,400
<15-3,Foreman>没有病变
<15-3,Foreman>It was clean.

449
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,160
<15-4,Cameron>说明除非你阻拦 他明天就能出院
<15-4,Cameron>Which means,barring anything else,,meaning you,he can go home tomorrow.

450
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,430
<15-5,House>他差点死了 怎么能放他走?
<15-5,House>This man nearly died.How can you discharge him?

451
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,650
<15-6,Cameron>我们的预测导致他喉咙塌陷
<15-6,Cameron>His throat collapsed becauseof what we predicted.

452
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,100
<15-7,Foreman>戳喉咙 肌肉会收缩 这是痉挛
<15-7,Foreman>you stick something down someone's throat,,they gag.Spasm.

453
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,150
<15-7,Foreman>他就是如此 用了半小时才取出探针
<15-7,Foreman>Which he did.It took us a half an hourto get that thing out.

454
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,500
<15-8,House>除非病人的喉咙被镇静了
<15-8,House>Except our patient's throatwas sedated.

455
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,460
<15-8,House>大脑应该发送信号不做出反应
<15-8,House>Which means the brainshould have sent,a signal in not to do anything.

456
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,580
<15-8,House>可能会是癌症
<15-8,House>This could be cancer.

457
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,740
<15-8,House>或是异常的神经退化 甚至是新型--
<15-8,House>Or some bizarre neurodegeneration.Even a new typeof vacular--

458
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,010
<15-9,Cameron>别说了
<15-9,Cameron>stop it.

459
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,460
<15-9,Cameron>你乐在其中
<15-9,Cameron>You're enjoying this.

460
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,410
<15-10,House>我觉得有趣
<15-10,House>I find it interesting.

461
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,150
<15-11,Cameron>你是对的 这才有趣,如果你错了 这么折磨他就只是取悦你
<15-11,Cameron>It's interestingonly if you're right.If you're wrong,we're torturing this guy to amuse you.

462
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,630
<15-12,House>半小时取出探针?
<15-12,House>Half hourto remove the probe?

463
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,370
<13-12,Cameron>House.
<13-12,Cameron>House

464
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,560
<13-13,Foreman>这不是痉挛
<13-13,Foreman>It's not a spasm.

465
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,870
<15-14,House>他的喉咙不是塌陷 而是紧锁了
<15-14,House>His throat didn't collapse.It locked down.

466
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,630
<15-14,House>大脑协调身体的每块肌肉同时舒张或收缩
<15-14,House>Brain is supposed to tell every muscle in,the body to relax and contract at the same time.

467
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,110
<15-14,House>这块肌肉只是收缩,说明有一个大脑信号没有传送到
<15-14,House>This muscle was onlycontracting,which means,a signal from thebrain was not getting through.

468
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,020
<15-15,Foreman>他大脑没有损伤 不会干扰指令
<15-15,Foreman>there are no lesions  his brain.Nothing to interruptany orders.

469
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,490
<15-16,House>一根电路坏损就能导致
<15-16,House>All it takes is one wire down.

470
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,180
<15-17,Foreman>没有证据哪根电路坏了
<15-17,Foreman>You have no evidenceof any wires down.

471
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,660
<15-18,House>脑膜中有微小肿瘤,瞬时就窒息而死
<15-18,House>A few microtumorson the meninges,,suddenly you're chokingto death.

472
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,190
<15-19,Chase>你要查看他大脑皮层?
<15-19,Chase>You wanna lookat the lining of his brain?

473
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,510
<15-19,Chase>为了查看还得泵入大量造影剂--
<15-19,Chase>the amount of contrast material,you'd need to pump up there just to see--

474
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,310
<15-20,Foreman>他会脑出血
<15-20,Foreman>he'll bleed into his brain.

475
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,020
<15-21,House>- 不 他不会,-  那样就不好玩了
<15-21,House>- No,he won'T.- Because that wouldn'tbe interesting.

476
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,610
<15-22,Cameron>你自己去请求家属同意吧
<15-22,Cameron>You can get permissionthis time.

477
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,940
<16-1,House>大脑被嵌套在袋中 称作脑膜
<16-1,House>The brain is enclosedin a sack,called the meninges.

478
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,240
<16-2,Arlene>难道癌症复发了?
<16-2,Arlene>Does this meanthe cancer's back?

479
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,390
<16-3,House>不 不
<16-3,House>No,no,no,no.

480
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,540
<16-3,House>House.
<16-3,House>House

481
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,640
<16-4,House>如果发现是癌症
<16-4,House>If we found cancer,

482
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,960
<16-4,House>也不是原先的 而是新的癌症
<16-4,House>it wouldn't bethe original cancer.It'd be new.

483
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,150
<16-5,Arlene>然后? 又是手术 化疗?
<16-5,Arlene>So what?More surgery?,More radiation?

484
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,620
<16-6,House>情况也不至于最坏
<16-6,House>Might not bethe worst thing.

485
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,620
<16-6,House>如果不是旧病 也许可以医治
<16-6,House>If this isn'tjust ancient history,,maybe it's somethingwe can correct.

486
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,590
<16-6,House>甚至能挽救回一些大脑功能
<16-6,House>Might even get some brain function back.

487
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,990
<16-7,Arlene>他会变好一点?
<16-7,Arlene>He could get better?

488
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,550
<16-8,Cameron>不
<16-8,Cameron>No.

489
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,020
<16-9,House>他若能听懂你说话 该多好
<16-9,House>But understanding whatyou're,saying would be nice.

490
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,030
<16-9,House>说不定你们能想办法交流
<16-9,House>Maybe you can figure outways to communicate.

491
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,130
<16-10,Arlene>幸好他对你说话了
<16-10,Arlene>Thank god he spoketo you.

492
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,890
<16-10,Arlene>McneiL女士
<16-10,Arlene>Mrs.McneiL.

493
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,660
<16-11,Cameron>检查风险很高
<16-11,Cameron>The test to do this is very risky.

494
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,930
<16-11,Cameron>他会死
<16-11,Cameron>He could die.

495
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,320
<16-12,Arlene>他现在生不如死
<16-12,Arlene>He's already dead.

496
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,240
<17-1,Foreman>Chase 慢点
<17-1,Foreman>chase,  go slow

497
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,280
<17-2,Chase>已经注入脊髓腔
<17-2,Chase>already injected into spinal canal

498
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,610
<17-2,Chase>下一站 大脑
<17-2,Chase>next stop is brain

499
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,210
<17-3,Foreman>造影剂进入第4脑室
<17-3,Foreman>contrast material entering into,the fourth ventricle.

500
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,530
<17-3,Foreman>室壁无出血
<17-3,Foreman>No parietal bleeds.

501
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,230
<17-4,Chase>血压高 但能控制住
<17-4,Chase>Blood pressure's high.But it's holding.

502
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,400
<17-5,Foreman>脑膜完整 无出血
<17-5,Foreman>meninges are intact.No bleeding.

503
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,280
<17-6,Chase>天
<17-6,Chase>Oh,god.

<17-6,Chase>Foreman 过来看
<17-6,Chase>Foreman,get in here.

506
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,270
<17-8,Cameron>你很幸运 他没有死
<17-8,Cameron>you are lucky he didn't die

507
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,630
<17-9,House>我幸运? 是他没死
<17-9,House>I'm lucky? he is the one who didn'y die

508
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,040
<17-10,Cameron>说过会有出血
<17-10,Cameron>we told you he had haemorrhage

509
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,980
<17-11,House>你们说他会脑出血 不是耳出血
<17-11,House>you told me he bleed into his brain,not out of his ear

510
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,570
<17-12,Cameron>你得停止
<17-12,Cameron>gotta drop this

511
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,120
<17-13,House>错过了什么
<17-13,House>I'm missing something

512
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,200
<17-14,Foreman>做了危险的检查 造成了损伤
<17-14,Foreman>we did a dangerous test,and something bad happened

513
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,050
<17-14,Foreman>如此而已
<17-14,Foreman>that's all this is

514
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,210
<17-15,House>带我漫游他的脑子 Foreman
<17-15,House>give me tour of the brain Foreman

515

<17-15,House>walk me through the scans

516
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,400
<17-16,Foreman>发生了什么
<17-16,Foreman>what happened

517
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,930
<17-16,Foreman>如果我脑子里长了厘米级的瘤子...
<17-16,Foreman>*******

518
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,950
<17-16,Foreman>不是这个
<17-16,Foreman>nothing

523
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,120
<17-21,Cameron>House 没有什么斑点可疑,是外科医生挖掘他的头
<17-21,Cameron>House, every spec is not suspect,It's use of surgeon digging around his head

524
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,820
<17-21,Cameron>让他走吧
<17-21,Cameron>let him go

525
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,680
<17-22,House>重新做血液检查
<17-22,House>we do every blood test he's ever had

<17-23,Cameron>他已经受伤病折磨了8年,我不会帮你作孽
<17-23,Cameron>he's in sick in suffering for 8 years,and I'm not gonna helping make it worse

529
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,210
<17-23,Cameron>不会帮你寻乐子
<17-23,Cameron>I'm not gonna help you make interesting

530
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,250
<17-24,House>没事 Foreman对这比你在行
<17-24,House>That's okay.Foreman's better at that stuffthan you are.

531
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,740
<17-24,House>在他枕骨和下丘脑处切开5毫米
<17-24,House>We need 5-millimeter cuts through,the occipitaland hypothalamic regions.

532
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,630
<17-25,Foreman>不
<17-25,Foreman>No.

533
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,540
<17-26,Chase>几毫米?
<17-26,Chase>How many millimeters?

534
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,680
<18-1,House>我能帮他
<18-1,House>I can help him.

535
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,370
<18-2,Cuddy>如此而已? 这就是你的论据?
<18-2,Cuddy>This is it?,That's your argument?

536
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,280
<18-3,House>很充分
<18-3,House>Seems like a good one.

537
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,230
<18-4,Cuddy>只要我稍微思考你是想帮他,你得取得全权委托书
<18-4,Cuddy>If I thought for a secondyou wanted,to help him,you'd have carte blanche.

538
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,400
<18-4,Cuddy>你这么做是为了好玩
<18-4,Cuddy>You're doing thisbecause it's fun.

539
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,010
<18-5,House>这医院里的人除了我的动机,就没别的好谈论了?
<18-5,House>Does nobodyin this hospital have,anything betterto talk about than my motives?

540
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,630
<18-5,House>我的动机和案例没关系
<18-5,House>My motives have nothing to dowith the case.

541
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,890
<18-6,Cuddy>你的动机和判断息息相关
<18-6,Cuddy>Your motives have everythingto,do with your judgment.

542
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,100
<18-7,House>这么多年来第一次 我体内没有了鸦片
<18-7,House>For the first time in years,,I've got no opiates in my body.

543
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,520
<18-7,House>你质疑我的判断
<18-7,House>Now you question my judgment.

544

<18-8,Cuddy>一年有24次 你闯进我办公室,叫嚣着要帮谁
<18-8,Cuddy>24 times a year you comestorming into my office,,spouting that you can help someone.

00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,450
<18-8,Cuddy>可是你从来不这么说
<18-8,Cuddy>Only you never saythose words.

546
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,620
<18-8,Cuddy>你会嚷嚷诸如
<18-8,Cuddy>You say something like,

547
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,220
<18-8,Cuddy>"他的胰腺要爆炸了 因为大脑着了火"
<18-8,Cuddy>"his pancreas is gonna explodebecause,his brain is on fire."

548
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,860
<18-8,Cuddy>你基于医学理由 而不是泛泛而谈
<18-8,Cuddy>You come here with medicine,,not with platitudes.

549
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,150
<18-9,House>我不想说细节 惹你乏味
<18-9,House>I didn't want to bore youwith the details.

550
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,650
<18-9,House>根本没有细节
<18-9,House>There are no details.

551
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,190
<18-10,Cuddy>你只有个直觉
<18-10,Cuddy>You have a hunch.

552
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
<18-10,Cuddy>House 你不依靠直觉
<18-10,Cuddy>House,you don't use hunches.

553
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,130
<18-10,Cuddy>你总是有理由的
<18-10,Cuddy>You always have reasons.

554
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,950
<18-10,Cuddy>医院不是因你的突发奇想而生存,很抱歉
<18-10,Cuddy>This hospital doesn't exist for your whims.I'm sorry.

<18-10,Cuddy>明早7点 就让你的病人出院
<18-10,Cuddy>As of 7:00 A.M. Tomorrow morning,,I'm sending your patient home.

556
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,560
<18-10,Cuddy>回答是不
<18-10,Cuddy>The answer is no.

557
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,120
<19-1,Wilson>Cuddy在你离开后30秒就打电话来,说你钻牛角尖
<19-1,Wilson>Cuddy called 30 secondsafter you left,and said you'd tryan end around.

558

<19-5,Wilson>Did it go away?

562
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,270
<19-6,House>疼了一小会
<19-6,House>Ached for a while.

<20-5,Cuddy>Even if the fountainproved anything,fixing,hypothalamicdysregulation isn't gonna regenerate brain.

595

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,500
<20-11,Cuddy>你一身臭汗 所以才能冒出这样的瞎猜
<20-11,Cuddy>This is a wild guess that came,to youbecause you were sweating.

603
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,460
<20-12,House>注射可的松
<20-12,House>Inject him with cortisol.

<20-12,House>这个人可以再次跟妻子欢好,再次拥抱儿子
<20-12,House>The guy'll have sexwith his wife again.He'll hug his kid again.

606
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,790
<20-12,House>否则我就救了一个恋童癖
<20-12,House>Be a shameif I cured a pedophile.

607

<20-12,House>你在微笑 不是好兆头

<20-13,Cuddy>你吃药了
<20-13,Cuddy>You're high.

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,750
<20-15,Cuddy>你一兴奋就这样
<20-15,Cuddy>This is as highas you get.

611
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,640
<20-15,Cuddy>你把病例用一个无根据的理论包装
<20-15,Cuddy>A theory that ties your case up,in a neat little bow.

612
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,560
<20-15,Cuddy>却拿不出一点证据
<20-15,Cuddy>But you don't have a lickof,substantiating proof.

613
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,850
<20-16,House>你的决定不合理
<20-16,House>Your decisiondoesn't make any sense.

614
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,650
<20-16,House>注射可的松没有风险,就算我错了 有什么大不了
<20-16,House>There is no risk to a cortisol injection.If I'm wrong,big deal.

615
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,530
<20-16,House>他像往常一样 作为一个植物人回家,但如果我是对的
<20-16,House>He goes home a vegetable,like he already is.But if I'm right--

616
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,610
<20-17,Cuddy>这不是好与坏的风险权衡
<20-17,Cuddy>this is not about downsidesor,risk management.

617
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,450
<20-17,Cuddy>重要的是让你懂得,如何接受"不"这个词
<20-17,Cuddy>It is a big deal for youto,understand the word no.

618
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,790
<20-17,Cuddy>对不起 House
<20-17,Cuddy>I'm sorry,house.

<20-18,Wilson>他要出院了
<20-18,Wilson>He's on his wayout of here.

620
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,680
<20-18,Wilson>我以为你会窜下楼去,在他脖子上扎一针可的松
<20-18,Wilson>Figured you'd beon your scooter racing down the,halls to stab the patient in the neckwith cortisol.

621
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,970
<20-19,House>她说"不"是对的
<20-19,House>She was right to say no.

622
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,050
<20-19,House>我自认为正确的 其实没有客观理由
<20-19,House>I had no objective reason to,thinkthat I was right.

623
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,020
<20-19,House>只是解谜
<20-19,House>Just needed the puzzle.

624

<21-1,Cuddy>稍等
<21-1,Cuddy>Hold on a sec.

<21-2,Arlene>Is everything all right?

626
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,110
<21-3,Cuddy>我忘了一点事情
<21-3,Cuddy>Yeah,it's just somethingI forgot.

<21-4,Mark>What's that?

628
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,150
<21-5,Cuddy>可的松
<21-5,Cuddy>This is cortisol.

629
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,510
<21-5,Cuddy>抗感染
<21-5,Cuddy>And it's to fight infection.

630

<21-5,Cuddy>帮我压一下
<21-5,Cuddy>Wanna hold onto that?

<21-16,Cuddy>he got up.

646
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,650
<21-16,Cuddy>- 我得告诉House,- 不
<21-16,Cuddy>- I have to go tell house.- No.

<21-17,Wilson>Cuddy.

648
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,170
<21-17,Wilson>不能告诉他
<21-17,Wilson>You can't tell him.

649
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,200
<21-18,Cuddy>当然要说 他是对的
<21-18,Cuddy>I have to tell him.He was right.

650
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,590
<21-19,Wilson>为什么这么做?
<21-19,Wilson>Why did you do it?

651
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,450
<21-19,Wilson>为什么你觉得他有可能对?
<21-19,Wilson>Why did you thinkhe might be right?

652
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,580
<21-20,Cuddy>因为他是House
<21-20,Cuddy>Because he's house.

653
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,190
<21-21,Wilson>医学角度 你根据什么判断他是对的
<21-21,Wilson>Medically.What made you thinkhe was right?

654
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,120
<21-23,Wilson>- 没根据,- 他运气好
<21-23,Wilson>- Nothing.- He got lucky.

655
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,030
<21-23,Wilson>只能从运气解释
<21-23,Wilson>That's all that happened.

656
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,870
<21-23,Wilson>跟他说"不"对他是好事
<21-23,Wilson>Telling him nowas a good thing.

657
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,390
<21-23,Wilson>因为下次 他不会这么好运,他会杀死某人
<21-23,Wilson>Because next time,he won't get lucky.He'll kill someone.

658
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,400
<21-23,Wilson>他对了 并不表明他没错
<21-23,Wilson>Just becausehe was right doesn't,meanhe wasn't wrong.

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,280
<21-24,Cuddy>我每天都见他
<21-24,Cuddy>I see him every day.

660
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,860
<21-24,Cuddy>不能就这么...
<21-24,Cuddy>I can't just...

661
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,390
<21-25,Wilson>人人都撒谎
<21-25,Wilson>everybody lies.
