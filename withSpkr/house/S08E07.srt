<1-1,House>位于华府附近的帕塔克森特河海军航空站

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,270
<1-1,House>我在考虑去玩滑翔翼
<1-1,House>I'm thinking of going hang gliding.

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,470
<1-2,Park>帕塔克河上的气流相当平缓
<1-2,Park>Pax River is, like, completely flat.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,720
<1-2,Park>我想这正是V-22鱼鹰式倾转旋翼机
<1-2,Park>Think that's why they tested

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,250
<1-2,Park>V-22鱼鹰式倾转旋翼机
<1-2,Park>兼具直升机和固定翼螺旋桨飞机的优点

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,360
<1-2,Park>选在那里试飞的原因

<1-3,House>奇斯哪去了
<1-3,House>And where is Chase?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,410
<1-4,Taub>去看牙根管  还有比格氏病
<1-4,Taub>Root canal and Berger's.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,030
<1-4,Taub>第一个是说奇斯
<1-4,Taub>The first one was regarding Chase,

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,850
<1-4,Taub>他去治牙根管
<1-4,Taub>root canal.

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,120
<1-4,Taub>如果治疗得当  就不像肾病了
<1-4,Taub>If done correctly, it doesn't look like kidney disease.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,450
<1-5,Foreman>给你找了个病人
<1-5,Foreman>Got a case for you.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,990

<1-7,Foreman>病人突发特发性过敏反应
<1-7,Foreman>Patient had an idiopathic anaphylactic reaction.

22
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,080
<1-7,Foreman>难倒了两名急诊室医生
<1-7,Foreman>It stumped two E.R. docs,

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,690
<1-7,Foreman>还有一位约翰·霍普金斯大学的免疫学家
<1-7,Foreman>and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,020
<1-8,House>在一年之内  患者从无症状到
<1-8,House>Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys

25

<1-8,House>肾功能衰竭
<1-8,House>in less than a year.

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,080

<1-10,House>四岁的小男孩  一直在鬼门关徘徊
<1-10,House>Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,850
<1-11,Adams>这病人五年前就死了
<1-11,Adams>This patient died five years ago.

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,550
<1-12,House>我又没说他在门里还是门外
<1-12,House>I didn't say which side of the door he was on.

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,160
<1-12,House>他的死亡让这病例更有趣
<1-12,House>The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting.

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,350
<1-12,House>四岁的孩子是不会死于比格氏病的
<1-12,House>Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
<1-13,Adams>我以为这是有关的
<1-13,Adams>I thought it was relevant.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,560
<1-14,House>死亡是结果  而不是症状
<1-14,House>Death is a consequence, not a symptom.

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,400
<1-14,House>只要它不是症状  就没有关系
<1-14,House>If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant.

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,270
<1-15,Taub>我们是不是该试着尽力
<1-15,Taub>Shouldn't we be trying to maximize

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,810
<1-15,Taub>拯救可以挽救的东西呢
<1-15,Taub>what we can save here,

39
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,720
<1-15,Taub>比如十四岁女孩的生命  你的自由和我们的生计
<1-15,Taub>14-year-old, your freedom, our asses?

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,270
<1-16,House>好吧  努力自保吧

<2-1,Park>她只受了些轻伤  但她父亲死了
<2-1,Park>She only had minor injuries, but her father died.

62
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,110
<2-2,Taub>那是十二年前的事了  你认为这有关吗
<2-2,Taub>That was 12 years ago. You think that's pertinent?

63
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,710
<2-3,Park>不  我认为她挺可怜的
<2-3,Park>No, I think it's sad.

64
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,210
<2-3,Park>她在十四岁生日聚会上生病了
<2-3,Park>She got sick in the middle of her 14th birthday party,

65
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,970
<2-3,Park>这既可怜而又相关
<2-3,Park>which is sad and pertinent.

66
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,110
<2-3,Park>或许她当时正在打开一份礼物
<2-3,Park>Maybe she was opening a present

67
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,470
<2-3,Park>才引发了过敏反应
<2-3,Park>that triggered the reaction.

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,860
<2-5,Taub>-豪斯人呢  -跟福曼比吹胡子瞪眼
<2-5,Taub>- Where's House? - Pissing contest with Foreman.

69
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,420
<2-6,Adams>她最后吃的东西是草莓蛋糕
<2-6,Adams>Last thing she ate was strawberry cake,

70
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,350
<2-6,Adams>但是过敏原检测显示她对什么都不过敏
<2-6,Adams>but allergy tests for everything were negative.

71
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,610
<2-7,Park>你喜欢你的牙医吗
<2-7,Park>Do you like your dentist?

72
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,260
<2-7,Park>我现在找的还是我小时候看牙的医生
<2-7,Park>I'm still going to my pediatric one.

73
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,660
<2-7,Park>你牙医叫什么
<2-7,Park>What's your dentist's name?

74
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,900
<2-9,Adams>-威廉姆斯  -如果不是过敏反应呢
<2-9,Adams>- Williams. - What if it's not an allergic reaction?

<2-9,Adams>遗传性血管水肿
<2-9,Adams>Hereditary angioedema

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,690
<2-9,Adams>或是全身性肥大细胞增多症
<2-9,Adams>or systemic mastocytosis

77
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,990
<2-9,Adams>可能表现为过敏反应
<2-9,Adams>could mimic anaphylaxis.

78
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,220
<2-10,Park>你不太清楚他的名字吗
<2-10,Park>You're not sure of his name?

79
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,760
<2-10,Park>你今天早上才去看的牙医
<2-10,Park>You just saw him this morning.

80
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,440
<2-11,Chase>他的助手叫安吉
<2-11,Chase>His assistant's name is Angie.

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,250
<2-11,Chase>她家电话是...
<2-11,Chase>Her home number is--

82
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,480
<2-12,Taub>防御素检测值正常
<2-12,Taub>Normal complement studies

83
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,870
<2-12,Taub>没有皮肤损害
<2-12,Taub>no skin lesions.

84
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,290
<2-13,Park>你去修指甲了
<2-13,Park>You had a manicure.

85
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,090
<2-13,Park>这是刚修剪过的  你没去看牙医
<2-13,Park>This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist.

86
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,610
<2-13,Park>你为什么要说谎呢
<2-13,Park>Why would you lie about that?

87
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,990
<2-14,Chase>就是不想有人多问
<2-14,Chase>To avoid having this conversation.

88
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,800
<2-15,Adams>血压高  会不会是嗜铬细胞瘤
<2-15,Adams>Elevated bp. What about pheochromocytoma?

89
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,230
<2-16,Taub>或者就是过敏反应
<2-16,Taub>Or an anaphylactoid reaction,

90
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,870
<2-16,Taub>可能由某些鸦片类药剂引起
<2-16,Taub>which could be triggered by certain opioids.

91
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,210
<2-17,Park>自我认识你以来  你剪过三次头发
<2-17,Park>You've had your hair cut three times since I've met you.

92
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,960
<2-17,Park>你不可能为修指甲而不好意思
<2-17,Park>You can't be embarrassed about a manicure.

93
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,530
<2-17,Park>肯定有更深层次的原因
<2-17,Park>There's gotta be a deeper reason.

94
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,660
<2-18,Chase>是不是豪斯让你问的
<2-18,Chase>Did House give you homework?

95
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,760
<2-19,Adams>她什么药都没吃过
<2-19,Adams>She's not on any meds.

96
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,540
<2-20,Taub>你没听说过吗  所有人都会说谎
<2-20,Taub>Haven't you heard? Everybody lies.

97
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,940
<2-21,Adams>毒理检验未检出毒物
<2-21,Adams>And the tox screen was clean.

98
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,400
<2-22,Taub>你们俩随时可以发表意见
<2-22,Taub>Feel free to jump in at any time.

99
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,150
<2-23,Chase>我们会检测血儿茶酚胺以确定有无嗜铬细胞瘤
<2-23,Chase>We'll check catecholamines for pheo

100
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,990
<2-23,Chase>然后再做次扩展鸦片筛检
<2-23,Chase>and run an expanded opioid panel.

101
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,780
<2-23,Chase>你们趁她母亲没在病房时
<2-23,Chase>You see what the patient says about drug use

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,310
<2-23,Chase>再问问她吸毒的事
<2-23,Chase>when her mother's out of the room.

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,050
<3-1,Iris>没有  从没吸过
<3-1,Iris>No, never.

104
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,400
<3-2,Adams>我们不是想揭发你  艾瑞斯
<3-2,Adams>Nobody's here to bust you, Iris.

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,450
<3-2,Adams>我们只需要知道你是否...
<3-2,Adams>We just need to know if--

106
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,650
<3-3,Iris>没有  我已经告诉过你们了
<3-3,Iris>No, I already told you.

107
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,670
<3-3,Iris>我就有时吃点维生素C
<3-3,Iris>I just take vitamin C sometimes.

108
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,380
<3-4,Adams>当你发病时  你具体在干什么
<3-4,Adams>What exactly were you doing when you had your reaction?

109
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,930
<3-5,Iris>拆一件生日礼物  是魔力八号球
<3-5,Iris>Opening a birthday present, the magic 8 ball.

111
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,270
<3-5,Iris>是开玩笑的玩具  不是可卡因
<3-5,Iris>The joke gift, not the cocaine.

112
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,180
<3-5,Iris>行了吗
<3-5,Iris>Is that it?

113
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,840
<4-1,Taub>有些药物可以引起她的过敏反应
<4-1,Taub>Certain drugs could explain her reaction.

114
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,050
<4-2,Faye>哪些药物
<4-2,Faye>What kind of drugs?

115
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,120
<4-3,Taub>你能想到什么
<4-3,Taub>What kind did you have in mind?

116
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,420
<4-4,Faye>艾瑞斯一直是一个情绪化的女孩
<4-4,Faye>Iris has always been a moody girl.

117
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,420
<4-4,Faye>现在她到了青春期  就更严重了
<4-4,Faye>And now that she's a teenager, it's gotten worse.

118
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,090
<4-4,Faye>所以这几个月来
<4-4,Faye>So for the past few months I've been...

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,720
<4-4,Faye>我一直给她吃些药  想让她放松些
<4-4,Faye>giving something to relax her.

120
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,990
<4-4,Faye>安定  我告诉她是维生素C
<4-4,Faye>Diazepam. I tell her it's vitamin c.

121
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,460
<4-4,Faye>艾瑞斯很想做个正常的女孩
<4-4,Faye>Being normal is very important to Iris.

122
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,250
<4-4,Faye>她会无法接受自己需要长期服药的事实
<4-4,Faye>She couldn't handle the thought of being on meds.

123
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,960
<4-5,Taub>抗焦虑药能引起这种反应
<4-5,Taub>Anti-anxiety medications would explain it.

124
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,630
<4-5,Taub>如果我们停止用这药
<4-5,Taub>If we keep her off,

125
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,880
<4-5,Taub>她会情绪化  但是会很健康
<4-5,Taub>she'll be moody, but healthy.

126
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,870
<4-5,Taub>或者另有病因
<4-5,Taub>Or it's something else.

127
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,070
<5-1,House>我需要和你一起为一个病人做会诊
<5-1,House>I need to DDX a patient with you.

128
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,440
<5-2,Wilson>你不是有个干这活的团队吗
<5-2,Wilson>I thought you had a team for that.

129
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,220
<5-3,House>根据福曼的说法
<5-3,House>According to Foreman,

130
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,950
<5-3,House>他们只能用来给活人做会诊
<5-3,House>they're only for DDXing people who are still alive.

131
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,990
<5-4,Wilson>你有一个死病人吗
<5-4,Wilson>You have a dead patient?

132
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,170
<5-5,House>修饰偏见很是无聊
<5-5,House>Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.

133
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,580
<5-5,House>我不去过问他的信仰  肤色  有没有脉搏
<5-5,House>I don't see creed, color, pulse.

134
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,480
<5-6,Wilson>福曼会发现你在研究这病例
<5-6,Wilson>Foreman will find out you're taking this case,

135
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,420
<5-6,Wilson>他会告发你
<5-6,Wilson>and he'll bust you.

136
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,870
<5-6,Wilson>但这你知道
<5-6,Wilson>But you know that,

137
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,260
<5-6,Wilson>也就是说
<5-6,Wilson>which means...

138
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,390
<5-6,Wilson>你想回监狱
<5-6,Wilson>You want to go back to jail...

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,070
<5-6,Wilson>因为只有那里
<5-6,Wilson>Because it's the one place

140
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,870
<5-6,Wilson>容不得你沉溺于自我毁灭的习惯
<5-6,Wilson>you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.

141
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,540
<5-7,House>是啊  我接这个病例更有可能
<5-7,House>Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case

142
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,900
<5-7,House>是因为我怀念囹圄时光
<5-7,House>because I miss showering with cro-magnons

143
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,220
<5-7,House>而不是我真的觉得它有趣
<5-7,House>than that I actually happen to find it interesting.

144
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,620
<5-7,House>四岁大的孩子
<5-7,House>Four-year-old kid.

145
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,480
<5-7,House>先是肾脏衰竭  他们给他输血
<5-7,House>His kidneys died, they transfused.

146
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,350
<5-7,House>接着又肺衰竭  他就死了
<5-7,House>His lungs died. He died.

147
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,540
<5-8,Wilson>看过《魔鬼新娘》没有
<5-8,Wilson>Have you seen Bride Of The Monster?

148
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,200
<5-8,Wilson>我刚买到艾德·伍德电影集锦
<5-8,Wilson>I just got the Ed wood box set.

150
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,050
<5-9,House>会不会搞错顺序
<5-9,House>What if the chicken was the egg?

151
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,520
<5-9,House>如果是肺部先出的问题呢
<5-9,House>What if the lung involvement came first?

152
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,890
<5-10,Wilson>其实我不怎么在乎那部电影
<5-10,Wilson>I don't really care about the movie.

153
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,250
<5-10,Wilson>-我只是不想纵容你的...  -红斑狼疮
<5-10,Wilson>- I just don't want to indulge your- - Lupus.

154
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,940
<5-12,Wilson>因为这样做没有好下场  豪斯
<5-12,Wilson>Because this is a bad idea, House.

155
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,800
<5-13,House>如果这孩子有皮疹
<5-13,House>If the kid had a rash

156
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,080
<5-13,House>或有些循环问题
<5-13,House>or some circulation issue...

157
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,090
<5-13,House>该死
<5-13,House>Damn!

158
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,090
<5-13,House>我才发觉我愤怒控制课要去晚了
<5-13,House>I just realized I'm late for my anger management class.

159
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,850
<6-1,Gene>交通  当然是一大问题
<6-1,Gene>Traffic, for sure.

160
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,230
<6-3,Gene>税收  无疑也是
<6-3,Gene>Taxes. Definitely taxes.

161
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,550
<6-4,Lena>被宠坏的孙子孙女
<6-4,Lena>Spoiled grandchildren.

162
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,780
<6-5,House>俗
<6-5,House>Platitudes.

163
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,550
<6-6,Gene>还有其它的吗
<6-6,Gene>Any others?

164
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,570
<6-7,House>我有时发脾气是因为有人说
<6-7,House>And I lose my temper when someone suggests

165
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,860
<6-7,House>几句大众心理学的口头禅
<6-7,House>that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases

166
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,010
<6-7,House>就能控制住我们最重要的  最难以控制的
<6-7,House>can control our most seminal, intractable,

167
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,670
<6-7,House>也是最自然的  对痛失爱子的反应
<6-7,House>and natural reaction to a dead child.

168
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,490
<6-7,House>我说得对吗  埃莫雷
<6-7,House>Am I right, Emory?

169
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,520
<6-8,Gene>我觉得埃莫雷现在不想分享
<6-8,Gene>I don't think Emory wants to share right now.

170
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,540
<6-9,House>他们搞砸了  对吧
<6-9,House>They blew it, didn't they?

171
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,410
<6-9,House>他们没留意到你儿子的皮疹
<6-9,House>They missed your son's rash.

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,930
<6-9,House>不很明显  在他脖子上
<6-9,House>A faint one, on his cheek.

173
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,130
<6-10,Emory>他没有皮疹
<6-10,Emory>He didn't have a rash.

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,540
<6-10,Emory>我认为我们该聊聊莉娜的孙子  孙女
<6-10,Emory>I think we should talk about Lena's grandchildren.

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,680
<6-11,House>他们活着
<6-11,House>They're alive.

176
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,520
<6-11,House>-他对阳光敏感吗  -不
<6-11,House>- Was he sensitive to sunlight? - No.

177
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,300
<6-11,House>-格雷戈  -手脚冰凉吗
<6-11,House>- Greg... - Cold fingers and toes?

178
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,080
<6-11,House>不

180
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,400
<7-1,House>我需要给你儿子做检查
<7-1,House>I need to examine your son.

181
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
<7-2,Emory>有点晚了  混蛋
<7-2,Emory>You're a bit late for that...you ass.

182
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,720
<7-3,House>只要你和你妻子同意
<7-3,House>With you and your wife's consent,

183
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,350
<7-3,House>我们就能获准开棺验尸
<7-3,House>we can get an exhumation order.

184
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,690
<7-3,House>找出他的死因
<7-3,House>Find out what killed him.

185
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,950
<7-3,House>是前妻
<7-3,House>Ex-wife.

186
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,000
<7-4,Emory>而且她永远不会同意
<7-4,Emory>And you'll never get her consent.

187
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,010
<7-4,Emory>她已开始新生活  新丈夫  新孩子
<7-4,Emory>She's moved on-- new hub, new kid.

188
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,010
<7-4,Emory>她不想再跟德鲁的死有任何瓜葛
<7-4,Emory>She wants nothing to do with Drew's death.

189
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,400
<7-4,Emory>对我也是
<7-4,Emory>Or me.

190
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,520
<7-5,House>你愤怒是因为你儿子死了
<7-5,House>You're angry because your kid died.

191
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,590
<7-5,House>不仅如此
<7-5,House>More than that,

192
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,300
<7-5,House>更因为你还不知道死因
<7-5,House>because you don't have an answer.

193
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,980
<7-5,House>人们总想讨个说法
<7-5,House>People need answers.

194
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,020
<7-6,Emory>他葬在圣犹达公墓的一个墓室里
<7-6,Emory>He's in a crypt at St. Jude's cemetery.

195
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,810
<8-1,Adams>这里有疼痛感吗
<8-1,Adams>You feeling any pain or cramping here?

196
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,240
<8-1,Adams>一点点
<8-1,Adams>A bit.

197
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,690
<8-2,Iris>但不止那里
<8-2,Iris>But not just there, um...

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,380
<8-2,Iris>这也有
<8-2,Iris>Here.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
<8-3,Taub>乳房触痛
<8-3,Taub>Breast tenderness.

200
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,300
<8-3,Taub>你经期正常吗  艾瑞斯
<8-3,Taub>Have you been having regular periods, Iris?

201
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,000
<8-4,Iris>不太好
<8-4,Iris>Not really.

202
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,890
<8-5,Faye>怎么了
<8-5,Faye>What is it?

203
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,540
<8-6,Taub>我觉得我们应该验孕
<8-6,Taub>I think we should run a pregnancy test.

204
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,310
<8-7,Faye>艾瑞斯没有性行为
<8-7,Faye>Iris isn't sexually active.

205
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,370
<8-7,Faye>她都没有男朋友
<8-7,Faye>She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

206
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,280
<8-8,Adams>怀孕能解释所有症状
<8-8,Adams>Pregnancy would explain all of her symptoms.

207
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,670
<8-8,Adams>甚至是引起不可预知的过敏反应
<8-8,Adams>Can even cause some unpredictable allergic reactions.

208
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,460
<8-9,Iris>我都没性行为怎么会怀孕呢
<8-9,Iris>How can I be pregnant if I've never even had sex?

209
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,740
<8-10,Adams>我们只需抽点血
<8-10,Adams>We just need a drop of blood.

210
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,370
<8-11,Taub>怎么了
<8-11,Taub>What's the matter?

211
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,380
<8-12,Iris>我的
<8-12,Iris>My--

212
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,390
<8-12,Iris>我的手臂
<8-12,Iris>my arms.

213
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,580
<8-12,Iris>失去知觉了
<8-12,Iris>I can't feel my arms.

214
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,830
<9-1,House>照这么个速度
<9-1,House>At this rate,

215
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,930
<9-1,House>我就得给自己找块墓地了
<9-1,House>I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.

216
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,430
<9-2,Milton>鉴于你的慷慨捐赠
<9-2,Milton>Thanks to your generous donation,

217
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,430
<9-2,Milton>你可以待一早上
<9-2,Milton>you have all morning.

218
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,040
<9-3,House>我看就剩十三分钟了
<9-3,House>More like 13 minutes.

219
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,690
<9-4,Milton>在进去之前  医生
<9-4,Milton>Before we proceed any further, doctor,

220
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,130
<9-4,Milton>我要问你具体打算
<9-4,Milton>I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure

221
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,480
<9-4,Milton>对遗体做些什么
<9-4,Milton>you intend to perform on the remains.

222
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,910
<9-5,House>你听说过
<9-5,House>Have you ever heard of

223
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,980
<9-5,House>北美男人与死童关爱协会吗
<9-5,House>the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?

224
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,970
<9-6,Milton>这里在我眼中是个神圣的地方
<9-6,Milton>I consider these grounds to be a holy place,

225
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,180
<9-6,Milton>我得要求你礼待逝者
<9-6,Milton>and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.

226
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,940
<9-7,House>你拿红包放盗墓的进去
<9-7,House>So you're taking bribes to plunder graves,

227
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,510
<9-7,House>我却要尊重死者
<9-7,House>and I need to show respect.

228
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,850
<9-7,House>我认为他们错判了死因
<9-7,House>I think they got the cause of death wrong.

229
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,890
<9-7,House>如果我在他的鼻软骨上找到一个洞
<9-7,House>And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose,

230
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,940
<9-7,House>就在这
<9-7,House>right about here,

231
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,100
<9-7,House>就意味着我是对的
<9-7,House>then it means I'm right.

232
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
<9-8,Milton>请放尊重些
<9-8,Milton>Please be respectful.

233
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,210
<10-1,Milton>石棺已经帮你开好了
<10-1,Milton>I prepared the sarcophagus for you.

234
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,830
<10-2,House>谢谢  伊戈尔
<10-2,House>Thank you, Igor.

235
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,470
<10-3,Milton>我叫米尔顿
<10-3,Milton>It's Milton.

236
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,540
<10-4,House>尿都被你吓出来了
<10-4,House>You owe me a new pair of pants.

237
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,670
<10-5,Adams>她怀孕了  结果呈阳性
<10-5,Adams>She is pregnant. Test came back positive.

238
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,480
<10-6,House>所以  她不止失了双臂活动能力
<10-6,House>So...she lost the use of her arms

239
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,520
<10-6,House>还丢了贞节
<10-6,House>and her innocence.

240
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,600
<10-6,House>遭天谴吗
<10-6,House>A vengeful god?

241
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,140
<10-6,House>还是...
<10-6,House>Or...

242

<10-7,Taub>脑瘤

245
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,490
<10-10,House>从此刻的寂静推断
<10-10,House>I gather from the silence

246
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,510
<10-10,House>奇斯不在
<10-10,House>that Chase isn't there.

247
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,600
<11-1,Chase>错了  我就在这
<11-1,Chase>Nope, I'm here.

248
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,650
<11-1,Chase>你在哪
<11-1,Chase>Where are you?

249
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,020
<11-2,House>"哪都不在"
<11-2,House>"Nowhere"...

250
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,870
<11-2,House>他神秘兮兮地说
<11-2,House>He said cryptically.

251
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,610
<11-2,House>我想你赞同他们的诊断吧
<11-2,House>I assume you concur with the diagnosis.

252
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,650
<11-3,Chase>必须的
<11-3,Chase>Absolutely.

253
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,470
<11-4,House>同意他们的三种诊断吗
<11-4,House>Even though there are three diagnoses?

254
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,310
<11-4,House>还有  多发性硬化和血管炎
<11-4,House>And MS and vasculitis

255
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,270
<11-4,House>在怀孕之后通常都会出现好转
<11-4,House>usually get better with pregnancy.

256
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,470
<11-5,Chase>我是说我完全同意另一个观点
<11-5,Chase>Yeah, I was saying I agreed with the other one.

257
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,950
<11-6,Park>他居然修过眉毛了
<11-6,Park>He's had his eyebrows waxed.

258
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,170
<12-1,Chase>我正在约会的女孩喜欢男人修整得干干净净
<12-1,Chase>I met a woman who likes her men well groomed.

259
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,830
<12-2,House>浑身上下吗
<12-2,House>All over?

260
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,180
<12-2,House>从此刻的寂静推断
<12-2,House>I assume, from the silence,

261
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,190
<12-2,House>奇斯做了个泳装除毛
<12-2,House>that Chase has had a Brazilian.

263
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,370
<12-3,Adams>-不错啊  -有意思
<12-3,Adams>- Cool. - Interesting.

264
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,300
<12-5,Taub>蛋疼啊
<12-5,Taub>Ouch.

265
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,990
<12-6,House>问题就在于  真的只是因为女人
<12-6,House>Question is... is this really about a woman?

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
<12-6,House>还是有什么深层原因
<12-6,House>or is it about something more profound?

267
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,310
<12-7,Chase>另一个问题是  她的感觉异常
<12-7,Chase>Another question is, could the paresthesia

268
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,730
<12-7,Chase>有没有可能是性病引起的
<12-7,Chase>be caused by an STD?

269
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,570
<12-7,Chase>HIV相关性多发性单神经炎
<12-7,Chase>HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.

270
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,420
<12-7,Chase>从此刻的寂静推断
<12-7,Chase>I gather from the silence

271
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,870
<12-8,House>要么你们都赞同奇斯的观点
<12-8,House>that either you all agree with Chase

272
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,930
<12-8,House>要么就是在盯着他伪娘的眉毛
<12-8,House>or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.

273
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,770
<12-8,House>不管怎么着  先做个HIV病毒检测
<12-8,House>In either case, test for HIV

274
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,130
<12-8,House>再做个核磁共振看看是不是肿瘤
<12-8,House>and do an MRI to rule out tumors.

275
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,460
<12-8,House>顺便检查一下奇斯的睾丸激素
<12-8,House>And check Chase for testosterone.

276
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,660
<13-1,Taub>HIV血液测试呈阴性
<13-1,Taub>Blood work was negative for HIV.

277
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,050
<13-1,Taub>只能押宝在肿瘤上了
<13-1,Taub>All the money's on tumor.

278
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,030
<13-2,Adams>泳装除毛感觉如何啊
<13-2,Adams>How was the Brazilian?

279
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,410
<13-3,Chase>还行  就是有点疼
<13-3,Chase>It was fine. Hurt a bit.

280
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,730
<13-4,Adams>那豪斯的理论呢
<13-4,Adams>What about House's theory?

281
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,620
<13-4,Adams>你到底是为什么做那玩意
<13-4,Adams>Why'd you really do it?

282
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,930
<13-5,Chase>因为我又虚荣又浅薄
<13-5,Chase>cause I'm vain and shallow.

283
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,960
<13-6,Adams>你以前就不是了吗
<13-6,Adams>And you weren't before?

284
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,440
<13-7,Chase>我以前约会的女孩不看重这些
<13-7,Chase>The girl I was seeing wasn't.

285
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,720
<13-7,Chase>没什么秘密好挖的
<13-7,Chase>There's nothing profound here.

286
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,430
<13-8,Taub>也不是肿瘤
<13-8,Taub>No tumor, either.

287
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,640
<13-8,Taub>她的大脑没问题
<13-8,Taub>It's not her brain.

288
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,500
<14-1,Taub>一切正常
<14-1,Taub>Everything looks good.

289
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,270
<14-2,Adams>你怎么了
<14-2,Adams>What's the matter?

290
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,070
<14-3,Iris>我的手臂...
<14-3,Iris>My arm, it's...

291
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,140
<14-4,Chase>还是什么感觉都没有吗
<14-4,Chase>Still nothing?

292
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,520
<14-5,Iris>不是  很酸
<14-5,Iris>No, now they're sore.

293
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,970
<14-6,Adams>感觉失常的症状消失了
<14-6,Adams>Paresthesia's gone.

294
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,600
<15-1,Chase>瘀伤会不会是身体创伤留下的
<15-1,Chase>Could the bruising be caused by a physical trauma?

295
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,130
<15-2,Taub>那她得从床上摔下来多少次才能变成那样
<15-2,Taub>You think she fell out of bed, repeatedly?

296
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,640
<15-3,Park>血液疾病  可能是血小板减少症
<15-3,Park>A blood disorder. Maybe thrombocytopenia.

297
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,570
<15-4,Adams>维生素K缺乏症或者败血症
<15-4,Adams>A vitamin k deficiency or scurvy

298
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,840
<15-4,Adams>可以解释她的出血
<15-4,Adams>could explain bleeding problems,

299
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,620
<15-4,Adams>怀孕又会加重这个症状
<15-4,Adams>and pregnancy could exacerbate it.

300
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,310
<15-5,House>带把的去搜家  不带的去做检查
<15-5,House>Boys, do a home search. Girls, do lab tests.

301
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,510
<15-5,House>我很确定这不算性别歧视
<15-5,House>I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.

302
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,980
<15-6,Foreman>你去哪了
<15-6,Foreman>Where have you been?

303
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,440
<15-7,House>取了趟干净衣服
<15-7,House>Picking up dry cleaning.

304
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,540
<15-7,House>加了个油
<15-7,House>Filling up the tank.

305
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,200
<15-7,House>奸了个尸
<15-7,House>Violating the dead.

306
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,740
<15-7,House>不信的话打电话去监控公司问问
<15-7,House>If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.

307
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,500
<15-7,House>我问过了
<15-7,House>I did.

308
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,650
<15-8,Foreman>不幸的是  帕塔克森特河海军航空站
<15-8,Foreman>Unfortunately, the Patuxent river naval air station

309
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,970
<15-8,Foreman>正好在进行卫星定位测试  干扰了信号
<15-8,Foreman>was GPS testing and disrupted the signal,

310
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,280
<15-8,Foreman>而且就刚好是你不在的那45分钟
<15-8,Foreman>at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.

311
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,270
<15-9,House>要是我知道我有45分钟的自由活动时间
<15-9,House>Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom,

312
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,920
<15-9,House>我就去玩滑翔翼了
<15-9,House>I'd have gone hang gliding.

313
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,340
<15-10,Foreman>这点子我喜欢
<15-10,Foreman>I admire the creativity.

314
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,140
<15-10,Foreman>但你有没有想过要是干扰没起作用的话怎么办
<15-10,Foreman>But what happens when the stunt doesn't work?

315
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,230
<15-10,Foreman>你以为后果就是你认赌服输
<15-10,Foreman>Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet?

316
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,010
<15-10,Foreman>我罚你三倍门诊时间了事吗
<15-10,Foreman>Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours?

317
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,070
<15-10,Foreman>我会打电话给你的假释官
<15-10,Foreman>I'm gonna call your P.O.,

318
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,490
<15-10,Foreman>把你送回牢里去
<15-10,Foreman>and you're gonna go back to jail.

319
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,390
<16-1,House>他的指甲盖上有米氏线
<16-1,House>There are Mees' lines on his fingernails,

320
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,980
<16-1,House>我现在怀疑他是重金属中毒
<16-1,House>so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.

321
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,010
<16-2,Wilson>你是个瘾君子
<16-2,Wilson>You're an addict.

322
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,190
<16-2,Wilson>而我蠢到以为你只对
<16-2,Wilson>And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions

323
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,790
<16-2,Wilson>药物  反社会行为和冷嘲热讽上瘾
<16-2,Wilson>were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.

324
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,130
<31-24,Iris>不好意思
<31-24,Iris>Sorry.

325
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,770
<16-3,House>维柯丁放不下我
<16-3,House>Vicodin repeating on me.

326
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,050
<16-4,Wilson>让你上瘾的还有谜题
<16-4,Wilson>You're also addicted to puzzles.

327
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,020
<16-4,Wilson>你表现出全部的典型症状
<16-4,Wilson>You show all the classic behaviors.

328
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,330
<16-4,Wilson>说谎  不负责任
<16-4,Wilson>Lying, neglecting responsibilities,

329
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,040
<16-4,Wilson>而且不管后果多严重你都没有办法收手
<16-4,Wilson>and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.

330
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,780
<16-5,House>解决病例又没有违反保释条例
<16-5,House>Working on a medical case is not a parole violation.

331
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,130
<16-5,House>是我该做的
<16-5,House>It's my job description.

332
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,030
<16-6,Wilson>你该做的是对福曼言听计从
<16-6,Wilson>Your job description is doing what Foreman tells you to do.

333
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,670
<16-7,House>别管什么《魔鬼新娘》了
<16-7,House>Never mind Bride of the Monster.

334
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,250
<16-7,House>你真该好好看看《诺玛·蕊》
<16-7,House>You need to watch Norma Rae.

336
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,230
<17-1,House>在我们开始之前
<17-1,House>Before we get started,

337
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,940
<17-1,House>感谢大家愿意移驾到此
<17-1,House>I just want to thank you all for agreeing to relocate.

338
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,420
<17-1,House>我之前在这附近有个约会
<17-1,House>Um, I had an appointment in this part of town,

339
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,870
<17-1,House>但是我也不想错过和大家的聚会
<17-1,House>and I absolutely didn't want to miss this meeting.

340
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,080
<17-1,House>不管怎么说  谢谢你们
<17-1,House>But, uh, thank you.

341
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,610
<17-1,House>这顿我买单
<17-1,House>I'm buying.

342
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,490
<17-1,House>大家别当真
<17-1,House>Not literally.

343
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,980
<17-1,House>埃莫雷
<17-1,House>Hey, Emory,

344
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,930
<17-1,House>我们一起去趟洗手间吧
<17-1,House>should we, uh, powder our noses?

345
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,050
<17-2,House>问你啊  你知不知道你前妻
<17-2,House>Hey, did you know your ex-wife

346
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,960
<17-2,House>还住在这栋房子后面
<17-2,House>still lives right behind this place?

347
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,420
<17-2,House>她四点下班
<17-2,House>She finishes work at 4:00.

348
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,350
<17-2,House>四点一刻去接她的二儿子
<17-2,House>Picks up her new kid at 4:15.

349
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,120
<18-1,House>我们有二十分钟左右时间
<18-1,House>Gives us about 20 minutes.

350
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,230
<18-1,House>我打过几次电话
<18-1,House>I made some calls.

351
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,510
<18-1,House>如果你问得够霸气  对方会出乎意料的坦诚
<18-1,House>It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask brutally enough.

352
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,500
<18-1,House>是这张桌子吗
<18-1,House>Was that table here?

353
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,710
<18-1,House>一些经过压力处理的木材可能含砷
<18-1,House>Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.

354
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,920
<18-2,Emory>我们不该来的
<18-2,Emory>We shouldn't be here.

355
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,320
<18-3,House>我们别无选择
<18-3,House>We don't have a choice.

356
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,650
<18-3,House>这是你唯一能找到答案的办法
<18-3,House>This is the only way you're gonna get your answer.

357
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,470
<18-3,House>知道你前妻把备用钥匙藏在哪吗
<18-3,House>Does your ex leave a spare key anywhere?

358
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,300
<18-4,Emory>他看上去怎么样
<18-4,Emory>How did he look?

359
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,740
<18-5,House>很安详
<18-5,House>Peaceful.

360
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,170
<18-5,House>缺乏维生素K看来是不可能了
<18-5,House>Vitamin K deficiency's a bust.

361
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,640
<19-1,Taub>冰箱里的菠菜和西兰花
<19-1,Taub>Fridge has more spinach and broccoli

362
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,970
<19-1,Taub>比菜场的还多
<19-1,Taub>than a farmer's market.

363
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,230
<19-1,Taub>泳装除毛
<19-1,Taub>The brazilian...

364
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,580
<19-1,Taub>你说"有点疼"
<19-1,Taub>You said it hurt "a bit."

365
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,840
<19-2,Chase>你做过吗
<19-2,Chase>You've had one?

366
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,430
<19-3,Taub>不止一次  而你没有
<19-3,Taub>More than one, and you haven't.

367
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,570
<19-3,Taub>那是相当得疼
<19-3,Taub>They hurt all your bits.

368
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,600
<19-3,Taub>那是我不为人知的小秘密
<19-3,Taub>That's my dark secret.

369
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,090
<19-3,Taub>你的呢
<19-3,Taub>What's yours?

370
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,970
<19-4,Chase>我做了指甲和眉毛
<19-4,Chase>I had the nails and eyebrows done,

371
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
<19-4,Chase>仅此而已
<19-4,Chase>but that's it.

372
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,240
<19-4,Chase>我只是要分散你们的注意力
<19-4,Chase>I just needed to create a distraction, though.

373
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,500
<19-4,Chase>有次吃饭我碰到一个电视制作人
<19-4,Chase>I met a TV producer at a dinner.

374
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,400
<19-4,Chase>她让我上一个医务节目
<19-4,Chase>She asked me to appear on the medical segment.

375
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
<19-4,Chase>昨天试镜  今天拍摄
<19-4,Chase>Screen tested it yesterday and shot it today.

376
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,830
<19-5,Taub>你做电视医生了吗
<19-5,Taub>You're a TV doctor?

377
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,280
<19-6,Chase>就一次
<19-6,Chase>It's a one-off.

378
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,620
<19-7,Taub>什么时候播
<19-7,Taub>When's it air?

379
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,500
<19-8,Chase>两小时以前
<19-8,Chase>Two hours ago.

380
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,410
<19-8,Chase>不然  我现在也不会告诉你

449
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,590
<23-4,Foreman>因为之后  他就会接三个  然后四个
<23-4,Foreman>'cause next, it'll be three cases, then four.

450
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,950

<24-4,Chase>nose tuck, and arse tuck,

472
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,130
<24-4,Chase>但她的新假胸就如狗鞭般直指九天
<24-4,Chase>but her new, fake norks stick out like nuts on a mutt.

473
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,910
<25-2,House>原本的台词是

<25-6,Park>原来你只是希望在电视上显得帅点儿
<25-6,Park>So you just wanted to look pretty on TV.

479
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,690
<25-7,House>问题是  他为什么想要这样呢
<25-7,House>Question is, why did he want that?

<26-9,House>我知道  我就是找抽
<26-9,House>I know. I deserved the slap.

499
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,890
<26-9,House>但我本希望你就是不会愤怒
<26-9,House>But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it.

500
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,890
<26-9,House>淡漠型甲状腺机能亢进
<26-9,House>Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

501
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,380
<26-9,House>可能是肾脏引起的  或是与基因有关
<26-9,House>Could have kidney involvement. Could be genetic.

502
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,140
<26-9,House>一定会引起冷漠反应
<26-9,House>Definitely causes apathy.

503
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,910
<26-9,House>我本指望你的冷漠
<26-9,House>I was hoping that your lack of emotion

504
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,050
<26-9,House>是你遗传给你第一个儿子的
<26-9,House>was a symptom of something you could

505
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,650
<26-9,House>一种症状呢
<26-9,House>have passed on to your first son.

506
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,780
<26-10,Mickey>你认识埃莫雷
<26-10,Mickey>You know Emory.

507
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,620
<26-11,House>我们是同一家俱乐部的
<26-11,House>We belong to the same club.

508
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,990
<26-12,Mickey>他想再经历这一切
<26-12,Mickey>He wants to relive this.

509
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,450
<26-12,Mickey>我不想
<26-12,Mickey>I don't.

510
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,400
<26-13,House>我听说了
<26-13,House>So I heard.

511
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,650
<26-14,Mickey>埃莫雷是个好男人
<26-14,Mickey>Emory was a wonderful man.

512
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,730
<26-14,Mickey>从不惧于展现自己的情感
<26-14,Mickey>Never afraid to show his emotions.

513
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,500
<26-14,Mickey>大多数情况下  这很好
<26-14,Mickey>Which is great, most of the time.

514
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,900
<26-14,Mickey>但德鲁死后...
<26-14,Mickey>But when Drew died...

515
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,220
<26-14,Mickey>他悲痛不能自已
<26-14,Mickey>It overwhelmed him.

516
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,810
<26-14,Mickey>我发誓不会像他一样
<26-14,Mickey>I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.

517
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,070
<26-15,House>这就是你离开他的原因吗
<26-15,House>That's why you left him?

518
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,760
<26-16,Mickey>我离开是因为他的眼睛
<26-16,Mickey>I left because of his eyes.

519
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,300
<26-16,Mickey>和德鲁一模一样
<26-16,Mickey>He had Drew's eyes.

520
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,570
<26-17,House>以前是谁照看德鲁的
<26-17,House>Who used to babysit Drew?

521
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,410
<26-18,Mickey>我父亲  但...
<26-18,Mickey>My father, but--

522
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,790
<26-19,House>在他家还是你家
<26-19,House>His place or yours?

523
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,340
<26-21,House>有两种人
<26-21,House>There are two types of people.

524
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,680
<26-20,Mickey>有些人迎接新生活  有些人沉溺于往事
<26-20,Mickey>Those who can move on, and those who can't.

525
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,930
<26-20,Mickey>我父亲外表看来已经释然了
<26-20,Mickey>My father keeps up a good front,

526
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,570
<26-20,Mickey>但其实他和埃莫雷一样
<26-20,Mickey>but he's just like Emory.

527
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,800
<26-20,Mickey>别去烦他
<26-20,Mickey>You need to leave him alone.

528
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,330
<26-21,House>这就是说他有双重人格
<26-21,House>So he has two types of people inside of him.

529
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,610
<27-1,House>脑血管造影检查没有异常
<27-1,House>MRA was normal.

530
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,680
<27-2,Taub>没错  你怎么...
<27-2,Taub>Yeah, how did--

531
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,560
<27-3,House>我找到你男友住的地方了
<27-3,House>I found out where your boyfriend lives.

532
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,150
<27-3,House>我去拜访他的时候  他跑了
<27-3,House>When I paid him a visit, he took off.

533
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,970
<27-3,House>被一辆车撞了
<27-3,House>Ran in front of a car.

534
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,480
<27-4,Iris>你在撒谎
<27-4,Iris>You're lying.

535
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,170
<27-5,House>他正在楼下的急救室呢
<27-5,House>He's down in the E.R. right now.

536
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,990
<27-6,Iris>闭嘴  你个臭骗子
<27-6,Iris>Shut up, you lying sack of crap.

537
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,210
<27-7,Faye>艾瑞斯
<27-7,Faye>Iris!

538
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,040
<27-8,House>你怎么知道我在撒谎呢
<27-8,House>How do you know I'm lying?

539
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,510
<27-8,House>你怎么知道你男友没事呢
<27-8,House>How do you know your boyfriend's okay?

540
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,710
<27-9,Iris>因为我就在这儿呢  混蛋
<27-9,Iris>Cause I'm right here, you dick.

541
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,210
<27-10,Chase>艾瑞斯有分离性身份识别障碍
<27-10,Chase>Iris has dissociative identity disorder.

542
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,070
<27-10,Chase>也就是多重人格障碍
<27-10,Chase>Also known as multiple personality disorder.

543
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,070
<27-11,Iris>你是说我疯了吗
<27-11,Iris>Are you saying I'm crazy?

544
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,970
<27-12,Chase>这是大脑对严重外伤的反应
<27-12,Chase>It's the mind's response to a severe trauma.

545
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,710
<27-12,Chase>当人们经历了难以接受的事情
<27-12,Chase>A person experiences something that's too difficult to accept,

546
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,670
<27-12,Chase>他们会创造出另一个不用接受现实的人格
<27-12,Chase>so they create alternate personalities that don't have to accept it.

547
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,900
<27-12,Chase>有人认为这是种自然反应
<27-12,Chase>Some think it's quite a natural reaction.

548
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,320
<27-13,Faye>艾瑞斯没经历过什么严重外伤
<27-13,Faye>Iris hasn't had any severe traumas.

549
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,710
<27-14,Taub>那场车祸呢
<27-14,Taub>The car accident?

550
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,130
<27-15,Iris>那时我才两岁
<27-15,Iris>I was two.

551
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,400
<27-15,Iris>我什么都不记得
<27-15,Iris>I don't remember anything.

552
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,340
<27-15,Iris>我的这些多重人格...
<27-15,Iris>These personalities that I'm supposed to have...

553
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,280
<27-15,Iris>他们在哪儿呢
<27-15,Iris>Where are they?

554
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,340
<27-16,Taub>只有在你害怕或焦虑的时候他们才出现
<27-16,Taub>They only come out when you're afraid or anxious.

555
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,540
<27-16,Taub>所以豪斯才用了男友受伤的故事
<27-16,Taub>That's why House used the hurt boyfriend story.

556
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,990
<27-17,Faye>但是如果她没有男友
<27-17,Faye>But if there's no boyfriend,

557
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,360
<27-17,Faye>这些伤痕是哪儿来的呢
<27-17,Faye>where did the bruises come from?

558
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,770
<27-17,Faye>还有怀孕呢
<27-17,Faye>The pregnancy?

559
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,900
<27-18,Chase>当你说你男友打了你
<27-18,Chase>When you say your boyfriend hit you,

560
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,040
<27-18,Chase>其实是你自己打了自己
<27-18,Chase>it means you actually hit yourself.

561
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,510
<27-19,Taub>至于怀孕...
<27-19,Taub>And the pregnancy...

562
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,160
<27-19,Taub>并不需要有男友
<27-19,Taub>Doesn't take a boyfriend.

563
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,060
<27-19,Taub>只要有个男生就行
<27-19,Taub>Just a boy.

564
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,740
<27-19,Taub>你可能做了很多事  自己却不知道
<27-19,Taub>You may not be aware of half the things you've done.

565
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,590
<27-20,Faye>为什么她发生了那么大的事
<27-20,Faye>How could this be happening to my own daughter

566
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,450
<27-20,Faye>我却一点也不知情
<27-20,Faye>without me knowing it?

567
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,240
<27-21,Taub>安定掩盖了症状
<27-21,Taub>Diazepam was masking it.

568
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,220
<27-21,Taub>停药后症状凸显出来了
<27-21,Taub>Taking her off made it more apparent.

569
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,770
<27-22,Iris>但是我没有服用
<27-22,Iris>But I--I wasn't on...

570
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,210
<27-22,Iris>安定
<27-22,Iris>"Diazepam"?

571
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,440
<27-22,Iris>那是什么药
<27-22,Iris>What is that?

572
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,350
<27-23,Faye>就是我给你吃的那些维生素
<27-23,Faye>That's what those vitamin pills were.

573
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,840
<27-23,Faye>艾瑞斯  我对不起你
<27-23,Faye>Iris...I am so sorry.

574
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,860
<27-23,Faye>我觉得你有些情绪化
<27-23,Faye>I just, I thought you were moody.

575
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,430
<27-23,Faye>我不想让你感觉你需要药物治疗
<27-23,Faye>I didn't want you to think you needed medication.

576
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,440
<27-23,Faye>我的天啊
<27-23,Faye>Oh, my god.

577
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,530
<27-23,Faye>不敢相信我这么蠢
<27-23,Faye>I can't believe how stupid I've been.

578
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,070
<27-24,Chase>我们需要你帮个忙
<27-24,Chase>We need you to help us with something.

579
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,820
<27-24,Chase>你不同的人格有各自的症状
<27-24,Chase>Different alters can have different apparent symptoms.

580
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,160
<27-24,Chase>有过敏  感觉异常  视力损伤
<27-24,Chase>Allergies, paresthesia, vision loss,

581
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,770
<27-25,Iris>-以及血压波动等  -你认为是我装的
<27-25,Iris>- changes in blood pressure. - Do you think I'm making this up?

582
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,120
<27-26,Chase>你的症状是真实的
<27-26,Chase>Your symptoms are real.

583
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,850
<27-26,Chase>有些是生理上的
<27-26,Chase>But some are physiological,

584
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,880
<27-26,Chase>有些是心理上的
<27-26,Chase>and others are psychological.

585
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,790
<27-27,Faye>这么说除了多重人格之外
<27-27,Faye>So there's something wrong with her...

586
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,800
<27-27,Faye>她还得了别的病吗
<27-27,Faye>in addition to the multiple personalities?

587
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,570
<27-28,Chase>是的  但目前无法下定论
<27-28,Chase>Yes, but we won't know what

588
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,700
<27-28,Chase>需要唤醒其它人格  并对比他们的症状
<27-28,Chase>until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.

589
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,540
<27-29,Iris>这要怎么做到
<27-29,Iris>Well, how do you do that?

590
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,390
<27-30,Chase>用催眠术
<27-30,Chase>Hypnosis.

591
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,530
<28-1,Wilson>福曼不会让步的
<28-1,Wilson>Foreman's not gonna back down.

592
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,180
<28-2,House>他没那么白痴
<28-2,House>He's not an idiot.

593
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,240
<28-3,Wilson>他就是那么白痴
<28-3,Wilson>Yes, he is.

594
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,150
<28-3,Wilson>和你一样
<28-3,Wilson>Just like you.

595
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,780
<28-3,Wilson>如果你继续玩硬的
<28-3,Wilson>If you keep being stubborn,

596
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,230
<28-3,Wilson>他也会奉陪下去
<28-3,Wilson>he will keep being stubborn.

597
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,020
<28-3,Wilson>最终你会捅出篓子
<28-3,Wilson>Eventually, you will screw something up,

598
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,920
<28-3,Wilson>你们俩都吃不了兜着走
<28-3,Wilson>which will be bad news for both of you.

599
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,820
<28-3,Wilson>但是你们中间只有一个会面临牢狱之灾
<28-3,Wilson>But...only one of you will be in prison.

600
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,290
<28-3,Wilson>豪斯  这真的不值
<28-3,Wilson>It just isn't worth it, House.

601
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,760
<28-4,House>好吧
<28-4,House>Okay.

602
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,520
<28-4,House>是的  先生
<28-4,House>Uh, y-yes, sir.

603
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,570
<29-1,House>我是说预约去做脊柱按摩
<29-1,House>I--yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment,

604
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,250
<29-1,House>但是我爆胎了
<29-1,House>but, uh, I got a flat.

605
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,750
<29-1,House>是啊
<29-1,House>I know, right?

606
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,470
<29-1,House>所以
<29-1,House>So...

607
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,070
<29-1,House>别派巡警来抓我哦
<29-1,House>You know, don't send out the marines.

608
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,520
<29-1,House>我过几分钟就能上路了
<29-1,House>I should be back on the road in a few minutes.

609
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,630
<29-1,House>好的  再见
<29-1,House>Okay, bye.

610
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,050
<29-1,House>我是詹姆斯·威尔森医生  县验尸官
<29-1,House>Dr. James Wilson, county coroner.

611
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,950
<29-1,House>我有几个问题  是关于你孙子德鲁·勒梅茵的
<29-1,House>I'd like to ask you about your grandson, Drew Lemaine.

612
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,600
<29-1,House>他在你家的时候都干些什么
<29-1,House>What did he do when he was here?

613
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,050
<30-1,House>他在哪里玩耍  在哪里进餐

628
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,430
<31-3,Chase>你总有个名字吧
<31-3,Chase>You must be somebody.

629
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,830
<31-4,Iris>我太渺小
<31-4,Iris>I'm too little.

630
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,020
<31-4,Iris>没人注意我
<31-4,Iris>Nobody sees me.

631
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,450
<31-4,Iris>没人知道我的存在
<31-4,Iris>Nobody knows I'm here.

632

<31-5,Adams>血压变为140  90
<31-5,Adams>Bp just went to 140 over 90.

<31-8,Chase>你感觉不到手臂吗

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,360
<31-8,Chase>没关系  我们能治好的
<31-8,Chase>It's okay. We can fix that.

637
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,280
<31-8,Chase>还有哪里疼吗
<31-8,Chase>Do you hurt anywhere else?

638
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,960
<31-9,Iris>现在不疼
<31-9,Iris>Not right now.

639
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,380
<31-10,Chase>但之前会疼吗
<31-10,Chase>But you used to hurt?

640
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,910
<31-11,Iris>我吃草莓的时候
<31-11,Iris>When I ate strawberries.

641
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,620
<31-11,Iris>还有当我回忆起过去
<31-11,Iris>And when I remember...

<31-14,Father>艾瑞斯
<31-14,Father>Iris?

647

<31-15,Faye>你为什么不告诉我
<31-15,Faye>Why didn't you ever tell me?

648
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,890
<31-16,Iris>是我害死了爸爸
<31-16,Iris>It was my fault daddy died.

649
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,670
<31-17,Faye>不是的
<31-17,Faye>Oh, no. No.

650
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,900
<31-18,Iris>是我害的
<31-18,Iris>Yes, it was.

651
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,170
<31-18,Iris>当时我哭得他都没法开车了
<31-18,Iris>I was crying, and he couldn't drive.

652
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,410
<31-18,Iris>都是我的错
<31-18,Iris>It was my fault daddy's...

653
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,720
<31-19,Faye>宝贝  不是的
<31-19,Faye>Oh, no. No, no, honey.

654
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,010
<31-21,Faye>你当时只是个孩子
<31-21,Faye>Yes. You were just a baby.

655
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,210
<31-21,Faye>不是你的错
<31-21,Faye>It wasn't your fault. No, shh.

656
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,730
<31-21,Faye>是我的错
<31-21,Faye>It was my fault.

657
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,170
<31-22,Iris>我很抱歉  妈妈
<31-22,Iris>I'm sorry, mommy.

658
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,350
<31-24,Iris>对不起
<31-24,Iris>I'm so sorry.

659
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,650
<32-1,Chase>她没有流产
<32-1,Chase>It wasn't a miscarriage.

660
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,400
<32-1,Chase>检查表明她还怀着呢
<32-1,Chase>Test shows she's still pregnant.

661
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,280
<32-1,Chase>把没在每个人格都出现的症状划掉
<32-1,Chase>Okay, cross out everything that doesn't appear in every alter.

662
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,900
<32-2,Taub>当她打开预言球的时候
<32-2,Taub>When she opened the magic 8 ball,

663
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
<32-2,Taub>触动了一个
<32-2,Taub>that triggered a switch

664
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,510
<32-2,Taub>对草莓过敏的人格
<32-2,Taub>to a personality with a strawberry allergy.

665
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,050
<32-3,Adams>怀孕  阴道出血  高血压
<32-3,Adams>Pregnancy, vaginal bleeding, and elevated B.P.

666
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,360
<32-4,Park>可能是先兆子痫
<32-4,Park>Could be pre-eclampsia.

667
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,960
<32-5,Adams>最糟的情况是宫外孕
<32-5,Adams>Worst case, could be an ectopic pregnancy.

668
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,340
<32-6,Chase>我们要做个超声波
<32-6,Chase>We need to ultrasound.

669
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,110
<33-1,Adams>输卵管内未见胚胎
<33-1,Adams>Not seeing an embryo in the fallopian tube.

670
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,590
<33-2,Chase>哪里都没有胚胎
<33-2,Chase>I'm not seeing an embryo anywhere.

671
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,930
<33-2,Chase>哪个白痴做的孕检
<33-2,Chase>Which idiot did the pregnancy test?

672
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,520
<34-1,House>一次是我做的  一次是奇斯做的
<34-1,House>I did one of them. Chase did another.

673
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,680
<34-2,Adams>后来陶博又检查了一次  三次都是阳性
<34-2,Adams>Taub did a third. Three tests, three positives.

674
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,400
<34-2,Adams>你眼睛怎么了
<34-2,Adams>What happened to your eye?

675
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,010
<34-3,House>我摸了朴克的屁股
<34-3,House>I grabbed Park's ass.

676
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,780
<34-3,House>太阳系外行星
<34-3,House>Exoplanets.

677
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,590
<34-4,Adams>他刚刚说太阳系外行星
<34-4,Adams>I think he said exoplanets.

678
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,600
<34-5,Chase>等他说完
<34-5,Chase>Wait for it...

679
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,230
<34-6,House>我们实际上看不到它们
<34-6,House>We can't actually see them...

680
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,700
<34-6,House>却可以推断出它们的存在
<34-6,House>but we infer their existence

681
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,060
<34-6,House>因为它们对所环绕的恒星会产生一定影响
<34-6,House>because of the effect they have on the star they orbit.

682
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,620
<34-7,Chase>孕检只能通过上升的人绒毛膜促性腺激素水平
<34-7,Chase>Pregnancy test only infers an embryo's existence

683
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,750
<34-7,Chase>推断出胎儿的存在
<34-7,Chase>because of  elevated HCG levels.

684
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,040
<34-8,Adams>宫绒毛膜癌同样会引起激素水平上升
<34-8,Adams>Which could also be caused by choriocarcinoma,

685
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,570
<34-8,Adams>并且会影响到激素分泌  造成妊娠假象
<34-8,Adams>which affects the placenta, mimics pregnancy,

686
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,580
<34-8,Adams>并引发血压上升和阴道出血
<34-8,Adams>and causes elevated BP and vaginal bleeding.

687
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,220
<34-9,Chase>隐匿性绒癌
<34-9,Chase>Occult choriocarcinoma,

688
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,310
<34-9,Chase>因此超声波未能显示
<34-9,Chase>which is why we didn't see it on the ultrasound.

689
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,830
<34-10,House>告诉她所有的人格
<34-10,House>Tell all the alters

690
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,300
<34-10,House>他们患了癌症
<34-10,House>that they have cancer.

691
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,330
<35-1,Wilson>妈妈还是爸爸
<35-1,Wilson>Mom or dad?

692
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,940
<35-2,House>妈妈  爸爸  还有妈妈的爸爸
<35-2,House>Mom, dad, and mom's dad.

693
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,890
<35-2,House>好消息是  我终于意识到你是对的
<35-2,House>The good news is, made me realize that you were right.

694
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,270
<35-2,House>我就是放不下
<35-2,House>I can't drop it.

695
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,310
<35-2,House>不过在接受了这个事实之后
<35-2,House>But now that I accept that,

696
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,860
<35-2,House>我心里就不那么矛盾了
<35-2,House>I feel much less conflicted.

697
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,340
<35-2,House>我已经排除了韦格纳肉芽肿
<35-2,House>I've ruled out Wegener's,

698
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,960
<35-2,House>比格氏病  重金属中毒
<35-2,House>Berger's, heavy metal poison...

699
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,760
<35-3,Wilson>两列火车就要相撞
<35-3,Wilson>Two trains are about to collide,

700
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,180
<35-3,Wilson>而我竟然在劝它们不要相撞
<35-3,Wilson>and I'm trying to talk them out of it.

701
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,790
<35-4,House>感觉我漏掉了什么
<35-4,House>Feels like I'm missing something.

702
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,550
<35-5,Wilson>不  不  你不想听我说话
<35-5,Wilson>No, no. You don't want to listen to me,

703
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,670
<35-5,Wilson>那我也不想听你说
<35-5,Wilson>then I don't want to listen to you.

704
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,270
<35-6,House>-真是孩子气  -我同意
<35-6,House>- That is so fifth grade. - I agree.

705
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,190
<35-7,Wilson>知道为什么吗
<35-7,Wilson>And you know why?

706
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,520
<35-7,Wilson>因为我不比你强
<35-7,Wilson>Because I'm just as bad as you.

707
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,010
<35-7,Wilson>我明知道你会充耳不闻
<35-7,Wilson>I knew this would fall on deaf ears,

708
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,250
<35-7,Wilson>可我还是不停地说下去
<35-7,Wilson>but I just kept talking and talking.

709
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,430
<35-8,House>你说的对
<35-8,House>You're right.

710
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,340
<35-9,Wilson>你都不知道我刚刚说了什么
<35-9,Wilson>You don't even know what I just said.

711
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,660
<35-10,House>才怪
<35-10,House>That is ridiculous.

712
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,920
<35-10,House>你说什么什么耳不闻
<35-10,House>You said, "Blah blah blah blah blah, deaf ears,

00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,740
<36-12,Ray>离他们远点
<36-12,Ray>Get away from them!

734
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,850
<36-13,Emory>豪斯  豪斯
<36-13,Emory>House, House!

735
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,400
<36-14,House>那是遗传病
<36-14,House>It's a genetic condition!

736
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,110
<36-15,Ray>-闭嘴  -遗传性的
<36-15,Ray>- Shut up! - Genetic!

737
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,870
<36-16,House>你父亲有那种基因
<36-16,House>Your father has the gene.

738
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,110
<36-16,House>你也有
<36-16,House>So do you.

739
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,310
<36-16,House>外公的耳背让我猜到了根源
<36-16,House>It's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.

740
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,410
<36-16,House>你明显是无症状的
<36-16,House>You're apparently asymptomatic.

741
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,570
<36-16,House>但你还是有可能把基因遗传给你的孩子
<36-16,House>You could still pass the gene onto your children.

742
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,320
<36-16,House>两个孩子
<36-16,House>Plural.

743
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,310
<36-17,Mickey>你撒谎
<36-17,Mickey>You're lying.

744
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,050
<36-18,House>他有高频听力损伤
<36-18,House>He has high-frequency hearing impairment.

745
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,100
<36-18,House>德鲁也一样
<36-18,House>And so did Drew.

746
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,820
<36-18,House>所以德鲁才自己造词
<36-18,House>That's why Drew made up his own words.

747
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,110
<36-18,House>因为他听不清楚
<36-18,House>'cause he couldn't hear properly.

748
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,440
<36-18,House>不用担心  我们已经清楚了病因
<36-18,House>It's okay. Now that we know what it is,

749
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,280
<36-18,House>他需要治疗  但是可以活下来
<36-18,House>he'll need treatment, but he'll live.

750
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,910
<36-18,House>要知道  控制愤怒的课程屡见不鲜
<36-18,House>You know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.

751
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,040
<36-19,Mickey>我也想他
<36-19,Mickey>I miss him too.

752
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,470
<37-1,Adams>她的反应很好
<37-1,Adams>She's responding well.

753
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,800
<37-1,Adams>卡迪用门诊时间来威胁他
<37-1,Adams>Cuddy threatened him with clinic duty.

754
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,140
<38-1,Foreman>我以为用监狱来威胁他会有所不同
<38-1,Foreman>I thought threatening him with jail would be different.

755
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,510
<38-2,Wilson>这么想也不无道理
<38-2,Wilson>Not an irrational thought.

756
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,550
<38-3,Foreman>我还是要送他回去
<38-3,Foreman>I'm still sending him back.

757
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,930
<38-4,Wilson>他救了两条人命
<38-4,Wilson>He saved two lives.

758
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,220
<38-5,Foreman>所以说我再让步已经来不及了
<38-5,Foreman>Which means it's too late for me to back down.

759
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,770
<38-5,Foreman>我已经别无选择
<38-5,Foreman>It's no longer my choice.

760
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,510
<38-5,Foreman>否则就等于告诉他  以后可以肆意妄为
<38-5,Foreman>It's just me telling him he can get away with anything.

761
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,810
<38-5,Foreman>我必须送他回监狱
<38-5,Foreman>I have to send him to prison.

762
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,690
<38-6,Wilson>你的工作是维持医院的运转
<38-6,Wilson>Your job is to keep this machine running.

763
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,790
<38-6,Wilson>豪斯是可用之材还是害群之马
<38-6,Wilson>It's your choice to make House a useful tool

764
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,270
<38-6,Wilson>完全在于你怎样利用
<38-6,Wilson>or a monkey wrench.

765
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,640
<38-6,Wilson>卡迪能成功领导他
<38-6,Wilson>Cuddy's way didn't fail

766
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,420
<38-6,Wilson>是因为她没有去控制豪斯
<38-6,Wilson>because she didn't try to control House.

767
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,100
<38-6,Wilson>而是支配他
<38-6,Wilson>She managed him.

768
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,550
<38-6,Wilson>她比所有人都更清楚他有时多混蛋
<38-6,Wilson>She knew better than anybody what a tool he could be.

769
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,870
<39-1,Foreman>卡迪在的话会怎么做
<39-1,Foreman>What would Cuddy have done?

770
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,760
<39-2,House>十小时门诊
<39-2,House>Ten clinic hours.

771
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,190
<39-3,Foreman>卡迪不当家了
<39-3,Foreman>Cuddy's not here anymore.

772
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,220
<39-3,Foreman>三十小时
<39-3,Foreman>You got 30.
