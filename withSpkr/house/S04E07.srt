<33-4,TAUB>I think Dr. House is wrong

452
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,160
<33-4,TAUB>而且类固醇治疗可能会很危险
<33-4,TAUB>and that the steroid/treatment could be dangerous.

453
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,770
<33-4,TAUB>我想我可以让House撤手这个病例
<33-4,TAUB>I think I can get house/thrown off the case,

454

459
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,300
<34-3,HOUSE>除非我们这里有一个老家伙/在他的耳边说了什么
<34-3,HOUSE>unless a former fellow of/mine was chirping in his ear.

<34-8,TAUB>液体没有排出
<34-8,TAUB>Fluids aren't draining properly.

466
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,510
<34-9,HOUSE>莫非你主要的兴趣 是给我捣乱?
<34-9,HOUSE>Temptation to come screw/with me just too much for you?

708
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,850
<48-7,HOUSE>或许类固醇仅仅缓和了他的症状
<48-7,HOUSE>or the steroids have just/tempered his condition.

709
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,910
<48-8,HOUSE>剪短头发并不能改善发质
<48-8,HOUSE>he had a haircut,still got bad hair.

<48-11,HOUSE>如果是莱姆病的话
<48-11,HOUSE>on the other hand,if/he has lyme disease,

714
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,900
<48-11,HOUSE>应该会出现一些其他的细微症状
<48-11,HOUSE>there would be other subtle clues,

715
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,870
<48-11,HOUSE>比如大面积的环状红斑

720
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,960
<48-14,TAUB>你觉得正常是不正常的
<48-14,TAUB>you don't think normal's healthy.

721
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,330
<48-15,VOLAKIS>也许是风湿热
<48-15,VOLAKIS>could be rheumatic fever.

722
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,850
<48-15,VOLAKIS>也可以被类固醇有效控制
<48-15,VOLAKIS>also explains why the steroids helped.

<48-15,VOLAKIS>与莱姆病类似的炎症性疾病
<48-15,VOLAKIS>it's a similar inflammatory disease.

724
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,620
<48-16,COLE>风湿热不会导致肝功能衰竭
<48-16,COLE>rheumatic fever doesn't/explain liver failure.

725
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,580
<48-17,HOUSE>Taub认为是那头疼药引起的

728
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
<48-18,TAUB>如果他有好转 心脏可以自己跳动
<48-18,TAUB>if he's better,his heart'll/beat just fine on its own,

729
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,760
<48-18,TAUB>那么就可以继续手术
<48-18,TAUB>and then he can have his operation.

730
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,730
<48-19,HOUSE>如果我是对的话 他的心跳将会停止
<48-19,HOUSE>if I'm right,his heart will stop.

776
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,650
<51-8,DARNELL>House自己都不确定
<51-8,DARNELL>dr. House doesn't think he's right.

777
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,640
<51-9,THIRTEEN>那我最多只是浪费几个小时观察手术
<51-9,THIRTEEN>well,then,I'll just waste a/few hours watching a surgery.

778
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,350
<51-11,CHASE>比较棘手的是 从这里一直到颅底都需要修复
<51-11,CHASE>the danger is we have to reconstruct/all the way down to the cranial base.

<55-10,HOUSE>你放弃自己的事业就是为了息事宁人?
<55-10,HOUSE>so you gave up your chosen/career just so they'd be quiet?
