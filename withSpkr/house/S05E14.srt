<11-9,Wilson>但你这个解释也不错
<11-9,Wilson>But your explanation's good too.

239
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,900
<11-9,Wilson>虽然有违你的本性 但是...
<11-9,Wilson>It's completely inconsistent withabcyour character, but...

<13-4,Taub>那是10年前了 一切都不一样了

277
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,950
<13-6,Taub>我当时这么说abc是为了和你上床
<13-6,Taub>I said it because Iabcwanted to sleep with you.

278
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,670
<13-6,Taub>后来我爱上了你
<13-6,Taub>And then I fellin love with you.

279
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,750
<13-6,Taub>才发现自己真的不介意
<13-6,Taub>And I realized that Iabcreally could be okay with it.

280
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,900
<13-6,Taub>不是说我想孩子想得发疯
<13-6,Taub>It wasn't like I had this burningabcdesire to have children.

<13-7,Rachel>上帝 你因此怨恨我? 所以你才--
<13-7,Rachel>God, have you been resentingabcme all this time?Is that why--

283
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,130
<13-8,Taub>我只是...突然想到了
<13-8,Taub>I'm just... revisiting.

284
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,370
<13-9,Rachel>我不是说着玩玩的
<13-9,Rachel>This isn't a whim for me.

285
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,370
<13-9,Rachel>我经过深思熟虑才abc作出了这个决定
<13-9,Rachel>It's not a decision that I made lightly.

286

<13-10,Taub>你没有想过 有了孩子会怎么样?
<13-10,Taub>Don't you ever wonder whatabcit would be like?

287
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,350

<13-11,Rachel>All the time.

288
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,400
<13-11,Rachel>但还不足以让我付诸实践
<13-11,Rachel>Just not enough to make me want to do it.

289
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,690
<13-11,Rachel>我喜欢我们现在的生活
<13-11,Rachel>I like our life.

<14-2,Thirteen>今早为什么不做这个测试?
<14-2,Thirteen>Why didn't we do this test this morning?

<14-6,Thirteen>I am on the drug.

298
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,120
<14-6,Thirteen>那你是不是得向他们报告abc并让我停止服药?
<14-6,Thirteen>Does this mean you have toabctell them and take me off it?

299
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,500
<14-7,Foreman>是 也不是
<14-7,Foreman>No, and yes.

<14-8,Thirteen>只要我停止服药abc就什么事也没了
<14-8,Thirteen>I'll stop taking the drug,andabceverything should be fine.

<14-9,Thirteen>样本对芽生菌病测试呈阴性
<14-9,Thirteen>Specimen's negative for blasmycosis.

<14-13,Thirteen>让我服用不知能否帮到我的药物
<14-13,Thirteen>to give me a drug we're notabceven sure will help me.

312
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,570
<14-13,Thirteen>我一时无法接受
<14-13,Thirteen>I don't think I'm ready for that.

313
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,840
<14-13,Thirteen>Miller医生?

<15-2,Dana>我不知道 我在睡觉 觉得很痒
<15-2,Dana>I don't know. I wasabcsleeping. It's so itchy.

317
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,050
<15-3,Foreman>你在睡梦中挠痒
<15-3,Foreman>You were scratching it in your sleep.

318
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,340
<15-3,Foreman>把头挠破露出了头骨
<15-3,Foreman>You scratched right through your skull.

319
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,700
<15-3,Foreman>这是脑浆
<15-3,Foreman>This is brain matter.

321
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,030
<15-3,Foreman>我给她做了个自由皮瓣缝合abc以免留下疤痕
<15-3,Foreman>I did a free flap closure toabcavoid any scarring.

322
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,470
<15-3,Foreman>算她走运-- 破损没有导致脑损伤
<15-3,Foreman>She was lucky--the scratching didn'tabccause any brain damage.

323
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,400
<16-1,Taub>但她术后醒来说的第一件事abc还是觉得很痒
<16-1,Taub>But the first thing she said when weabcwoke her up was it still itches.

324

<16-2,House>痒的传感器只存在于皮肤表面两层
<16-2,House>Itch receptors are only inabcthe top two layers of skin.

325
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,630
<16-2,House>就是说 她不是真的痒abc而是她以为自己很痒
<16-2,House>Which means she's not actuallyabcitchy, she just thinks she is.

326
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,640
<16-3,Taub>就是说问题出在脑子里?
<16-3,Taub>So the problem's in her brain?

<16-4,Thirteen>Sorry, I have a headache.

329
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,900

<16-5,Kutner>could be psychogenic. She madeabcbig, sudden change in her life.

330
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,020
<16-5,Kutner>可能是心理失衡导致的
<16-5,Kutner>Could be the resultabcof a mental imbalance.

331
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,600
<16-6,Taub>她做自己想做的事abc这有什么问题?
<16-6,Taub>She wants to dowhat she wantsabcto do. What's crazy about that?

332
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,030
<16-7,Kutner>那她为什么非辞职不可?
<16-7,Kutner>why do you have to quit to do it?

333
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,430
<16-7,Kutner>我做某件事 是因为我想去做
<16-7,Kutner>If I want to do something,I do it.

<17-5,Foreman>你吃的是指定剂量的两倍
<17-5,Foreman>You're taking twice the indicated amount.

350
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,220
<17-6,Thirteen>我离开药物不过24小时
<17-6,Thirteen>I've only been off the drug for 24 hours,

351
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,620
<17-6,Thirteen>我想你不满是因为我abc离开了你24小时吧
<17-6,Thirteen>so I think the bigger issue here isabcthat I've been off you for 24 hours.

<18-2,House>因为个人成就感什么的
<18-2,House>Something about personal fulfillment.

361
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,560
<18-3,Cuddy>这只是职业妇女为不能陪伴孩子找的借口
<18-3,Cuddy>That's just a rationalization by workingabcmoms to justify not being with their kids.

362
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,910
<18-3,Cuddy>她们有权选择 但不是我想要的生活
<18-3,Cuddy>Which is fine,if that's whatabcthey want. It's not what I want.

363
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,500
<18-3,Cuddy>这是一本护士季刊
<18-3,Cuddy>And this is nurses quarterly.

364
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,250
<18-4,House>重点是--

<18-5,Cuddy>你来这里的唯一目的是把abc脏兮兮的拖把水溅到我的地毯上
<18-5,Cuddy>you're only here to get back at me byabcdumping dirty mop water on my carpet.

366
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,650
<18-5,Cuddy>要干就快些 让我专心工作
<18-5,Cuddy>Just get it over with soabcI can get back to work.

<18-5,Cuddy>I'm sorry.

368
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:10,150
<18-5,Cuddy>我想...我们当中总得有人承担风险
<18-5,Cuddy>I figured... I don't know, oneabcof us needed to go out on a limb.

369
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,090
<19-1,Foreman>我以为能帮你
<19-1,Foreman>I thought I could help you.

<19-2,Thirteen>我要保持不动 很难和你交谈
<19-2,Thirteen>It's hard to have a conversationabcwhen I'm trying not to move.

371

<20-1,Taub>没有肿瘤 没有损伤
<20-1,Taub>No tumors,no lesions.

<20-2,Kutner>Where's your cane?

375
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,780
<20-3,House>你们的同事呢?
<20-3,House>Where are your coworkers?

376

<20-5,Kutner>- 我拷过他们了abc- 仍有可能是心理问题
<20-5,Kutner>- I paged them.abc- It could still be psychogenic.

377
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,370
<20-6,Taub>客观来说 哪来"仍有"这个可能abc这个可能从来都不成立
<20-6,Taub>Technically,it c't still be that,abcbecause it never could be that.

378
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,780
<20-6,Taub>她在睡梦中把头都挠穿了
<20-6,Taub>She scratched through herabcskull while she was sleeping.

379
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,050
<20-6,Taub>除非她做了关于虱子的噩梦
<20-6,Taub>Unless she was having aabcdream about fleas--

380
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,580
<20-7,House>真巧你正好路过
<20-7,House>Funny you should drop by.

381
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,790
<20-7,House>正在讨论我们的病人呢
<20-7,House>We were just talkingabcabout this patient of ours.

382

<20-7,House>给他说说 两个医生不在时abc发生了什么事-- 你要去哪里?
<20-7,House>Tell him the part about where two of herabcdoctors don't show up--where are you going?

383
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,300
<20-7,House>多发性神经炎 不是脑子的问题abc而是神经
<20-7,House>Polyneuropathy. It's not inabcthe brain,it's in the nerves.

384
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,110

<20-7,House>It explains the itching,theabclungs, the liver.

387
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,440
<20-8,House>她的情况有多糟?
<20-8,House>How bad is she?

388
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,400
<20-9,Foreman>她的视神经交叉有一个肿瘤
<20-9,Foreman>She's got a tumor in her optic chiasm.

389
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,210
<20-10,House>治疗肿瘤不需要穿上外套
<20-10,House>You don't need your coat treat a tumor.

390
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,950
<20-11,Foreman>我要去制药公司
<20-11,Foreman>I'm going to the drug company.

391
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,110
<20-12,House>告诉他们 你毁了他们的试验abc你的医德 还有病人的健康?
<20-12,House>To tell them that you compromised theirabctrial, your ethics,and the patient's health?

392
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,040
<20-12,House>这真是个好主意
<20-12,House>That's a great idea.

393
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,910
<20-13,Foreman>他们记录了数百个病人的资料
<20-13,Foreman>They have recordsonabchundreds of patients.

394
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,200
<20-13,Foreman>我要知道 其他病人有没出现肿瘤abc以及是如何治疗的
<20-13,Foreman>I can ask them for access, find out if otherabcpatients developed tumors and how they were treated.

395
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,800
<20-14,House>药物抑制细胞的死亡
<20-14,House>This drug inhibits cell death.

396
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,890
<20-14,House>我能猜到他们是如何治疗的
<20-14,House>I think I could take a wildabcguess at how I treat that.

397
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,030
<20-15,Foreman>- 停止服药?abc- 没错
<20-15,Foreman>- Stop taking it?abc- Yeah.

<20-15,Foreman>她昨天已经试过了
<20-15,Foreman>She tried that yesterday.

399
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,580
<20-16,House>噢 天啊 都一整天了abc她脑子的肿瘤还没融掉?
<20-16,House>Oh, my god,it's been a whole day,abcand her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

400
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,450
<20-16,House>你走进电梯abc不过是为了求个心里安稳
<20-16,House>If you get on that elevator, and it's only'causeabcyou're worried about getting to sleep tonight--

401
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,830
<20-17,Foreman>我想告诉她 别的病人也有这种情况abc而且他们好转了
<20-17,Foreman>I want to be able to tell her this happenedabcto other people,and they're fine now.

402
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,440
<20-18,House>那告诉她得了
<20-18,House>So tell her.

403
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,870
<20-19,Foreman>我不会骗她的
<20-19,Foreman>I'm not gonna lie to her.

404
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,320
<20-20,House>现在说这话有点晚了
<20-20,House>A little late for that.

405
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,130
<20-20,House>你必须等
<20-20,House>You need to wait.

406
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,670
<20-20,House>因为如果症状不消失abc她需要你有医生执照
<20-20,House>Because if this thing doesn't go away, she'sabcgonna need you to still have a medical license.

407
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,980
<21-1,Foreman>我和House谈了 他觉得我们应该--
<21-1,Foreman>So I spoke with house.Heabcthinks we should just--

<21-6,Thirteen>我看不见了
<21-6,Thirteen>I can't see.

411
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,550
<21-5,Foreman>什么意思?
<21-5,Foreman>What do you mean?

412
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,750
<21-6,Thirteen>我什么也看不见了
<21-6,Thirteen>I can't see anything.

<22-3,Wilson>不要告诉我-- 她把你的房子给烧了
<22-3,Wilson>Don't tell me-- she burnedabcyour apartment to the ground.

416
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,840
<22-4,House>她放火倒好 起码暖和
<22-4,House>The warmth would have been nice.

<22-5,Wilson>你有17条短讯
<22-5,Wilson>You have 17 messages.

420
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,690

<22-5,Wilson>And your non-involvement strategyabcdoesn't seem to be working.

421
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,150

<23-3,House>By all means,let's discuss the failedabcattempts to contact me, not the reason behind them.

424

<23-4,Taub>我们还没打开机器abc病人就脊髓休克了
<23-4,Taub>Patient started experiencing spinalabcshocks before the machine was turned on.

<23-6,Kutner>Lhermitte's sign couldabcmean behcet's, b-12 deficiency.

429
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,240

<23-8,Taub>No idea.

431

<23-9,Kutner>可能是另一种脱髓鞘疾病

432
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,220
<23-9,Kutner>为什么你只问Foreman而不问13?
<23-9,Kutner>Why are you asking aboutabcforeman and not thirteen?

433
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,730
<23-10,House>因为两个问题指向同一个答案

439
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,450
<24-1,House>你为什么不应门
<24-1,House>You didn't answer the door.

440
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,900
<24-2,Thirteen>大概是因为我不想和任何人说话
<24-2,Thirteen>Probably because Iabcdidn't want to talk to anyone.

441
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,050
<24-2,Thirteen>出去时麻烦把你偷来的钥匙留下

<25-5,Wilson>这算什么重点?
<25-5,Wilson>What's the point?

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,250
<31-3,Wilson>血吸虫病导致动静脉畸形
<31-3,Wilson>Avm's secondary to schistosomiasis.

<31-4,Taub>她体内会有蠕虫乱爬 我们没看到
<31-4,Taub>She'd be crawling withabcworms. We'd have noticed it.

559
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,030
<31-4,Taub>溶骨症和血管瘤伴血小板减少综合征abc都能导致超级侵略性血管肿瘤
<31-4,Taub>Gorham's disease and kasabach-merritt canabcboth cause super-aggressive vascular tumors.

560
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,980
<31-4,Taub>病人心跳停止
<31-4,Taub>Patient's heart just stopped.

561
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,180
<31-5,House>这又是什么导致的?
<31-5,House>So what causes that?

562
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,710
<31-5,House>心包填塞 血液进入心包膜 压迫心脏
<31-5,House>Cardiac tamponade. She's bleeding intoabcher pericardium, smothering her heart.

563
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,620
<32-1,Kutner>注射器
<32-1,Kutner>Syringe.

564

<32-2,Kutner>血压回升 见效了
<32-2,Kutner>B.P.'S going back up. It's working.

00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,860
<32-3,Taub>不 没有--看
<32-3,Taub>No, it'sabcnot--look.

566
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,620
<32-3,Taub>现在输血小板 新鲜冷冻血浆abc所有能让她情况稳定的东西
<32-3,Taub>we're transfusing platelets,ffp,abceverything to try to keep her stable.

567
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,530
<32-3,Taub>但恐怕补不及血液损失
<32-3,Taub>But we can barely keepabcup with the blood loss.

568
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,620
<33-1,Taub>照这个速度 她今晚就会死
<33-1,Taub>At this rate, she could beabcdead by the end of the day.

569
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,670
<33-2,Kutner>我们必须切除血管瘤 阻止出血
<33-2,Kutner>We need to resect the vascularabctumors, stop the bleeding.

570
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,140
<33-3,House>太晚了-- 现在没外科医生敢碰她
<33-3,House>Too late--no surgeon's gonnaabctouch her now.

571
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,190
<33-4,Kutner>我们该放弃? 让她流血而亡?
<33-4,Kutner>Should we give up?abcJust let her bleed out?

572
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,970
<33-5,House>别这么傻
<33-5,House>Don't be silly.

573
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,090
<33-5,House>那得提高职业过失责任险费率多少点啊?
<33-5,House>You know what that would do toabcour malpractice insurance rates?

574
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,680
<33-5,House>采取主动
<33-5,House>We go on the offensive.

575
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,850
<33-5,House>切断侵略军补给线
<33-5,House>Cut off the invading army's supply line.

576
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,810
<33-6,Taub>你是说栓塞?
<33-6,Taub>You're talking about embolization?

577
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,910
<33-7,House>切断供给血液给肿瘤的动脉abc肿瘤就会衰亡
<33-7,House>Cut off the arteries that feed bloodabcto the tumors, they wither and die.

578
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,870
<33-7,House>从肺部开始
<33-7,House>Start with the ones in her lungs.

579
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,330
<33-7,House>如果肿瘤长大 她会呼吸困难
<33-7,House>If they get any bigger, she'sabcgonna have a hard time breathing.

580
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,430
<33-7,House>要告诉我们她要死了 都会很困难
<33-7,House>So she'll have a hardabctime telling us she's dead.

581
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,990
<33-8,Taub>杀死肿瘤是 无法避免伤害健康组织
<33-8,Taub>You can't kill the tumors withoutabcalso killing healthy tissue.

582
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,000
<33-8,Taub>如果我们毁了她3/4的肺...
<33-8,Taub>If we wipe out3/4 of her lungs...

583
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,030
<33-9,House>祈祷马拉松长跑不在她的爱好名单上
<33-9,House>let's hope that running marathonsabcwasn't on her happy list.

<34-3,Cuddy>It isn't about you. I...

<34-6,House>We gonna have to do thisabcdance again in 28 days?

599

<34-8,House>我只能猜想 是你大姨妈来了
<34-8,House>I can only assume that what I'mabchearing is your aunt flow telling me...

603
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,970
<34-9,Cuddy>当我像个混蛋时 你突然变好心肠

<34-9,Cuddy>当我想和好了 你又变回混蛋
<34-9,Cuddy>But when I act human,youabcturn back into a jerk.

605
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,970
<34-10,House>我们的周期没同步吧
<34-10,House>Guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.

606
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,680
<34-11,Cuddy>这是你说接受我道歉的方式 对吧?
<34-11,Cuddy>This is your way of sayingabcyou accept my apology, isn't it?

<34-12,House>不 我是说你以前工作得很蹩脚abc以后会更蹩脚
<34-12,House>Nope, this is my way of saying you were doing a crappyabcjob before; you will a slightly crappier job now.

<34-12,House>地球接着转 生活和育儿的本质都如此
<34-12,House>Everything keeps going. Natureabcof life. Nature of parenthood.

<34-13,Cuddy>你一直在演戏
<34-13,Cuddy>Or this whole thing is just an act.

610
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,600
<34-13,Cuddy>现在回到了你认为该扮演的角色
<34-13,Cuddy>And you've gone back to theabcpart you think you need to play.

611
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,100
<34-14,House>你该和Wilson谈谈
<34-14,House>You should go talk to wilson.

<35-2,House>见鬼! 噢 也好
<35-2,House>Damn! Oh, well.

<35-2,House>意味着 掏出来唯一的东西...
<35-2,House>That means the only thingabcI'm gonna get out of this...

617
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,210
<35-2,House>就是诊断结果
<35-2,House>is a diagnosis.

618
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,830
<35-3,Kutner>护士给她卫生巾替代棉条
<35-3,Kutner>So the nurses gave herabcpads instead of tampons.

619
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,300
<35-3,Kutner>这和诊断有关吗?
<35-3,Kutner>Is that diagnostically relevant?

620
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,580
<35-4,House>护士为什么要给她用护垫呢
<35-4,House>Fact that the nursesabchad to give her anything is.

621
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,750
<35-4,House>意味着她子宫内流血
<35-4,House>Means she's bleeding from her uterus.

622
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,760
<35-5,Taub>女人都有 很正常 没啥好怕
<35-5,Taub>Women do that. It's perfectlyabcnatural. Not scary at all.

623

<35-5,Taub>她来月经 她全身都在出血
<35-5,Taub>She menstruating andabcshe's bleeding everywhere.

624
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,460
<35-6,House>28天里有3 4天如此 可以叫巧合
<35-6,House>There's about a 3 or 4 in 28abcchance it's a coincidence.

625
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,920
<35-6,House>更有可能是子宫内膜异位
<35-6,House>Which leaves a much bigger chance thatabcthe diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis.

626
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,850
<35-6,House>八个月前她有子宫肌瘤
<35-6,House>She had a myoma eight months ago.

627
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,960
<35-6,House>医生切入子宫壁
<35-6,House>Surgeons cut through her uterine wall.

628
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,900
<35-6,House>每一刀都有可能将子宫内膜细胞abc带入血液循环
<35-6,House>Every cut of the scalpel could have sentabcendometrial cells spilling out into her bloodstream.

629
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,650
<35-6,House>有些进驻在肺 有些在肝 或者脊柱
<35-6,House>Some of them took up residence in herabclungs, some in her liver,some in her spine.

630
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,100
<35-6,House>就像所有蓬勃的内膜细胞abc它们成长繁殖到临界点
<35-6,House>And like all horny little cells, they went forth andabcmultiplied till they reached a critical mass.

631
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,150
<35-6,House>到了下一个周期 当她子宫膨胀的时候abc所有内膜细胞群都膨胀
<35-6,House>In the days leading up to her next period, whenabcher uterusis supposed to swell, everything swelled.

632
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,810
<35-6,House>当子宫该出血时 所有着陆点都出血
<35-6,House>And when her uterus was supposedabcto bleed, everything bled.

633
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,670
<35-6,House>是的 女士 我在责怪她的周期
<35-6,House>Yes, ladies,I am blaming her period.

634
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,680
<35-6,House>这算得上最糟糕的经期
<35-6,House>Granted, it's the worst period ever.

635
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,190
<35-6,House>同时来经期实在糟糕
<35-6,House>Although, frankly,not by all that much.

636
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,160
<35-6,House>切掉肿块 她就没事了
<35-6,House>Cut out the masses,she'll be fine.

637
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,210
<35-7,Taub>得等到周期结束 不出血了才能手术
<35-7,Taub>Can't do surgery until her cycle'sabcover and she stops bleeding.

638
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,300
<35-8,House>那我们祈祷她能撑到那时
<35-8,House>Well, let's hope sheabccan hold out till then.

639
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,330
