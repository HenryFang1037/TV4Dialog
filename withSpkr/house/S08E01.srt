1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,290
<9-5,House>你在十二个月的服刑期中
<9-5,House>You've been good...

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,340
<1-1,Delaire>过去八个月内
<1-1,Delaire>...ish..behavior.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,770
<1-1,Delaire>表现良好
<1-1,Delaire>In 8 of 12 months time served.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,620
<1-1,Delaire>我们依照酌处权获准你假释
<1-1,Delaire>We have the discretion to grant parole,

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,380
<1-1,Delaire>五天后  本月十号星期五
<1-1,Delaire>Friday the 10th, five days from now.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
<1-1,Delaire>你对你的所作所为心怀歉意吗
<1-1,Delaire>Are you sorry about what you did?

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,720
<1-2,House>是的
<1-2,House>Yes.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,660
<1-2,House>就一句"是的"吗
<1-2,House>Yes?

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,620
<1-4,House>那是正确答案  不是吗
<1-4,House>That's the correct answer, isn't it?

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,430
<1-5,Female Case Worker>你是想招我们烦吗
<1-5,Female Case Worker>Are you trying to annoy us?

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,590
<1-6,House>不  我只是想给你们
<1-6,House>No, I'm just trying to give you

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,440
<1-6,House>能保住你们饭碗的答案
<1-6,House>the answers you need to cover your asses,

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,460
<1-6,House>好让你们填完表格  然后放我出去
<1-6,House>fill out your forms, and let me out of here.

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,010
<1-7,Female Case Worker>我们需要你表现出悔恨
<1-7,Female Case Worker>We need you to show us remorse.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,430
<1-8,House>我们的体制就是这样运转的啊
<1-8,House>Is that how our system works?

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,270
<1-8,House>释放最会演戏的犯人吗
<1-8,House>Release the best actors?

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,840
<1-8,House>真不敢想像那会造成怎样的后果
<1-8,House>I shudder to think what that world would be like.

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,770
<1-9,Female Case Worker>你开车撞进你前女友的家
<1-9,Female Case Worker>You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,910
<1-9,Female Case Worker>然后在国外潜逃了三个月
<1-9,Female Case Worker>and then fled the country for three months.

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,040
<1-10,House>我知道她女儿在祖母家里
<1-10,House>I knew that her daughter was at grandma's,

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,410
<1-10,House>每周五都如此
<1-10,House>like every Friday,

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,690
<1-10,House>也看到所有人都去往客厅了
<1-10,House>and I saw everyone else move into the living room.

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,750
<1-11,Female Case Worker>他们可能会折回来的
<1-11,Female Case Worker>They could've moved back.

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,280
<1-12,House>我会注意到的
<1-12,House>Which I would've noticed

25
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,950
<1-12,House>因为我正开车冲向他们
<1-12,House>since I was driving right towards them.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,470
<1-13,Delaire>闭嘴  我们接到通知要缩减犯人数量
<1-13,Delaire>Shut up. We got an order to reduce overcrowding.

27
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,460
<1-13,Delaire>我就直说了  只要你对一名警卫出言不逊
<1-13,Delaire>But let me be clear-- you mouth off to one guard,

28
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,980
<1-13,Delaire>被我们发现你的牢房里有一只餐厅的托盘
<1-13,Delaire>we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell,

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,600
<1-13,Delaire>违反任何我都记不清楚的规定
<1-13,Delaire>you break any rules I don't even remember,

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,230
<1-13,Delaire>你就得在这里再待足四个月
<1-13,Delaire>you can park your ass here for four more months.

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,630
<1-13,Delaire>且不说你是否悔恨
<1-13,Delaire>So forget being sorry.

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,650
<1-13,Delaire>你能安分守己过完这五天吗
<1-13,Delaire>Can you stay out of trouble for five days?

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,940
<1-13,Delaire>可以
<1-13,Delaire>Yes.

53
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,910
<2-1,Hseuh>排队取药  阿索法
<2-1,Hseuh>Get in line for meds! Asofa!

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,220
<2-3,Mendelson>你为什么总是帮他啊
<2-3,Mendelson>Why you keep helping him out?

55
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,220
<2-4,House>好问题  为什么我要确认
<2-4,House>Yeah, why would I wanna make sure

56
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,870
<2-4,House>我的杀人犯狱友
<2-4,House>that my homicidal cellmate

57
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,230
<2-4,House>服用的是正确的精神抑制药
<2-4,House>is taking the right anti-psychotics?

58
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,850
<2-5,Hseuh>豪斯
<2-5,Hseuh>House!

59
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,830
<2-6,Hseuh>门德尔松
<2-6,Hseuh>Mendelson!

60
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,440
<2-7,House>他该服用八十毫克的普萘洛尔  这只有四十
<2-7,House>He's on 80 mg of Propranolol. That's 40.

61
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,790
<2-8,Hostetter>你是对的  抱歉
<2-8,Hostetter>You're right. Sorry.

62
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,180
<2-9,Mendelson>没关系
<2-9,Mendelson>No worries.

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,010
<2-9,Mendelson>我喜欢淘气小护士
<2-9,Mendelson>I like my nurses naughty.

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,140
<2-10,House>门德尔松  我开始觉得
<2-10,House>I'm starting to think, Mendelson,

65
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,600
<2-10,House>你就是喜欢我口水的味道
<2-10,House>that you just really like the taste of my spit.

66
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,530
<2-11,Mendelson>豪斯  看
<2-11,Mendelson>Hey, House.

67
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,060
<2-11,Mendelson>看看我们的新标志
<2-11,Mendelson>Check out our new brand, huh?

68
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,230
<2-12,House>门德尔松  你还真喜欢万字符啊
<2-12,House>You really got a thing for swastikas, Mendelson.

69
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,320
<2-12,House>不觉得讽刺吗
<2-12,House>Like an ironic thing?

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,650
<2-13,Mendelson>这是个德国名字
<2-13,Mendelson>It's a German name.

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,370
<2-14,House>豪斯也是  但我是犹太人
<2-14,House>So is "House." I'm Jewish.

72
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,280
<2-14,House>不  其实我是个黑皮肤的吉普赛同性恋
<2-14,House>Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy.

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,260
<2-15,Frankie>马进f3
<2-15,Frankie>Knight to King's Bishop three.

74
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,630
<2-16,House>后进f7
<2-16,House>Queen to King's Bishop seven.

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,770
<2-17,Nick>你是豪斯  对吧
<2-17,Nick>You're House, right?

76
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,110
<2-17,Nick>我肘部有奇怪的痛感
<2-17,Nick>I got these weird pains in my elbows

77
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,360
<2-17,Nick>还有我的膝盖
<2-17,Nick>and in my knees--

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,660
<2-18,House>你知道吗  更奇怪的是
<2-18,House>You know, what's weirder

79
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,160
<2-18,House>诊室明明空间很大
<2-18,House>is how the clinic is a large room

80
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,280
<2-18,House>你却能把我当成它
<2-18,House>and you somehow confused me with it.

81
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,250
<2-18,House>虽然实话实说  我确实挺大只
<2-18,House>Although, to be fair, I am large.

82
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,460
<2-19,House>你好  罗诺
<2-19,House>Hi, Rollo.

83
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,850
<2-19,House>我意识到这可能是个反问句
<2-19,House>I realize this is probably a rhetorical question--

84
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,330
<2-19,House>你为什么要偷我的东西
<2-19,House>Why are you stealing my stuff?

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,170
<2-20,Rollo>豪斯  听说你短期内就要出去了
<2-20,Rollo>Hey, House. I heard you're on short time.

86
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,270
<2-20,Rollo>你不需要这个了
<2-20,Rollo>You won't need this.

87
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,050
<2-21,House>你听说我的假释了
<2-21,House>You heard about my parole,

88
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,940
<2-21,House>却没听说过我对偷我的金枪鱼的人
<2-21,House>but not about my violent reactions

89
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,510
<2-21,House>产生的暴力反应
<2-21,House>when people steal my tuna.

90
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,340
<2-21,House>放回去
<2-21,House>Put it back.

91
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,010
<2-22,Rollo>没门儿
<2-22,Rollo>Nuh-uh.

92
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,510
<2-22,Rollo>真的吗
<2-22,Rollo>Really?

93
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,030
<2-23,House>你在招惹一个
<2-23,House>You're stepping to a guy

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,020
<2-23,House>比你重五十磅
<2-23,House>who outweighs you by 50 pounds,

95
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,870
<2-23,House>还带着一根准许在监狱里使用的
<2-23,House>and he was carrying a cane, which,

96
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,860
<2-23,House>且插入你的结肠后
<2-23,House>while prison-approved, would still cause some issues

97
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,410
<2-23,House>仍会有不小伤害的拐杖
<2-23,House>if inserted into your colon.

98
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,860
<2-24,Rollo>来啊  看你怎么搞砸自己的假释
<2-24,Rollo>Yeah, like you losing your parole.

99
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,700
<2-24,Rollo>你也不能告发我
<2-24,Rollo>And you ain't gonna rat me out neither,

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,250
<2-24,Rollo>因为你不会想背上打小报告的恶名
<2-24,Rollo>'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket

101
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,500
<2-24,Rollo>最后在洗澡的时候被人捅死
<2-24,Rollo>and wind up shanked in the showers.

102
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,200
<2-24,Rollo>所以你只能眼睁睁地看我走出去
<2-24,Rollo>So you're just gonna let me walk out of here.

103
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,020
<2-25,Frankie>你想报复这些家伙
<2-25,Frankie>You wanna get back at these guys...

104
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,780
<2-25,Frankie>那就在周五那天活着出去
<2-25,Frankie>Get out alive on Friday.

105
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
<2-25,Frankie>好了  豪斯  工作去吧
<2-25,Frankie>All right, now go to work, House.

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,200
<2-25,Frankie>你那一棋把我将死了  对吧
<2-25,Frankie>Oh, and that was Checkmate, right?

107
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,040
<2-26,House>没错
<2-26,House>Yep.

108
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,010
<3-1,Stomper>豪斯  我听说你短期内就能出狱了
<3-1,Stomper>I heard you're on that short time, House?

109
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
<3-2,House>如果你想要金枪鱼  为时已晚
<3-2,House>If you like tuna, you're a little late.

110
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,750
<3-3,Stomper>我想要你的立体声装备和头戴耳机
<3-3,Stomper>I want your stereo and your headphones.

111
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,780
<3-3,Stomper>我可以等你先做完你的工作
<3-3,Stomper>It can wait till you finish your work.

112
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,950
<3-3,Stomper>送到我的牢房里
<3-3,Stomper>Drop it off in my cell.

113
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,710
<3-3,Stomper>九十九点九
<3-3,Stomper>99.9.

114
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,000
<4-1,Adams>我想先给他用头孢曲松治疗
<4-1,Adams>I'm gonna start him on ceftriaxone.

115
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,450
<4-2,Sykes>很好
<4-2,Sykes>Good catch.

116
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,670
<4-2,Sykes>我说不定就会遗漏这点
<4-2,Sykes>I might've missed that.

117
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,960
<4-3,House>那不是淋病
<4-3,House>It's not gonorrhea.

118
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,850
<4-4,Adams>我可没说是啊
<4-4,Adams>I didn't say it was.

119
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,270
<4-5,House>是没说出来
<4-5,House>Not out loud,

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,900
<4-5,House>但你觉得为关节疼痛
<4-5,House>but you're figuring that joint pain,

121
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,770
<4-5,House>加之高热和不健康的生活方式
<4-5,House>plus fever, plus a low lifestyle

122
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,070
<4-5,House>开头孢曲松的处方合情合理
<4-5,House>equals a ceftriaxone prescription.

123
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,970
<4-6,Nick>你是说我得了淋病吗
<4-6,Nick>So you're saying I got the clap?

124
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,900
<4-6,Nick>我才来这里一周
<4-6,Nick>I've only been in here one week.

125
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,990
<4-6,Nick>我女朋友也没病
<4-6,Nick>My girlfriend's clean.

126
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,660
<4-6,Nick>我在这里都没有女友
<4-6,Nick>I ain't got a girlfriend in here.

127
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,750
<4-7,Adams>你怎么知道头孢曲松的
<4-7,Adams>How do you know about ceftriaxone?

128
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,450
<4-8,Sykes>豪斯以前是个医生
<4-8,Sykes>House used to be a doctor.

129
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,570
<4-9,House>不再干这行了
<4-9,House>Not going back,

130
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,760
<4-9,House>你那震惊的表情既让我又荣幸又不快
<4-9,House>and that look of shock is elitist and offensive.

131
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,590
<4-9,House>医生也堕落  毕竟这里是美国
<4-9,House>Doctors can be degenerates. This is America.

132
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,160
<4-9,House>少量眉毛缺损
<4-9,House>There's subtle eyebrow loss.

133
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,510
<4-9,House>是狼疮
<4-9,House>It's lupus.

134
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,360
<4-10,Adams>他脸上没有其他斑疹
<4-10,Adams>Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.

135
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,590
<4-11,House>如果他头够大的话就能看到了
<4-11,House>Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.

136
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,830
<4-12,Sykes>他说得有道理
<4-12,Sykes>He's got a point,

137
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,760
<4-12,Sykes>但还是由你做决定
<4-12,Sykes>but I'll let you make the call.

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,300
<4-13,Adams>根本没必要进行全身斑疹检查
<4-13,Adams>No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash

139
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,530
<4-13,Adams>因为通常狼疮不会表现这样的症状
<4-13,Adams>since lupus doesn't usually present that way.

140
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,590
<4-15,Adams>"通常"
<4-15,Adams>"Usually"?

141
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,450
<4-14,House>我猜这对狱医来说足够了
<4-14,House>Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work.

142
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,980
<4-14,House>你们不会给胡说八道的犯人记一笔吧
<4-14,House>You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?

143
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,390
<4-15,Adams>"通常"不会
<4-15,Adams>Not usually.

145
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,220
<5-1,Frankie>别惹斯托普
<5-1,Frankie>You don't wanna mess with Stomper.

146
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,880
<5-1,Frankie>可不是因为他喜欢圣诞驯鹿
<5-1,Frankie>He didn't get that name

147
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,700
<5-1,Frankie>别人才那么叫他的
<5-1,Frankie>because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.

148
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,960
<5-2,House>你以为圣诞驯鹿
<5-2,House>You think one of Santa's reindeer

149
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,070
<5-2,House>有叫斯托普的吗
<5-2,House>was called Stomper?

150
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,280
<5-3,Frankie>你没抓到重点
<5-3,Frankie>You're missing my point.

151
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,290
<5-4,House>连圣诞驯鹿叫什么都搞不清  我才不要听你的
<5-4,House>I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.

152
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,920
<5-5,Frankie>你也见到了迪亚兹在院子里的惨状
<5-5,Frankie>Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz.

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,020
<5-5,Frankie>他还没说什么呢
<5-5,Frankie>He barely said a couple of words

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,220
<5-5,Frankie>他们就恼了
<5-5,Frankie>and set the boy off.

155
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,540
<5-5,Frankie>不是吧
<5-5,Frankie>Oh, no.

156
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,800
<5-5,Frankie>又是这副表情
<5-5,Frankie>I know that look.

157
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,460
<6-1,House>你好  斯托普
<6-1,House>Hey, Stomper.

158
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,390
<6-2,Stomper>我的东西呢
<6-2,Stomper>Where's my stereo?

159
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,060
<6-3,House>我送到你屋里了
<6-3,House>I brought it to your cell.

160
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,780
<6-4,Stomper>没在那
<6-4,Stomper>It ain't there.

161
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,130
<6-5,House>我还没说完呢
<6-5,House>I was just getting to that part.

162
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,370
<6-5,House>罗诺尾随我  把它拿走了
<6-5,House>Rollo followed me in and took it.

163
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,760
<6-6,Stomper>罗诺不敢对我那么不敬
<6-6,Stomper>No way Rollo'd diss me like that.

164
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,560
<6-7,House>他敢啊  我可不想造谣  但是...
<6-7,House>Way. I don't wanna start any rumors, but--

165
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,440
<6-8,Stomper>但是什么
<6-8,Stomper>But what?

166
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,140
<6-9,House>他就说  "我可以扳倒斯托普"
<6-9,House>Well, he was all, you know, "I could take stomper."

167
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,840
<6-9,House>我就说  "何以见得"
<6-9,House>And I was all, "How come?"

168
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,630
<6-9,House>他就说  "瞧上个月
<6-9,House>And he was all, "'cause of how Diaz

169
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,100
<6-9,House>迪亚兹是怎么教训他的"
<6-9,House>kicked his ass last month."

170
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,780
<6-9,House>他其实管你叫"斯托皮"
<6-9,House>In fact, he actually called you "Stompee,"

171
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,380
<6-9,House>是"皮皮"哦
<6-9,House>with an "ee."

172
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,910
<6-9,House>我觉得他是想说...
<6-9,House>I think his gist was...

173
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,110
<6-10,Stomper>你偷了我的立体声吗
<6-10,Stomper>You took my stereo?

174
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,660
<6-11,Rollo>出去  斯托普
<6-11,Rollo>Get out of my house, Stomper.

175
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,800
<6-11,Rollo>我没有立体声
<6-11,Rollo>I ain't got no stereo.

176
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,650
<6-12,Stomper>那这是什么
<6-12,Stomper>Well, then what's this, then?

177
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,500
<6-13,Rollo>什么  不是我放的
<6-13,Rollo>What? I didn't put that there!

178
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,650
<6-14,Stomper>你这个狗娘养的骗子  敢当着我面骗我
<6-14,Stomper>You're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch!

179
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,170
<6-15,Rollo>我什么都没做
<6-15,Rollo>What? I didn't do anything!

180
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,690
<6-15,Rollo>下次你的立体声我拿定了
<6-15,Rollo>Next time I will take your stereo!

181
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,400
<7-1,Frankie>那可真蠢
<7-1,Frankie>That was stupid.

182
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,860
<7-2,House>你说的  是"聪明"的同义词吗
<7-2,House>Is that, like, a synonym for "clever"?

183
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,020
<7-2,House>等他们出了禁闭室
<7-2,House>By the time they get out of solitary,

184
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,580
<7-2,House>我已经在斐济大学教物理了
<7-2,House>I'll be teaching physics at the University of Fiji.

185
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,600
<7-3,Frankie>你还有四天
<7-3,Frankie>You have four days left.

186
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,580
<7-3,Frankie>还有多少鬼把戏
<7-3,Frankie>How many more tricks do you got?

188
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,130
<7-4,Asofa>别
<7-4,Asofa>Don't.

189
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,610
<7-5,House>新宠物吗
<7-5,House>This another pet?

190
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,740
<7-5,House>一定没有好下场
<7-5,House>'Cause it's gonna end badly.

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,410
<7-5,House>就像以前一样
<7-5,House>Again.

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
<7-5,House>记得我们讨论过这个吗
<7-5,House>Remember we talked about this?

193
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,660
<7-5,House>至少我有在说  你很诡异地看着我
<7-5,House>At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily.

194
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,200
<7-5,House>我觉得挺诡异的
<7-5,House>I think it was eerily.

195
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,110
<7-5,House>"诡异"感觉是个高级词汇
<7-5,House>"Eerily" felt like the best-case scenario.

196
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,110
<8-1,House>脱掉衬衫  让我找下疹子
<8-1,House>Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.

197
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,370
<8-2,Nick>你现在打算帮我了
<8-2,Nick>Oh, now you wanna help me.

198
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,830
<8-2,Nick>因为那个医生不信你吗
<8-2,Nick>'Cause that doctor didn't believe you?

199
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,090
<8-3,House>如果你有更好的办法
<8-3,House>Well, if you can think of a better way

200
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,520
<8-3,House>能证明她是个蠢蛋
<8-3,House>to prove that she's an idiot,

201
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,620
<8-3,House>我洗耳恭听
<8-3,House>I'm all ears.

202
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,130
<8-3,House>早查完早了事
<8-3,House>Now, let's get this over with.

203
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,920
<8-3,House>好吧
<8-3,House>Yeah.

204
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,480
<8-4,Nick>那是妮可
<8-4,Nick>That's Nicole.

205
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,220
<8-4,Nick>她现在和她妈妈一起住
<8-4,Nick>She lives at her mom's now

206
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,540
<8-4,Nick>因为她丢了工作
<8-4,Nick>on account that she lost her job.

207
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,140
<8-4,Nick>她妈妈恨我  所以她不能来探监
<8-4,Nick>Her mom hates me, so she can't visit,

208
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,490
<8-4,Nick>她也不能接我的电话
<8-4,Nick>she ain't accepting my calls.

209
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,270
<8-5,House>你交往的是个12岁的姑娘吧
<8-5,House>Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.

210
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,370
<8-6,Nick>你不信我吗
<8-6,Nick>You don't believe me?

211
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,360
<8-7,House>相信就意味着一定程度的在乎
<8-7,House>Belief implies a level of giving a crap

212
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,060
<8-7,House>这我可办不到
<8-7,House>that I am never gonna achieve.

213
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,500
<8-7,House>脱裤子
<8-7,House>Pull down your pants.

214
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,830
<9-1,House>不是我处心积虑要证明
<9-1,House>It's not that I was trying to prove

215
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,210
<9-1,House>你是个傻瓜什么的
<9-1,House>that you're an idiot or anything,

216
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,250
<9-1,House>但我今早和狼疮小伙去沙滩日光浴
<9-1,House>But lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning,

217
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,470
<9-1,House>发现他左大腿处有个疹子
<9-1,House>and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.

218
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,730
<9-2,Adams>我查了你的资料
<9-2,Adams>I checked you out.

219
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,350
<9-2,Adams>是个人物
<9-2,Adams>You were a pretty big deal.

220
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,900
<9-2,Adams>出什么问题了
<9-2,Adams>What went wrong?

221
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,580
<9-3,House>原因显而易见又了无生趣
<9-3,House>Something very obvious and very boring.

222
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,500
<9-4,Adams>嗑药吗
<9-4,Adams>Drug related?

223
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,760
<9-4,Adams>伪造处方吗
<9-4,Adams>Forging prescriptions?

224
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,230
<9-5,House>你真厉害
<9-5,House>Oh, you're good,

225
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,700
<9-5,House>如果你给狼疮小伙用泼尼松
<9-5,House>just like lupus boy will be

226
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,110
<9-5,House>他也会这么厉害的
<9-5,House>when you start him on prednisone.

227
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,580
<9-5,House>药名本来可以做有奖竞猜的
<9-5,House>Name should've been a giveaway.

228
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,000
<9-5,House>我会送他过来的
<9-5,House>I'll send him up.

229
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,920
<9-6,Adams>你怎么这么自信
<9-6,Adams>Why are you so sure

230
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,130
<9-6,Adams>我会听你的
<9-6,Adams>I'm gonna do what you say?

231
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,580
<9-7,House>因为你聪明  家底殷实  出身良好
<9-7,House>Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl

232
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,180
<9-7,House>你选择这份工作只是因为
<9-7,House>who took this job because your liberal ideology

233
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,480
<9-7,House>自由主义信念让你想与众不同
<9-7,House>makes you wanna make a difference,

234
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,670
<9-7,House>但你已经开始厌倦了
<9-7,House>But you're already getting bored,

235
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,820
<9-7,House>这有点意思
<9-7,House>and this is interesting.

236
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,630
<9-8,Adams>你为什么这么说
<9-8,Adams>Why would you say any of that?

237
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,230
<9-9,House>你穿的鞋
<9-9,House>Your shoes--

238
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,410
<9-9,House>每天都不同  每双都很贵
<9-9,House>A different, expensive pair every day,

239
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,240
<9-9,House>可从来不穿皮鞋
<9-9,House>but never leather,

240
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,210
<9-9,House>意味着你有钱又信奉自由主义
<9-9,House>which means you're both rich and liberal.

241
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,140
<9-9,House>戴着未被抛过光的古老金挂盒
<9-9,House>Antique locket-- it's unpolished gold.

242
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,400
<9-9,House>而不是时髦的吊坠
<9-9,House>Not some hipster thing.

243
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,270
<9-9,House>说明是传家宝  也就是你家底殷实
<9-9,House>It's a family heirloom, which means old money.

244
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,020
<9-9,House>奥斯勒  霍普金森医学院创建者之一
<9-9,House>周五带奥斯勒围巾/领带是霍普金森传统

245
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,020
<9-9,House>只在周五戴奥斯勒围巾
<9-9,House>Osler scarf-- only on fridays,

246
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,310
<9-9,House>说明你在霍普金森做的住院医
<9-9,House>which means you did your residency at Hopkins,

247
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,600
<9-9,House>也意味着你比我们上回交手所表现的
<9-9,House>which means you're smarter than our interactions

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,790
<9-9,House>要更聪明
<9-9,House>would so far indicate.

249
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,550
<9-9,House>至于你的眼睛
<9-9,House>And your eyes--

250
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,530
<9-9,House>你在这里的这三个月来
<9-9,House>The only time you haven't looked bored

251
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,090
<9-9,House>也就咱们讨论诊断时
<9-9,House>in the three months since you've been here

252
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,270
<9-9,House>你的眼神才略显生气
<9-9,House>is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.

253
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,620
<9-9,House>所以  对  你会按狼疮对他进行治疗
<9-9,House>So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.

254
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,350
<9-9,House>豪斯
<9-9,House>House.

255
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,100
<10-1,Sullivan>他找你
<10-1,Sullivan>He wants you.

256
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,860
<10-1,Sullivan>能假释出去了啊
<10-1,Sullivan>Parole?

257
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,780
<11-1,Mendelson>你怎么没告诉我
<11-1,Mendelson>You didn't tell me.

258
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,070
<11-2,House>我不想大家深情送别
<11-2,House>I didn't want a big, emotional scene.

259
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,520
<11-3,Mendelson>但规矩你懂的

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,810
<13-10,House>我在努力每天只服一粒药
<13-10,House>I'm trying to survive on one a day

317
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,860
<14-1,House>不是狼疮  他手臂断了
<14-1,House>It's not lupus. He broke his arm.

318
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,640
<14-2,Adams>或者就是狼疮  只是他打了一架
<14-2,Adams>Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.

319
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,780
<14-3,House>他只是被挤了下
<14-3,House>He was in a jostle.

320
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,150
<14-4,Adams>因为如果他承认打架
<14-4,Adams>'Cause if he admits he was in a fight,

321
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,530
<14-4,Adams>就得被关禁闭
<14-4,Adams>then he goes to the hole.

322
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,670
<14-5,House>他会这样骗狱警
<14-5,House>That's why he'd lie to the guards.

323
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,100
<14-5,House>但没理由骗我
<14-5,House>He's got no reason to lie to me.

324
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,120
<14-7,House>看见没  这眼神又出现了
<14-7,House>See? There are those eyes again.

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,000
<14-7,House>有可能是病毒感染症状
<14-7,House>How about a viral syndrome,

326
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,070
<14-7,House>或是耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌
<14-7,House>or MRSA?

327
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,390
<14-7,House>不对  骨损害不应这么早就出现
<14-7,House>No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast,

328
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,820
<14-7,House>医源性反应倒有可能

<14-8,Adams>Make me lose my job by showing you a patient file?

331
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,640
<14-8,Adams>你不妨假设
<14-8,Adams>But why don't you assume

332
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,350
<14-8,Adams>他近期没有接受药物呢
<14-8,Adams>no recent meds?

333
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,190
<14-9,House>鉴于他的手指都被烟都熏黄了
<14-9,House>How long can I assume that he's been smoking,

334
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,800
<14-9,House>我可以假设他抽烟多久了呢
<14-9,House>based on his yellow fingers?

335
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,080
<14-10,Adams>你认为是肺癌吗
<14-10,Adams>You're thinking lung cancer.

<14-11,House>I'm out of here on Friday.

340
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,470
<14-12,Adams>又不是他走
<14-12,Adams>He's not.

341
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,740
<14-13,House>要不这样吧
<14-13,House>Well, how about...

342
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,820
<14-13,House>要是他血栓脱落导致中风
<14-13,House>if he throws a clot and strokes out,

343
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,340
<14-13,House>你就用那X光机给他做尸检
<14-13,House>you can use the x-ray to do the autopsy.

344
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,770
<14-13,House>开始让他使用抗凝药物
<14-13,House>Start him on blood thinners.

<14-14,Adams>你行医的方式真挺有趣
<14-14,Adams>Very interesting practice you must've run.

<15-2,House>About me not caring? I thought so.

352
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,530
<15-3,Nick>问题不在于她妈妈  而是她
<15-3,Nick>It wasn't her mom. It was her.

353
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,870
<15-3,Nick>她不想和我说话

<15-8,House>我会把它们打扮的一模一样  真假难辨
<15-8,House>I'll dress 'em the same, like in vertigo.

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,760
<16-3,House>说明他有个肿瘤
<16-3,House>It means he's got a tumor.

379
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,750
<16-4,Adams>没有听诊器你是怎么听出来的
<16-4,Adams>How did you find that without a stethoscope?

380
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,270
<16-4,Adams>我不知道你还会这套啊
<16-4,Adams>I didn't even know you could do this!

381
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,580
<16-5,House>给他服用抗凝药物吧
<16-5,House>Start the blood thinners.

382
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,960
<16-6,Nick>我真得癌症了吗
<16-6,Nick>So I for sure got lung cancer?

383
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
<16-8,House>-没有  -是的
<16-8,House>- No. - Yeah.

384
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,250
<16-9,Adams>你只证明了
<16-9,Adams>All you've proven

385
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,950
<16-9,Adams>他的肺部有异物
<16-9,Adams>is there's an anomaly in his chest.

386
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,000
<16-10,House>说明你原先的诊断
<16-10,House>Which means your initial diagnosis

387
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,160
<16-10,House>有可能是对的
<16-10,House>could still be right.

388
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,810
<16-11,Adams>你对这点很不满意啊
<16-11,Adams>Which apparently really bugs you.

389
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,930
<16-11,Adams>我可以做个凝血功能检测
<16-11,Adams>I could do a clotting test.

390
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,500
<16-12,House>这...
<16-12,House>That's...

391
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,900
<16-12,House>这是个好主意
<16-12,House>That's a good idea.

392
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,440
<16-13,Adams>我们要在你耳垂上取点血样
<16-13,Adams>We're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit

393
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,100
<16-13,Adams>两分钟后回来检查
<16-13,Adams>and check back in two minutes.

394
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,140
<16-13,Adams>如果还有血渗出  那是正常现象
<16-13,Adams>If there's a little blood bubbling up, that's normal.

395
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,730
<16-13,Adams>如果完全凝结了
<16-13,Adams>But if it's completely clotted,

396
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,180
<16-13,Adams>就有可能是癌症
<16-13,Adams>It may indicate cancer.

397
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,530
<16-13,Adams>好吗  开始了哦
<16-13,Adams>Okay? Ready?

398
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,010
<16-14,Adams>你真的放弃行医了吗
<16-14,Adams>Are you really leaving medicine?

399
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,020
<16-14,Adams>那你准备从事什么行业呢
<16-14,Adams>What are you gonna do?

400
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,070
<16-14,Adams>你知道  对于一个
<16-14,Adams>You know, for someone

401
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,380
<16-14,Adams>向我求助过那么多次的人来说
<16-14,Adams>who asks as many favors as you do,

402
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,110
<16-14,Adams>你倒是丝毫没有费力气
<16-14,Adams>you sure don't make any effort

403
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,830
<16-14,Adams>讨好过我
<16-14,Adams>to win me over.

404
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,220
<16-15,House>在我念医学院之前
<16-15,House>Before I went to med school,

405
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,400
<16-15,House>我想过要成为物理学博士
<16-15,House>I thought about getting a PhD in physics.

406
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,210
<16-15,House>你听说过暗物质吗
<16-15,House>You ever heard of dark matter?

407
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,180
<16-15,House>通过星系旋转及宇宙运行的方式
<16-15,House>The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the universe,

408
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,650
<16-15,House>可以判断暗物质的质量
<16-15,House>it means there's six times more stuff

409
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,600
<16-15,House>是已知物质的六倍
<16-15,House>than we can detect.

410
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,150
<16-15,House>但这只是个理论
<16-15,House>But it's theorized.

411
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,840
<16-15,House>还没人证明过暗物质的存在
<16-15,House>No one's ever proved it exists.

412
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,000
<16-16,Adams>你想要研究暗物质
<16-16,Adams>So you wanna research it?

413
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,150
<16-16,Adams>原因呢
<16-16,Adams>Why?

414
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,790
<16-17,House>这是现存的最大谜题
<16-17,House>It's the greatest mystery there is.

415
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,680
<16-17,House>万物形成的理论
<16-17,House>The theory of everything.

416
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,910
<16-18,Adams>而且和人性完全无关
<16-18,Adams>And completely divorced from humanity.

417
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,080
<16-19,House>好吧  我与人性
<16-19,House>Well, me and humanity.

418
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,000
<16-19,House>水火不能相容
<16-19,House>We got together too young.

419
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,050
<16-20,Adams>你有天赋
<16-20,Adams>Tsk. You have a gift.

420
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,640
<16-20,Adams>你无法否认在这世上
<16-20,Adams>There is something in this world

421
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,360
<16-20,Adams>有些事是你非常擅长的
<16-20,Adams>you are undeniably great at.

422
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,430
<16-20,Adams>你很会观察人
<16-20,Adams>You can read people.

423
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,310
<16-20,Adams>你可以读懂他们
<16-20,Adams>You-- you understand them.

424
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,360
<16-20,Adams>你不能放弃行医
<16-20,Adams>You gotta go back to medicine.

425
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,400
<16-21,House>如果说就是这种天赋令我身陷囹圄
<16-21,House>Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here,

426
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,040
<16-21,House>你能理解我为什么不能回头了吧
<16-21,House>you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.

427
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,190
<16-22,Nic>血这么流是正常的吗
<16-22,Nic>Is this supposed to happen?

428
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,370
<16-23,Adams>有意思
<16-23,Adams>Cool.

430
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,770
<16-24,House>唧唧昨晚没怎么叫唤
<16-24,House>Jiminy didn't chirp much last night.

431
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,370
<16-24,House>如果它得的是病  那早就该挂了
<16-24,House>If it's a disease, then he's six inches under.

432
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,910
<16-24,House>但也有可能是杀虫剂中毒
<16-24,House>But this could also be pesticide poisoning,

433
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,240
<16-24,House>那就可以用苏打粉里的碳酸氢盐治疗
<16-24,House>which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.

434
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,910
<16-24,House>瞧好了
<16-24,House>See?

435
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,010
<16-24,House>这点就够了
<16-24,House>Just so much and no more.

436
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,680
<16-25,House>这会儿你应该说声"谢谢"
<16-25,House>This is where you say "Thank you."

437
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,990
<16-25,House>或者我说吧
<16-25,House>Or I say thank you

438
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,180
<16-25,House>谢谢你饶我一命
<16-25,House>for not killing me.

439
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,370
<16-25,House>谢谢
<16-25,House>Thank you.

440
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,840
<17-1,Adams>胸透没有看出有肿瘤
<17-1,Adams>The x-ray didn't show any tumors.

441
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,240
<17-1,Adams>那个声影只是个脂肪瘤
<17-1,Adams>The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.

442
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,700
<17-1,Adams>我在想  你没事吧
<17-1,Adams>I'm thinking-- You all right?

443
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,670
<17-2,House>没事
<17-2,House>I'm fine.

444
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,170
<17-3,Adams>要布洛芬吗[常用止痛药]
<17-3,Adams>Ibuprofen?

445
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,970
<17-4,House>那没用的
<17-4,House>That's not gonna help.

446
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,900
<17-5,Adams>想看的话就看病人的病历吧
<17-5,Adams>You can look at the patient file if you want.

447
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,970
<17-6,House>你相信我吗
<17-6,House>You trust me?

448
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,320
<17-7,Adams>为什么不呢
<17-7,Adams>Any reason I shouldn't?

449
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,170
<17-8,House>你真的不会看人  是吗
<17-8,House>You're really not good at reading people, are you?

450
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,020
<17-8,House>还有地方
<17-8,House>Or buildings.

451
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,570
<17-9,Adams>人是很复杂的
<17-9,Adams>People are complicated.

452
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,350
<17-9,Adams>人也是会变的
<17-9,Adams>And people change.

453
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,800
<17-10,House>首先人并不怎么复杂
<17-10,House>Not that much to the first,

454
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,470
<17-10,House>其次人根本不会改变
<17-10,House>and not at all to the second.

455
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,020
<17-10,House>反正我能看病历就好
<17-10,House>But if it'll get me the file...

456
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,870
<17-11,Adams>如果把凝血功能异常算作症状之一的话
<17-11,Adams>If we add "clotting disorder" to the symptoms,

457
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,060
<17-11,Adams>肯定是中毒了
<17-11,Adams>it's gotta be a toxin.

458
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,570
<17-12,House>就他一个人出现了病症
<17-12,House>This guy's the only one with symptoms.

459
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,450
<17-12,House>毒源要么在他的牢房要么在他工作的地方
<17-12,House>It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.

460
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,320
<17-13,Adams>洗衣房
<17-13,Adams>The laundry room.

461
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,370
<17-13,Adams>可能是种溶剂或洗涤剂
<17-13,Adams>So maybe a solvent or detergent?

462
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,330
<17-14,House>你能陪我去取个样吗
<17-14,House>Can you get me an escort to gather samples?

463
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,660
<17-14,House>亚当斯医生
<17-14,House>Dr. Adams.

464
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,670
<17-15,Sykes>他怎么拿着病历
<17-15,Sykes>Why does he have a file?

465
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,240
<18-1,House>你得去弄些棉花棒
<18-1,House>You need to get cotton swabs.

466
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,740
<18-2,Nick>现在不行
<18-2,Nick>But not now.

467
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,960
<18-2,Nick>我有事要做
<18-2,Nick>I got something to do.

468
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,880
<18-3,House>现在是放风时间
<18-3,House>You're a prisoner on tier time.

469
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,250
<18-3,House>就是说  你没事要做
<18-3,House>By definition, you have nothing to do.

470
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,330
<18-4,Nick>我要给她家里  她朋友  她工作的地方打电话
<18-4,Nick>Call her family, her friends, her work.

471
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,720
<18-4,Nick>最终肯定能打通的
<18-4,Nick>I'm gonna get through eventually.

472
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,420
<18-5,House>你动作变慢了  人也虚弱了
<18-5,House>You're moving slower. You're getting weaker.

473
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,800
<18-5,House>你的病在侵蚀你的骨头  关节
<18-5,House>This thing's attacking your bones, your joints,

474
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,050
<18-5,House>和血液
<18-5,House>your blood.

475
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,630
<18-6,Nick>我女友更重要
<18-6,Nick>Look, my girl's more important.

476
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,630
<18-7,House>她不是你女友  你个傻瓜
<18-7,House>She's not your girl, you idiot.

477
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,100
<18-7,House>她曾经是
<18-7,House>She was the girlfriend

478
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,870
<18-7,House>找了你这么个失败的毒贩子
<18-7,House>of a loser drug dealer.

479
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,170
<18-7,House>你觉得她有自制力
<18-7,House>Think she's got the self-control

480
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,830
<18-7,House>傻等你三年吗
<18-7,House>to wait around for three years?

481
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,430
<18-7,House>你觉得她应该吗
<18-7,House>You think she should?

482
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,800
<18-7,House>我们被关在这里
<18-7,House>There's a reason we're locked away

483
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,770
<18-7,House>远离世人  是有原因的
<18-7,House>from nice, normal people.

484
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,690
<18-7,House>你外面的生活已经结束了
<18-7,House>Your life outside is over.

485
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,420
<18-7,House>你的朋友  爱人  同伴
<18-7,House>Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with,

486
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,940
<18-7,House>他们已经继续生活
<18-7,House>they've moved on.

487
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,840
<18-8,Nick>滚出我的房间
<18-8,Nick>Get out of my house.

488
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,290
<18-8,Nick>滚出去

494
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,880
<19-5,House>怎么  因为给我看病历他冲你嚷了
<19-5,House>What? He yelled at you for letting me see the file?

495
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,320
<19-5,House>你会想开的
<19-5,House>You'll get over it.

<19-5,House>A few years of therapy--

497
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
<19-6,Adams>关于入狱的原因  你为什么要说谎
<19-6,Adams>Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?

498
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,860
<19-7,House>好吧  事实上我开车冲进屋子
<19-7,House>Okay, so I drove a car into a wall

499
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,880
<19-7,House>而不是偷了些药片
<19-7,House>instead of stealing some pills.

500
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,330
<19-7,House>你明显不在乎我做过什么
<19-7,House>You obviously don't care what I did.

501
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,700
<19-7,House>而是介意我欺骗了你  伤了你的心
<19-7,House>You care that I lied to you. You feel jilted.

502
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,340
<19-8,Adams>我感觉自己好蠢
<19-8,Adams>I feel stupid.

503
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,540
<19-8,Adams>这  这根本说不通
<19-8,Adams>It--it doesn't even make sense.

504
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,270
<19-8,Adams>你为什么会坐牢
<19-8,Adams>Why are you doing time?

505
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,470
<19-8,Adams>你没有前科
<19-8,Adams>You didn't have any priors.

506
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,280
<19-8,Adams>也没有伤到任何人
<19-8,Adams>You didn't hurt anyone.

507
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,910
<19-9,House>我有个糟糕的律师
<19-9,House>I had a bad lawyer.

508
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,380
<19-10,Adams>抱歉
<19-10,Adams>I'm sorry.

509
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,920
<19-10,Adams>我们不能再继续讨论这个病例了
<19-10,Adams>We can't talk about this case anymore.

510
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,310
<20-2,Mendelson>为让你明天能如期交药
<20-2,Mendelson>We hear you're gonna need an incentive

511
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,190
<20-2,Mendelson>我们听说你需要点鼓励
<20-2,Mendelson>to get all my pills by tomorrow.

512
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,880
<20-3,House>我没法凑齐二十粒  不过一旦我出去了
<20-3,House>I--I can't get all 20, but once I get out--

513
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,900
<20-4,Mendelson>你先出去
<20-4,Mendelson>Give us a minute.

514
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,490
<20-4,Mendelson>知道我为什么服丁螺环酮吗
<20-4,Mendelson>Why do you think I'm on buspirone?

515
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,620
<20-4,Mendelson>因为压力
<20-4,Mendelson>The stress!

516
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,090
<20-4,Mendelson>我差不多每天都拉肚子
<20-4,Mendelson>And I get the runs almost every day.

517
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,090
<20-4,Mendelson>一旦露出软弱迹象  一帮人就会排着队
<20-4,Mendelson>Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up

518
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,760
<20-4,Mendelson>把削尖的牙刷插到我眼睛里
<20-4,Mendelson>to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye.

519
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,380
<20-4,Mendelson>所以尽管我天性善良
<20-4,Mendelson>So as much as my better nature

520
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,660
<20-4,Mendelson>真的想给你开绿灯
<20-4,Mendelson>really wants to give you a pass...

521
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,380
<20-4,Mendelson>但那真的只会对我的健康不利
<20-4,Mendelson>It just wouldn't be good for my health.

522
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,390
<20-4,Mendelson>明天见
<20-4,Mendelson>See you tomorrow.

523
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,050
<20-4,Mendelson>我需要你的帮助
<20-4,Mendelson>I need your help.

524
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,470
<21-1,House>你还有火柴吗
<21-1,House>You have any matches?

525
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,690
<21-2,Frankie>没有  那可是严重违禁品
<21-2,Frankie>No, that's serious contraband.

526
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,640
<21-2,Frankie>你在打什么算盘
<21-2,Frankie>What are you planning to do?

527
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,760
<21-3,House>口香糖有吗
<21-3,House>What about a stick of gum?

528
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,110
<21-4,Frankie>当然
<21-4,Frankie>Sure.

529
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,950
<21-5,House>那个我也需要
<21-5,House>I'm gonna need that too.

530
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,120
<21-6,Frankie>为什么
<21-6,Frankie>Why?

531
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,710
<21-7,House>你问我为什么需要你一直带着
<21-7,House>Why do I need the pen that you always carry around

532
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,470
<21-7,House>却又从来不用的笔吗
<21-7,House>and never write with?

533
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,130
<21-7,House>这是B计划
<21-7,House>This is plan "B."

534
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,020
<22-1,Adams>你的脸怎么了
<22-1,Adams>What happened to your cheek?

535
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,670
<22-2,House>什么事
<22-2,House>What is it?

536
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,520
<22-3,Adams>着火
<22-3,Adams>A fire?

537
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,540
<22-3,Adams>豪斯  我们得撤离这里
<22-3,Adams>House, we gotta evacuate this area.

<22-3,Adams>快走
<22-3,Adams>Come on.

539

<23-2,House>什么
<23-2,House>What?

544
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,330
<23-3,Nick>你不管我了吗

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,880
<23-4,House>是的  就等你走开
<23-4,House>As soon as you leave, I am.

546
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,510
<23-5,Nick>为什么  有什么变化

547
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,670
<23-6,House>我只是受够了

548
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,260
<23-6,House>不想管你  不想行医  不想治病
<23-6,House>No you, no medicine, no fixing people.

<23-6,House>受够了

<23-10,House>我得开个洞  让你能够呼吸
<23-10,House>I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.

<23-11,Alvarez>豪斯  离他远点
<23-11,Alvarez>House, get away from him.

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,620
<23-12,House>他出现过敏反应
<23-12,House>He's having an allergic reaction.

<23-13,Alvarez>双手抱头  躺下
<23-13,Alvarez>Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.

<23-14,House>阿尔瓦雷斯  看看我在做什么
<23-14,House>Alvarez, look at what I'm doing!

<24-1,House>Saving us both from contraband charges.

<25-1,House>I think I really dodged a bullet there.

578
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,940
<25-2,Guard>你不需要保护性监禁了吗
<25-2,Guard>You don't need P.C.?

579
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,960
<25-3,House>呃  也不是什么私人恩怨

<25-3,House>我们再约  从长计议  我保证
<25-3,House>We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.

581
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,560
<25-3,House>不是因为食物  是因为热
<25-3,House>It wasn't the food. It was the heat.

00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,460
<25-3,House>肥大细胞增生症

584
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,930
<26-1,House>像是他刚喝的咖啡

594
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,480
<26-5,House>靠血液检查确诊肥大细胞增生症
<26-5,House>It's almost impossible to confirm masto

595
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,780
<26-5,House>是不大可能的
<26-5,House>with blood work.

596
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,510
<26-5,House>给我五片阿司匹林
<26-5,House>Just give him five aspirin.

597
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,920
<26-6,Sykes>如果他患有肥大细胞增生症
<26-6,Sykes>If he has masto,

00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,990
<26-6,Sykes>再次不能呼吸
<26-6,Sykes>and won't be able to breathe again.

<26-7,House>You do understand the meaning of the word "Confirm."

<26-8,Nick>我差点儿死在监房里
<26-8,Nick>I almost died in that cell.

603
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,800
<26-9,Sykes>豪斯  你之所以进来  就是因为你自以为
<26-9,Sykes>House, you're in here because you think you can do

604
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,180
<26-9,Sykes>可以随时随地为所欲为

606
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,140
<26-9,Sykes>我胆敢未经准许做实验性治疗
<26-9,Sykes>The A.C.L.U. would have my job,

607
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,520
<26-9,Sykes>公民自由联盟就会让我丢掉工作
<26-9,Sykes>my license, maybe even my house,

608
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,810
<26-9,Sykes>吊销我的行医执照  甚至让我失去房子
<26-9,Sykes>if I do an unauthorized experimental...

609
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,390
<26-10,Adams>可如果真的是肥大细胞增多症
<26-10,Adams>But if... if it is masto...

610
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,220
<26-11,Sykes>不是
<26-11,Sykes>It's not.

611
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,010
<26-12,House>给他服阿司匹林能有什么害处
<26-12,House>What do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?

612
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,280
<26-13,Sykes>我不会冒这个险
<26-13,Sykes>I'm not taking the risk.

613
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
<26-14,House>是他在冒险
<26-14,House>It's his risk to take.

614
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,870
<26-14,House>如果他再次发病
<26-14,House>If he has another attack
