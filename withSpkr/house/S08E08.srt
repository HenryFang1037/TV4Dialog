23
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,200
<1-14,Mike>如我所说
<1-14,Mike>That's what I just said.

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,090
<1-15,Tommy>被告不可能实施抢劫
<1-15,Tommy>That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery

25
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,250
<1-15,Tommy>因为他和你在一起

<1-19,Judge Foley>This is what you call going quickly?

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,780

<1-23,Tommy>That's it. Keep going.

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,460
<1-24,Mike>"误认为是马丁·布罗德
<1-24,Mike>"misidentified as Martin Brodeur

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,600
<1-24,Mike>图片说明及技术统计均出错"

40
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,730
<1-25,Tommy>情有可原的错误
<1-25,Tommy>An understandable mistake.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,600
<1-25,Tommy>毕竟原计划是马丁·布罗德上场
<1-25,Tommy>Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start

42
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,140
<1-25,Tommy>结果告吹
<1-25,Tommy>but bowed out

43
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,790
<1-25,Tommy>因为热身时喉部被球击中
<1-25,Tommy>after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,700
<1-25,Tommy>这就说到与本案最为相关的问题
<1-25,Tommy>Which brings me to my most relevant question.

45
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,640
<1-25,Tommy>10月8日晚你是否和被告在一起
<1-25,Tommy>Did you and the defendant spend the evening of October 8th

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,570
<1-25,Tommy>看魔鬼队比赛
<1-25,Tommy>watching the Devils game on tv,

47
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,680
<1-25,Tommy>还是你不过是在日报上读到相关信息
<1-25,Tommy>or did you just read about the game in the chronicle

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,500
<1-25,Tommy>进而作伪证
<1-25,Tommy>while concocting this false alibi?

49
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,250
<1-26,Mike>我  我
<1-26,Mike>I... I, um...

50
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,630
<1-27,Tommy>请原谅  法官阁下
<1-27,Tommy>Excuse me, your honor,

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,740
<1-27,Tommy>我请求上前议事
<1-27,Tommy>may I approach?

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,840
<1-28,Judge Foley>你确定
<1-28,Judge Foley>You sure you don't want to wait

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,470
<1-28,Judge Foley>不等他说完吗
<1-28,Judge Foley>till after he answers your question?

54
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,160
<1-28,Judge Foley>是的
<1-28,Judge Foley>No.

55
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,270
<1-29,Tommy>我申请延期审理
<1-29,Tommy>I'm gonna need a continuance.

56
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,030
<1-29,Tommy>现在
<1-29,Tommy>Now?

57
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,540
<1-30,Judge Foley>你再问一个问题  辩方就会一败涂地
<1-30,Judge Foley>You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.

58
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,560
<1-32,Judge Foley>-拜托  -闭嘴
<1-32,Judge Foley>- Come on. - Oh, shut up.

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,660
<1-32,Judge Foley>你心里清楚
<1-32,Judge Foley>You know it's true.

60
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,690
<1-32,Judge Foley>-我们把这了结了吧  -我做不到
<1-32,Judge Foley>- Let's finish this up. - I can't.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,220
<1-34,Judge Foley>为什么不行
<1-34,Judge Foley>Why the hell not?

62
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,240
<1-35,Tommy>因为我感觉我心脏病发了
<1-35,Tommy>Because I think I'm having a heart attack.

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,140
<1-36,Judge Foley>好吧  快叫救护车
<1-36,Judge Foley>Great. Call an ambulance.

81
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,700
<1-36,Judge Foley>总监：
<1-36,Judge Foley>zlean

83
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,880
<1-37,Foreman>以为自己心脏病发  其实不然
<1-37,Foreman>Thinks he had a heart attack but didn't.

84
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,330
<1-37,Foreman>他的心电图  心肌酶谱和心脏导管介入检查
<1-37,Foreman>His EKG, cardiac enzymes, and catheterization

85
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,580
<1-37,Foreman>都显示正常
<1-37,Foreman>are all normal.

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,710
<1-38,House>因为那是焦虑发作
<1-38,House>'Cause it's an anxiety attack.

87
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,110
<1-38,House>估计是因为他人到四十
<1-38,House>Probably because he just turned 40

88
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,570
<1-38,House>仍然叫做汤米
<1-38,House>and still goes by the name "Tommy".

89
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,770
<1-39,Foreman>不是焦虑
<1-39,Foreman>It's not anxiety.

90
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,310
<1-39,Foreman>急症室医生询问过他的妻子
<1-39,Foreman>The E.R. docs interviewed his wife.

91
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,990
<1-39,Foreman>证实他状态一直不错
<1-39,Foreman>She confirmed he's been feeling fine.

92
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,850
<1-39,Foreman>工作和家庭都没有异常情况
<1-39,Foreman>Nothing out of the ordinary at work or at home.

93
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,450
<1-40,House>她大概也以为她老公
<1-40,House>Probably also believes that he thinks

94
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,550
<1-40,House>嫌萨尔玛·海耶克的胸太大
<1-40,House>Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.

96
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,330
<1-41,Foreman>所以我坚持让他住院
<1-41,Foreman>Which is why I had them admit him anyway

97
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,700
<1-41,Foreman>并用阿普唑仑[抗焦虑药]治疗
<1-41,Foreman>and treat with Alprazolam.

98
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,020
<1-41,Foreman>没效果
<1-41,Foreman>No improvements.

99
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,730
<1-43,Foreman>-因为  -因为对某些病人来说
<1-43,Foreman>- Because... - Because for some patients

100
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,550
<1-43,Foreman>被诊断为焦虑性障碍
<1-43,Foreman>the diagnosis of anxiety disorder

101
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,330
<1-43,Foreman>反而会加剧焦虑
<1-43,Foreman>can actually increase anxiety,

102
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,730
<1-43,Foreman>所以我才会告诉他
<1-43,Foreman>which is also why I told him

103
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,120
<1-43,Foreman>他有轻度呼吸道感染
<1-43,Foreman>he had a minor respiratory infection

104
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,070
<1-43,Foreman>通过药物治疗  可以很容易痊愈
<1-43,Foreman>that was easily curable by the medication.

105
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,780
<1-44,House>你说谎了
<1-44,House>You lied?

106
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,560
<1-45,Foreman>我排除了心脏病和焦虑性障碍
<1-45,Foreman>I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,870
<1-46,House>有意思
<1-46,House>Interesting.

108
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,060
<1-47,Foreman>我知道
<1-47,Foreman>I know.

109
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,370
<2-1,Taub>真厉害
<2-1,Taub>Impressive.

110
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,630
<2-2,House>你是指他耍小伎俩
<2-2,House>What, the wiliness

111
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,460
<2-2,House>排除了焦虑吗
<2-2,House>with which Foreman ruled out anxiety

112
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,640
<2-2,House>还是他遇到我之前的完全不知变通
<2-2,House>or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?

113
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,990
<2-3,Taub>是你居然能把果酱抹得每页都是
<2-3,Taub>The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.

114
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,880
<2-4,Park>带状疱疹导致的胸痛可能在皮疹之前出现
<2-4,Park>Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.

115
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,280
<2-5,House>疼痛会局限在一个皮肤节段
<2-5,House>Pain would be restricted to one dermatome.

116
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,230
<2-5,House>不会超出的
<2-5,House>It wouldn't cross them.

117
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,200
<2-6,Taub>如果是哮喘导致的气胸就有可能
<2-6,Taub>Asthma-induced pneumothorax would

118
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,460
<2-6,Taub>且可能不会在后前位胸片上显示
<2-6,Taub>and might not show up on a posteroanterior X-ray.

119
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,770
<2-7,House>没有哮喘病史
<2-7,House>No history of asthma.

120
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,460
<2-7,House>还做了胸部侧位片
<2-7,House>They did a lateral view as well.

121
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,180
<2-8,Chase>没有气胸的迹象
<2-8,Chase>No sign of a pneumothorax

122
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,210
<2-8,Chase>也没有深沟征
<2-8,Chase>or deep sulcus sign.

123
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,820
<2-9,Adams>我曾治疗过一个有类似症状的囚犯
<2-9,Adams>I treated an inmate once with similar symptoms

124
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,990
<2-9,Adams>他试图用氯气毒死自己的牢友
<2-9,Adams>after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.

125
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,020
<2-10,Taub>他没意识到牢房空气共享吗
<2-10,Taub>He didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?

126
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,600
<2-11,Adams>氯气集中在近地面
<2-11,Adams>Chlorine gas pools near the ground

127
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,900
<2-11,Adams>他以为自己在上铺就没事
<2-11,Adams>he thought he'd be safe in the top bunk.

128
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,090
<2-12,Park>为什么会有人对我们的患者下毒
<2-12,Park>Well, why would anyone try to poison our guy?

129
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,730
<2-13,Taub>他就靠把别人送进监狱谋生
<2-13,Taub>He makes a living sending people to prison.

130
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,970
<2-14,Chase>但他不在狱内  再说他又没被
<2-14,Chase>But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard

131
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,260
<2-14,Chase>关在密闭室内  怎么用毒气毒他啊
<2-14,Chase>to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.

132
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,780
<2-15,House>所以阿尔宙斯才创造了一个物质有三态的世界
<2-15,House>Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter

134
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,570
<2-15,House>和300种能引发他症状的固态液态毒物
<2-15,House>and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.

135
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,650
<2-16,Taub>阿尔宙斯
<2-16,Taub>Arceus?

136
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,130
<2-17,House>去查查吧  并碱化他的尿液
<2-17,House>Look it up. And alkalinize his urine.

137
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,730
<2-17,House>去他家搜寻一下  和他老婆谈谈
<2-17,House>Go search his home, talk to his wife,

138
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,590
<2-17,House>看看能不能套出她用的什么毒
<2-17,House>see if you can get her to tell us what she used.

139
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,090
<2-18,Adams>等等  你为什么认为是他妻子下的毒
<2-18,Adams>Wait, why would you think his wife poisoned him?

140
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,290
<2-19,House>因为最危险的  不是外贼
<2-19,House>Because dangerous people don't break into your home,

141
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,250
<2-19,House>而是家贼
<2-19,House>they live in it.

142
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,300
<2-19,House>虽然他的孩子已经到了希望爸爸去死的年纪
<2-19,House>And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead,

143
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,050
<2-19,House>要说真动手却还嫩了点
<2-19,House>they're still too young to do anything about it.

144
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,710
<2-20,Taub>你脑袋里的世界一定和谐美满
<2-20,Taub>Must be such a pleasure to live in your head.

145
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,400
<2-21,House>你说得对
<2-21,House>You're right.

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,810
<2-21,House>孩子可能早熟
<2-21,House>Kids might be precocious.

147
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,360
<2-21,House>你去搜查他家
<2-21,House>You handle his house.

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
<2-21,House>你去应付他和他老婆
<2-21,House>You handle him and his wife.

149
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,650
<2-22,Chase>他们可以出去溜达  什么都不做吗
<2-22,Chase>They get to just hang out and do nothing?

150
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,260
<2-23,House>需要帮忙的话  随便挑
<2-23,House>If you need help, you can take whoever you want.

151
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,430
<2-24,Chase and Adams>-我选陶博  -我选陶博
<2-24,Chase and Adams>- I'll take Taub. - I'll take Taub.

152
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,530
<2-26,Adams>-有意思  -不  这没什么
<2-26,Adams>- Interesting. - No, it's not.

153
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,990
<2-26,Adams>非此即彼
<2-26,Adams>It was a 50/50 choice.

154
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,600
<2-26,Adams>陶博还是朴克我都无所谓
<2-26,Adams>I'm totally fine with Taub or Park.

155
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,760
<2-27,Chase>正好  我选陶博
<2-27,Chase>Cool. I'll take Taub.

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,330
<2-28,Adams>那我选朴克
<2-28,Adams>And I'll take Park.

157
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,060
<2-29,House>真好玩
<2-29,House>That was fun.

158
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,450
<2-30,Park>一点也不
<2-30,Park>Not really.

159
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,370
<3-1,Chase>干得好  头儿
<3-1,Chase>Nice move, boss.

160
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,200
<3-1,Chase>对患者撒谎
<3-1,Chase>Lying to the patient.

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,220
<3-2,Foreman>我别无选择
<3-2,Foreman>I had no choice.

162
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,470
<3-2,Foreman>我知道豪斯不会接这病例
<3-2,Foreman>I knew House wouldn't take the case

163
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,870
<3-2,Foreman>除非我先排除焦虑
<3-2,Foreman>unless I ruled out anxiety.

164
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,190
<3-3,Taub>你需要个女朋友
<3-3,Taub>You need a girlfriend.

165
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,610
<3-4,Foreman>好管住我  不对病人撒谎吗
<3-4,Foreman>To keep me from lying to patients?

166
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,220
<3-5,Taub>好给你你所需的刺激
<3-5,Taub>To give you the excitement you need

167
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,490
<3-5,Taub>那样你就不用去找刺激了
<3-5,Taub>so you don't go looking for it.

168
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,870
<3-5,Taub>你已经不在豪斯手底下干活了
<3-5,Taub>You're not working for House anymore,

169
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,130
<3-5,Taub>也就是说如果你犯事
<3-5,Taub>which means you no longer have him

170
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,590
<3-5,Taub>也不能把责任推给他
<3-5,Taub>to blame if you get caught.

171
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,720
<3-6,Foreman>我不是在找刺激
<3-6,Foreman>I'm not looking for excitement.

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,550
<3-6,Foreman>我是在干我的本职工作
<3-6,Foreman>I'm doing my job,

173
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,460
<3-6,Foreman>其中就包括让豪斯做好他的本职工作
<3-6,Foreman>part of which is to make sure House does his.

174
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,510
<3-7,Chase>找个女朋友这主意不错
<3-7,Chase>Girlfriend might not be so bad.

175
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,850
<3-8,Taub>这比你要做的事风险小多了
<3-8,Taub>It's less dangerous than where you're headed.

176
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,060
<3-8,Taub>这话是从我这个要付一份赡养费
<3-8,Taub>And that's from a guy with one alimony

177
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,710
<3-8,Taub>还要养两个孩子的人口中说出的
<3-8,Taub>and two child support payments.

178
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,670
<4-1,Adams>这个新的弯道控制装置
<4-1,Adams>It's this new curve control thing.

179
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,980
<4-1,Adams>当它感应到我入弯速度太快时
<4-1,Adams>It automatically slows the car when it senses

180
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,770
<4-1,Adams>能自动减慢车速
<4-1,Adams>I'm taking a curve too fast.

181
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,360
<4-2,Park>你真的以为我很在乎你的车吗
<4-2,Park>You really think I care about your car,

182
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,890
<4-2,Park>或是你在想方设法不谈及
<4-2,Park>or are you just trying to avoid talking

183
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,790
<4-2,Park>你为什么不喜欢和我一起工作
<4-2,Park>about why you don't like working with me?

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,430
<4-3,Adams>这没什么可说的
<4-3,Adams>There's nothing to talk about.

185
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,120
<4-3,Adams>豪斯小时候就喜欢
<4-3,Adams>House liked poking ant hills

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
<4-3,Adams>拿着木棍捅蚁冢
<4-3,Adams>with a stick when he was a kid,

187
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,430
<4-3,Adams>他现在是对我们故技重施
<4-3,Adams>and now he wants to do the same with us.

188
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,920
<4-4,Park>豪斯是个混蛋  但他直觉很准
<4-4,Park>House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass.

189
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,620
<4-4,Park>显然他看出些问题了
<4-4,Park>He obviously noticed something.

190
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,460
<4-5,Adams>对  那就是我们合作得很愉快
<4-5,Adams>Yeah, the fact that we work well together.

191
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,030
<4-5,Adams>他喜欢坐山观虎斗  就想找人虐一下
<4-5,Adams>He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.

192
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,090
<4-5,Adams>可别落入他的圈套
<4-5,Adams>Don't let it be us.

193
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,910
<4-5,Adams>我觉得那不可能
<4-5,Adams>I don't see how that's possible.

194
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,790
<4-5,Adams>汤米在办公室里很受欢迎
<4-5,Adams>Tommy's the most popular guy in his office.

195
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,080
<5-1,Taub>甚至有被告被判刑后还感谢他
<5-1,Taub>He's even had defendants thank him after they were sentenced.

196
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,650
<5-1,Taub>他们为什么感谢他
<5-1,Taub>Why would they thank him?

197
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,330
<5-2,Olivia>因为他不把他们当成人渣来看
<5-2,Olivia>Because he doesn't treat them like scum.

198
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,260
<5-2,Olivia>他让他们感觉他是在帮助他们
<5-2,Olivia>He makes them feel like he's helping

199
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,440
<5-2,Olivia>替他们提出恳求或是
<5-2,Olivia>by offering a plea or even just

200
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,780
<5-2,Olivia>让他们在监狱中赎罪  以安抚良心
<5-2,Olivia>by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience.

201
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,780
<5-2,Olivia>就算有人想下毒
<5-2,Olivia>And even if someone wanted to poison him,

202
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,020
<5-2,Olivia>我看他们也没有机会啊
<5-2,Olivia>I don't see how they would do it.

203
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,350
<5-2,Olivia>他只吃喝家里做的东西
<5-2,Olivia>He never eats or drinks anything that we haven't made at home.

204
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,410
<5-3,Taub>等等  你没夸张吗
<5-3,Taub>Wait. You mean literally,

205
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,870
<5-3,Taub>比如  在外面连一瓶水都不喝吗
<5-3,Taub>like, not even a bottle of water?

206
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,760
<5-4,Olivia>不喝
<5-4,Olivia>No.

207
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,750
<5-5,Taub>那么他显然是在害怕什么
<5-5,Taub>So he was obviously afraid of something.

208
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,870
<5-6,Olivia>对  怕耗子  老鼠和蟑螂
<5-6,Olivia>Yeah, rats, mice, cockroaches.

209
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,350
<5-6,Olivia>我从法律学院毕业后
<5-6,Olivia>My first job out of law school

210
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,770
<6-1,Tommy>第一份工作是在卫生部
<6-1,Tommy>was at the health department.

211
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,700
<6-1,Tommy>如果你也见过我见过的一些厨房
<6-1,Tommy>If you'd have seen some of the kitchens

212
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,220
<6-1,Tommy>或是食品处理厂
<6-1,Tommy>or the processing plants I have,

213
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,540
<6-1,Tommy>你也会只吃自己做的东西
<6-1,Tommy>you'd cook all your own food too.

214
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,700
<6-2,Chase>毒物不一定在食物里
<6-2,Chase>Poison wouldn't have to be in food.

215
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,790
<6-2,Chase>你最近有没有收到
<6-2,Chase>Have you gotten any

216
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,270
<6-2,Chase>什么陌生的信件或是包裹
<6-2,Chase>strange letters or packages recently?

217
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,920
<6-3,Tommy>没有
<6-3,Tommy>No.

218
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,530
<6-4,Chase>也不一定是在工作的地方中毒
<6-4,Chase>You also wouldn't have to be at work.

219
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,200
<6-5,Tommy>我们有两个小孩
<6-5,Tommy>We've got two young kids.

220
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,230
<6-5,Tommy>我在家里绝对不可能
<6-5,Tommy>There's definitely no poisons

221
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,070
<6-5,Tommy>意外接触到有毒物质
<6-5,Tommy>I could have accidentally been exposed to at home.

222
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,650
<6-6,Chase>如果不是意外呢
<6-6,Chase>What if it wasn't an accident?

223
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,170
<6-6,Chase>你和你妻子关系怎么样
<6-6,Chase>How are things between you and your wife?

224
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,010
<6-7,Tommy>你是在问  我是否
<6-7,Tommy>Are you asking me if I think

225
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,470
<6-7,Tommy>认为我妻子想杀我吗
<6-7,Tommy>my wife is trying to kill me?

226
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,760
<6-8,Chase>对
<6-8,Chase>Yes, I am.

227
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,630
<6-9,Tommy>绝对不可能
<6-9,Tommy>Absolutely not.

228
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,780
<6-9,Tommy>我这人可是时刻警惕着
<6-9,Tommy>This is coming from a man whose eyes are wide open.

229
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,950
<6-9,Tommy>我起诉过几百个犯下卑劣罪行的丈夫  妻子
<6-9,Tommy>I have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts by husbands, wives,

230
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,720
<6-9,Tommy>还有父母
<6-9,Tommy>parents.

231
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,310
<6-9,Tommy>我敢保证...
<6-9,Tommy>I can assure you...

232
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,650
<6-9,Tommy>我爱我的丈夫
<6-9,Tommy>I love my husband,

233
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,240
<6-9,Tommy>而且我绝对不会
<6-9,Tommy>and I would not ever even for a second

234
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,180
<6-9,Tommy>有去伤害他的想法
<6-9,Tommy>consider doing anything to hurt him.

235
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,530
<7-1,Adams>车库里没有
<7-1,Adams>No pesticides,

236
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,800
<7-1,Adams>杀虫剂  化肥或是燃料
<7-1,Adams>fertilizers, or fuel in the garage.

237
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,570
<7-1,Adams>你有什么发现吗
<7-1,Adams>You find anything?

238
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,940
<7-1,Adams>没有  我在这里甚至
<7-1,Adams>No, there's not even a bottle

239
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,410
<7-2,Adams>连一瓶清洁剂都没有找到
<7-2,Adams>of wite-out in this place.

240
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,390
<7-2,Adams>也许我们应该再找找
<7-2,Adams>Maybe we should look again.

241
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,590
<7-3,Park>也许我们应该在警察赶到前就撤
<7-3,Park>Maybe we should leave before the police get here.

242
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,350
<7-4,Adams>就算有人看到我们闯进来 然后报警
<7-4,Adams>Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911,

243
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,820
<7-4,Adams>除非说我们携带武器  否则就不是首要案件
<7-4,Adams>unless they said we were armed, it's low priority.

244
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,340
<7-4,Adams>所以我们应该还有五分钟
<7-4,Adams>We've got another five minutes.

245
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,440
<7-5,Park>他是一名检查官
<7-5,Park>He's a prosecutor.

246
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,260
<7-5,Park>他显然认识很多警察
<7-5,Park>Obviously he knows a lot of cops.

247
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,830
<7-5,Park>他的房子才不会不是首要案件呢
<7-5,Park>His house is not gonna be low priority.

248
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,690
<7-6,Adams>有道理
<7-6,Adams>Good point.

249
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,920
<7-6,Adams>等等
<7-6,Adams>Wait.

250
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,420
<7-7,Park>餐厅是在墙那边
<7-7,Park>The dining room's on the other side of that wall.

251
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,870
<7-8,Adams>对  怎么了
<7-8,Adams>Yeah, so?

252
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,680
<7-9,Park>但是它似乎在这边多出了三英尺
<7-9,Park>But it ends, like, three feet further over.

253
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
<7-10,Adams>你是在开玩笑吧
<7-10,Adams>You've got to be kidding me.

254
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,040
<7-10,Adams>你刚刚还想赶紧逃出去
<7-10,Adams>A second ago, you wanted to run like hell,

255
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,950
<7-10,Adams>现在却想在这儿找密道吗
<7-10,Adams>and now you want to look for secret passages?

256
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,720
<7-11,Park>在冰箱上有一块磁铁
<7-11,Park>There's a magnet on the fridge

257
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,780
<7-11,Park>是用来打开有童锁的柜子的
<7-11,Park>they use to open child-proofed cabinets.

258
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,710
<7-11,Park>去拿过来
<7-11,Park>Go get it.

259
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,660
<7-11,Park>快点
<7-11,Park>Hurry up.

260
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,500
<7-12,Adams>给
<7-12,Adams>Here.

261
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,160
<7-13,Park>天啊
<7-13,Park>Holy crap.

262
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,250
<8-1,House>先别说
<8-1,House>Don't tell me.

263
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,200
<8-1,House>我猜是吃醋的妻子在厨房里
<8-1,House>The jealous wife in the dining room

264
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,370
<8-1,House>手里拿着联吡啶除草剂
<8-1,House>with bipyridyl herbicide.

265
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,070
<8-2,Park>我们没找到任何有毒物质
<8-2,Park>We didn't find any poisons.

266
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,980
<8-3,House>但你们显然找到些东西
<8-3,House>Well, you obviously found something.

267
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,860
<8-3,House>对
<8-3,House>Yeah.

268
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,400
<8-3,House>一个隐蔽的掩体
<8-3,House>A hidden bunker

269
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,980
<8-3,House>里面的枪足以守卫诺克斯堡
<8-3,House>with enough guns to defend Fort Knox.

270
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,980
<8-3,House>诺克斯堡是美国陆军装甲中心
<8-3,House>美国陆军装甲学校等机构均所在地

271
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,300
<9-1,Adams>或是攻进去
<9-1,Adams>Or break into it.

272
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,620
<9-2,House>太帅了
<9-2,House>Cool.

273
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,280
<10-1,Olivia>不可能  你们肯定闯错家了
<10-1,Olivia>That's impossible. You must have broken into the wrong house.

274
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,710
<10-2,Adams>那么你的邻居就很诡异了
<10-2,Adams>Then you have creepy neighbors,

275
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,860
<10-2,Adams>因为房子里到处是你们和孩子的照片
<10-2,Adams>because there were photos of you and your kids all over.

276
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,720
<10-3,Olivia>我不明白
<10-3,Olivia>I don't understand.

277
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,570
<10-3,Olivia>这怎么可能...
<10-3,Olivia>How could this...

278
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,350
<10-4,Tommy>那是去年装修时我建的密室
<10-4,Tommy>I had it put in during the remodel last year.

279
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,700
<10-5,Olivia>但我们是一起商量装修计划的啊
<10-5,Olivia>But we went over the plans together.

280
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,010
<10-6,Tommy>它没在计划里
<10-6,Tommy>It's not in the plans.

281
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,580
<10-6,Tommy>我不想让市里知道
<10-6,Tommy>I didn't want the city to know about it.

282
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
<10-6,Tommy>我很抱歉
<10-6,Tommy>I'm sorry.

283
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,280
<10-6,Tommy>我应该告诉你的
<10-6,Tommy>I should have told you.

284
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,150
<10-6,Tommy>只是...
<10-6,Tommy>I just...

285
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,880
<10-6,Tommy>我不想你和孩子们担心
<10-6,Tommy>I didn't want you and the kids to worry.

286
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,040
<10-7,Olivia>担心什么啊
<10-7,Olivia>About what?

287
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,590
<10-7,Olivia>汤米  是什么事啊
<10-7,Olivia>Tommy, what is it?

288
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,230
<10-7,Olivia>你为什么认为你需要这么多枪啊
<10-7,Olivia>Why would you think you needed so many guns?

289
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,550
<11-1,Adams>你不会相信的
<11-1,Adams>You're not gonna believe this.

290
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,900
<11-2,House>国将不国  天下大乱
<11-2,House>Imperio absenti chaos regit.

291
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,670
<11-2,House>他担心"大而不倒"只适用于银行
<11-2,House>He's worried that "too big to fail" applies to our banks

293
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,090
<11-2,House>而不适用于我们的政府
<11-2,House>but not our government.

294
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,270
<11-3,Adams>你怎么知道的
<11-3,Adams>How'd you know?

295
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,310
<11-4,House>因为每个建造掩体
<11-4,House>Because that's what every idiot

296
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,690
<11-4,House>并装满冲锋枪的傻瓜都怕那个
<11-4,House>with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of.

297
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,600
<11-4,House>希瑟·斯威尼在吗
<11-4,House>Heather Sweeney.

298
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,960
<11-4,House>请再等几分钟
<11-4,House>Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes

299
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,430
<11-4,House>就会有人来给你看病了
<11-4,House>till someone's ready to see you.

300
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,480
<11-5,Chase>也许那不是犯傻  而是一个症状
<11-5,Chase>Maybe it's not stupidity. It's a symptom.

301
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,350
<11-5,Chase>滥用可卡因可以引起妄想症和胸痛
<11-5,Chase>Cocaine abuse can cause paranoia and chest pain.

302
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,090
<11-6,Park>这不一定就是妄想症
<11-6,Park>This isn't necessarily paranoia.

303
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,470
<11-6,Park>社会确实是会崩溃的
<11-6,Park>Societies do fall apart.

304
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,260
<11-6,Park>看看伦敦还有那些暴动
<11-6,Park>Look what happened with London and the riots.

305
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,460
<11-7,Chase>个别地区的暴动和整个文明的陷落
<11-7,Chase>There's a difference between an isolated riot

306
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,150
<11-7,Chase>是有区别的
<11-7,Chase>and the fall of civilization.

307
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,540
<11-8,House>艾普尔·唐纳森在吗
<11-8,House>April Donaldson.

308
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,310
<11-8,House>抱歉  叫错名字了
<11-8,House>Sorry. Misspoke.

309
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,770
<11-9,Park>想象一下如果有恐怖分子
<11-9,Park>Imagine what would happen if there was

310
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,940
<11-9,Park>破坏咱们的食物供给链
<11-9,Park>a terrorist attack on the food supply

311
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,590
<11-9,Park>或是散布传染病  造成抗生素限量供给会怎么样
<11-9,Park>or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.

312
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,870
<11-10,Adams>这太荒谬了
<11-10,Adams>That's ridiculous.

313
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,230
<11-11,House>犀利啊
<11-11,House>Ouch.

314
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,420
<11-11,House>你闭嘴吧
<11-11,House>Oh, shut up.

315
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,630
<11-12,Adams>我们知道你想干什么  你不会得逞的
<11-12,Adams>We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,380
<11-13,Park>你的话确实挺重的
<11-13,Park>It was a little harsh.

317
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,180
<11-14,Adams>-别那么...  -什么  妄想狂吗
<11-14,Adams>- Stop being so... - What? Paranoid?

318
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,160
<11-16,House>如果你猜错了  你可就出洋相了
<11-16,House>You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.

319
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,030
<11-17,Adams>我认为你是个好人  一名优秀的医生
<11-17,Adams>I think you're a good person and a fine doctor,

320
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,450
<11-17,Adams>但是如果你认为所有人都需要一个
<11-17,Adams>but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs

321
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,770
<11-17,Adams>军火库的话  你就太荒谬了
<11-17,Adams>an arsenal of assault weapons.

322
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,700
<11-17,Adams>他显然有妄想症  会不会是法尔氏病
<11-17,Adams>He's obviously paranoid. What about Fahr's disease?

323
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,550
<11-19,Adams>-他没有产生幻觉  -那是我们还没发现
<11-19,Adams>- He's not hallucinating. - As far as we know.

324
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,240
<11-19,Adams>我们应该做一个精神状态检查
<11-19,Adams>We should do a mental status examination

325
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,750
<11-19,Adams>给他的基底神经节做个CT
<11-19,Adams>And get a CT of his basel ganglia.

326
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,610
<11-20,Park>不对  不该这么做
<11-20,Park>No, we shouldn't.

327
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,180
<11-20,Park>如果不是中毒了  最有可能是心房纤颤
<11-20,Park>If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation

328
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,300
<11-20,Park>由甲状腺机能亢进
<11-20,Park>brought on by hyperthyroidism

329
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,110
<11-20,Park>或睡眠呼吸暂停综合症引发
<11-20,Park>or sleep apnea.

330
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,880
<11-21,House>看来有小妞吵架可围观了
<11-21,House>Looks like we got ourselves a good, old-fashioned cat fight.

331
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,630
<11-22,Adams>我们没有吵架
<11-22,Adams>No, we don't.

332
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,050
<11-22,Adams>我们只是意见不合
<11-22,Adams>We have a reasoned disagreement.

333
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,110
<11-22,Adams>好吧  只有一个办法能解决争议
<11-22,Adams>Still there's only one way to settle this.

334
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,530
<11-23,House>实际是有两个办法
<11-23,House>Actually there's two,

335
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,500
<11-23,House>但是第一种  我们果冻不够
<11-23,House>But we don't have enough jell-o for the first.

337
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,700
<11-23,House>做个简单的精神状态检查
<11-23,House>Mini-mental,

338
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,680
<11-23,House>CT以及毛发取样
<11-23,House>CT, and get a hair sample

339
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,350
<11-23,House>查查他有没有吸食过可卡因
<11-23,House>to check for past cocaine use.

340
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,170
<11-23,House>检查下他的甲状腺水平  再做个睡眠监测
<11-23,House>Check his TSH levels and get a sleep study.

341
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,100
<11-23,House>抱歉  为了让她俩公平对决
<11-23,House>Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight,

342
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,280
<11-23,House>你和她凑合一下吧
<11-23,House>which means you're stuck with her.

343
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,750
<11-24,Park>什么叫凑合啊
<11-24,Park>He's not "stuck" with me.

344
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,270
<11-25,Adams>而且也不是对决
<11-25,Adams>And it's not a fight.

345
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,270
<11-26,House>小姐抱歉
<11-26,House>Uh, excuse me, miss.

346
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,110
<11-26,House>你叫什么名字
<11-26,House>What is your name?

347
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,570
<11-27,Lady>梅丽尔·威尔克森
<11-27,Lady>Mariel Wilkerson.

348
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,360
<11-28,House>你看着不像是叫梅丽尔的嘛
<11-28,House>You don't look like a Mariel.

349
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,550
<11-28,House>轮到你了
<11-28,House>You're up.

350
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,800
<12-1,Park>你怎么看  是病人有妄想症还是我有
<12-1,Park>So what do you think? Is the patient paranoid or am I?

351
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,410
<12-2,Taub>我不认为储存武器
<12-2,Taub>I don't think stockpiling weapons

352
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,790
<12-2,Taub>是理智的表现
<12-2,Taub>is the most reasoned response.

353
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,510
<12-4,Taub>但是  见识过布卢明代尔百货公司
<12-4,Taub>But, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's

354
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,590
<12-2,Taub>的黑色周五抢购潮[万圣节后的第一天]
<12-2,Taub>on Black Friday,

355
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,710
<12-2,Taub>我觉得他这么做也不能算是脑子有病
<12-2,Taub>I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.

356
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,760
<12-3,Park>那我呢
<12-3,Park>And me?

357
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,630
<12-4,Taub>同样的  见识过那抢购的场景...
<12-4,Taub>Again, given what I've seen at bloomingdale's...

358
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,070
<12-4,Taub>别让豪斯影响你
<12-4,Taub>Don't let House get to you.

359
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,110
<12-5,Park>是你们所有人
<12-5,Park>It's all of you.

360
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,820
<12-5,Park>我感觉你们不尊重我
<12-5,Park>I feel like you don't respect me.

361
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,580
<12-5,Park>奇斯就表现得很明显
<12-5,Park>Chase certainly doesn't try to hide it.

362
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,360
<12-6,Taub>他是尊敬你的  只是他觉得
<12-6,Taub>Chase respects you. He's just more comfortable

363
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,990
<12-6,Taub>和我搭档比较顺  因为我们认识得比较早
<12-6,Taub>working with me because he's known me longer.

364
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,000
<12-6,Taub>我不是因为你有枪才这么说的
<12-6,Taub>And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.

365
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,590
<12-6,Taub>我没有枪
<12-6,Taub>I don't own a gun.

366
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,830
<12-7,Park>我倒是考虑过  但是我很可能会
<12-7,Park>I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting

367
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,760
<12-7,Park>射伤家人  比如在看到我弟弟
<12-7,Park>someone in my own family, like when my brother

368
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,180
<12-7,Park>往沙发后面扔指甲屑的时候
<12-7,Park>tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.

369
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,830
<12-7,Park>你呢
<12-7,Park>What about you?

370
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,770
<12-8,Taub>如果政权真被推翻
<12-8,Taub>If anarchy breaks out,

371
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,930
<12-8,Taub>我打算做我的祖先们
<12-8,Taub>I plan to do what my ancestors have done

372
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,200
<12-8,Taub>做了几个世纪的事情  逃跑
<12-8,Taub>throughout the ages: run.

373
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,680
<12-8,Taub>这计划不错啊
<12-8,Taub>Sounds like a good plan.

374
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,660
<12-9,Forman>你有空吗
<12-9,Forman>You got a moment?

375
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,980
<12-9,Forman>你别再和护士们说我要找女朋友了
<12-9,Forman>Stop telling the nurses I'm looking for a girlfriend.

376
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,640
<12-10,Taub>你怎么会觉得...
<12-10,Taub>What makes you--

377
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,850
<12-11,Foreman>从早上到现在  已经有两个人邀请我吃饭
<12-11,Foreman>Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes

378
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,760
<12-11,Foreman>还有人送了我一盒蛋糕
<12-11,Foreman>since this morning.

379
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,450
<12-12,Taub>这么说  有几个人向你示好
<12-12,Taub>So a few people are nice to you,

380
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,350
<12-12,Taub>你首先想到的是"这真奇了怪了"
<12-12,Taub>and your first thought is, "Hmm, this seems strange"?

381
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,630
<12-12,Taub>我连自己吃午饭的时间都没有
<12-12,Taub>I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch,

382
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,510
<12-12,Taub>更别说四处去帮你物色女朋友了
<12-12,Taub>much less run around trying to recruit nurses for yours.

383
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,990
<12-12,Taub>我能回去工作了吗
<12-12,Taub>So can I get back to work?

384
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,010
<12-13,Park>你骗他的  是不是
<12-13,Park>You're lying, aren't you?

385
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,460
<12-14,Taub>我是为了他好
<12-14,Taub>It's for his own good.

386
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,730
<13-1,House>他没有妄想症  他就是蠢
<13-1,House>He's not paranoid. He's just stupid.

387
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,120
<13-2,Wilson>好吧  你不是也属于这类人吗
<13-2,Wilson>Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group?

388
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,030
<13-2,Wilson>你有把枪的
<13-2,Wilson>You own a gun.

389
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,850
<13-3,House>这病人有的不是一把枪  而是个军火库
<13-3,House>Our patient doesn't own a gun. He owns an arsenal.

390
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,500
<13-3,House>而且  我没有枪
<13-3,House>And I don't own a gun.

391
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,730
<13-4,Wilson>你有的
<13-4,Wilson>Yes, you do.

392
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,040
<13-4,Wilson>你是重罪犯  持枪会被送回监狱的
<13-4,Wilson>And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail.

393
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,190
<13-5,House>这还真不是我没枪的N条理由中的一条
<13-5,House>That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun.

394
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
<13-5,House>我要枪有什么用呢
<13-5,House>Why would I need a gun?

395
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,270
<13-5,House>唯一值得我保护的
<13-5,House>The only thing I own worth protecting

396
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,070
<13-5,House>毛贼还得拿根拐杖才能弄出我的公寓
<13-5,House>a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.

397
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,050
<13-6,Wilson>你不会去买你需要的东西
<13-6,Wilson>You don't own anything you need.

398
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,410
<13-6,Wilson>而是买你想要的东西
<13-6,Wilson>You own things you want.

399
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,270
<13-6,Wilson>而你绝对是那种想要搞把枪的人
<13-6,Wilson>And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun.

400
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,740
<13-6,Wilson>凡是危险的东西你都喜欢
<13-6,Wilson>You like anything dangerous,

401
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,450
<13-6,Wilson>巨型卡车  摩托车  烟火什么的
<13-6,Wilson>monster trucks, motorcycles, fireworks.

402
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,010
<13-7,House>人人都爱烟火
<13-7,House>Everyone loves fireworks.

403
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,070
<13-8,Wilson>喜欢看烟火  而不是制作烟火
<13-8,Wilson>Watching them, not making them.

404
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,560
<13-9,House>我说的是实话
<13-9,House>I'm telling the truth.

405
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,720
<13-10,Wilson>那我纠正我的说法
<13-10,Wilson>I stand corrected.

406
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
<13-11,House>如果你相信我  这事儿就此打住
<13-11,House>If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved

407
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,630
<13-11,House>别再节外生枝了
<13-11,House>with no further action necessary.

408
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,020
<13-12,Wilson>当然
<13-12,Wilson>Absolutely.

409
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,150
<13-13,House>这事儿还没结束  是吧
<13-13,House>It's not resolved, is it?

410
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,180
<13-14,Wilson>离结束还早着呢
<13-14,Wilson>Not even close.

411
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,160
<14-1,Chase>他没吸可卡因
<14-1,Chase>It's not cocaine.

412
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,300
<14-1,Chase>毛发取样没问题
<14-1,Chase>Hair samples were clean.

413
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,250
<14-2,Adams>看着也不像是法尔氏病
<14-2,Adams>It's not looking good for Fahr's either.

414
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,030
<14-2,Adams>没有钙化迹象
<14-2,Adams>I'm not seeing any calcifications.

415
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,730
<14-2,Adams>你肯定吗
<14-2,Adams>You sure?

416
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,450
<14-3,Chase>在未满五十岁的病人身上会难以察觉
<14-3,Chase>They can be pretty hard to detect in people under 50.

417
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,210
<14-4,Adams>-瞧见没  -什么
<14-4,Adams>- See? - What?

418
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,190
<14-6,Adams>意见不合是常有的事
<14-6,Adams>We all disagree all the time.

419
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,570
<14-6,Adams>不只是我和朴克会这样
<14-6,Adams>It's not just me and Park.

420
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,610
<14-7,Chase>挺会说话的嘛
<14-7,Chase>Nice try,

421
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,070
<14-7,Chase>不过我可不想趟你们的浑水
<14-7,Chase>but I'm not getting in the middle.

422
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,080
<14-8,Adams>那你早上为什么不愿和她一组
<14-8,Adams>So why didn't you want to go with her this morning?

423
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,760
<14-9,Chase>她人挺怪的
<14-9,Chase>She's weird.

424
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,610
<14-10,Adams>她不怪  她是个优秀的医生
<14-10,Adams>She's not weird. She's a good doctor.

425
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,700
<14-11,Chase>大部分优秀的医生都挺古怪的
<14-11,Chase>Most good doctors are weird.

426
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,250
<14-11,Chase>你看豪斯
<14-11,Chase>Look at House.

427
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,310
<14-12,Adams>我算怪吗
<14-12,Adams>Am I weird?

428
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,480
<14-13,Chase>是的  不过你长得靓  比较好忍受
<14-13,Chase>Yeah, but you're hot, so it's easier to put up with.

429
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,470
<14-13,Chase>你完全正常
<14-13,Chase>You're completely normal

430
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,790
<14-13,Chase>和你相处很愉快
<14-13,Chase>and a pleasure to deal with.

431
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,530
<14-14,Adams>你真奇怪
<14-14,Adams>You're weird.

432
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,150
<14-15,Chase>怪得很有型是吧
<14-15,Chase>In a good way?

433
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,580
<14-16,Adams>我们还是专心看病吧
<14-16,Adams>Maybe we should just concentrate on the medicine.

434
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,640
<14-17,Chase>你有枪吗
<14-17,Chase>You own any guns?

435
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,090
<14-18,Adams>你又跑题了
<14-18,Adams>That's not medicine.

436
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,110
<14-19,Chase>这话题和医学多少有点关系
<14-19,Chase>But it's related to medicine. Kind of.

437
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,430
<14-20,Adams>那你觉得呢
<14-20,Adams>What do you think?

438
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,890
<14-21,Chase>你有枪  不过不是为了自卫
<14-21,Chase>Yeah, but not for protection.

439
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,910
<14-21,Chase>尽管媒体大肆宣传社会动荡
<14-21,Chase>Despite what the media would have us believe,

440
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,870
<14-21,Chase>你还是觉得这世界很安全
<14-21,Chase>you think we live in a very safe world.

441
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,820
<14-21,Chase>你就是觉得枪支很好玩
<14-21,Chase>You just think they're fun.

442
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,380
<14-22,Adams>你怎么知道的
<14-22,Adams>How did you know?

443
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,230
<14-23,Chase>你在监狱工作
<14-23,Chase>Working in prison,

444
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,480
<14-23,Chase>知道罪犯很少随机攻击路人甲
<14-23,Chase>you learned criminals rarely target random strangers,

445
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,370
<14-23,Chase>而且你的钱多得都不知道怎么花
<14-23,Chase>And you've got more money than you know what to do with,

446
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,640
<14-23,Chase>所以你会去尝试那些看起来新鲜好玩的事物
<14-23,Chase>so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.

447
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,330
<14-24,Adams>你呢
<14-24,Adams>And you?

448
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,250
<14-25,Chase>我在美国这边没有枪
<14-25,Chase>Not here in the States.

449
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,820
<14-25,Chase>在我老家  我有几把打袋鼠的枪
<14-25,Chase>Back home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos.

450
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,240
<14-26,Adams>你猎袋鼠的
<14-26,Adams>You hunt kangaroos?

451
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,150
<14-26,Adams>它们那么可爱
<14-26,Adams>But they're so cute.

452
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,290
<14-27,Chase>还很可口
<14-27,Chase>They're also delicious.

453
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,860
<14-28,Adams>你骗我的吧
<14-28,Adams>You're screwing with me.

454
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,590
<14-29,Chase>当然
<14-29,Chase>Totally.

455
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,910
<14-29,Chase>没有钙化
<14-29,Chase>There's no calcification.

456
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,060
<14-29,Chase>看来我们都错了
<14-29,Chase>Looks like we're both wrong.

457
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,410
<15-1,Park>你不需要陪在这里
<15-1,Park>You don't need to stay.

458
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,290
<15-1,Park>要明天早上才会出结果
<15-1,Park>We won't have the results until the morning.

459
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,490
<15-2,Olivia>没关系的  我陪着他
<15-2,Olivia>It's okay. I'll stay.

460
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,310
<15-2,Olivia>回去吧
<15-2,Olivia>Go.

461
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,250
<15-3,Tommy>你也该让你妈歇歇了
<15-3,Tommy>I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh?

462
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,000
<15-3,Tommy>替我吻吻孩子们
<15-3,Tommy>Give the kids a kiss for me.

463
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,440
<15-4,Olivia>你认为世界末日来了  但却要孩子
<15-4,Olivia>You think it's the end of the world, but you wanted kids.

464
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,820
<15-4,Olivia>亲爱的  别这样
<15-4,Olivia>Oh, honey, come on.

465
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,420
<15-5,Tommy>我没认为末日将至
<15-5,Tommy>I don't think the world's coming to an end.

466
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,610
<15-5,Tommy>听着
<15-5,Tommy>Look...

467
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,810
<15-5,Tommy>你的车上有个备胎  对吧
<15-5,Tommy>You have a spare tire in your car, right?

468
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,850
<15-5,Tommy>那些枪就和备胎一样
<15-5,Tommy>That's what those guns are.

469
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,380
<15-5,Tommy>我祈求上帝不要让我用到它们
<15-5,Tommy>I mean, I hope to god I never have to use one.

470
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,250
<15-5,Tommy>但是如果一觉醒来
<15-5,Tommy>But if we can wake up

471
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,590
<15-5,Tommy>发现整个银行系统一夜间全倒闭了
<15-5,Tommy>and learn that the entire bank system has gone bankrupt overnight,

472
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,430
<15-5,Tommy>到时毫无准备就傻眼了
<15-5,Tommy>it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk.

473
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,680
<15-5,Tommy>只是以防万一
<15-5,Tommy>Just in case.

474
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,030
<15-6,Olivia>你一直...
<15-6,Olivia>And you've always...

475
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,360
<15-7,Park>这血哪里来的
<15-7,Park>What's that from?

476
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,740
<15-8,Tommy>不知道
<15-8,Tommy>I don't know.

477
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,470
<15-9,Park>你不觉得疼吗
<15-9,Park>You don't feel that?

478
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,260
<15-9,Park>不觉得
<15-9,Park>No.

479
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,040
<16-1,Adams>他整夜发高烧
<16-1,Adams>He also spiked a fever overnight.

480
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,600
<16-1,Adams>可能是肺结核
<16-1,Adams>It could be TB.

481
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,640
<16-2,House>你有话要说是吧
<16-2,House>You want to say it.

482
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,370
<16-4,Chase>-说什么  -胸片中没有肺不张
<16-4,Chase>- Say what? - There's no sign of atelectasis

483
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,070
<16-4,Chase>或肺部浸润的现象
<16-4,Chase>or infiltrates on the chest x-ray.

484
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,500
<16-5,House>没错  这是"她是白痴"的医学表述
<16-5,House>Yeah. It's med-speak for she's an idiot.

485
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,870
<16-6,Taub>系统性硬化病会导致下肢溃疡
<16-6,Taub>Systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.

486
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,580
<16-7,Park>那他的症状早该出现了
<16-7,Park>It would have to be pretty far along

487
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,310
<16-7,Park>而他的第一个症状是几天前才出现的
<16-7,Park>because the first symptom was just a few days ago.

488
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,330
<16-8,Adams>他的妄想症一年前就开始了
<16-8,Adams>His paranoia started at least a year ago.

489
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,870
<16-9,Park>如果他有妄想症的话
<16-9,Park>If he's paranoid.

490
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,160
<16-10,House>这么说要么就不是硬化症
<16-10,House>So it's either not sclerosis

491
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
<16-10,House>要么就是发展极快的硬化症
<16-10,House>or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.

492
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,860
<16-11,Taub>我们应该进行皮肤活检并开始给他用依诺肝素
<16-11,Taub>We should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.

493
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,550
<16-12,Park>我们不该等活检结果出来后
<16-12,Park>Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results

494
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,800
<16-12,Park>再开始治疗吗
<16-12,Park>before we start treatment?

495
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,640
<16-13,House>该你表态了
<16-13,House>Now's your chance.

496
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,110
<16-13,House>她可是豁出去了
<16-13,House>She's leading with her chin.

497
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,020
<16-14,Adams>我同意她的看法
<16-14,Adams>I agree with her.

498
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
<16-15,House>不  你不同意
<16-15,House>No, you don't.

499
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,490
<16-15,House>这意味着你俩都是白痴
<16-15,House>Which means you're both idiots.

500
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,150
<16-15,House>干活去吧
<16-15,House>Get to work.

501
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,080
<16-16,Park>我知道你不认为我是白痴
<16-16,Park>I know you don't think I'm an idiot.

502
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,310
<16-17,House>有什么关系吗
<16-17,House>Does it matter?

503
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,690
<16-18,Park>如果你只是拿我找乐  那没所谓
<16-18,Park>If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.

504
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,220
<16-18,Park>但如果你觉得需要耍手段
<16-18,Park>But if you feel the need to manipulate me

505
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,550
<16-18,Park>让我觉得自己有用  那关系大了
<16-18,Park>to make me feel useful, then yes.

506
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,060
<16-18,Park>我以为我们已经过了那个阶段了
<16-18,Park>I thought we'd gotten past that.

507
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,990
<16-19,House>如果真过了  你就不会在这纠结了
<16-19,House>If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here.

508
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,310
<16-19,House>但有能力并非就够了
<16-19,House>But ability isn't always enough.

509
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,770
<16-19,House>看看英格威·马尔莫斯汀就知道了
<16-19,House>Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.

511
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,460
<16-20,Park>那你是想帮我吗
<16-20,Park>So this is you trying to help me?

512
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,610
<16-21,House>不  我是在帮我自己
<16-21,House>No, this is me helping me.

513
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
<16-21,House>同时拿你找乐
<16-21,House>And amusing myself at your expense.

514
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,240
<16-21,House>这就又回到  你为什么在乎这事呢
<16-21,House>Which brings us back to, why do you care?

515
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,420
<16-22,Park>我应该得到尊重
<16-22,Park>I deserve respect.

516
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,640
<16-22,Park>我是个好医生
<16-22,Park>I'm a good doctor.

517
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,670
<16-23,House>大家尊重你  他们只是不喜欢你而已
<16-23,House>People respect you. They just don't like you.

518
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,370
<17-1,Chase>你妻子呢
<17-1,Chase>Where's your wife?

519
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,030
<17-2,Tommy>她需要点时间想想
<17-2,Tommy>She just needed some time.

520
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,720
<17-3,Chase>看来是对枪不感冒了
<17-3,Chase>Not a fan of guns I take it.

521
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,640
<17-4,Tommy>不只是枪的问题  只是...
<17-4,Tommy>It's not the guns. It's...

522
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,390
<17-4,Tommy>我不该对她撒谎
<17-4,Tommy>I shouldn't have lied about it.

523
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,990
<17-5,Taub>我猜两者都有点
<17-5,Taub>I'm guessing it's a little of both.

524
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,010
<17-5,Taub>还有点"我怎么不认识这人"的感觉
<17-5,Taub>And a little of, "Who the hell is this guy?"

525
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,080
<17-6,Tommy>我不是疯子
<17-6,Tommy>I'm not a nutcase.

526
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,870
<17-6,Tommy>我只是想竭尽所能
<17-6,Tommy>I just want to do everything I can

527
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,680
<17-6,Tommy>保护我的家庭
<17-6,Tommy>to protect my family.

528
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,310
<17-7,Chase>别担心  我相信她能理解
<17-7,Chase>Don't worry. I'm sure she understands.

529
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,900
<18-1,Guy in the clinic>一开始我以为是冻伤
<18-1,Guy in the clinic>At first, I thought it might be frostbite,

530
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,510
<18-1,Guy in the clinic>但我从没在冷的地方待过
<18-1,Guy in the clinic>but I haven't really been out in the cold.

531
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,160
<18-2,House>但你的第一感觉还是冻伤吗
<18-2,House>And yet your first thought was frostbite?

532
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,340
<18-3,Guy>是的  估计我只是从外表判断的
<18-3,Guy>Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.

533
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,870
<18-4,House>这看上去完全不像冻伤
<18-4,House>It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.

534
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,020
<18-5,Guy>真的吗
<18-5,Guy>You serious?

535
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,110
<18-6,House>不太确定
<18-6,House>With some difficulty.

536
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,330
<18-7,Guy>那究竟是什么
<18-7,Guy>Then what is it?

537
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,890
<18-8,House>是你需要放个长假的标志
<18-8,House>A sign that you need to take a long vacation.

538
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,230
<18-8,House>至少一个月
<18-8,House>At least a month.

539
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,650
<18-9,Guy>休假
<18-9,Guy>A vacation?

540
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,640
<18-9,Guy>等等  是像遗愿清单那样的吗
<18-9,Guy>Wait, is this like a bucket list thing?

541
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,640
<18-9,Guy>电影《遗愿清单》
<18-9,Guy>讲述两个同患癌症一贫一富的病友结伴完成未尽的心愿

542
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,050
<18-9,Guy>是癌症
<18-9,Guy>It's cancer.

543
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,290
<18-10,House>是银
<18-10,House>It's silver.

544
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,260
<18-10,House>我猜可能是你老板将硝酸银与凡士林混合
<18-10,House>I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly

545
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,060
<18-10,House>涂抹在钱上
<18-10,House>that your boss put on the petty cash

546
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,490
<18-10,House>这样他就能抓住偷钱的人了
<18-10,House>so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.

547
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,660
<18-11,Guy>我去
<18-11,Guy>Damn.

548
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,980
<18-11,Guy>是啊  我去
<18-11,Guy>Yeah, damn.

549
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,660
<18-12,House>它会渗透进你的皮肤
<18-12,House>It's diffused into your skin,

550
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,520
<18-12,House>而唯一去除的方法
<18-12,House>and the only way to get rid of it

551
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,950
<18-12,House>就是长出新的皮肤
<18-12,House>Is to get new skin.

552
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,410
<18-12,House>一般来讲需要30天
<18-12,House>That normally happens every 30 days.

553
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,690
<18-12,House>我听说威斯康辛州的拉克罗斯
<18-12,House>So I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got

554
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,020
<18-12,House>有世界上最大的啤酒罐
<18-12,House>the world's largest beer can.

555
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,360
<19-1,Regina>这是每天的日程
<19-1,Regina>Here's the per diem schedules.

556
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,070
<19-2,Foreman>这些应该录入电脑的
<19-2,Foreman>These are supposed to be in the computer files.

557
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,290
<19-3,Regina>对不起  自从克劳汀走了
<19-3,Regina>Sorry. Since Claudine left,

558
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,990
<19-3,Regina>就没人把这些数字进行录入了
<19-3,Regina>no one's been inputting the numbers.

559
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,390
<19-4,House>我真想克劳汀
<19-4,House>I miss Claudine.

560
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,520
<19-5,Regina>她是因为你才走的
<19-5,Regina>She left because of you.

561
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,920
<19-6,House>我以为那是娜汀
<19-6,House>I thought that was Nadine.

562
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,440
<19-4,House>-她也是  -你去哪
<19-4,House>- Her too. - Where are you going?

563
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,960
<19-5,Regina>你还有一个小时门诊时间呢
<19-5,Regina>You still have an hour left.

564
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,610
<19-7,House>优先处理急诊寻呼
<19-7,House>Emergency page takes precedence.

565
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,160
<19-8,Regina>-你能...  -我不知道那程序怎么用
<19-8,Regina>- Can you-- - I don't know how to use the program.

566
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,760
<19-9,Foreman>那就去找会用的人
<19-9,Foreman>Then find someone who does.

567
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,450
<19-9,Foreman>我得走了
<19-9,Foreman>I got to get out of here.

568
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,310
<20-1,House>收到你的寻呼了
<20-1,House>Got your page.

569
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,050
<20-2,Wilson>你个混蛋
<20-2,Wilson>You're an ass.

570
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,290
<20-3,House>承认吧
<20-3,House>Admit it.

571
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,890
<20-4,Wilson>放我下来
<20-4,Wilson>Let me down.

572
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,220
<20-5,House>你承认了就放
<20-5,House>After you admit it.

573
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,950
<20-5,House>要知道  我有点累了
<20-5,House>You know, I'm a little tired.

574
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,930
<20-5,House>-我想我要去...-好吧  我承认
<20-5,House>- I think I'm gonna-- - All right, I admit it.

575
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,790
<20-6,Wilson>尽管我知道这里有把枪
<20-6,Wilson>Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here,

576
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,770
<20-6,Wilson>但我永远找不到  因为你更狡猾
<20-6,Wilson>I'd never find it because you are more devious--

577
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,140
<20-7,House>-聪明  -狡猾
<20-7,House>- Clever. -Devious.

578
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,860
<20-8,Wilson>好吧好吧  聪明
<20-8,Wilson>All right, fine, clever.

579
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,750
<20-9,Wilson>你更聪明而且总能魔高一丈
<20-9,Wilson>More clever and you'll always be one step ahead of me.

580
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,170
<21-1,Anita>你要么在备战拳击赛
<21-1,Anita>You're either preparing to fight pacquiao

581
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,370
<21-1,Anita>要么就是今天过得很不顺
<21-1,Anita>or you're having one heck of a bad day.

582
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,940
<21-1,Anita>-我叫安妮塔  -艾瑞克
<21-1,Anita>- I'm Aniita. - Eric.

<21-2,Foreman>很高兴见到你
<21-2,Foreman>Nice to meet you.

584
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,990
<21-2,Foreman>你可以告诉陶博
<21-2,Foreman>And you can tell Taub

585
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,100
<21-2,Foreman>如果再不停止这种愚蠢的行为
<21-2,Foreman>that he's gonna get the same treatment

586
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,420
<21-2,Foreman>就将和这个沙包同样下场
<21-2,Foreman>as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.

587
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,530
<21-3,Anita>谁是陶博
<21-3,Anita>Who's Taub?

588
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,200
<21-4,Foreman>我知道你是个好人
<21-4,Foreman>You know, I'm sure you're a nice person

589
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,350
<21-4,Foreman>你也不知道你被搅进什么浑水里
<21-4,Foreman>and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into,

590
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,420
<21-4,Foreman>但是  说真的  我没兴趣
<21-4,Foreman>but, really, I'm not interested.

591
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,870
<21-4,Foreman>好吧  我肯定你是个好人
<21-4,Foreman>Okay, and I'm sure you're a nice person,

592
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,830
<21-5,Anita>不过我刚从亚特兰大搬来
<21-5,Anita>but I just moved from Atlanta,

593
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,120
<21-5,Anita>这是我第一次来这个健身房
<21-5,Anita>and it's my first time at this gym,

594
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,030
<21-5,Anita>我肯定不知道这个陶博是谁
<21-5,Anita>so definitely don't know who this Taub guy is,

595
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,470
<21-5,Anita>但我完全同意  他是个混蛋
<21-5,Anita>but I already agree. He's a jerk.

596
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,530
<21-5,Anita>你确定不想重新来过吗
<21-5,Anita>Are you sure you don't want to start over?

597
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,530
<21-5,Anita>慢慢想
<21-5,Anita>Take your time.

598
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,030
<21-5,Anita>我就在附近
<21-5,Anita>I'll be around.

599
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,570
<21-6,Foreman>陶博  我是福曼
<21-6,Foreman>Taub, it's Foreman.

600
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,460
<21-7,Taub>我现在没空聊  有点忙
<21-7,Taub>Hey, can't talk now. Little busy.

601
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,630
<21-8,Foreman>怎么回事
<21-8,Foreman>What's going on?

602
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,180
<22-1,Chase>这需要氟哌利多
<22-1,Chase>Need some droperidol in here!

603
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,380
<22-2,Taub>我得挂了
<22-2,Taub>I gotta go!

604
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,330
<22-2,Taub>他产生了幻觉以为自己被熊袭击了
<22-2,Taub>He was hallucinating he was being attacked by bears.

605
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,880
<22-2,Taub>再次表明是妄想症
<22-2,Taub>Points again to paranoia.

606
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,740
<23-1,Taub>我同意
<23-1,Taub>I agree.

607
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,190
<23-2,Adams>不过并非是再次
<23-2,Adams>Except for the "Again".

608
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,280
<23-3,Park>急性发作更可能是土拉菌病
<23-3,Park>Acute onset points to tularemia.

609
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,120
<23-4,Adams>或者是慢性的  那就是自身免疫疾病
<23-4,Adams>Or it's been chronic, which points to gad autoimmunity.

610
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,610
<23-4,Adams>可以解释神经功能缺损
<23-4,Adams>Explains the neurological impairment

611
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,620
<23-4,Adams>以及正常的血检结果
<23-4,Adams>as well as the normal blood work.

612
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,780
<23-5,Park>土拉菌病也不一定会在血检中查到
<23-5,Park>Tularemia doesn't always show up in blood work either.

613
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,810
<23-6,Chase>你们知道还有什么在血检中也查不到吗
<23-6,Chase>You know what else doesn't show up in the blood work?

614
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,280
<23-6,Chase>就是没病
<23-6,Chase>Nothing.

615
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,700
<23-6,Chase>可能是精神病
<23-6,Chase>This could be all psychiatric.

616
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,220
<23-6,Chase>未经治疗的精神分裂症
<23-6,Chase>An untreated schizoid disorder

617
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,230
<23-6,Chase>他终于无法抑制了
<23-6,Chase>he's finally lost the ability to suppress.

618
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,790
<23-7,Park>精神分裂症不会引起皮肤溃疡或高烧
<23-7,Park>Schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.

619
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,800
<23-8,Chase>没错  但因妄想而用脏指甲抠皮肤
<23-8,Chase>No, but digging delusions out of your skin

620
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,760
<23-8,Chase>就可能导致这两种症状
<23-8,Chase>with dirty fingernails could cause both.

621
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,370
<23-9,Park>我不认为这是精神病例
<23-9,Park>I don't think he's a psych case.

622
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,020
<23-10,House>因为你对妄想症产生了妄想
<23-10,House>Because you're paranoid about paranoia.

623
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,460
<23-11,Park>因为他的症状表明是感染
<23-11,Park>Because his symptoms point towards an infection

624
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,830
<23-11,Park>并已经扩散到脑部
<23-11,Park>that spread to his brain.

625
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,890
<23-11,Park>我认为我们应该用大剂量的广谱...
<23-11,Park>I think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum--

626
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,160
<23-12,Adams>如果是自身免疫疾病那会杀了他的
<23-12,Adams>Which will kill him if it's a gad autoimmunity.

627
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,140
<23-13,House>按自身免疫疾病治疗
<23-13,House>Treat for gad.

628
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,020
<23-13,House>用皮质激素并静脉滴注免疫球蛋白
<23-13,House>Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin.

629
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,410
<23-14,Park>我不是妄想
<23-14,Park>I'm not paranoid.

630
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,640
<23-14,Park>他们也不是不喜欢我
<23-14,Park>And they don't dislike me.

631
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,650
<23-14,Park>他们甚至都不了解我
<23-14,Park>They don't even really know me.

632
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,830
<23-15,House>谁告诉你的
<23-15,House>They tell you that?

633
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,800
<23-16,Park>我没问  因为你不会相信他们的回答
<23-16,Park>I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.

634
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,190
<23-17,House>如果这么想你能好过点  就随你吧
<23-17,House>If it makes you feel better to think that.

635
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,460
<23-18,Park>大家都不喜欢的是你
<23-18,Park>You're the one everyone dislikes.

636
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,160
<23-18,Park>估计你都不觉得是自身免疫疾病
<23-18,Park>You probably don't even think it's gad.

637
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,440
<23-18,Park>你同意她只是因为你认为
<23-18,Park>You're just agreeing with her because you think

638
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,940
<23-18,Park>这会引起我们之间更多的纷争
<23-18,Park>it'll create more conflict between us.

639
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,580
<23-19,House>想得到答案只有一个方法
<23-19,House>There's only one way to find out.

640
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,980
<23-19,House>实际上  有两个方法
<23-19,House>Actually, there's two.

641
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,440
<23-19,House>我们还在等果冻送来
<23-19,House>We're still waiting for that Jell-O delivery.

642
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,000
<23-19,House>记得把进展汇报给我
<23-19,House>Let me know how it goes.

643
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,260
<24-1,Wilson>抓住你啦
<24-1,Wilson>Gotcha!

644
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,260
<24-2,House>你这个可怜的傻缺
<24-2,House>You poor dumb bastard.

645
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,430
<24-2,House>干得好
<24-2,House>Touche.

646
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,880
<24-2,House>天啊  我正是我需要的
<24-2,House>God, this is exactly what I needed.

647
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,290
<25-1,Anita>无比赞同
<25-1,Anita>Tell me about it.

648
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,270
<25-2,Foreman>安妮塔
<25-2,Foreman>Anita.

649
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,720
<25-3,Foreman>-天啊  -那是谁  你室友吗
<25-3,Foreman>- Oh, my god. - Who is that, your roommate?

650
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,040
<25-4,Anita>你必须得走了
<25-4,Anita>It's just you have to go.

651
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,070
<25-4,Anita>等等  到底怎么了
<25-4,Anita>Wait a minute, what's the big deal?

652
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,500
<25-5,Anita>快走吧  我以后再解释
<25-5,Anita>Please. I'll explain later.

653
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,340
<25-5,Anita>请赶紧走吧  拜托了
<25-5,Anita>Just hurry up. Please.

654
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,590
<25-6,Foreman>你有男友了吗
<25-6,Foreman>You have a boyfriend?

655
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,260
<25-7,Anita>不  他不是我男友
<25-7,Anita>No, he's not my boyfriend.

656
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,160
<25-7,Anita>他是我丈夫
<25-7,Anita>He's my husband.

657
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,800
<25-7,Anita>真的很抱歉
<25-7,Anita>I'm really sorry.

658
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,010
<25-7,Anita>我以为你明天才回来呢
<25-7,Anita>Hey! I thought you weren't getting back till tomorrow.

659
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,880
<26-1,Park>他烧得非常厉害
<26-1,Park>His fever's going through the roof,

660
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,560
<26-1,Park>也就证明不是自身免疫疾病
<26-1,Park>which means we were wrong about gad

661
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,680
<26-1,Park>而且激素使得感染急剧恶化了
<26-1,Park>and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.

662
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,580
<26-2,Adams>也可能就是自身免疫疾病  不过治晚了
<26-2,Adams>Or it's gad, and we started treatment too late.

663
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,160
<26-3,House>-加大激素的量  -不能这么做
<26-3,House>- Increase the steroid dose. - We can't.

664
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,970
<26-4,Park>如果确实是感染  我们无疑会害死他
<26-4,Park>If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.

665
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,080
<26-5,House>神经系统症状恶化得这么快
<26-5,House>With neurological symptoms progressing this fast,

666
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,470
<26-5,House>他怎样都会死
<26-5,House>he's dead either way.

667
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,000
<26-5,House>如果我们增大激素的量
<26-5,House>If we increase the steroids,

668
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,500
<26-5,House>而他能多活几天
<26-5,House>then either death comes slower,

669
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,410
<26-5,House>就表示是自身免疫疾病而我们治得太晚
<26-5,House>which means we were too late with the gad,

670
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,860
<26-5,House>如果加速了死亡
<26-5,House>or death comes faster,

671
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,570
<26-5,House>则说明确实是感染  我们犯傻了
<26-5,House>which means we were too stupid with the infection.

672
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,520
<26-6,Park>我们没按感染治已经很傻了
<26-6,Park>We were already stupid with the infection,

673
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,600
<26-6,Park>但还不算太晚
<26-6,Park>but it's not too late.

674
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,390
<26-6,Park>他还年轻  两天前还非常健康
<26-6,Park>He's young, and he was perfectly healthy two days ago.

675
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,680
<26-6,Park>如果给他个机会  他能挺过去的
<26-6,Park>He can fight this off if we give him a chance.

676
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,010
<26-6,Park>好吧
<26-6,Park>Fine.

677
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,640
<26-7,House>不过猎枪可不顶用
<26-7,House>But a shotgun is not gonna work.

678
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,020
<26-7,House>我们需要一部狙击步枪
<26-7,House>We need a sniper rifle.

679
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,410
<26-7,House>做孢子丝菌病和脑膜炎球菌血症的DNA分析
<26-7,House>Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia,

680
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,770
<26-7,House>还有其它你能想到的测试
<26-7,House>and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.

681
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,620
<26-8,Adams>你刚刚才说要加大激素的量
<26-8,Adams>You just said you wanted to increase the steroids,

682
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,110
<26-9,House>-现在就...  -我改变主意了
<26-9,House>- and now you want to just... - I changed my mind.

683
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,090
<26-11,House>-但是...  -按朴克说的做
<26-11,House>- But...  - Do what Park says.

684
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,760
<26-12,Wilson>你确实没有枪
<26-12,Wilson>Well, you don't have a gun,

685
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,570
<26-12,Wilson>但你有我的太阳镜
<26-12,Wilson>but you do have my sunglasses,

686
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,110
<26-12,Wilson>我的网球拍  虽然我不知道你拿来干嘛
<26-12,Wilson>my tennis racket-- I can't imagine why--

687
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,690
<26-13,House>用来杀老鼠的
<26-13,House>Had to kill a mouse.

688
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,880
<26-13,House>你的小破太阳镜没帮上什么忙
<26-13,House>It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.

689
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,830
<26-14,Wilson>还有我的钱夹
<26-14,Wilson>And my money clip.

690
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,150
<26-15,House>还夹着钱吗
<26-15,House>Was there any money in it?

691
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,540
<26-16,Wilson>现在没有了
<26-16,Wilson>Not anymore.

692
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,440
<26-17,House>我能去睡觉了吗
<26-17,House>Can I go to bed now?

693
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,480
<26-17,House>还是你想进行体穴搜查呢
<26-17,House>Or do you want to do a cavity search?

694
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,780
<26-17,House>走的时候记得锁门
<26-17,House>Lock up on your way out.

695
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,660
<27-1,Adams>这太荒谬了
<27-1,Adams>This is ridiculous.

696
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,800
<27-1,Adams>我们浪费在寻找这个不存在的感染上的时间
<27-1,Adams>Every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection

697
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,880
<27-1,Adams>本可以用来治疗他的
<27-1,Adams>is time we could be treating him.

698
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,150
<27-2,Park>按错误的诊断治疗
<27-2,Park>For the wrong diagnosis.

699
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,160
<27-2,Park>如果是自身免疫疾病  他就应该癫痫发作了
<27-2,Park>If it was gad, he'd be having seizures.

700
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,330
<27-3,Adams>如果是感染
<27-3,Adams>If it was infection,

701
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,400
<27-3,Adams>在他的血液或者中枢神经系统中也会有迹象的
<27-3,Adams>there would be some sign of it in his blood or CNS.

702
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,150
<27-3,Adams>-而现在并没有  -只是暂时没有
<27-3,Adams>- Which there isn't. - Yet.

703
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,790
<27-5,Chase>我现在悔不当初听从豪斯的意见
<27-5,Chase>I'm beginning to think we should just go with House's idea.

704
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,370
<27-6,Taub>这就是豪斯的意见  他说...
<27-6,Taub>This was House's idea. He said--

705
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,220
<27-7,Chase>不  我说的是果冻
<27-7,Chase>No, I'm talking about the Jell-O.

706
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,650
<27-7,Chase>至少还赏心悦目
<27-7,Chase>At least it wouldn't be so annoying to watch.

707
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,910
<27-7,Chase>陶博  你有时间吗
<27-7,Chase>Taub, you got a minute?

708
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,670
<27-8,Taub>你真是个混蛋  你知道吗
<27-8,Taub>You're an ass. You know that?

709
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,700
<27-8,Taub>怎么了
<27-8,Taub>What's the problem?

710
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,710
<27-8,Taub>有些可爱的小护士给你烤饼干了吗
<27-8,Taub>Some cute young nurse baked you cookies?

711
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,430
<27-9,Foreman>不  我差点被人捉奸在他家客厅
<27-9,Foreman>No, some guy almost caught me making out with his wife

712
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,750
<27-9,Foreman>跟他老婆亲热
<27-9,Foreman>in their living room.

713
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,490
<27-10,Taub>这为什么会是我的错呢
<27-10,Taub>And how exactly is that my fault?

714
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,750
<27-11,Foreman>如果不是因为你闹得我
<27-11,Foreman>If you hadn't been screwing with me

715
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,500
<27-11,Foreman>有了这个想法...
<27-11,Foreman>and put the idea in my head...

716
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,440
<27-12,Taub>这么说我要是不让你有这个想法你还不约会了
<27-12,Taub>So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head.

717
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,400
<27-12,Taub>你真该看心理医生了
<27-12,Taub>You really do need psychiatric help.

718
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,850
<27-13,Foreman>与你不同
<27-13,Foreman>Unlike you,

719
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,410
<27-13,Foreman>我不喜欢戏剧化的生活
<27-13,Foreman>I don't need drama.

720
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,560
<27-13,Foreman>我喜欢我的工作
<27-13,Foreman>I like my job,

721
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,830
<27-13,Foreman>对生活也很满意
<27-13,Foreman>and I'm happy with my life.

722
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,390
<27-14,Taub>你对生活还真满意啊
<27-14,Taub>You're so happy with your life

723
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,780
<27-14,Taub>以至于你没有比半夜回来吼我
<27-14,Taub>you've got nothing better to do at midnight

724
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,130
<27-14,Taub>更好的事可做了
<27-14,Taub>than to come back into work to yell at me?

725
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,320
<27-15,Foreman>别插手我的生活
<27-15,Foreman>Stay out of my business.

726
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,900
<27-16,Taub>你怪错人了
<27-16,Taub>You're blaming the wrong guy.

727
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,750
<27-16,Taub>对他有好处
<27-16,Taub>Good for him.

728
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,250
<27-16,Taub>已婚妇女虽然不能长久  但至少是个开始
<27-16,Taub>Married one's not a keeper, but it's a start.

729
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,550
<27-17,Chase>你真是个笨蛋
<27-17,Chase>You're an idiot.

730
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,510
<27-18,Nurse>他有喘鸣音但是没有呼吸道阻塞
<27-18,Nurse>He has stridor but no obstruction.

731
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,730
<27-19,Chase>他发生过敏反应了  给我气管切开包
<27-19,Chase>He's anaphylaxing. Get me a trach kit.

732
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,310
<27-19,Chase>手术刀
<27-19,Chase>Scalpel.

733
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,500
<27-19,Chase>没有用  没有呼吸声
<27-19,Chase>It's not working. There's no breath sounds.

734
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,460
<27-19,Chase>这没道理啊
<27-19,Chase>It doesn't make any sense.

735
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,090
<27-20,Taub>他的气道在切口以下的地方阻塞了
<27-20,Taub>His trachea's blocked below the incision point.

736
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,090
<27-21,Nurse>-我们得试试消旋肾上腺素  -试过了
<27-21,Nurse>- We need racemic epinephrine. - We tried that already.

737
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,870
<27-22,Taub>再试一下
<27-22,Taub>We're gonna try again.

738
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,380
<27-22,Taub>只有这个办法了
<27-22,Taub>It's our only choice.

739
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,190
<28-1,Chase>他能重新呼吸了  但很微弱
<28-1,Chase>We got him breathing, but barely.

740
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,450
<28-2,Adams>至少我们知道呼吸道水肿不是治疗引起的
<28-2,Adams>At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did

741
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,820
<28-2,Adams>因为我们什么也没做
<28-2,Adams>because we're not doing anything.

742
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,590
<28-3,Taub>这是好事  因为自身免疫疾病
<28-3,Taub>Which is a good thing, because neither gad

743
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,070
<28-3,Taub>和全身性感染都不会引起过敏
<28-3,Taub>nor systemic infection would cause anaphylaxis

744
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,030
<28-3,Taub>或呼吸道水肿
<28-3,Taub>or tracheal edema.

745
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,400
<28-4,Park>而过敏反应
<28-4,Park>And an allergic reaction

746
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,980
<28-4,Park>不会在入院三天后突然恶化
<28-4,Park>wouldn't get worse three days after he was admitted.

747
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,250
<28-5,Chase>也就是说我们一无所获
<28-5,Chase>So we've got nothing.

748
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,660
<28-6,House>除非他还中着毒
<28-6,House>Unless he was still being poisoned.

749
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,570
<28-7,Adams>会是谁干的呢
<28-7,Adams>By who?

750
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,130
<28-7,Adams>在他出现幻觉的时候他老婆都不在这里
<28-7,Adams>His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.

751
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,980
<28-8,House>问得好
<28-8,House>Good question.

752
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,390
<28-9,Adams>现在我们成妄想狂了
<28-9,Adams>Now we're the ones being paranoid.

753
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,610
<28-10,Park>鳞状细胞癌呢
<28-10,Park>What about squamous cell carcinoma?

754
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,180
<28-10,Park>如果只在他的上皮细胞
<28-10,Park>If it's only in his epithelium,

755
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,830
<28-10,Park>胸腔X光片上就看不到
<28-10,Park>it wouldn't show up in his chest x-ray.

756
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,430
<28-11,Chase>有可能  但是...
<28-11,Chase>It is possible, but...

757
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,620
<28-12,House>不会导致幻觉
<28-12,House>Wouldn't cause hallucinations.

758
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,970
<28-13,Park>如果同时有副肿瘤综合症就会
<28-13,Park>It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.

759
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,690
<28-14,House>去做活组织检查
<28-14,House>Get a biopsy.

760
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,420
<28-15,Taub>你觉得是癌症吗
<28-15,Taub>You think it's cancer?

761
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,650
<28-16,House>我觉得你该赶紧做活组织检查
<28-16,House>I think you should get a biopsy.

762
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,600
<28-16,House>承认吧
<28-16,House>Admit it.

763
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,080
<28-17,Wilson>这是两小时前  我在你的衣柜里
<28-17,Wilson>Two hours ago, I found this in your closet

764
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,100
<28-17,Wilson>一只写着你名字的盒子里发现的
<28-17,Wilson>in a box with your name on it.

765
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,960
<28-17,Wilson>我知道你只有确定我不找了
<28-17,Wilson>I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment

766
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,770
<28-17,Wilson>才会把枪放回屋子里
<28-17,Wilson>until you were certain I'd given up looking.

767
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,890
<28-17,Wilson>所以我得让你确信我放弃了
<28-17,Wilson>So I had to convince you that I'd given up looking.

768
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,330
<28-18,House>那不是枪
<28-18,House>That's not a gun.

769
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,820
<28-19,Wilson>是啊  是个镇纸  凑巧还带有
<28-19,Wilson>Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy

770
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,900
<28-19,Wilson>能存放45口径子弹的空间
<28-19,Wilson>storage compartment for .45-caliber bullets.

771
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,770
<28-20,House>-那也不是真子弹  -承认吧
<28-20,House>- And that's not a bullet. - Admit it.

772
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,340
<28-21,Wilson>承认我更聪明更狡猾吧
<28-21,Wilson>I'm more clever and more devious.

773
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,410
<28-21,Wilson>我甚至可以把它还给你
<28-21,Wilson>You can even have it back.

774
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,840
<28-21,Wilson>如果你因此再次入狱  也不是我的问题
<28-21,Wilson>It's not my problem if you go back to prison.

775
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,340
<28-21,Wilson>我是要让你承认
<28-21,Wilson>My problem is you thinking

776
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,110
<28-25,Wilson>你并不总是魔高一丈
<28-25,Wilson>you're always one step ahead of me.

777
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,630
<28-26,House>它不是枪  所以什么也证明不了
<28-26,House>This proves nothing because it's not a gun.

778
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,010
<28-22,House>这是个道具
<28-22,House>It's a prop.

779
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,120
<28-22,House>从桃乐西·迪特里希魔术专卖买的
<28-22,House>From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act.

780
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,550
<28-22,House>看仔细了
<28-22,House>Look it up.

781
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,800
<28-22,House>她是唯一做接子弹表演的女魔术师
<28-22,House>She's the only woman to ever do the "Catch a bullet" trick.

782
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,350
<28-22,House>我是在一次扑克比赛里从她的道具师那里赢的
<28-22,House>I won this off her prop master in a poker game.

783
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,800
<28-24,House>-豪斯  -这是假枪
<28-24,House>- House... - It's fake.

784
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,300
<28-24,House>都塞住了
<28-24,House>It's plugged.

785
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,680
<28-24,House>你自己看
<28-24,House>Look for yourself.

786
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,890
<28-25,Wilson>别拿那东西指着我
<28-25,Wilson>Hey, hey, don't point that thing at me.

787
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,030
<28-26,House>一点儿都不危险  它又不是枪
<28-26,House>It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.

788
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,040
<28-27,Wilson>豪斯  豪斯  别这样
<28-27,Wilson>House, House, just stop it.

789
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,380
<28-28,House>好吧
<28-28,House>Fine.

790
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,310
<28-29,Wilson>你这是做什么
<28-29,Wilson>What the hell are you doing?

791
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,140
<28-30,House>-扣扳机  -别发疯了
<28-30,House>- Pull the trigger. - Don't be insane.

792
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,330
<28-32,House>子弹是空的
<28-32,House>They're blanks.

793
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,670
<28-30,House>你扣响扳机
<28-30,House>You pull the trigger,

794
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,050
<28-32,House>我假装吐点儿血沫
<28-32,House>I drool a little fake blood,

795
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,070
<28-32,House>然后吐出一枚子弹
<28-32,House>and then I spit out the bullet that

796
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,450
<28-32,House>骗观众是用牙齿接住的  来吧
<28-32,House>the audience thinks I caught in my teeth. Go ahead.

797
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,840
<28-32,House>开枪呀
<28-32,House>Shoot me.

798
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,570
<28-33,Wilson>我不会向你开枪的
<28-33,Wilson>I'm not shooting you.

799
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,740
<28-34,House>好  我来开枪打你
<28-34,House>All right. I'll shoot you.

800
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,430
<28-35,Wilson>住手  豪斯  住手
<28-35,Wilson>Don't. House, don't.

801
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,170
<28-35,Wilson>就算是空弹  也会吓坏别人的
<28-35,Wilson>Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.

802
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,800
<28-36,House>这不是真枪
<28-36,House>It's not real.

803
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,630
<28-36,House>所以你没能证明我有枪
<28-36,House>Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun.

804
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,360
<28-36,House>所以你什么都没证明
<28-36,House>Which means you proved nothing.

805
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,250
<28-37,Wilson>承认吧
<28-37,Wilson>Admit it.

806
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,680
<28-37,Wilson>承认吧
<28-37,Wilson>Admit it.

807
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,690
<28-38,House>-好吧  -什么好吧
<28-38,House>- All right. - All right, what?

808
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,270
<28-39,Wilson>你赢了
<28-39,Wilson>You win.

809
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,250
<28-40,House>赢了的感觉真好
<28-40,House>And it feels good.

810
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,380
<29-1,House>你们错了
<29-1,House>You were wrong.

811
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,800
<29-1,House>别太难过
<29-1,House>Don't feel too bad.

812
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,170
<29-1,House>我们之前都错了
<29-1,House>We all were.

813
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,730
<29-1,House>他的气道没有水肿
<29-1,House>His trachea wasn't swollen.

814
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,200
<29-1,House>是被假膜堵塞的
<29-1,House>It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it.

815
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,130
<29-1,House>说明他不是妄想症  只是个白痴
<29-1,House>It means he's not paranoid, is an idiot,

816
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,760
<29-1,House>而且确实中毒了
<29-1,House>and was poisoned.

817
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,680
<29-2,Chase>你在做什么
<29-2,Chase>What are you doing?

818
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,630
<29-3,House>给我一个纤维喉镜
<29-3,House>Give me a machida scope.

819
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,980
<29-3,House>抓住他的腿  他不会喜欢的
<29-3,House>Hold his legs. He's not gonna like this.

820
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,030
<29-3,House>因为你会不能呼吸
<29-3,House>Because you're not gonna be able to breathe.

821
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,830
<29-3,House>但我需要看看你的气道
<29-3,House>But I need to see down your barrel.

822
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,160
<29-3,House>好消息是  给你下毒的不是你妻子
<29-3,House>The good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.

823
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,450
<29-3,House>而是一种该死的小细菌
<29-3,House>It came from a little bastard of a bacterium

824
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,640
<29-3,House>它们的排泄物可以导致胸痛
<29-3,House>whose crap can cause chest pain,

825
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,580
<29-3,House>呼吸困难  皮肤溃疡
<29-3,House>respiratory distress, skin ulcers,

826
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,050
<29-3,House>令呼吸道产生假膜
<29-3,House>the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway,

827
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,650
<29-3,House>并且  在极少数情况下
<29-3,House>and, in very rare cases,

828
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,650
<29-3,House>产生幻觉
<29-3,House>hallucinations.

829
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,580
<29-3,House>打电话给疾控中心
<29-3,House>Call the CDC.

830
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,050
<29-3,House>说我们急需抗毒素
<29-3,House>Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.

831
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,120
<29-4,Park>白喉
<29-4,Park>Diphtheria?

832
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,010
<29-5,House>我们没有想到
<29-5,House>We didn't guess it

833
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,890
<29-5,House>因为白喉几乎绝迹了
<29-5,House>because nobody gets it.

834
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,760
<29-5,House>你不该猛挖掩体
<29-5,House>Instead of building bunkers,

835
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
<29-5,House>而该去扎点激发剂
<29-5,House>you should be getting boosters.
