1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,850
<20-14,Foreman>据估计  可观察到的宇宙达到了93亿光年的距离范围
<20-14,Foreman>It's estimated the observable universe is 93 billion light-years across.

2
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,880
<20-14,Foreman>可能更确切地说
<20-14,Foreman>It's probably more accurate...

3
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,350
<1-1,Abby>那里离这儿很远
<1-1,Abby>I'm gonna be so far away.

4
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,500
<1-2,Nick>我不在乎  我不想分手
<1-2,Nick>I don't care. I don't want to break up.

5
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,890
<1-2,Nick>周末我会去看你
<1-2,Nick>I'll come on the weekends.

6
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,040
<1-3,Abby>斯坦福在美国的另一边
<1-3,Abby>Stanford's on the other side of the country.

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,460
<1-4,Nick>我爸爸至少飞行了一千万里
<1-4,Nick>My dad has, like, ten million frequent flyer miles.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,350
<1-4,Nick>他不会介意的
<1-4,Nick>He won't care.

9
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,420
<1-5,Abby>大家都在注意听吗
<1-5,Abby>Are we all right over here?

10
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,760
<1-6,Abby>呃  是的  达蒙先生
<1-6,Abby>Uh, yes, Mr. Damon.

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,720
<1-6,Abby>我刚刚只是呛到了
<1-6,Abby>I just had something caught in my throat.

12
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,440
<1-6,Abby>艾比  这里是不容许吃喝东西的
<1-6,Abby>Abby, you know you're not supposed to have any food or drinks in here.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,670
<1-7,Abby>只是水而已
<1-7,Abby>Oh, it's just water.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,720
<1-7,Abby>我有点咳嗽
<1-7,Abby>I have a cough.

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,160
<1-7,Abby>不想打扰别人
<1-7,Abby>I didn't want to disturb anyone.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,590
<1-7,Abby>我们只能观察到宇宙的4%
<1-7,Abby>We can only observe 4% of the universe.

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,580
<1-8,Nick>剩下的还是未知的
<1-8,Nick>The rest of it is unaccounted for.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,320
<1-8,Nick>我竟然不知道你这么会撒谎
<1-8,Nick>I never knew you were such a good liar.

19
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,970
<1-9,Abby>再喝点伏特加  你或许还会发现我的其他一些不为你所知的地方
<1-9,Abby>Well, a little more vodka, and you might find out some more things you didn't know about me.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,050
<1-10,Nick>是吗
<1-10,Nick>Really?

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,660
<1-11,Mr Damon>尼古拉斯
<1-11,Mr Damon>Nicholas.

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,960
<1-12,Nick>是  老师
<1-12,Nick>Yes, sir?

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,060
<1-13,Mr Damon>从这些多得难以置信的星星中我们能得出什么结论呢
<1-13,Mr Damon>What conclusions can we draw from the incredible number of stars?

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,010
<1-14,Nick>结论是这个电影要么非常好  要么很差
<1-14,Nick>That the movie's either gonna be really good or really bad.

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,550
<1-15,Mr Damon>我更加注意的是有关外星生命的问题
<1-15,Mr Damon>I was thinking more about the implications for extraterrestrial life.

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,140
<1-16,Nick>我想  若是有无数个星星的话
<1-16,Nick>Well, I guess if there's an infinite number of stars,

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,640
<1-16,Nick>可能除了太阳系外  至少还有一个星系上存在着生命体
<1-16,Nick>Odds are there's at least one galaxy with life other than our own.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,290
<1-17,Mr Damon>或者说
<1-17,Mr Damon>Or?

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,250
<1-18,Nick>或者  没有
<1-18,Nick>Or...not?

30
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,080
<1-18,Nick>或者可以说  我们太阳系是很独特的
<1-18,Nick>Or our solar system is somehow unique.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,760
<1-19,Nick>现在的问题是  "哪里独特呢"
<1-19,Nick>The question then becomes, "In what way?"

32
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,950
<1-19,Nick>现在的问题是
<1-19,Nick>The question then becomes,

33
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,360
<1-19,Nick>"你还能教我们些更无用的东西吗"
<1-19,Nick>"Could you possibly teach us anything more useless?"

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,710
<1-19,Nick>你在看什么
<1-19,Nick>What are you looking at?

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,150
<1-19,Nick>艾比
<1-19,Nick>Abby?

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,500
<1-19,Nick>哦  天哪  出事了  她没呼吸了
<1-19,Nick>Oh, my god. Something's wrong. She's not breathing.

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,780
<1-19,Nick>艾比
<1-19,Nick>Abby?

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,470
<1-19,Nick>打911
<1-19,Nick>Call 911.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
<2-1,Wilson>你能不能在你的果冻祝酒下面垫张餐巾纸呢
<2-1,Wilson>Would you mind at least putting a napkin under your jelly toast?

40
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,770
<2-2,House>你弄张桌子来  我就不会在沙发上吃了
<2-2,House>Get a table, and I won't eat it on the couch.

41
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,250
<2-3,Wilson>不  你还是会的
<2-3,Wilson>Yes, you will.

42
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,780
<2-4,House>但我就不会有这么好的借口了
<2-4,House>But I won't have a good excuse.

43
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,180
<2-5,Wilson>为什么你不去弄张桌子来呢
<2-5,Wilson>Why don't you go get a table?

44
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,040
<2-6,House>又不是我的公寓
<2-6,House>Not my condo.

45
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,320
<2-7,Wilson>我批准了
<2-7,Wilson>You have my permission.

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,600
<2-7,Wilson>挑你喜欢的任何东西都行
<2-7,Wilson>Pick out whatever you want.

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,400
<2-8,House>那样就只能展现我的风格而不是你的
<2-8,House>Then it would be a reflection of me, not you.

48
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,350
<2-8,House>那样不好
<2-8,House>That wouldn't be right.

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,620
<2-8,House>不  那可以说明
<2-8,House>No, it would be a reflection of the fact

50
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,440
<2-9,Wilson>那个一直赖着我的家伙
<2-9,Wilson>that the guy who's been mooching off of me

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,490
<2-9,Wilson>并不完全是忘恩负义之徒
<2-9,Wilson>for as long as I can remember isn't a complete ingrate.

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,370
<2-10,House>你从没布置过一间房子
<2-10,House>You've never furnished a home.

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,160
<2-11,Wilson>我布置过一堆的房子
<2-11,Wilson>I have furnished a bunch of homes.

54
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,250
<2-12,House>不  你娶过一堆女人是她们布置的那些房子
<2-12,House>No, you've married a bunch of women who furnished a bunch of homes.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,400
<2-13,Wilson>你想搁在什么东西上吃是吧  没问题
<2-13,Wilson>You want to eat off something? Fine.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,810
<2-13,Wilson>把你的钢琴搬过来  在那上面吃
<2-13,Wilson>Move your piano in here and eat off that.

57
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,350
<2-14,House>你害怕
<2-14,House>You're afraid.

58
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,030
<2-15,Wilson>怕一个餐桌吗
<2-15,Wilson>Of a dining table?

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,370
<2-15,Wilson>就算把床柱上的把手下下来安到餐桌上
<2-15,Wilson>You know, they don't actually come to life

60
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,950
<2-15,Wilson>它们也不会变成活物
<2-15,Wilson>when you put a knob off your bedpost on them.

61
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,430
<2-16,House>你所处的环境就是一面镜子
<2-16,House>You are what you sit in.

62
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,640
<2-16,House>你的朋友  工作  家具
<2-16,House>Your friends, your job, your furnishings--

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,870
<2-16,House>都能映照出你的性格
<2-16,House>It all defines you.

64
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,000
<2-17,Wilson>你其实并不相信这点
<2-17,Wilson>You don't really believe that.

65
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,480
<2-17,Wilson>你只是不想去购物罢了
<2-17,Wilson>You just don't want to do the shopping.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,700
<2-18,House>买些家具回来
<2-18,House>Buy some furniture,

67
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,240
<2-18,House>不然就承认  你内心很空虚
<2-18,House>or admit that you're empty inside.

68
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,580
<3-1,Chase>X光检查的结果证实了
<3-1,Chase>X-rays confirm the fluid

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,070
<3-1,Chase>那些差点让她窒息而死的液体是肺水肿引起的
<3-1,Chase>that almost suffocated her to death was from pulmonary edema.

70
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,190
<3-2,Foreman>就是说问题出在她的心脏或肺上
<3-2,Foreman>Means the problem's either in her heart or lungs.

71
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,590
<3-3,Thirteen>毒化检验显示只有酒精
<3-3,Thirteen>Tox screen's clean for everything except the alcohol,

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
<3-3,Thirteen>她的碱式氯化铝含量也只有0.05毫克
<3-3,Thirteen>and her B.A.C. was barely .05.

73
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,010
<3-4,Chase>说明她只喝了一两口酒  顶级的
<3-4,Chase>That means she only had one or two drinks, tops.

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,810
<3-5,House>而且也没有外伤的迹象
<3-5,House>And there's no sign of trauma.

75
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,960
<3-6,Chase>你怎么知道
<3-6,Chase>How'd you know?

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,700
<3-7,House>因为如果有的话
<3-7,House>Because if there was,

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,650
<3-7,House>卡迪就不需要我来接手这个病人了
<3-7,House>Cuddy wouldn't have needed me to take the case.

78
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,000
<3-8,Thirteen>-你怎么知道卡迪  -福曼是唯一一个
<3-8,Thirteen>- How do you know Cuddy... - Foreman's the only one

79
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,260
<3-9,House>敢不跟我商量就接任务的
<3-9,House>with the balls to take a case without checking with me,

80
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,050
<3-9,House>而他现在还在吃早餐
<3-9,House>and he's still working on breakfast,

81
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,050
<3-9,House>就说明那个
<3-9,House>which means that the...

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,280
<3-9,House>18岁
<3-9,House>18...

83
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,740
<3-9,House>不对  17岁的优等生
<3-9,House>No, 17-year-old honor student--

84
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,890
<3-10,Thirteen>卡迪对聪明的女孩
<3-10,Thirteen>Cuddy has a soft spot

85
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,920
<3-10,Thirteen>特别关照  他们到了大四下学期
<3-10,Thirteen>for smart girls, and they don't start drinking

86
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,050
<3-10,Thirteen>才开始喝酒
<3-10,Thirteen>until second semester, senior year.

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
<3-11,House>所以要么你认为聪明的女人
<3-11,House>So either you think that smart women

88
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,080
<3-11,House>彼此会互相照顾  这说明你是个白痴
<3-11,House>look out for each other, which means you're an idiot,

89
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,640
<3-11,House>或者你觉得卡迪不聪明  也就是说
<3-11,House>or you think Cuddy's not smart, which means...

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,660
<3-11,House>不过  这两种想法的结论都一样
<3-11,House>Well, I guess it's the same both ways.

91
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,740
<3-12,Thirteen>那你怎么
<3-12,Thirteen>Then how did you...

92
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,960
<3-13,House>照片从病历中掉出来了  她看上去很聪明
<3-13,House>Picture fell out of the file. She looks smart.

93
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,860
<3-14,Thirteen>-陶博在哪儿  -难道你不知道吗
<3-14,Thirteen>- Where's Taub?  - You don't already know?

94
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,290
<3-15,House>对  他在家和老婆吵架
<3-15,House>Yeah, he's at home in a fight with his wife.

95
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,980
<3-15,House>我只是好奇他会如何跟我解释
<3-15,House>I'm just curious what he wanted me to know.

96
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,540
<3-16,Chase>他的车爆胎了  他在等拖车
<3-16,Chase>His car has a flat tire. He's waiting for a tow truck.

97
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,310
<3-17,Foreman>血压升高会不会是饮酒过度引起的呢
<3-17,Foreman>What about rising blood pressure from binge drinking?

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,890
<3-17,Foreman>那能引发高血压
<3-17,Foreman>It could set off a hypertensive crisis,

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
<3-17,Foreman>导致心力衰竭
<3-17,Foreman>cause heart failure.

100
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,430
<3-18,Chase>两口酒怎能算过度
<3-18,Chase>Two drinks is hardly a binge.

101
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,200
<3-19,House>若是澳大利亚人肯定没问题
<3-19,House>Certainly not if you're an aussie.

102
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,890
<3-19,House>但若是美国女学生在早上10点前喝了两口酒
<3-19,House>But when an American schoolgirl has two drinks before 10:00 a.M.,

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,170
<3-19,House>那她肯定打算喝更多
<3-19,House>it's a pretty sure bet that the plan is to have a lot more.

104
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,960
<3-19,House>也许这不是她第一次这样做了
<3-19,House>Probably wasn't the first time she had that plan.

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,170
<3-20,Chase>我会做个c-13-丙酮酸磁共振成像
<3-20,Chase>We'll get a c-13-pyruvate mri

106
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,200
<3-20,Chase>检查她的心脏乳酸水平
<3-20,Chase>to check for cardiac lactic-acid levels.

107
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,550
<3-21,House>谁给陶博打个电话
<3-21,House>Someone call Taub.

108
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,060
<3-21,House>让他在私人时间处理掉他的老婆
<3-21,House>Tell him to cut the ball and chain on his own time.

109
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,760
<4-1,Taub>你和我吵架是因为夫妻瑜伽的事情吗
<4-1,Taub>We're arguing about couples yoga?

110
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,550
<4-1,Taub>不是
<4-1,Taub>No.

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,100
<4-2,Rachel>问题在于我们从未一起做过什么事
<4-2,Rachel>We're arguing over the fact that we don't ever do anything together anymore.

112
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,900
<4-3,Taub>难道我们从来没一起做过什么吗
<4-3,Taub>We don't ever do anything together?

113
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,600
<4-4,Rachel>克里斯  我爱你  但我发誓
<4-4,Rachel>Chris, I love you, but I swear,

114
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,400
<4-4,Rachel>如果你再用这种审问证人的口气跟我说话的话
<4-4,Rachel>if you start talking to me like I'm on the witness stand again,

115
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,530
<4-4,Rachel>我会拧断你的脖子
<4-4,Rachel>I'm gonna break your neck.

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,100
<4-5,Taub>亲爱的  我们一直都是一起做事的啊
<4-5,Taub>Honey, we do stuff together all the time.

117

<4-5,Taub>是吗  比如什么
<4-5,Taub>Really? Like what?

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,800
<4-6,Rachel>除了睡觉  看电视  出去吃饭
<4-6,Rachel>Besides sleeping, watching tv, going out to dinner,

119
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,470
<4-6,Rachel>我们还一起做过什么
<4-6,Rachel>what do we do together,

120
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,650
<4-6,Rachel>就只我们两个
<4-6,Rachel>just the two of us?

121
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,680
<4-6,Rachel>我们
<4-6,Rachel>We...

122
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,790
<4-7,Taub>你不喜欢出去吃饭吗
<4-7,Taub>You don't like going out to dinner?

123
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,420
<4-7,Taub>好吧  我会去练瑜伽的
<4-7,Taub>All right, I'll do the yoga.

124
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,340
<4-8,Rachel>算了
<4-8,Rachel>Forget it.

125
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,230
<4-9,Taub>你现在又不希望去练了
<4-9,Taub>Now you don't want me to do it?

126
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,900
<4-10,Rachel>去上班吧
<4-10,Rachel>Just go to work.

127
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,530
<4-10,Rachel>不
<4-10,Rachel>No.

128
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,880
<4-11,Taub>在我们解决这个问题前  我不会离开的
<4-11,Taub>I'm not leaving until we work this out.

129
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,800
<4-12,Rachel>我没事  拜托  快走吧
<4-12,Rachel>I'm fine. Please, just go.

130
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,870
<5-1,Nick>艾比·纳什在哪里
<5-1,Nick>Where's Abby Nash?

131
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,900
<5-1,Nick>我是尼克  是她男朋友
<5-1,Nick>I'm Nick, her boyfriend.

132
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,030
<5-1,Nick>这是我爸
<5-1,Nick>This is my dad.

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,440
<5-3,Taub>你可以等候在...
<5-3,Taub>You can wait in...

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,690
<5-4,Nick>她在哪
<5-4,Nick>Where is she?

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,030
<5-6,Nick>她还好吗
<5-6,Nick>Is she okay?

136
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,510
<5-5,Taub>她正在做检查
<5-5,Taub>She's having some tests run.

137
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,420
<5-6,Nick>她没事吗
<5-6,Nick>Is she okay?

138
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,160
<5-7,Taub>我们认为饮酒可能对她的心脏造成了损害
<5-7,Taub>We think her drinking may have damaged her heart.

139
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,150
<5-7,Taub>她的心脏吗
<5-7,Taub>Her heart?

140
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,690
<5-8,Nick>不  她不喝酒
<5-8,Nick>No, she doesn't drink,

141
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,490
<5-8,Nick>没喝很多
<5-8,Nick>Not that much.

142
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,660
<5-9,Taub>只在学校里喝吗
<5-9,Taub>Just when she's at school?

143
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,950
<5-10,Artie>尼克  怎么回事
<5-10,Artie>Nick, what's he talking about?

144
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,620
<5-11,Nick>一次旅行中  有个学生手里有假张身份证[用来买酒]
<5-11,Nick>It was a field trip. One of the kids had a fake I.D.

145
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,310
<5-11,Nick>不过  爸爸  你了解艾比的  告诉他
<5-11,Nick>But, dad, you know Abby. Tell him.

146
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,130
<5-12,Artie>我知道她的为人
<5-12,Artie>Well, I know what she's like

147
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,680
<5-12,Artie>你们在我面前时  她是怎么样的  不过...
<5-12,Artie>When the two of you are around me, but...

148
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,850
<5-13,Taub>如果你是对的检查结果会呈阴性
<5-13,Taub>If you're right, The tests will come back negative.

149
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,910
<5-14,Nick>你能帮我带个口信给她吗
<5-14,Nick>Can you give her a message?

150
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,020
<5-14,Nick>我帮她把作业拿来了
<5-14,Nick>I brought her homework...

151
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,480
<5-14,Nick>还有  我爱她
<5-14,Nick>And I love her.

152
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,110
<6-1,Taub>抱歉我迟到了
<6-1,Taub>Sorry I'm late.

153
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,410
<6-1,Taub>尼克很爱你
<6-1,Taub>Nick loves you.

154
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,130
<6-2,Chase>豪斯不相信你的车爆胎了
<6-2,Chase>House doesn't believe you got a flat tire.

155
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,000
<6-3,Taub>他觉得我为什么迟到呢
<6-3,Taub>What does he think I was doing?

156
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,100
<6-4,Chase>和你妻子吵架
<6-4,Chase>Fighting with the wife.

157
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,300
<6-5,Taub>我为什么要说谎呢
<6-5,Taub>Why would I lie about that?

158
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,120
<6-5,Taub>她想让我和她一起练瑜伽
<6-5,Taub>She wants me to do yoga.

159
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,300
<6-6,Chase>我们要做更薄的层面剖析
<6-6,Chase>We need thinner cuts.

160
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,010
<6-7,Taub>当你和卡梅隆意见有分歧时
<6-7,Taub>When you and Cameron had disagreements...

161
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,900
<6-8,Chase>你向我咨询婚姻问题似乎不妥
<6-8,Chase>I'm probably not the best guy to go to for marital advice.

162
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,560
<6-9,Taub>对不起
<6-9,Taub>Sorry.

163
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,050
<6-9,Taub>只是...
<6-9,Taub>It's just...

164
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,130
<6-10,Chase>加强显示二尖瓣
<6-10,Chase>Punch in to the mitral valve.

165
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,980
<6-11,Taub>好了  我明白你的意思了
<6-11,Taub>All right, I get the message.

166
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,780
<6-12,Chase>不  不  我是认真的
<6-12,Chase>No no, I'm serious.

167
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,980
<6-12,Chase>那是什么
<6-12,Chase>What is that?

168
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,480
<6-13,Thirteen>可能是真菌感染
<6-13,Thirteen>Could be a fungus.

169
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,160
<6-14,Foreman>急诊室做过血液培养了
<6-14,Foreman>E.R. Drew blood cultures--

170
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,220
<6-14,Foreman>都是阴性  没寄生虫  没真菌
<6-14,Foreman>All negative, no parasites, no fungus.

171
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
<6-15,Taub>可能是肠道苛求菌
<6-15,Taub>It could be fastidious enteric bacteria.

172
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,640
<6-16,House>你觉得她吃了你妻子做的东西吗
<6-16,House>You think she's been eating your wife's cooking?

173
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,540
<6-16,House>嗨  我站在你这边  兄弟
<6-16,House>Hey, I'm on your side, man.

174
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,920
<6-17,Taub>我没在和我妻子吵架
<6-17,Taub>I am not fighting with my wife.

175
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,630
<6-17,Taub>我的车爆胎了  还放在我后备箱内
<6-17,Taub>I had a flat tire. It's in my trunk.

176
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,040
<6-17,Taub>你可以自己去看
<6-17,Taub>You can go look at it if you want.

177
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,070
<6-18,House>不需要
<6-18,House>Don't need to.

178
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,740
<6-18,House>表情告诉我你在说虚张声势
<6-18,House>Face tells me you're bluffing.

179
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,330
<6-18,House>不是你的  是奇斯的表情
<6-18,House>Not yours...chase's.

180
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,560
<6-19,Foreman>如果她有肠道感染她会表现出肠道症状
<6-19,Foreman>If she was infected through the intestinal tract, she'd have intestinal symptoms.

181
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,040
<6-20,Taub>肠道细菌还可能通过其它方式获得并进入血液
<6-20,Taub>There are other ways to get enteric bacteria into the bloodstream.

182
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,590
<6-21,Chase>她不静脉注射吸毒没有纹身
<6-21,Chase>She's not an intravenous drug user, she has no tattoos,

183
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,640
<6-21,Chase>并且她身上没任何伤疤能说明她会自残
<6-21,Chase>And she doesn't have any scars that would indicate she's a cutter.

184
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,400
<6-22,Thirteen>做个经食管超声心动扫描
<6-22,Thirteen>Transesophageal echo could give us a better idea

185
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,710
<6-22,Thirteen>会为我们提供更多线索
<6-22,Thirteen>Of what we're looking at.

186
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,140
<6-23,Taub>如果瓣膜快要裂开
<6-23,Taub>If that valve is about to dehisce,

187
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,790
<6-23,Taub>心动描记会引发心脏病发作
<6-23,Taub>Echo could trigger a heart attack.

188
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,460
<6-24,House>那你们想个更好的主意或是准备好急救推车
<6-24,House>So come up with a better idea Or have a crash cart ready.

189
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,090
<7-1,Thirteen>你为什么对豪斯说谎
<7-1,Thirteen>Why are you lying to House?

190
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,540
<7-1,Thirteen>奇斯告诉我了  有什么大不了的呢
<7-1,Thirteen>Chase told me. What's the big deal?

191
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,240
<7-2,Taub>我们换个时间聊这个吧
<7-2,Taub>Maybe we can talk about this another time...

192
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,480
<7-2,Taub>或永远不谈
<7-2,Taub>Or never.

193
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,380
<7-3,Thirteen>我想她不会告诉别人的
<7-3,Thirteen>I really don't think she's gonna tell anyone.

194
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,870
<7-4,Taub>如果我承认我们在吵架他就会想知道为什么
<7-4,Taub>If I admit we're fighting, He's gonna want to know what about.

195
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,280
<7-5,Thirteen>那就告诉他真相呀
<7-5,Thirteen>So tell him,

196
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,760
<7-5,Thirteen>或者告诉他不要多管闲事
<7-5,Thirteen>Or tell him it's none of his business.

197
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,720
<7-6,Taub>说谎更容易
<7-6,Taub>This is easier.

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,440
<7-7,Thirteen>真的吗  看起来比说实话难多了
<7-7,Thirteen>Really? Because it seems much harder.

199
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,520
<7-7,Thirteen>我知道什么  我又不是男的
<7-7,Thirteen>What do I know? I'm not a guy.

200
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,100
<7-7,Thirteen>对...
<7-7,Thirteen>Yes...

201
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,220
<7-8,Taub>除非我能像你一样坦露自己感情
<7-8,Taub>If only I could be as open about my emotional life as you are.

202
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,370
<7-9,Thirteen>这件事与瑜伽无关
<7-9,Thirteen>It's not about the yoga.

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,350
<7-10,Taub>真的吗  我还以为有关呢
<7-10,Taub>Really? I thought it was,

204
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,100
<7-10,Taub>因为我们讨论了一个小时瑜伽
<7-10,Taub>Since we spent an hour talking about yoga,

205
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,660
<7-10,Taub>不过我怎么知道呢  我不是女的
<7-10,Taub>But what do I know? I'm not a girl.

206
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,070
<7-11,Thirteen>我猜她认为你不愿花时间和她待在一起
<7-11,Thirteen>My guess is she thinks you don't want to spend time with her

207
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,200
<7-11,Thirteen>而是花时间陪在别人身边
<7-11,Thirteen>Because you're spending it with someone else.

208
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,920
<7-12,Taub>如果她觉得我有外遇  她会问的
<7-12,Taub>If she thinks I'm cheating, she would ask.

209
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,270
<7-13,Thirteen>因为你总是说实话吗
<7-13,Thirteen>Because you'd tell the truth?

210
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,490
<7-14,Taub>我确实没有外遇
<7-14,Taub>I'm not seeing anyone else.

211
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,060
<7-15,Thirteen>那不管  你有前科
<7-15,Thirteen>Doesn't matter. You have a history.

212
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,650
<7-15,Thirteen>那不是她的错
<7-15,Thirteen>And that's not her fault.

213
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,680
<7-16,Taub>那我该做什么呢
<7-16,Taub>So what am I supposed to do?

214
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,290
<7-16,Taub>我不能证明不存在的事情
<7-16,Taub>I can't prove a negative.

215
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,340
<7-17,Thirteen>这确实是个问题
<7-17,Thirteen>That is a problem.

216
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,070
<7-18,Thirteen>心脏在这里
<7-18,Thirteen>There's the heart.

217
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,410
<7-19,Taub>瓣膜看上去正常
<7-19,Taub>Valves look fine--

218
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,670
<7-19,Taub>没有赘生物  没有粘液性变性
<7-19,Taub>No vegetations, no myxomatous changes.

219
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,450
<7-20,Thirteen>你能给她多打一点点镇静剂吗
<7-20,Thirteen>Can you give her a little more sedative?

220
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,540
<7-21,Thirteen>主动脉夹层正在破裂
<7-21,Thirteen>She's dissecting.

221
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,100
<7-22,Taub>已经撕裂了  把探头拿出来
<7-22,Taub>She's rupturing. Get the scope out.

222
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
<8-1,Thirteen>完全不合理
<8-1,Thirteen>This doesn't make sense.

223
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,750
<8-1,Thirteen>她的血压正常  心率也控制得很好
<8-1,Thirteen>Her b.P. Is normal, and her heart rate was controlled.

224
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,020
<8-2,Taub>过会再找原因
<8-2,Taub>We'll figure it out later.

225
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,390
<8-2,Taub>我们只剩大概30秒钟的时间打开它的胸腔
<8-2,Taub>We've only got about 30 seconds to get her open.

226
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,170
<9-1,Taub>插管处没有渗漏
<9-1,Taub>No leakage from cannulation site.

227
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,230
<9-2,Thirteen>很好
<9-2,Thirteen>Nice.

228
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,190
<9-3,Taub>看看她心脏能否重新跳动
<9-3,Taub>Let's see if she'll start up.

229
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,180
<9-4,Thirteen>除颤器
<9-4,Thirteen>Cardiac paddle.

230
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,850
<9-5,Taub>充电
<9-5,Taub>Charging.

231
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,940
<9-5,Taub>放电
<9-5,Taub>And go.

232
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,740
<9-6,Taub>加油
<9-6,Taub>Come on.

233
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,720
<9-7,Thirteen>再来一次  放电
<9-7,Thirteen>Again. Go.

234
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,760
<9-8,Taub>5毫升肾上腺素
<9-8,Taub>Pushing five ccs Adrenline.

235
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,480
<9-9,Taub>再来一次
<9-9,Taub>Zap her again.

236
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,010
<9-10,Thirteen>不要
<9-10,Thirteen>No.

237
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,510
<9-11,Taub>这没用的  闪开
<9-11,Taub>It's not working. Clear.

238
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,490
<9-11,Taub>闪开
<9-11,Taub>Clear.

239
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,540
<9-12,Thirteen>正常窦性心律
<9-12,Thirteen>Normal sinus rhythm.

240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,830
<9-13,Taub>感谢上帝
<9-13,Taub>Thank god.

241
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,680
<10-1,Taub>经食管超声心动扫描和手术中所见没有发现瓣膜上有赘生物
<10-1,Taub>T.E.E. And intra-operative visualization showed no vegetations on the valves,

242
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,240
<10-1,Taub>没有结构异常
<10-1,Taub>No structural abnormalities.

243
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,310
<10-2,Foreman>主动脉夹层说明我们之前
<10-2,Foreman>The dissection means we were wrong

244
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,400
<10-2,Foreman>关于酒精引起高血压危象的猜测错误
<10-2,Foreman>About alcohol causing a hypertensive crisis.

245
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,690
<10-3,House>你说"我们"  其实是"你"
<10-3,House>And by "We" You mean "You."

246
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,220
<10-4,Foreman>是啊  但你也没有更好的主意啊
<10-4,Foreman>Yeah. You were the one who didn't have any better ideas.

247
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,370
<10-5,House>又不是我的过错
<10-5,House>It's not my fault.

248
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,060
<10-5,House>我当时还忙着评价陶呢
<10-5,House>I was busy trying to judge Taub.

249
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,430
<10-6,Taub>既然我们排除了外伤的可能性
<10-6,Taub>Since we already ruled out trauma,

250
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,280
<10-6,Taub>主动脉夹层可能是遗传缺陷
<10-6,Taub>The dissection's probably a genetic defect.

251
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,100
<10-7,Foreman>我们在做测试
<10-7,Foreman>We're running the tests.

252
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,400
<10-7,Foreman>她不是马凡氏综合征患者
<10-7,Foreman>She's not marfanoid.

253
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,600
<10-8,Thirteen>那过敏呢
<10-8,Thirteen>What about an allergy?

254
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,190
<10-8,Thirteen>严重的过敏症状可以触发系统性的免疫反应
<10-8,Thirteen>A severe enough one could set off a systemic immune reaction,

255
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,380
<10-8,Thirteen>进而导致肺部积液
<10-8,Thirteen>Cause fluid in the lungs,

256
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,450
<10-8,Thirteen>还有炎症会削弱主动脉
<10-8,Thirteen>And inflammation that could weaken the aorta.

257
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,300
<10-9,Chase>如果是过敏的话
<10-9,Chase>If it was an allergy,

258
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,500
<10-9,Chase>她在医院里就会有所好转
<10-9,Chase>She'd be getting better in the hospital,

259
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,250
<10-10,Thirteen>-而不是更严重了  -除非是过敏源在她体内
<10-10,Thirteen>- Not worse. - Unless it was inside her.

260
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,010
<10-11,House>意味着
<10-11,House>Meaning?

261
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,880
<11-1,Nick>你们要我的精子
<11-1,Nick>You want my sperm?

262
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,890
<11-2,Thirteen>我们认为严重的过敏反应能导致系统性的崩溃
<11-2,Thirteen>We think a severe allergic reaction could be causing systemic breakdown.

263
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,250
<11-3,Artie>对我儿子的精子过敏吗
<11-3,Artie>To my son's sperm?

264
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,980
<11-4,Taub>事实上更可能是他的精液的问题
<11-4,Taub>Actually, his semen is more likely the problem,

265
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,260
<11-4,Taub>所以我觉得你刚才的反应对象并不对
<11-4,Taub>Which, I realize, is not what you were reacting to.

266
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,000
<11-5,Thirteen>你们上一次进行没有防护措施的性爱是什么时候呢
<11-5,Thirteen>When's the last time the two of you had unprotected sex?

267
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,320
<11-6,Nick>从没有  我用避孕套的
<11-6,Nick>Never. I use a condom.

268
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,450
<11-7,Taub>你时刻都用避孕套吗  所有过程吗
<11-7,Taub>You always use a condom... for everything?

269
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,950
<11-8,Nick>对大多数过程
<11-8,Nick>Well, for most everything.

270
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,660
<11-9,Thirteen>什么时候
<11-9,Thirteen>When?

271
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,690
<11-10,Nick>她崩溃的前一晚
<11-10,Nick>The night before she collapsed.

272
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,370
<12-1,Chase>我会滴一滴尼克的精液蛋白到你皮肤上
<12-1,Chase>I'm placing a drop of Nick's semen protein onto the skin.

273
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
<12-1,Chase>然后我会用枕头来摩擦
<12-1,Chase>Then I'll abrade it with a needle,

274
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,910
<12-1,Chase>一个小时左右来检查皮疹
<12-1,Chase>Check for a rash in an hour or so.

275
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,650
<12-2,Abby>妈妈  得了吧
<12-2,Abby>Mom, come on...

276
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,760
<12-2,Abby>我们都约会了三年了
<12-2,Abby>We've been dating for three years.

277
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,630
<12-3,June>我没有生气  亲爱的
<12-3,June>Look, I'm not mad, sweetheart.

278
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,850
<12-3,June>我只是困惑了
<12-3,June>I'm just confused.

279
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,250
<12-4,Foreman>系统性的反应可能是由精液蛋白引发的
<12-4,Foreman>A systemic reaction Can be triggered by the protein in semen.

280
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,990
<12-4,Foreman>在多数情况下  这种反应是相当微小的
<12-4,Foreman>In most cases, the reaction is fairly minor.

281
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,760
<12-4,Foreman>但在少数情况下反复暴露在过敏源下会引发过敏反应
<12-4,Foreman>But in rare cases, Repeat exposure can trigger a hypersensitivity response.

282
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,800
<12-5,June>反复暴露吗
<12-5,June>Repeat exposure?

283
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,170
<12-5,June>我懂  我懂
<12-5,June>Ugh, I know, I know--

284
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,110
<12-5,June>三年时光
<12-5,June>Three years.

285
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,590
<12-6,Abby>这会疼的吗
<12-6,Abby>Is it supposed to hurt?

286
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
<12-7,Foreman>反应时间应该长于
<12-7,Foreman>The reaction should take longer than...

287
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,770
<12-8,Abby>不是那里
<12-8,Abby>No, it's not that. Ow.

288
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,850
<12-9,Foreman>-艾比  怎么了  -我的胃
<12-9,Foreman>- Abby, what's wrong? - My stomach.

289
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,880
<12-11,Chase>血尿
<12-11,Chase>Blood in the urine.

290
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,230
<12-12,Abby>救命
<12-12,Abby>Help me!

291
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,780
<13-1,Foreman>没有过敏反应
<13-1,Foreman>No allergic reaction.

292
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,070
<13-1,Foreman>另一方面  她的肾脏现在正在衰竭
<13-1,Foreman>On the other hand, now her kidneys are failing.

293
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,990
<13-2,Taub>会是某种神经性病变吗
<13-2,Taub>Could be some kind of neuropathy.

294
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,750
<13-2,Taub>梅毒性的闪电痛吗
<13-2,Taub>Syphilitic lightning pains?

295
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,930
<13-3,House>不是梅毒
<13-3,House>It's not syphilis.

296
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,010
<13-3,House>性病研究实验室和酶免疫测定都是阴性
<13-3,House>Vdrl and enzyme immunoassays were negative.

297
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,350
<13-4,Thirteen>那血栓呢
<13-4,Thirteen>What about a blood clot?

298
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,960
<13-5,House>她做完动脉手术要用抗凝剂的时候你考虑血栓吗
<13-5,House>While she's on anticoagulants from the aortic surgery?

299
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,440
<13-6,Taub>间质性肾炎呢
<13-6,Taub>Interstitial nephritis?

300
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,390
<13-7,House>不会引起水肿和主动脉夹层
<13-7,House>Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.

301
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,590
<13-8,Chase>但是癌症能解释通
<13-8,Chase>But cancer could.

302
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,070
<13-9,House>你敢说得再具体一些吗
<13-9,House>Would you care to be a little more specific?

303
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,050
<13-10,Chase>如果我知道的话  我早就说了
<13-10,Chase>If I could, I would have.

304
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,940
<13-11,Foreman>我们可以给她做个全身扫描
<13-11,Foreman>We could do a full-body scan.

305
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,840
<13-12,House>我们讨厌全身扫描
<13-12,House>We hate full-body scans.

306
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,730
<13-12,House>你说"我们"  其实是"你"
<13-12,House>And by "We" You mean "You."

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
<13-13,Foreman>我们同样讨厌病人病故
<13-13,Foreman>We also hate when a patient dies

308
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,800
<13-13,Foreman>在我们能搞清楚他们到底出了什么问题前
<13-13,Foreman>Before we figure out what's wrong with them.

309
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,000
<13-14,House>去做全身扫描吧
<13-14,House>Do the scan.

310
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,930
<14-1,Taub>你怎么去说服别人你没有欺骗他们呢
<14-1,Taub>How can you convince someone you're not cheating on them?

311
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,990
<14-2,Foreman>真的别欺骗就行
<14-2,Foreman>Don't cheat.

312
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,970
<14-2,Foreman>过段时间后  他们会知道真相的
<14-2,Foreman>After a while, they'll catch on.

313
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,490
<14-3,Taub>假若我不想等那么久呢
<14-3,Taub>What if I don't want to wait that long?

314
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,010
<14-4,Foreman>无论你去哪  带他们全天24小时和你一起
<14-4,Foreman>Take them with you wherever you go for 24 hours a day.

315
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,240
<14-4,Foreman>是的  你老婆有不安全感
<14-4,Foreman>So your wife's a little insecure.

316
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,250
<14-4,Foreman>又那么糟糕吗
<14-4,Foreman>Is that so bad?

317
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,280
<14-4,Foreman>至少你知道她还关心这些
<14-4,Foreman>At least you know she still cares.

318
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,760
<14-5,Taub>我知道她很关心
<14-5,Taub>I know she cares.

319
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,000
<14-5,Taub>我需要的是让她开心起来
<14-5,Taub>What I want is for her to be happy.

320
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,060
<14-5,Taub>怎么了
<14-5,Taub>What?

321
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,310
<14-5,Taub>你觉得我不想让我老婆开心吗
<14-5,Taub>You don't think I want my wife to be happy?

322
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,680
<14-6,Foreman>当然觉得
<14-6,Foreman>Sure...

323
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,450
<14-6,Foreman>只要那能让你开心
<14-6,Foreman>As long as it makes you happy.

324
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,250
<15-1,Wilson>你觉得怎么样
<15-1,Wilson>What do you think?

325
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,680
<15-2,House>我觉得你动作迅速
<15-2,House>I think you work quickly.

326
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,850
<15-3,Wilson>小事一桩
<15-3,Wilson>Piece of cake--

327
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,490
<15-3,Wilson>你付钱  他们给家具
<15-3,Wilson>You give them money, they give you furniture.

328
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,840
<15-3,Wilson>还不错吧
<15-3,Wilson>Not bad, huh?

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,610
<15-4,House>不是
<15-4,House>Nope.

330
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,230
<15-4,House>是一点坏的感觉都没有
<15-4,House>It's not bad at all.

331
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,310
<15-5,Abby>花的时间有些长啊
<15-5,Abby>It's taking a really long time.

332
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,790
<15-6,Foreman>再忍受一会除非有必要  你最好忍住别说话
<15-6,Foreman>Just hang in there and try not to talk unless you really have to.

333
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,150
<15-6,Foreman>那会影响到成像的
<15-6,Foreman>It can affect the images.

334
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,020
<15-7,Abby>那是什么
<15-7,Abby>What was that?

335
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,240
<15-7,Abby>喂  你还在吗
<15-7,Abby>Hello? Are you still there?

336
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,550
<15-8,Abby>我觉得这仪器有些问题
<15-8,Abby>I think there's something wrong with the machine.

337
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,610
<15-9,Foreman>不是仪器的问题
<15-9,Foreman>It's not the machine.

338
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,790
<15-9,Foreman>是地震而已
<15-9,Foreman>It's an earthquake.

339
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,050
<15-9,Foreman>抓住  我们来把你弄出来
<15-9,Foreman>Hold on. We'll get you out.

340
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,040
<15-10,Abby>现在就把我弄出去
<15-10,Abby>Get me out now.

341
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,990
<15-12,Abby>哦  天哪
<15-12,Abby>Oh, my god!

342
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,820
<15-13,Abby>我抓不住了
<15-13,Abby>I can't hold on!

343
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,490
<15-15,Abby>是黑洞
<15-15,Abby>It's a black hole.

344
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,970
<15-16,Foreman>她产生了幻觉
<15-16,Foreman>She's hallucinating.

345
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,580
<15-17,Taub>我确实希望如此
<15-17,Taub>I certainly hope so.

346
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
<15-17,Taub>(你在哪?)
<15-17,Taub>

351
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,460
<17-2,Rachel>豪斯
<17-2,Rachel>House!

352
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,680
<17-3,Rachel>这不好玩
<17-3,Rachel>It's not funny.

353
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,380
<17-4,Taub>我的问题已经够多了
<17-4,Taub>I got enough problems already.

354
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
<17-5,House>相信我吧  这会有帮助的
<17-5,House>Trust me. This is gonna help.

355
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,880
<17-6,Foreman>动脉瘤能解释幻觉
<17-6,Foreman>An aneurysm explains the hallucinations.

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,290
<17-6,Foreman>而且这点是我们在鉴别诊断时没有排除的
<17-6,Foreman>And it's the one thing We haven't excluded from the differential.

357
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,470
<17-7,House>你的短信不能证明你的忠诚
<17-7,House>Your texting does not prove you're faithful.

358
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,970
<17-7,House>只能说明你知道  她觉得你不忠
<17-7,House>Just proves you know she thinks you're unfaithful.

359
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,950
<17-7,House>信任不能被强加
<17-7,House>Can't force trust.

360
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,150
<17-7,House>她幻觉了什么
<17-7,House>What did she hallucinate?

361
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,270
<17-8,Thirteen>幻觉的内容不相干的
<17-8,Thirteen>The content of the hallucination isn't relevant.

362
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,120
<17-9,House>-通常不是  -从不想干
<17-9,House>- Not usually. - Not ever.

363
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
<17-10,Foreman>我们什么都不知道  大脑却什么都知道
<17-10,Foreman>We know nothing. Brain knows all.

364
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,620
<17-11,House>得了溃疡  你不会知道
<17-11,House>You get an ulcer, you don't know it,

365
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,880
<17-11,House>但是大脑增加黏液素分泌
<17-11,House>But the brain increases mucin secretions.

366
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,090
<17-11,House>它知道出了什么问题
<17-11,House>It knows what the problem is,

367
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,380
<17-11,House>哪里有问题
<17-11,House>Knows where the problem is.

368
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,310
<17-12,Foreman>从机体免疫反应到大脑给予下意识诊断线索
<17-12,Foreman>It's a big logical jump from a body's immune response

369
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,710
<17-12,Foreman>这在逻辑上可是个大跳跃
<17-12,Foreman>to the brain giving subconscious diagnostic clues.

370
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,350
<17-13,Chase>梦到瀑布  水流什么意思
<17-13,Chase>What about dreaming about waterfalls, running streams

371
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,250
<17-13,Chase>得去洗手间吗
<17-13,Chase>if you need to go to the bathroom?

372
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,090
<17-14,Foreman>没错  就像是大脑呼喊
<17-14,Foreman>Sure. That's the same as the brain shouting,

373
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,250
<17-14,Foreman>"你有胰腺癌"
<17-14,Foreman>"You have pancreatic cancer."

374
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,530
<17-15,House>她的潜意识试图告诉她什么
<17-15,House>Her subconscious is trying to tell her something.

375
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,710
<17-15,House>我们得偷听
<17-15,House>We need to eavesdrop.

376
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,500
<17-16,Taub>她尖叫说她被吸进黑洞
<17-16,Taub>She was screaming she was being sucked into a black hole,

377
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,700
<17-16,Taub>那么我们是不是该在她的肛门里找肿瘤呢
<17-16,Taub>So we should look for a tumor in her anus?

378
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,280
<17-17,House>我们需要完整的故事
<17-17,House>We need the whole story.

379
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,370
<17-17,House>认知模式识别
<17-17,House>The cognitive pattern recognition program

380
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,350
<17-17,House>或许能告诉我们她的脑袋里发生了什么
<17-17,House>might tell us what's going on in her head.

381
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,700
<17-18,Foreman>或许  我们可以基于科学做点什么而不是根据科幻小说
<17-18,Foreman>Or we could act on something based in science, not science fiction.

382
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,500
<17-18,Foreman>做个对比磁共振血管造影看看她有没有动脉瘤
<17-18,Foreman>Get an MRA with contrast to see if she has an aneurysm,

383
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,290
<17-18,Foreman>除非你觉得卡迪会支持读心术
<17-18,Foreman>Unless you think Cuddy's gonna go for the mind reading.

384
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,260
<17-19,House>算了  磁共振血管造影
<17-19,House>Fine. Do the MRA.

385
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,300
<17-19,House>等结果出来是阴性的时候  我们能转向
<17-19,House>When it comes back negative, we can move on to the...

386
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,770
<17-19,House>疯狂  不过也许能有用的主意
<17-19,House>Crazy but possible ideas.

387
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,300
<18-1,Wilson>你怎么处理了那些家具
<18-1,Wilson>What did you do with the furniture?

388
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,460
<18-2,House>退了
<18-2,House>I returned it.

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,130
<18-3,Wilson>你让我买下的
<18-3,Wilson>You told me to buy it.

390
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,070
<18-4,House>不过你没有  你仅仅是租的
<18-4,House>But you didn't buy it. You rented it.

391
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,230
<18-4,House>你给经济家具供应打了电话
<18-4,House>You made one phone call to economy furniture supply--

392
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,800
<18-4,House>"我们搞定  不用你忙"
<18-4,House>"We get it done so you don't have to."

393
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,620
<18-5,Wilson>那又怎样  我们有了桌子  椅子
<18-5,Wilson>So what? We had a table, chairs--

394
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,570
<18-6,House>但是看不出任何意义
<18-6,House>But no clue what any of it meant.

395
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,120
<18-7,Wilson>好了  我雇个装璜师
<18-7,Wilson>Fine. I'll hire a decorator.

396
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,000
<18-8,House>棒极了  另一个女人来告诉你你是谁
<18-8,House>Perfect. Another woman to tell you who you are.

397
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,600
<18-9,Wilson>我雇个男的装璜师
<18-9,Wilson>I'll hire a male decorator.

398
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,740
<18-10,House>你要走进一家家具店
<18-10,House>Step inside one furniture store

399
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,070
<18-10,House>找件你喜欢的东西
<18-10,House>And find one thing you like.

400
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,130
<18-11,Wilson>我喜欢不这么做
<18-11,Wilson>I like not doing this.

401
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,030
<18-12,House>一件
<18-12,House>One.

402
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,140
<19-1,Nick>艾比
<19-1,Nick>Abby.

403
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,510
<19-1,Nick>你好
<19-1,Nick>Hi.

404
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,760
<19-2,Abby>我妈妈在哪里
<19-2,Abby>Where's my mom?

405
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,800
<19-3,Nick>她下去买早饭了
<19-3,Nick>She went down to get some breakfast.

406
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,300
<19-3,Nick>你感觉如何
<19-3,Nick>How are you feeling?

407
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,480
<19-4,Abby>还行  除了我差不多没法呼吸还有浑身疼
<19-4,Abby>Well, besides the fact that I can barely breathe and I ache all over,

408
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,120
<19-4,Abby>不太妙
<19-4,Abby>Not good.

409
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,360
<19-5,Nick>我能做什么吗
<19-5,Nick>Anything I can do?

410
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,310
<19-6,Abby>就是别走
<19-6,Abby>Just don't go.

411
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,870
<19-7,Nick>我哪儿也不去
<19-7,Nick>I'm not going anywhere.

412
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,210
<19-8,Nick>距离我们上一次超过一天没干那个很久了
<19-8,Nick>Been a while since we've gone more than a day without doing that.

413
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,410
<19-7,Nick>我哪儿也不去
<19-7,Nick>I'm not going anywhere.

414
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,890
<19-10,Abby>你说什么
<19-10,Abby>What'd you say?

415
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,250
<19-11,Nick>我在想
<19-11,Nick>I've been thinking.

416
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,720
<19-12,Nick>距离我们上一次超过一天没干那个很久了
<19-12,Nick>Been a long time since we went more than a day without doing that.

417
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,320
<19-13,Hallucination of Young Abby>我们有个秘密
<19-13,Hallucination of Young Abby>We have a secret.

418
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,960
<19-14,Nick>现在  你不用马上回答  不过
<19-14,Nick>Now, you don't need to answer right now, but...

419
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,850
<19-14,Nick>艾比  我想娶你
<19-14,Nick>Abby, I want to marry you.

420
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,630
<19-15,Hallucination of Young Abby>告诉他那个秘密  没事的
<19-15,Hallucination of Young Abby>Tell him the secret. It's okay.

421
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,790
<19-16,Abby>不对劲
<19-16,Abby>Something's wrong.

422
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,060
<19-18,Foreman>-什么  -艾比  你觉得怎样
<19-18,Foreman>- What? - Abby, what are you feeling?

423
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,010
<19-19,Abby>我不知道
<19-19,Abby>I don't know.

424
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,350
<19-20,Hallucination of Young Abby>你的秘密在杀死你
<19-20,Hallucination of Young Abby>Your secret is killing you.

425
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,750
<19-21,Abby>我看见  或许都是因为药
<19-21,Abby>I see, um... maybe it's all the medication.

426
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,830
<19-21,Abby>我就是
<19-21,Abby>I'm just--um...

427
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,800
<19-22,Taub>艾比  你能听到我说话吗
<19-22,Taub>Abby. Can you hear me?

428
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,340
<19-23,Hallucination of Young Abby>你该死
<19-23,Hallucination of Young Abby>You deserve to die.

429
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,510
<19-24,Foreman>我们需要4毫克劳拉西泮
<19-24,Foreman>We need four milligrams lorazepam.

430
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,350
<20-1,Taub>她癫痫发作超过一分钟
<20-1,Taub>She seized for over a minute.

431
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,660
<20-2,Foreman>发作期脑电图显示没有同步放电
<20-2,Foreman>Inner-ictal E.E.G. showed no synchronous discharges.

432
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,340
<20-3,House>磁共振血管造影呢
<20-3,House>And the MRA?

433
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,630
<20-4,Foreman>没有动脉瘤  脑部动脉或静脉无异常
<20-4,Foreman>No aneurysms or arterial or venous malformations in the brain.

434
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,630
<20-5,House>意料之中
<20-5,House>As predicted.

435
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,270
<20-5,House>我们说要继续做什么来着
<20-5,House>What did we say we'd move on to?

436
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,630
<20-6,Thirteen>灵魂出窍能被
<20-6,Thirteen>Out-of-body experiences can be induced

437
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,860
<20-6,Thirteen>颞顶联合区感觉超负荷所诱导
<20-6,Thirteen>by sensory overload in the temporoparietal junction.

438
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,280
<20-7,Foreman>核磁共振上颞顶联合区无异常
<20-7,Foreman>Temporoparietal junction was clean on MRI,

439
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,080
<20-7,Foreman>还有磁共振血管造影  全身扫描
<20-7,Foreman>MRA, and whole-body scan.

440
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,070
<20-8,House>就只留给我们一个疑问
<20-8,House>Which just leaves us with the question

441
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,900
<20-8,House>灵魂出窍时到底发生了什么
<20-8,House>Of what happened during the out-of-body experience.

442
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,870
<20-9,Taub>要是我说她的血压飙至200多她还咬了自己的舌头
<20-9,Taub>If I say her blood pressure shot up over 200 and she bit her tongue,

443
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,860
<20-9,Taub>是个满意的答复吗
<20-9,Taub>Would that be a satisfactory answer?

444
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,740
<20-10,House>当然  要是你接着回答
<20-10,House>Sure. If you then went on to answer the following--

445
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,430
<20-10,House>她的灵魂有没有漂浮于身体之上呢 见到上帝了吗
<20-10,House>Did she float above her body? Did she see Jesus?

446
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,050
<20-10,House>她是否在恒河沐浴呢
<20-10,House>Did she bathe in the ganges?

447
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,560
<20-11,Foreman>没有  没有还是没有
<20-11,Foreman>No, no, and no.

448
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,490
<20-11,Foreman>我们能不能回到医学上来
<20-11,Foreman>Can we get back to the medical science?

449
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,130
<20-12,House>不行
<20-12,House>No.

450
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,420
<20-13,Taub>她声称以年轻时的自己脱离肉体
<20-13,Taub>She claims she emerged from her body as a younger version of herself

451
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,900
<20-13,Taub>然后开始说话
<20-13,Taub>and started talking.

452
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,660
<20-13,Taub>她记不得说了什么
<20-13,Taub>She couldn't remember what was discussed.

453
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,630
<20-14,Foreman>但我确定没有差别
<20-14,Foreman>But I'm sure it wasn't a differential.

454
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,810
<20-14,Foreman>豪斯  认知模式识别
<20-14,Foreman>House, cognitive pattern recognition

455
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,420
<20-14,Foreman>是50年前有用的诊断工具
<20-14,Foreman>Is 50 years from being a useful diagnostic tool.

456
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,650
<20-15,Chase>就算我们能搞到仪器
<20-15,Chase>Even if we can get the equipment,

457
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,390
<20-15,Chase>做初步映射得要几个小时
<20-15,Chase>It takes hours for the initial mapping.

458
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,370
<20-15,Chase>要是她再次癫痫发作  可能就玩完了
<20-15,Chase>If she has another seizure, she could stroke out.

459
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,560
<20-16,House>与此同时要是我们什么也不做  她也可能玩完
<20-16,House>Coincidentally, She could also have a stroke if we do nothing.

460
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,960
<20-17,Foreman>我不会和一个吓坏了的母亲说
<20-17,Foreman>I'm not telling a mother who's scared out of her mind

461
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,700
<20-17,Foreman>魔幻戏法是我们最好的选择
<20-17,Foreman>That our best shot is a magic trick.

462
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,680
<20-18,House>不是魔幻的  是试验性的
<20-18,House>It's not magical. It's experimental.

463
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,800
<20-18,House>就像当年的便后洗手一样
<20-18,House>Just like washing your hands after pooping once was.

464
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,040
<20-18,House>理论角度而言  不是我们最好的选择
<20-18,House>And technically, it's not our best shot.

465
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,630
<20-18,House>我相当肯定是我们唯一的选择
<20-18,House>I'm pretty sure it's our only shot.

466
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,420
<20-18,House>好极了
<20-18,House>Perfect.

467
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,710
<20-19,House>那么  福曼  去拿她的知情同意书
<20-19,House>So, Foreman, go get her consent.

468
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,460
<20-19,House>其他人下楼到认知科学实验室
<20-19,House>The rest of you go down to the cog sci lab.

469
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,520
<20-19,House>仪器应该已经在那里了
<20-19,House>Equipment should already be there.

470
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,090
<20-20,Taub>我随后就到
<20-20,Taub>I'll catch up.

471
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,090
<20-21,Rachel>多谢邀请
<20-21,Rachel>Thanks for the invite.

472
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,930
<20-21,Rachel>我不太确定我喜欢医院食物
<20-21,Rachel>I'm not sure I'm up for the hospital food.

473
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,150
<20-22,Taub>不错  因为我没计划共进午餐
<20-22,Taub>Good, 'cause I wasn't planning on lunch.

474
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,980
<21-1,Foreman>当你看录像剪辑的时候
<21-1,Foreman>While you watch video clips,

475
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,150
<21-1,Foreman>电脑会记录你的大脑如何处理图像
<21-1,Foreman>A computer maps how your brain processes the images.

476
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,600
<21-2,June>要多久呢
<21-2,June>How long will it take?

477
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,480
<21-3,Foreman>6小时  不过这还只是准备工作
<21-3,Foreman>Six hours. But that's really just the prep.

478
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,770
<21-3,Foreman>一旦电脑了解她如何处理信息
<21-3,Foreman>Once the computer maps how she processes the information,

479
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,550
<21-3,Foreman>我们会将她半麻
<21-3,Foreman>We'll put her under twilight sedation,

480
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,580
<21-3,Foreman>用同样的仪器监测她的潜意识思维活动
<21-3,Foreman>Use the same equipment to monitor her unconscious thoughts.

481
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,730
<21-4,Foreman>顺利的话  能提供一个基本影像 关于她脑袋里所发生的事情
<21-4,Foreman>Hopefully, it'll spit out a very basic video of whatever's going on in her head.

482
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,160
<21-5,Abby>然后那个能告诉你们什么呢
<21-5,Abby>And what will that tell you?

483
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,830
<21-6,Foreman>希望  能给我们 你大脑中问题所在线索
<21-6,Foreman>Hopefully, it'll give us a clue as to where your brain thinks the problem is.

484
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,060
<21-7,Artie>好多希望啊
<21-7,Artie>A lot of "Hopefullys".

485
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,680
<21-8,Nick>有副作用吗
<21-8,Nick>Could it hurt her?

486
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,540
<21-9,Foreman>我们现在也没有其它诊断结果
<21-9,Foreman>We're at a diagnostic dead end.

487
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,550
<21-9,Foreman>必须试一下
<21-9,Foreman>We've got to try something.

488
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,760
<22-1,Rachel>这比吃午餐好很多
<22-1,Rachel>This is much better than lunch.

489
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,770
<22-2,Taub>是啊
<22-2,Taub>I agree.

490
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,430
<22-3,Rachel>你怎么想到这个的
<22-3,Rachel>What made you think of this?

491
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,940
<22-4,Taub>我想你
<22-4,Taub>I missed you.

492
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,060
<22-5,Rachel>不  我是说
<22-5,Rachel>No, I...I mean this...

493
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,430
<22-5,Rachel>在车里  在停车场
<22-5,Rachel>Car, in the parking lot.

494
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,650
<22-5,Rachel>我只是不想觉得你不是第一次这么做
<22-5,Rachel>I just don't like feeling like maybe this isn't the first time you've done this.

495
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,020
<22-6,Taub>确实是第一次
<22-6,Taub>It's the first.

496
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,640
<22-6,Taub>我爱你  你是知道的对吗
<22-6,Taub>I love you. You know that, right?

497
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,420
<22-7,Rachel>我知道
<22-7,Rachel>Yes.

498
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,490
<22-8,Taub>你要信任我
<22-8,Taub>I want you to be able to trust me.

499
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,310
<22-9,Rachel>我也希望  但是
<22-9,Rachel>And I want to, but...

500
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,220
<22-10,House>天黑之后就没有灵感了
<22-10,House>Inspiration point doesn't open till after dark.

501
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,330
<22-10,House>真正的魔幻戏法就要开始了
<22-10,House>Got a real cool magic show about to start.

502
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,720
<22-10,House>另外  我要经常查你的岗
<22-10,House>Also, I'm gonna need to check your spare.

503
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,620
<23-1,Chase>艾比  你可以想一些细节的东西吗
<23-1,Chase>Abby, can you think of something specific?

504
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,530
<23-2,Abby>比如什么
<23-2,Abby>Like what?

505
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,470
<23-3,Chase>不要紧  一些简单的影像
<23-3,Chase>Doesn't matter. Just make it a single image.

506
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,690
<23-4,Thirteen>你在想什么
<23-4,Thirteen>What are you thinking?

507
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,410
<23-5,Abby>尼克在打棒球
<23-5,Abby>About Nick playing baseball.

508
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,600
<23-6,Taub>天啊
<23-6,Taub>Holy crap.

509
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
<23-7,Chase>太神了
<23-7,Chase>That's amazing.

510
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,310
<23-8,Foreman>是的  现在我们需要做的就是研究她的潜在意识
<23-8,Foreman>Yeah. Now all we have to do is read her subconscious

511
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,210
<23-8,Foreman>希望它完全合理
<23-8,Foreman>And hope that it's completely rational

512
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,340
<23-8,Foreman>然后去医学院
<23-8,Foreman>And went to med school.

513
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,070
<23-9,Chase>你觉得很兴奋吗
<23-9,Chase>Does anything get you excited?

514
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,040
<24-1,Saleswoman>请问有什么能帮你的
<24-1,Saleswoman>Can I help you with something?

515
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:53,930
<24-2,Wilson>我希望你可以介绍一下 这张餐桌
<24-2,Wilson>Yes. I was wondering if you could tell meA little bit about this dining table.

516
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,950
<24-3,Saleswoman>它原材料是木头  你可以在上面吃饭
<24-3,Saleswoman>It's made of wood, and you eat off it.

517
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,320
<24-4,Wilson>你是按厂商佣金推销的吗
<24-4,Wilson>So you're paid by commission?

518
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,190
<24-5,Saleswoman>这只是家具
<24-5,Saleswoman>It's furniture.

519
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,890
<24-5,Saleswoman>如果看到喜欢的告诉我
<24-5,Saleswoman>Find something you like. Let me know.

520
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,910
<24-5,Saleswoman>我来开单
<24-5,Saleswoman>I'll ring it up.

521
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,300
<24-6,Wilson>非常感谢
<24-6,Wilson>Thank you so much.

522
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,760
<24-7,Wilson>这个不是我要的
<24-7,Wilson>Okay, that's...that's not the one.

523
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,060
<25-1,Gabiella>这件非常不错我可以给你介绍一下
<25-1,Gabiella>That is a remarkable collection, If I can show it to you.

524
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,330
<25-1,Gabiella>我是加布里埃尔
<25-1,Gabiella>I'm Gabriella.

525
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,830
<25-2,Wilson>我想找一张满意的餐桌
<25-2,Wilson>I'm really just looking for a nice dining-room table.

526
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,400
<25-3,Gabriella>我知道  你很另类
<25-3,Gabriella>I see. You're daring.

527
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,680
<25-4,Wilson>是的  有时候但是
<25-4,Wilson>Yes, I do that sometimes, But...

528
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,730
<25-4,Wilson>现在你为什么觉得我另类
<25-4,Wilson>Right now why am I daring?

529
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,870
<25-5,Gabriella>你不拘泥于规则
<25-5,Gabriella>You're not constrained by rules.

530
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,270
<25-5,Gabriella>还有其它吸引你的阳台家具吗
<25-5,Gabriella>What else attracts you in the patio section?

531
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,460
<25-6,Wilson>等等  这是户外用的阳台家具吗
<25-6,Wilson>Wait, this is a patio tab... for outside?

532
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,290
<25-7,Foreman>我们花了一个多小时
<25-7,Foreman>Well, it's taken us just over an hour

533
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,050
<25-7,Foreman>就为了看她的无聊意识吗
<25-7,Foreman>To prove that she has a very boring subconscious.

534
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,610
<25-8,House>有人说过你很扫兴吗
<25-8,House>Anyone ever tell you you can be a real buzzkill?

535
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,680
<25-9,All but Foreman>有
<25-9,All but Foreman>Yes.

536
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,110
<25-10,Taub>星星
<25-10,Taub>Stars?

537
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,170
<25-10,Taub>可能是条纹
<25-10,Taub>Maybe that's a stripe?

538
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,330
<25-11,House>是天空
<25-11,House>It's the sky.

539
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,740
<25-11,House>她在想月亮
<25-11,House>She's thinking about the moon

540
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,210
<25-11,House>星星和天空
<25-11,House>And the stars and the sky.

541
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,700
<25-12,Foreman>她要去斯坦福学物理
<25-12,Foreman>She's going to Stanford to study physics.

542
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,060
<25-12,Foreman>所以想象天空没什么好意外的
<25-12,Foreman>It's not a big revelation that she'd think about the sky.

543
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,840
<25-13,Chase>星星可能是白血球
<25-13,Chase>Or star could be a white blood cell.

544
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,200
<25-13,Chase>白血病
<25-13,Chase>Leukemia?

545
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,620
<25-14,House>那是谁
<25-14,House>Who's that?

546
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,560
<25-15,Thirteen>他爸爸
<25-15,Thirteen>Her dad?

547
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,020
<25-15,Thirteen>他在她8岁时去世
<25-15,Thirteen>He died when she was eight.

548
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,570
<25-16,House>怎么死的
<25-16,House>What did daddy die of?

549
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,910
<25-17,Thirteen>私人飞机坠毁  毫无联系
<25-17,Thirteen>Private-plane crash... no connection.

550
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,390
<25-18,Foreman>星星  月亮  天空
<25-18,Foreman>Stars, moon, sky,

551
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,130
<25-18,Foreman>白血球  心脏瓣膜黑洞或者肛门
<25-18,Foreman>White blood cells, heart valves, Black holes, or anus

552
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,860
<25-18,Foreman>或者成百万通向身体的通道
<25-18,Foreman>Or a million other circular passageways into the body

553
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,700
<25-18,Foreman>还有她爸爸
<25-18,Foreman>And her dad.

554
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,070
<25-19,Chase>你觉得是什么意思
<25-19,Chase>What do you think it means?

555
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,420
<25-20,House>她喜欢上学 有恋父情结
<25-20,House>She likes school, And she has daddy issues...

556
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,260
<25-20,House>两者对我们都毫无帮助
<25-20,House>Neither of which helps us.

557
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,850
<26-1,Chase>我们现在做什么  重新开始吗
<26-1,Chase>So now what do we do? Start over?

558
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,800
<26-1,Chase>显然我们错过什么了
<26-1,Chase>We obviously missed something.

559
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,730
<26-2,Thirteen>肝脏呢
<26-2,Thirteen>What about the liver?

560
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,900
<26-3,Taub>左脚趾呢
<26-3,Taub>What about her left toe?

561
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,930
<26-3,Taub>对不起
<26-3,Taub>Sorry.

562
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,550
<26-3,Taub>我以为我们在猜身体哪个部分
<26-3,Taub>I thought we were randomly picking out body parts

563
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,550
<26-3,Taub>和她的症状没有关系
<26-3,Taub>That had nothing to do with her symptoms.

564
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,800
<26-4,Thirteen>肝脏是负责蛋白质
<26-4,Thirteen>Liver's responsible for proteins,

565
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,240
<26-4,Thirteen>免疫反应和造红血球的
<26-4,Thirteen>Immunological effects, production of red blood cells.

566
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,760
<26-4,Thirteen>或许可以解释肺部问题和幻觉
<26-4,Thirteen>Might be able to explain the lungs, The hallucinations.

567
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,580
<26-5,House>但没有解释不通主动脉夹层
<26-5,House>Not the aortic dissection.

568
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,670
<26-6,Chase>同样  肾脏在衰竭
<26-6,Chase>Kidneys are also failing.

569
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,200
<26-6,Chase>还有性疾病  可以解释解主动脉夹层
<26-6,Chase>We add in polycystic disease, could explain the dissection.

570
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,750
<26-7,House>一个完善的推测
<26-7,House>So that's one imperfect theory,

571
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,270
<26-7,House>加一个混乱的推测
<26-7,House>Plus a rare complication of a second theory,

572
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,160
<26-7,House>给了我们一个完整的解释
<26-7,House>Which gives us a complete explanation.

573
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,530
<26-7,House>你想到什么了福曼
<26-7,House>Don't polish the notion, Foreman.

574
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,720
<26-8,Foreman>松果腺钙化
<26-8,Foreman>Pineal gland is calcified.

575
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,390
<26-9,Taub>青春期之后
<26-9,Taub>It's supposed to be calcified.

576
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,890
<26-9,Taub>都会钙化
<26-9,Taub>Happens after puberty.

577
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,850
<26-10,Foreman>如果它里面有肿瘤呢
<26-10,Foreman>What if it's obscuring a tumor?

578
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,730
<26-10,Foreman>那里面是我们唯一看不到的地方
<26-10,Foreman>It's the only place we couldn't look inside.

579
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,120
<26-11,House>用三倍特斯拉旋转反射核磁共振成像
<26-11,House>Get a better look at her pineal gland

580
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,120
<26-11,House>再去检查一下她的松果腺
<26-11,House>With three tesla fast spin echo mri.

581
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,740
<27-1,Cuddy>你来我办公室是因为要买家具的事
<27-1,Cuddy>You're pacing my office 'cause you're buying furniture?

582
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,400
<27-2,Wilson>不  我来你办公室
<27-2,Wilson>No, I'm pacing your office

583
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,150
<27-2,Wilson>是因为我天生不会买家具
<27-2,Wilson>Because I'm physically incapable of buying furniture.

584
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,520
<27-3,Cuddy>是为Amber的老地方买吗
<27-3,Cuddy>For Amber's old place?

585
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,170
<27-4,Wilson>是的
<27-4,Wilson>Yeah.

586
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,410
<27-4,Wilson>需要买些新的
<27-4,Wilson>It needs some new...

587
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,170
<27-5,Cuddy>我知道你买了我想要的地方
<27-5,Cuddy>I know you bought the place I wanted.

588
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,580
<27-5,Cuddy>你是个混蛋  继续
<27-5,Cuddy>You're a jerk. Let's move on.

589
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,640
<27-5,Cuddy>请一个室内设计师
<27-5,Cuddy>Hire a decorator.

590
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,850
<27-6,Wilson>我想自己来
<27-6,Wilson>I'm supposed to find me.

591
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,230
<27-7,Cuddy>你不如背包穿越欧洲
<27-7,Cuddy>Backpack through Europe.

592
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,780
<27-7,Cuddy>我知道你很难相信
<27-7,Cuddy>I know it's hard to believe,

593
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,560
<27-7,Cuddy>但你应该了解你自己多过了解家具吧
<27-7,Cuddy>But you know what says even more About who you are than your furniture?

594
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,640
<27-7,Cuddy>事实上你让豪斯教你怎么买家具
<27-7,Cuddy>The fact that you are letting House tell you how to buy furniture.

595
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,090
<27-7,Cuddy>打电话给Beatrice
<27-7,Cuddy>Call Beatrice.

596
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,230
<28-1,Foreman>核磁共振没有透析出 松果腺异常
<28-1,Foreman>Mri revealed no remarkable features on her pineal gland.

597
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,350
<28-1,Foreman>只是乳酸脱氢酶异酵素水平稍微偏高
<28-1,Foreman>But there were slightly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.

598
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,190
<28-2,House>如果有过敏反应我们应该怎么办
<28-2,House>Which we would expect to see if there was an allergic reaction happening.

599
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,060
<28-3,Foreman>不可能过敏
<28-3,Foreman>There's definitely no allergy.

600
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,850
<28-4,Foreman>寄生虫呢
<28-4,Foreman>Parasite?

601
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,610
<28-4,Foreman>这种中东的寄生虫
<28-4,Foreman>There's this middle eastern parasite...

602
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,840
<28-5,House>你就这么想被反驳得无话可说吗
<28-5,House>How exactly do you want to be shot down?

603
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,130
<28-5,House>事实摆在那儿
<28-5,House>On the basis of the fact

604
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,170
<28-5,House>她从没踏入过中东的方圆六千里之内
<28-5,House>that she's never been within 6,000 miles of the middle east,

605
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,920
<28-5,House>而我们所做的所有
<28-5,House>or on the basis of the fact that all our scans

606
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,790
<28-5,House>测验和尿检都呈阴性
<28-5,House>And urine samples came back clean?

607
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,890
<28-5,House>而她依旧在衰竭一个系统接着一个系统
<28-5,House>And yet she's still failing, system after system.

608
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,670
<28-5,House>我们要不然就在尸检台上找到答案
<28-5,House>So either we find the answer at autopsy

609
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,890
<28-6,Foreman>要不然就
<28-6,Foreman>Or...

610
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,370
<28-6,Foreman>什么
<28-6,Foreman>What?

611
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,500
<28-7,House>我不知道
<28-7,House>I got nothin'.

612
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,820
<29-1,Taub>我得出去一趟
<29-1,Taub>I was gonna head out.

613
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,140
<29-1,Taub>要是有问题  你会呼我吧
<29-1,Taub>If there's any change, I assume you'll page me?

614
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,540
<29-5,Taub>你有外遇吗
<29-5,Taub>Are you having an affair?

615
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,810
<29-2,House>你妻子不敢问你这个问题而我却敢问
<29-2,House>Does it bother you that your wife doesn't have the guts to actually ask that question,

616
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,810
<29-2,House>这让你感到烦恼吗
<29-2,House>and I do?

617
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,300
<29-3,Taub>两边都是
<29-3,Taub>On both ends, yes.

618
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,920
<29-4,House>不同之处在于  答案不会让我害怕
<29-4,House>Difference is, I'm not afraid of the answer.

619
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,550
<29-4,House>而且我会相信你
<29-4,House>And I might believe you.

620
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,450
<29-5,Taub>我没外遇
<29-5,Taub>I'm not having an affair.

621
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,510
<29-6,House>但你想搞外遇
<29-6,House>But you want to.

622
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,210
<29-7,Taub>我不想
<29-7,Taub>No, I don't.

623
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,640
<29-7,Taub>我不想再那样过日子了
<29-7,Taub>I'm through living like that.

624
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,820
<29-7,Taub>为什么
<29-7,Taub>Why?

625
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,890
<29-8,House>怎么  你还是到了那点子上吗
<29-8,House>What, you finally got to the point

626
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,040
<29-8,House>连只比你岁数的一半大七岁的女孩也不够年轻了吗
<29-8,House>where half your age plus seven just isn't young enough?

627
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,950
<29-9,Taub>晚点跟你说
<29-9,Taub>Talk to you later, house.

628
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,350
<29-10,House>还是说你实在已经老得足以做他们的
<29-10,House>Or is it because you now really are old enough to be their--

629
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,960
<29-10,House>那个爸爸
<29-10,House>The dad.

630
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,610
<29-10,House>他会出差吗
<29-10,House>Does he travel for work?

631
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,940
<29-11,Taub>你说什么  他会吗
<29-11,Taub>What do you mean, "Does he"?

632
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,860
<29-11,Taub>他十年前就死了
<29-11,Taub>He died almost ten years ago.

633
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,250
<29-12,House>不是她的  她男友的
<29-12,House>Not hers, her boyfriend's.

634
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,320
<29-12,House>她幻觉里的那个人是他
<29-12,House>He's the one in her visions.

635
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,180
<30-1,House>我是你儿子女友的医生
<30-1,House>I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor.

636
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,820
<30-3,House>这头衔可真够长的
<30-3,House>Oh. It's a mouthful,

637
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,160
<30-3,House>但应该没有你的复杂
<30-3,House>But probably not as tricky as your title.

638
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,310
<30-4,Artie>好吧  艾比会好起来吗
<30-4,Artie>Um, okay. Is abby gonna be all right?

639
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,300
<30-5,House>你经常旅游吗
<30-5,House>Do you travel a lot?

640
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,340
<30-6,Artie>对啊  我做食品进口生意  怎么了
<30-6,Artie>Yeah, I have a food-import business. Why?

641
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,570
<30-7,House>你去过哪儿
<30-7,House>Where'd you go?

642
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,650
<30-8,Artie>哪里都去
<30-8,Artie>All over--

643
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,090
<30-8,Artie>法国  意大利 地中海地区  怎么了
<30-8,Artie>France, italy, the mediterranean. Why?

644
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,280
<30-9,House>我认为你令她感染了寄生虫
<30-9,House>I think you exposed her to a parasite.

645
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,700
<30-10,Artie>但检测里什么都没显示啊
<30-10,Artie>I thought the scans didn't show any.

646
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,970
<30-11,House>因为她什么都没有得
<30-11,House>Because she doesn't have any.

647
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,380
<30-12,Artie>-但你刚才说  -这很酷
<30-12,Artie>- But you just said... - It's cool.

648
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,000
<30-13,House>我的猜想是她的身体能杀死寄生虫
<30-13,House>My theory is that her body was able to kill off the parasite,

649
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,140
<30-13,House>但却没办法清除它们的外壳
<30-13,House>But what it couldn't do was get rid of the shell,

650
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,520
<30-13,House>这在检测里无法显示
<30-13,House>which doesn't show up on the scans.

651
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,850
<30-13,House>那些微型的垃圾
<30-13,House>That little piece of microscopic garbage

652
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,600
<30-13,House>引起了过敏反应叫做小脑血吸虫
<30-13,House>set off an allergic reaction Called cerebellar

653
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,480
<30-13,House>迟发性过敏症
<30-13,House>schistosomiasis delayed hypersensitivity allergy,

654
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,970
<30-13,House>或者说cusdehaaa
<30-13,House>Or cusdehaaa.

655
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,680
<30-13,House>治疗痛苦而充满风险  但绝对能治
<30-13,House>Risky, unpleasant treatment, but completely curable.

656
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,340
<30-14,Artie>好吧  那很棒
<30-14,Artie>Well, that's fantastic.

657
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,980
<30-15,House>你这么想不是吗
<30-15,House>You'd think so, wouldn't you?

658
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,940
<30-15,House>只有一点
<30-15,House>Only thing is,

659
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,940
<30-15,House>你和你儿子的女朋友睡过吗
<30-15,House>did you ever have sex with your son's girlfriend?

660
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,840
<30-16,Artie>你该死的在问些什么鬼东西
<30-16,Artie>Where the hell do you get off asking--

661
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,710
<30-17,House>闭嘴
<30-17,House>Shut up.

662
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,230
<30-17,House>听着  不确定的话我就不能治疗
<30-17,House>See, I can't treat this unless I can confirm it,

663
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,890
<30-17,House>而性接触是感染
<30-17,House>and the only way she could have been exposed

664
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,550
<30-17,House>这一寄生虫的唯一途径
<30-17,House>to this parasite is sexually,

665
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,090
<30-17,House>意味着除非你承认和她睡过不然她很快就要死了
<30-17,House>which means she's gonna die very soon unless you admit that you slept with her.

666
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,230
<30-18,Nick>爸
<30-18,Nick>Dad?

667
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,680
<30-18,Nick>发生什么事
<30-18,Nick>What's going on?

668
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,030
<30-19,House>糟糕了
<30-19,House>Gee, this is bad,

669
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,460
<30-19,House>你得二选一了  是让她死掉呢
<30-19,House>because you now have to choose between her living

670
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,310
<30-19,House>还是把这公诸于众呢
<30-19,House>and the truth becoming public.

671
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,590
<30-19,House>实话说  在这种情况下
<30-19,House>And frankly, given what the truth is,

672
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,920
<30-19,House>这真是困难的选择
<30-19,House>it's a tough call.

673
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,240
<30-20,Artie>你们分手了
<30-20,Artie>You'd broken up.

674
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,380
<30-20,Artie>她在哭
<30-20,Artie>She was crying.

675
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,360
<30-21,House>你女友不是对你的精液过敏
<30-21,House>Your girlfriend is not allergic to your semen.

676
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,340
<30-21,House>她对你父亲精液中的埃及寄生虫过敏
<30-21,House>She's allergic to the egyptian parasite swimming around in your dad's semen.

677
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,010
<30-22,Nick>你和艾比上床了吗
<30-22,Nick>You slept with Abby?

678
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,580
<30-23,Artie>我醉了
<30-23,Artie>I was drunk.

679
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,700
<30-23,Artie>我们都
<30-23,Artie>We both...

680
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,320
<30-24,House>没什么好解释  理论说来这是合法的
<30-24,House>No need to explain. Technically, she was legal.

681
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,420
<30-25,Artie>等等  等等  等等
<30-25,Artie>Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait!

682
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,280
<30-26,House>嘿
<30-26,House>Hey!

683
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,820
<30-26,House>全盘考虑的话
<30-26,House>All things considered,

684
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,820
<30-26,House>其实这是好消息
<30-26,House>it's actually great news.

685
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
<31-1,Wilson>你觉得怎么样
<31-1,Wilson>So what do you think?

686
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,000
<31-2,House>你懦弱地退缩了  找了个装修公司
<31-2,House>You wussed out, and you used a decorator.

687
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,180
<31-3,Wilson>我为什么就不能这样
<31-3,Wilson>Why can't that be me--

688
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,140
<31-3,Wilson>做个热爱装修公司的懦夫呢
<31-3,Wilson>the wuss who loves decorators?

689
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,380
<31-4,House>因为你就不是
<31-4,House>'cause it's not.

690
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,710
<31-5,Wilson>好吧  我不是
<31-5,Wilson>Okay. It's not.

691
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,810
<31-5,Wilson>但再全还回去了  我不能一直这么做
<31-5,Wilson>But don't return it. I can't keep doing this.

692
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,710
<31-6,House>你必须这样
<31-6,House>You have to.

693
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,720
<31-6,House>你不能一直让别人来定义你
<31-6,House>You can't keep letting other people define you.

694
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,900
<31-7,House>不会是另一头大象吧
<31-7,House>Not another elephant.

695
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,160
<31-8,House>装修公司没挑这个
<31-8,House>Decorator didn't pick this.

700
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,110
<31-11,Rachel>你呢
<31-11,Rachel>Do you?

<31-12,Taub>婚礼上大部分人我都不记得了
<31-12,Taub>I don't remember most of the people who were at our wedding.

<31-12,Taub>所以我想
<31-12,Taub>Which is why...

<31-16,House>What'd you tell him?

708
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,630
<31-17,Taub>那并不代表她不爱他
<31-17,Taub>That it doesn't mean she doesn't love him.

709

00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,480
<31-22,House>至少他以年轻愚蠢做借口
<31-22,House>At least he has the young and stupid excuse.
