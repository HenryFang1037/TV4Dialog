<2-2,ROY>什么时候能完成?
<2-2,ROY>When can we close?

5
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,620
<2-3,OLIVER>还需经过两地的监管部门审批 多伦多和...
<2-3,OLIVER>It would be subject to regulatory approval  in both toronto and--

6
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,200
<2-4,ROY>我没问"怎么做" Oliver 我问的是"何时做完"
<2-4,ROY>I didn't say,"how," oliver.I said,"when."

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,010
<2-5,KEN>- 什么事? - 你确定这就是今后的方向 Roy?
<2-5,KEN>- What - You sure this is a direction you want to go,roy?

8
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,230
<2-5,KEN>- 这将使我们从能源服务转型到... - 你不觉得石油会涨价?
<2-5,KEN>- This would move us from energy service into-- you don't think oil's going up?

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,450
<2-7,KEN>当然会 问题是什么时候涨
<2-7,KEN>Of course it's gonnago up.The question is when.

10
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,080
<2-8,ROY>问题一直在于何时 如果 我们等所有人都看出投资价值
<2-8,ROY>The question is always when,and if we wait until the deal makes senseto everyone else,

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,270
<2-8,ROY>我们都会落在别人的后面
<2-8,ROY>we're gonna be waitingin line behind everyonelse.

12
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,000
<2-9,KEN>- 我只想说... - 你一贯为自己开脱的废话
<2-9,KEN>- All I'm saying is-- the same cover-your-ass crap you always say.

13
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,350
<2-10,ROY>我们得速战速决 我要走了
<2-10,ROY>We're gonna have to wrap this up.I got to go.

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,660
<2-11,KEN>- 你要去哪? - 上楼
<2-11,KEN>- Where are you going? - Upstairs.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,860

<2-12,ROY>Get the regulators on it.I want to close by the end of the month.

16
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,050
<2-13,KEN>拜托 Roy 议程上还有十件事呢
<2-13,KEN>Come on,roy.There are ten other itemson the agenda.

17
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,440
<2-14,ROY>等到下周再说
<2-14,ROY>Which will haveto wait until next week.

18
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,940
<2-15,KEN>你不能把我们从办公室拖过来 开一半的会 然后把我们踢出去
<2-15,KEN>You can't drag us all outof the office,get halfway through,and then just kick us out.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,080
<2-16,ROY>对 我可以
<2-16,ROY>Yeah,I can.

20
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,840
<3-1,DOCTOR>抗生素治疗没有效果
<3-1,DOCTOR>the antibiotic treatment had no effect.

21
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,480
<3-1,DOCTOR>热度更高了 疼痛也加剧了 也就是说不是艰难梭菌
<3-1,DOCTOR>Both the fever and the painare getting worse,which means it's not clostridium difficile.

22
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,510
<3-2,ROY>但你说这是唯一说得通的诊断
<3-2,ROY>But you said that was the onlydiagnosis that made sense.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,260
<3-2,ROY>以前是
<3-2,ROY>It was.

24
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,260
<3-3,DOCTOR>得送他去医院
<3-3,DOCTOR>We need to get himto a hospital.

25
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,720
<3-3,DOCTOR>爸爸?
<3-3,DOCTOR>dad?

26
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,510
<3-4,JACK>我不想去
<3-4,JACK>I don't want to go.

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,080
<3-5,ROY>我知道 伙计 但也许我们得去
<3-5,ROY>I know,buddy.But we may need to.

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,910
<3-6,JACK>我会死吗?
<3-6,JACK>Am I gonna die?

29
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,380
<3-7,ROY>不 当然不会
<3-7,ROY>No,of course not.

30
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,800
<3-8,JACK>你怎么知道?
<3-8,JACK>How do you know?

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,990
<3-9,ROY>嗯 我就是知道
<3-9,ROY>Well,I just do.

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,650
<3-9,ROY>而且我一直都是对的 是不是?
<3-9,ROY>And I'm always right,aren't I?

33
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,470
<3-10,JACK>是
<3-10,JACK>Yeah.

34
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,430
<4-1,ROY>我想要House
<4-1,ROY>I want house.

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,930
<4-2,CUDDY>我理解 但我已经告诉你 House医生没空
<4-2,CUDDY>I understand,but I told ou Dr. House isn't available.

36
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,170
<4-3,ROY>- Foreman... - 打电话给他
<4-3,ROY>- Dr.-- Call him.

37
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,140
<4-3,ROY>告诉他我会派私人飞机去接他 不管他在哪个岛上...
<4-3,ROY>Tell him I'll have a private jet pick him up from whatever island--

38
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,640
<4-4,CUDDY>他没在度假
<4-4,CUDDY>he isn't on vacation.

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,520
<4-4,CUDDY>Foreman医生是我们这最好的医生之一
<4-4,CUDDY>Dr. Foreman's one of our best doctors.

40
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,000
<4-5,ROY>House被关起来了?
<4-5,ROY>Is house in jail?

41
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,530
<4-6,CUDDY>没 Foreman目前正与两名 House最资深的同事共事
<4-6,CUDDY>No.Foreman is currently working with two of house's  most veteran associates.

42
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,950
<4-7,ROY>去戒毒了?
<4-7,ROY>Rehab?

43
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,800
<4-7,ROY>不是
<4-7,ROY>No.

44
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,270
<4-8,CUDDY>Randall先生 你儿子将得到悉心照料
<4-8,CUDDY>Mr. Randall,your son will be in good hands.

45
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,800
<4-8,CUDDY>我儿子...
<4-8,CUDDY>My son...

46
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,670
<4-9,ROY>已经接受了悉心医治 但他还是快死了
<4-9,ROY>has already been in good hands,and he's still dying.

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,070
<4-9,ROY>我再也不要好医生了
<4-9,ROY>I'm through dealing  with good.

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,690
<4-9,ROY>我要最好的 我咨询过的所有人都说是House
<4-9,ROY>I want the best and everyone I've asked says at's house.

49
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,630
<4-9,ROY>所以除非他死了 昏迷了 或者疯了 否则我想他今天就来治我儿子
<4-9,ROY>So unless he's dead,comatose,or insane,I want him treating my son today.

50
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,250
<5-1,HOUSE>你可以凭着良心拒绝他
<5-1,HOUSE>You could have said no in good conscience.

51
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,600
<5-2,CUDDY>孩子依然是Foreman的病人 但他的父亲希望由你做诊断
<5-2,CUDDY>the kid'll still  be foreman's patient,but his dad wants you making the decisions.

52
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,490
<5-3,FOREMAN>那他就不是我的病人
<5-3,FOREMAN>Then he's not my patient.

53
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,100
<5-3,FOREMAN>我做不了主 却要承担全部责任?
<5-3,FOREMAN>You want to give me none of the responsibility and all of the liability?

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,520
<5-4,HOUSE>也就是说我要... 噢 真不错
<5-4,HOUSE>Which means I get-- oh,cool.

55
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,240
<5-5,CUDDY>别让他做出格的事
<5-5,CUDDY>Don't let him do anything crazy.

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,750
<5-6,FOREMAN>他什么时候能拿回执照? 这样我们就不用再玩这游戏了
<5-6,FOREMAN>When is he getting his license back so we can stop playing this game?

57
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,640
<5-7,HOUSE>也许拿不回来了 这游戏挺好玩
<5-7,HOUSE>Maybe never.This game is fun.

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,410
<5-8,CUDDY>你还要为这周Dibala总统的 M&M会议做准备(病发及病亡报告例会)
<5-8,CUDDY>You also need to prepare president dibala's case for this week's morbidity and mortality conference.

59
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,360
<5-9,HOUSE>噢 真不幸 我还拖着个指甲护理的预约没去呢
<5-9,HOUSE>Ohh,unfortunately I'm overdue a mani-pedi appointment.

60
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,720
<5-10,CUDDY>没说你 这是Foreman的部门
<5-10,CUDDY>Not you.Foreman's department.

61
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,560
<5-11,HOUSE>哦对 他有的是时间
<5-11,HOUSE>Oh,right.Well,he's got all the time in the world.

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,680
<5-12,FOREMAN>我们弄错了 他死了 没什么好说的
<5-12,FOREMAN>We made the wrong call.He died.There's nothing to present.

63
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,320
<5-13,CUDDY>显然引起了不少好奇心
<5-13,CUDDY>It obviously garnered a lot of curiosity.

64
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,570
<5-14,CHASE>除了满足每个人无聊的好奇心 我们就没其他重要的事了?
<5-14,CHASE>And we don't have more important things to do than satisfy everyone's idle curiosity?

65
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,230
<5-15,CUDDY>这不无聊
<5-15,CUDDY>It's not idle.

66
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,050
<5-15,CUDDY>我们如何抉择两种不同诊断
<5-15,CUDDY>The question of how we deal with two possible diagnoses

67
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,480
<5-15,CUDDY>而不同诊断的治疗方法是冲突的 这值得讨论
<5-15,CUDDY>whose treatments are contraindicated is worth discussing.

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,020
<5-16,CAMERON>腹部疼痛加剧加频 发热 脱水 腹泻 体重减轻
<5-16,CAMERON>Abdominal pain increasing in severity equed frncy,fever,dehydration,diarrhea,weight loss.

69
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,570
<5-17,CHASE>母亲死于因I型糖尿病 引起的肾脏衰竭 已经排除了
<5-17,CHASE>Mom died from kidney failure caused by type one diabetes,which has been ruled out.

70
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,650
<5-18,HOUSE>17个医生
<5-18,HOUSE>17 doctors.

71
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,360
<5-18,HOUSE>所有病因都被排除了
<5-18,HOUSE>Everything's been  ruled out.

72
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,330
<5-18,HOUSE>也就是说我们得重新排除
<5-18,HOUSE>Which means we have to re-rule out.

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,900
<5-18,HOUSE>重做病史询问和身体检查
<5-18,HOUSE>Get a new history and physical.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,760
<5-18,HOUSE>除非这算出格 老大
<5-18,HOUSE>Unless that's crazy,boss.

75
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,090
<6-1,CAMERON>最近有没有出过国 或者参加过露营?
<6-1,CAMERON>you been out of the country or on any recent camping trips?

76
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,580
<6-2,ROY>没去过露营
<6-2,ROY>No camping.

77
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,890
<6-2,ROY>但一月份我们在蒙特利尔
<6-2,ROY>But we were in montreal back in january.

78
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,670
<6-3,JACK>我们去看了冰球全明星赛 庆祝我的生日
<6-3,JACK>We went to see the nhl all-star game for my birthday.

79
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,900
<6-4,CAMERON>真不错
<6-4,CAMERON>Awesome.

80
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,960
<6-5,ROY>House医生在哪?
<6-5,ROY>Where's Dr. House?

81
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,580
<6-6,CAMERON>在办公室里
<6-6,CAMERON>In his office.

82
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,010
<6-6,CAMERON>他更像个决策者 而非操作者
<6-6,CAMERON>He's really more of a decider than a doer.

83
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,390
<6-6,CAMERON>他决定让我们从头再来
<6-6,CAMERON>He's decided we should  start over.

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,500
<6-6,CAMERON>说不定之前的医生可能遗漏了什么
<6-6,CAMERON>Never know what previous doctors may have missed.

85
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,300
<6-6,CAMERON>比如这个
<6-6,CAMERON>Like this.

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,490
<6-6,CAMERON>按下去会不会感觉疼?
<6-6,CAMERON>Does that hurt more when I push there?

87
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,210
<6-8,ROY>- 没 - 是什么问题?
<6-8,ROY>- Not really. - What is it

88
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,140
<6-9,CAMERON>我不确定
<6-9,CAMERON>I'm not sure.

89
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,270
<7-1,CHASE>规规矩矩 就这么简单
<7-1,CHASE>Just keep it clean,simple.

90
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,510
<7-1,CHASE>检测结果引起我们对初始诊断的怀疑 所以改主意了
<7-1,CHASE>We did a test that called into question our initial diagnosis,so we changed our mind.

91
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,140
<7-2,FOREMAN>如果他们问检测是怎么做的呢?
<7-2,FOREMAN>And if they ask how the test was done?

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,390
<7-3,CHASE>他们为什么要问? 只是常规检测
<7-3,CHASE>Why would they do that?It's a routine lab test.

93
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,100
<7-4,FOREMAN>常规检测可不包括从尸体上 偷血样来骗我做出错误治疗
<7-4,FOREMAN>Routine lab tests don't involve blood you stole from a corpse to trick me into giving the guy the wrong treatment.

94
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,150
<7-5,CHASE>对 如果你提起这事 肯定会招起一场热烈的
<7-5,CHASE>Yes,and if you brought that up,it'd certainly make for a lively debate

95
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,670
<7-5,CHASE>关于谋杀杀人犯的道德问题的辩论
<7-5,CHASE>about the morality of murdering murderers.

96
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,570
<7-6,FOREMAN>- 但基于你烧毁了唯一的证据 - 是为了给你做掩饰 而不是为我
<7-6,FOREMAN>- But since you burned the only evidence of that-- to cover for you,not me.

97
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040
<7-7,CHASE>你是受到保护的
<7-7,CHASE>You're protected.

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,650
<7-7,CHASE>我们得二选一 没什么正误之分
<7-7,CHASE>The decision was a coin flip.There was no rig or wrong answer.

99
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,120
<7-7,CHASE>遗体已经安葬在八千英里外了 没人能证明什么
<7-7,CHASE>The body's underground,8,000 miles away.Nobody can prove anything.

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,400
<7-8,FOREMAN>屋子会挤满了人 不是因为 我们要二选一 不是因为病人的身份
<7-8,FOREMAN>That room will be filled,not because of the coin flip,not because of the patient,

101
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,720
<7-8,FOREMAN>而是因为House的部门搞砸了
<7-8,FOREMAN>but because house's department screwed up.

102
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,670
<7-8,FOREMAN>他们会像是装满鱼饵的 游泳池中的鲨鱼
<7-8,FOREMAN>They're gonna be like sharks in a chum-filled swimming pool

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,300
<7-8,FOREMAN>除非我在铁笼子里 否则我绝不会跳进去
<7-8,FOREMAN>and there's no way I'm jumping in unless I'm in a steel cage.

104
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,820
<7-9,CHASE>你想怎样?
<7-9,CHASE>So what do you want?

105
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,600
<7-10,FOREMAN>我要确定你把一切都掩盖好了
<7-10,FOREMAN>I want to know you have everything covered.

106
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,840
<7-11,HOUSE>掩盖什么?
<7-11,HOUSE>got what covered?

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,020
<7-12,CHASE>我们只是在回顾Dibala的案子
<7-12,CHASE>We're just reviewing the dibala case.

108
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,620
<7-12,CHASE>确保没遗漏什么
<7-12,CHASE>Making sure we didn't miss anything.

109
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,310
<7-13,HOUSE>没遗漏 当然 除了害死他的病因之外
<7-13,HOUSE>We didn't.Except of course the thing that killed him.

110
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,530
<7-14,CAMERON>他便秘
<7-14,CAMERON>he's constipated.

111
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,340
<7-14,CAMERON>体检显示他的腹部有硬块 所以我重新照了X光
<7-14,CAMERON>Physical revealed a mass in his abdomen,so I repeated the x-ray.

112

<12-9,THIRTEEN>I said I'm sorry.

220
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,180
<12-9,THIRTEEN>噢 喂
<12-9,THIRTEEN>Oh,hello.

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,480
<12-9,THIRTEEN>请问商务舱有没空位 我想用积分升级舱位
<12-9,THIRTEEN>I was wondering if there were any business class seats open that I could use my miles to upgrade to.

222
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,720
<12-10,CAB DRIVER>虽然我不认识你 但我一开始便抱以信任
<12-10,CAB DRIVER>I don't know you,but I assumed I could trust you.

223
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,430
<12-10,CAB DRIVER>欢迎你坐上我的车
<12-10,CAB DRIVER>Welcomed you in my car.

224
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,660
<12-11,THIRTEEN>好吧 你是圣人
<12-11,THIRTEEN>Okay,you're a saint.

225
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,760
<12-11,THIRTEEN>这不可能 我昨晚确认过了
<12-11,THIRTEEN>That's impossible.I confirmed my reservation last night.

226
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
<12-11,THIRTEEN>那再订一次
<12-11,THIRTEEN>So rebook it.

227
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,990
<12-11,THIRTEEN>显然是你搞错了 不是我的问题
<12-11,THIRTEEN>Well,obviously it was a mistake on your end,not mine.

228
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,990
<12-11,THIRTEEN>不 我正在去机场的路上
<12-11,THIRTEEN>No,I'm on my way to the airport right now.

229
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,260
<12-12,CAB DRIVER>他们不相信你 对吧?
<12-12,CAB DRIVER>They didn't believe you,huh?

230
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,560
<13-1,ROY>脑癌?
<13-1,ROY>Brain cancer?

231
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,000
<13-2,CHASE>明早前就能知道了
<13-2,CHASE>We should know for sure by the morning.

232
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,770
<13-3,ROY>我们的运气是越来越差了
<13-3,ROY>Our luck just keeps getting worse,huh?

233
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,640
<13-4,CAMERON>现在的治疗手段越来越有效
<13-4,CAMERON>Treatment options are getting better every day.

234
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,290
<13-4,CAMERON>目前还看不到肿瘤快 即使活检呈阳性 也只是早期
<13-4,CAMERON>There's no visible mass,so even if the biopsy comes back positive,we've caught it early.

235
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,810
<13-5,ROY>那照你说 这是好消息?
<13-5,ROY>Oh,so you're telling me this is good news?

236
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,280
<13-6,CAMERON>我的意思是 我们会尽力而为
<13-6,CAMERON>I'm saying we will do whatever we can.

237
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,760
<13-7,ROY>好吧
<13-7,ROY>Right.

238
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,230
<13-7,ROY>对不起
<13-7,ROY>Sorry.

239
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,570
<13-8,CHASE>我要走了 Foreman让我帮忙准备 M&M会议的事
<13-8,CHASE>I got to go.Foreman needs more help with the m and m prep.

240
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,320
<13-9,CAMERON>好吧 我做完活检后来帮忙
<13-9,CAMERON>Okay,I'll come up and help after I finish the biopsy.

241
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,750
<13-10,CHASE>我们能搞定
<13-10,CHASE>We can handle it.

242
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,260
<13-10,CHASE>我们晚点回家见
<13-10,CHASE>I'll see you at home later.

243
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,920
<13-11,CAMERON>如果你留下 我也不走
<13-11,CAMERON>If you're here,I might as well be.

244
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,860
<13-12,CHASE>回家休息去吧
<13-12,CHASE>Go home.Get some rest.

245
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,220
<13-12,CHASE>我一回家就叫醒你
<13-12,CHASE>'Cause I'm gonna be waking you up as soon as I get home.

246
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,630
<14-1,THIRTEEN>离我远点
<14-1,THIRTEEN>Stay out of my life.

247
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,810
<14-2,HOUSE>好吧
<14-2,HOUSE>Okay.

248
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,800
<14-3,THIRTEEN>我知道你取消了我的机位
<14-3,THIRTEEN>I know you anceled my reservation.

249
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,290
<14-3,THIRTEEN>你在咖啡馆偷看到我订机票
<14-3,THIRTEEN>You obviously saw me log in when you were spying on me in the coffee shop.

250
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,760
<14-4,HOUSE>我在和你聊天
<14-4,HOUSE>I was talking to you.

251
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,710
<14-4,HOUSE>偷看的是隔壁穿热裤的熟女
<14-4,HOUSE>I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.

252
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,250
<14-6,HOUSE>- 我不会回医疗小组的 - 我也不想你回来
<14-6,HOUSE>- I'm not coming back on the team. - I don't want you back on the team.

253
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,040
<14-7,THIRTEEN>我不想在Foreman手下 或身边工作
<14-7,THIRTEEN>I cannot work for,with,or around foreman.

254
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,840
<14-6,HOUSE>所以我不想你回来
<14-6,HOUSE>Which is why I don't want you back on the team.

255
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,120
<14-8,HOUSE>你不在时 他表现比以往都好
<14-8,HOUSE>Now that you're out of the picture,he's better than ever,

256
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,020
<14-8,HOUSE>也让我过的比以往都舒坦
<14-8,HOUSE>which is gonna make me less miserable than ever,

257
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,190
<14-8,HOUSE>所以咱俩一点也不在乎...
<14-8,HOUSE>which is why neither of us gives a damn how,

258
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,050
<14-8,HOUSE>你打算在巴哈马某小岛呆多长时间
<14-8,HOUSE>when,or on what island in the bahamas you want to get from it all.

259
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,240
<14-9,THIRTEEN>巴哈马?
<14-9,THIRTEEN>The bahamas?

260
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,750
<14-10,HOUSE>哥斯达黎加?
<14-10,HOUSE>Costa rica?

261
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,340
<14-11,THIRTEEN>我告诉你是泰国
<14-11,THIRTEEN>I told you thailand.

262
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,660
<14-12,HOUSE>我以为你骗我来着 因为如果 你告诉我实话 你也太白痴了
<14-12,HOUSE>I assumed you were lying,because it would have been idiotic of you to tell me truth.

263
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,450
<14-12,HOUSE>这是另一个我用不着你的原因
<14-12,HOUSE>Yet another reason I have no use for you.

264
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,940
<15-1,FOREMAN>我们有麻烦了
<15-1,FOREMAN>we've got a problem.

265
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,810
<15-1,FOREMAN>Cameron送Dibala的血样去实验室时 特地要求对方做抗着丝点检测
<15-1,FOREMAN>When camer sent dibala's blood to the lab,she specifically asked for the anticentromere antibodies test.

266
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,180
<15-2,CHASE>又如何?
<15-2,CHASE>So?

267
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,530
<15-3,FOREMAN>他们送返来的回条 上有抗着丝点抗体
<15-3,FOREMAN>The printout they sent you included just the anticentromere antibodies,

268
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,020
<15-3,FOREMAN>但实验室还做了全血检查
<15-3,FOREMAN>but the lab also did a full blood panel.

269
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,130
<15-4,CHASE>我又不是白痴 我当然会 确保取血样的尸体血型一致
<15-4,CHASE>So,I'm not an idiot I obviously made sure the cadaver I got the sample from had the same blood type.

270
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,490
<15-5,FOREMAN>但显然你没有查胆固醇
<15-5,FOREMAN>You apparently didn't check his cholesterol.

271
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,990
<15-6,CHASE>相差多少?
<15-6,CHASE>How far off?

272
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,140
<15-7,FOREMAN>20%
<15-7,FOREMAN>20%.

273
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,640
<15-7,FOREMAN>Dibala并非死于胆固醇过高
<15-7,FOREMAN>dibala didn't die of high cholesterol.

274
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,810
<16-1,CHASE>怎会有人费神去比对两份报告?
<16-1,CHASE>Why would anyone even bother to compare the two reports?

275
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,320
<16-2,FOREMAN>和我这么做的原因一样
<16-2,FOREMAN>The same reason I did.

276
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,380
<16-2,FOREMAN>他们想挖出任何证明我们犯错的证据
<16-2,FOREMAN>Becae they're looking for anything we might have screwed up.

277
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,170
<16-3,CHASE>我们可以推说血检仪坏了
<16-3,CHASE>We could claim the blood analyzer broke.

278
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,320
<16-4,FOREMAN>不行 Cameron记录下她做血检时 仪器是校准的
<16-4,FOREMAN>We can't.Cameron documented that it was perfectly calibrated when she did the test.

279
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,510
<16-5,CHASE>就算数字有点出入 谁在乎?
<16-5,CHASE>So the numbers are off,it's weird.Who cares?

280
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,410
<16-5,CHASE>如果查到我们头上 就装出吃惊的样子
<16-5,CHASE>If it comes up,just act surprised like it's some irrelevasi curioty.

281
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,330
<16-6,FOREMAN>我不能这么做
<16-6,FOREMAN>I can't do this.

282
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,140
<16-6,FOREMAN>我不能用一个谎言 去掩盖另一个谎言
<16-6,FOREMAN>I can't go in there and stack lie upon lie.

283
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,100
<16-6,FOREMAN>你得想办法跟人解释
<16-6,FOREMAN>You've got to figure out a way to explain this.

284
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,000
<16-9,CAMERON>我今早很想你
<16-9,CAMERON>Missed you this morning.

285
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,740
<16-10,CHASE>对不起 我得早点过来 不想吵醒你
<16-10,CHASE>Yeah,sorry.I needed to get in early.I didn't want to wake you.

286
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,300
<16-11,CAMERON>我以为你会叫醒我呢 你昨晚是这么说的
<16-11,CAMERON>I thought you did want to wake me.At least that's what you said last night.

287
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,020
<16-12,FOREMAN>- 这儿没我事了 - 不 我拿到活检结果了
<16-12,FOREMAN>- I'm out of here. - No,no.I have the biopsy results.

288
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,830
<16-12,FOREMAN>不是癌症
<16-12,FOREMAN>It's not cancer.

289
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,720
<17-1,FOREMAN>这么多问题却一个查不出来
<17-1,FOREMAN>How can so much be wrong with nothing being wrong?

290
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,280
<17-2,HOUSE>从什么时候开始 癌症也不算问题了?
<17-2,HOUSE>Since when has cancer been considered nothing?

291
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,240
<17-3,CAMERON>我刚说了 不是癌症 细胞形态分析正常
<17-3,CAMERON>I just saidit's not cancer.The cell morphologies were all normal.

292
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,120
<17-4,FOREMAN>最近一次CT扫描也正常
<17-4,FOREMAN>And so are the most recent ct scans.

293
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,520
<17-5,HOUSE>另一边厢 胃部腺癌会引起腹痛
<17-5,HOUSE>On the other hand,andenocarcinoma of the stomach uld cause pain,

294
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,870
<17-5,HOUSE>便秘 营养不良 继而引发癫痫
<17-5,HOUSE>constipation,nutritional deficiencies.That could cause seizures.

295
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,210
<17-6,FOREMAN>而且CT上看不出来
<17-6,FOREMAN>And wouldn't show on a ct.

296
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,930
<17-7,HOUSE>你的癌症诊断是对的 只是位置搞错了
<17-7,HOUSE>You're right about the cancer,just wrong about the place.

297
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,460
<17-7,HOUSE>如果你同意 请继续保持缄默
<17-7,HOUSE>Continue to say nothing if you agree.

298
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,820
<17-8,FOREMAN>给他做胃镜 再做一组活检
<17-8,FOREMAN>Go scope h  Get another set of biopsies.

299
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,270
<17-9,HOUSE>如果你带着两张飞往更棒的 度假胜地的机票去找她
<17-9,HOUSE>I'd get canceling her ticket if you then showed up with two more to somewhere better.

300
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,150
<17-10,FOREMAN>- 你在说什么? - 我还能理解
<17-10,FOREMAN>- What are you talking about? - Or showed up at all.

301
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,630
<17-11,HOUSE>但光破坏她的度假计划 也不能让她同意你的啊
<17-11,HOUSE>But how does just ruining her plans get her to agree to yours?

302
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,330
<17-12,FOREMAN>你说13? 她要去哪?
<17-12,FOREMAN>You talking about thirteen? Where's she going?

303
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,400
<17-13,HOUSE>这周哪儿也不去 多亏了你
<17-13,HOUSE>Well,nowhere this week,thanks to you.

304
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,250
<17-14,FOREMAN>我没阻止她 我也不会阻止
<17-14,FOREMAN>I didn't stop her.I'm not gonna stop her.

305
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,680
<17-14,FOREMAN>我已经尽力挽留她了
<17-14,FOREMAN>I've already doneall I could.

306
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,390
<17-14,FOREMAN>现在我只能向前看了
<17-14,FOREMAN>Now all I can dois move on.

307
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,490
<17-15,HOUSE>我想...我相信你
<17-15,HOUSE>I  ink... I actually believe you.

308
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,700
<17-15,HOUSE>如果你说的是真话 说明你比我设想的更理性--
<17-15,HOUSE>If you're telling the truth,you're even more rational than I-- well,not more.

309
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,300
<17-15,HOUSE>应该说 更明智
<17-15,HOUSE>Then again,more sane.

310
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,440
<17-15,HOUSE>你会是个好老板 老板
<17-15,HOUSE>You're gonna be a good boss,boss.

311
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,440
<18-1,CHASE>我说了 什么问题也没有
<18-1,CHASE>I told you there's nothing wrong.

312
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,860
<18-2,CAMERON>很明显有问题 况且我 也没逼着你去讨论这问题
<18-2,CAMERON>There's obviously something wrong and I'm not even saying we need to talk about it right now.

313
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,570
<18-2,CAMERON>我只是不明白你为什么急着否认
<18-2,CAMERON>I just don't see why you have to deny it.

314
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,040
<18-3,CHASE>我没有
<18-3,CHASE>I'm not.

315
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,280
<18-4,CAMERON>现在你又在否认自己否认问题了
<18-4,CAMERON>Now you're denying you're enying.

316
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,660
<18-5,CHASE>不 我只是否认 有问题值得我去否认
<18-5,CHASE>No,I'm denying that there's anything to deny.

317
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,030
<18-6,CAMERON>Robert 你办不到的 你什么也瞒不过我
<18-6,CAMERON>Robert,you can't do this.You can't hide things from me.

318
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,700
<18-7,CHASE>关于Dibala的M&M会议出问题了
<18-7,CHASE>There's a problem with the dibala m and M.

319
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,610
<18-7,CHASE>他前后两次全血检查 的高密度脂蛋白数量不一致
<18-7,CHASE>The hdl numbers on one of his early blood panels don't match a later panel.

320
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,650
<18-8,CAMERON>太奇怪了
<18-8,CAMERON>That's weird.

321
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,920
<18-8,CAMERON>是的
<18-8,CAMERON>Yeah.

322
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,770
<18-9,CHASE>不是什么大问题
<18-9,CHASE>It's no big deal.

323
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,980
<18-9,CHASE>他的死因和胆固醇无关 但你知道
<18-9,CHASE>Cholesterol didn't have anything to do with his death,but,you know,

324
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,570
<18-9,CHASE>经历了被仁爱医院辞退 还有掉包13的药物实验
<18-9,CHASE>after being let go from mercy and then that thing with thirteen's drug trial,

325
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,760
<18-9,CHASE>Foreman不免神经兮兮 担心别人质疑他处理病例的能力
<18-9,CHASE>foreman's paranoid about about people questioning the way he handled the case.

326
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,140
<18-10,CAMERON>这更说不通了 即便有问题 Foreman也没啥好担心的
<18-10,CAMERON>That's ridiculous.If anything,foreman should be feeling secure.

327
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,790
<18-10,CAMERON>他开始的诊断是正确的 是我们说服他换了疗法
<18-10,CAMERON>He's the one who had the right diagnosis.We're the ones who talked him out of it.

328
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,290
<18-10,CAMERON>我知道
<18-10,CAMERON>I know.

329
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,130
<18-11,CHASE>不要告诉他我告诉你了 他不愿在人前示弱
<18-11,CHASE>Don't tell himI told you.He doesn't want to show any signs of weakness,

330
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,310
<18-11,CHASE>尤其现在House嚷嚷 要让他继续当老大
<18-11,CHASE>especially now that house is claiming he wants him to stay in charge.

331
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,320
<18-12,CAMERON>好吧
<18-12,CAMERON>All right.

332
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,410
<19-1,ROY>那么说还是癌症? 只是在别的地方?
<19-1,ROY>So it's still cancer? It's just somewhere else?

333
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,670
<19-2,CAMERON>还有待确证 但这解释了所有症状
<19-2,CAMERON>That's what we're looking for,but it would explain all the symptoms

334
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,020
<19-2,CAMERON>以及所有检测和成像结果
<19-2,CAMERON>and all the normal test and imaging studies.

335
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,740
<19-3,CHASE>取了粘膜和粘膜下层组织 正向幽门处移去
<19-3,CHASE>got biopsies of the mucosa and the submucosa.Moving towardsthe pylorus.

336
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,990
<19-4,ROY>是我的错
<19-4,ROY>It's my fault.

337
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,290
<19-5,CAMERON>腺癌不是由饮食或环境因素引起的
<19-5,CAMERON>Adenocarcinomasaren't caused by diet or environmentalfactors.

338
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,090
<19-6,ROY>我24岁那年 继承了一家 1千万美元的管道燃气公司
<19-6,ROY>I inherited a $10 million pipeline business when I was 24.

339
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,870
<19-6,ROY>到我30岁那年 其价值超过了10亿美元
<19-6,ROY>By the time I was 30,it was worth over a billion.

340
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,790
<19-6,ROY>自此我做的超过50笔生意都所向披靡
<19-6,ROY>Since then,I have been involved in over 50 deals that make that first one look like a loser.

341
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,350
<19-6,ROY>我仿佛有了点石成金的能力
<19-6,ROY>Everything I do,everything I touch turns to gold...

342
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,310
<19-6,ROY>除了我的家庭 首先 是我的妻子
<19-6,ROY>except my family.First,my wife.

343
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,500
<19-6,ROY>现在是...我儿子
<19-6,ROY>And now...my son.

344
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,280
<19-6,ROY>这是我的错
<19-6,ROY>This is my fault.

345
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,380
<19-7,CAMERON>这是报应
<19-7,CAMERON>It's karma.

346
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,070
<19-7,CAMERON>这是不可能的
<19-7,CAMERON>That's obviously ot true.

347
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,530
<19-8,CHASE>又开始抽搐了
<19-8,CHASE>He's seizing again.

348
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,890
<19-9,CAMERON>把胃镜取出来
<19-9,CAMERON>Get the scope out.

349
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,820
<19-9,CAMERON>5毫克安定
<19-9,CAMERON>Five milligrams diazepam.

350
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,760
<19-10,CHASE>- 颅内压多少? - 8
<19-10,CHASE>- How's the icp? - It'S...eight.

351
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,730
<19-11,CAMERON>但是分流是畅通的 没问题
<19-11,CAMERON>But the shunt's open and clear.

352
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,780
<19-11,CAMERON>这不是颅内压的问题
<19-11,CAMERON>This isn't intracranial pressure.

353
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,590
<19-12,CHASE>那这是什么玩意儿?
<19-12,CHASE>Then what the hell is it?

354
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,910
<20-1,CHASE>抽搐停止了 但他还没有恢复意识
<20-1,CHASE>seizures stopped,but he hasn't regained consciousness.

355
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,060
<20-1,CHASE>胃和食道无肿块
<20-1,CHASE>No sign of any masses in his stomach or esophageal lining

356
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,450
<20-1,CHASE>但硬膜下和腹膜下都在积水
<20-1,CHASE>and he's still accumulating subdural and peritoneal fluid.

357
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,500
<20-2,HOUSE>每次我们打算观察积水打哪来 他就开始痉挛
<20-2,HOUSE>And every time we look to see where it's coming from,he starts seizing.

358
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,360
<20-3,CAMERON>你觉得是我们引起的吗?
<20-3,CAMERON>You think we'resetting this off?

359
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,690
<20-4,HOUSE>我觉得总有个原因引起
<20-4,HOUSE>I think something is.

360
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,330
<20-5,FOREMAN>其中一个胃部活检显示出小动脉部分阻塞
<20-5,FOREMAN>One of his stomach biopsies shows an arteriole partially occluded.

361
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,580
<20-6,CAMERON>但其他组织层没有反常 而且没有细胞炎症反应
<20-6,CAMERON>but with no abnormality in the other layers and no evidence of a cellular inflammatory reaction.

362
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,090
<20-7,HOUSE>这绝对不是癌症
<20-7,HOUSE>It's definitely not cancer.

363
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,990
<20-8,CHASE>那一定是某种感染
<20-8,CHASE>Then it has to be some sort of infection.

364
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,660
<20-9,FOREMAN>我们已经排除了感染
<20-9,FOREMAN>We already ruled out infection.

365
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,320
<20-10,CHASE>那只是因为按照感染治疗后他恶化了
<20-10,CHASE>Only because he was treated for it and got worse.

366
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,800
<20-12,CHASE>- 听起来像个有说服力的原因 - 除非是抗药反应
<20-12,CHASE>- Seems like a sound reason.- Unless it's a drug-resistant strain.

367
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,270
<20-13,HOUSE>抗什么药的反应?
<20-13,HOUSE>Drug-resistant strain of what?

368
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,170
<20-13,HOUSE>细菌培养 病毒血清学 抗核抗体 抗中性粒细胞胞质抗体结果都是阴性的
<20-13,HOUSE>Bacterial cultures,viral serologies,A.N.A. And A.N.C.A.Were all negative.

369
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,270
<20-14,CHASE>一切都是阴性的 很明显我们忽略了什么
<20-14,CHASE>Everything's negative.We obviously missed something.

370
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,730
<20-15,CAMERON>可能痉挛不是新症状 是旧症状
<20-15,CAMERON>Maybe the seizures aren't a new symptom.They're an old one.

371
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,490
<20-16,CHASE>没有医生注意到这孩子抽搐吗?
<20-16,CHASE>No doctor noticed a thrashing kid?

372
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,200
<20-16,CHASE>腹型癫痫
<20-16,CHASE>Abdominal epilepsy.

373
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,610
<20-17,CAMERON>痉挛可能比较像腹痛 直到蔓延到他的运动皮层.
<20-17,CAMERON>The seizures would just ok like pain until it spread to his motor cortex.

374
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,960
<20-18,FOREMAN>这解释不了发烧
<20-18,FOREMAN>It wouldn't explain the fevers.

375
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,410
<20-19,CAMERON>蛋白质营养不良可以造成发烧 每次进食都加重的胃部剧痛
<20-19,CAMERON>Protein malnutrition can cause fevers and nothing causes malnutrition

376
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,230
<20-19,CAMERON>导致营养不良
<20-19,CAMERON>like excruciating stomach pain that getsorse every time you eat.

377
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,450
<20-20,HOUSE>如果是我的主意的话我会更肯定的 但这是目前最好的
<20-20,HOUSE>I'd be a lot more certainif it was my idea,but it's the best we got.

378
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,090
<20-21,FOREMAN>给他用Gabapentin(抗癫痫药)
<20-21,FOREMAN>Start him on gabapentin.

379
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,440
<20-21,FOREMAN>给他接上颅内脑电图不间断观察
<20-21,FOREMAN>Hook him up to an intracranial eeg for continuous monitoring.

380
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,110
<21-1,CHASE>- 我给他用了Statin (降胆固醇药) - 什么?
<21-1,CHASE>- I gave him statins. - What?

381
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,770
<21-3,CHASE>如果他们问到胆固醇的问题 就说我开了Statin 但忘了写在病历上
<21-3,CHASE>If they ask aboute cholesterol,just say I prescribeda statin and forgot to put itin the chart.

382
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,610
<21-4,FOREMAN>你这是拆了东墙补西墙
<21-4,FOREMAN>You want to solve a problem in the records by creating another problem in the records?

383
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,420
<21-5,CHASE>这就不算数据差错了 仅仅是记录遗漏罢了
<21-5,CHASE>It's not a problem with the records.It's a problemwith my record keeping.

384
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,510
<21-5,CHASE>没人能说我们错了
<21-5,CHASE>There's no way anyonecan prove me wrong.

385
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,100
<21-6,FOREMAN>你怎么拿到Statins?
<21-6,FOREMAN>How'd you get access to the statins?

386
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,290
<21-6,FOREMAN>你要让配药处的某个人 承认他记录也有遗漏吗?
<21-6,FOREMAN>You gonna get someonein the pharmacy to confess to yet anotherrecord-keeping p blem?

387
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,090
<21-7,CHASE>我看见药箱开着 就拿了一些
<21-7,CHASE>I saw an open cart.Just took it.

388
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,970
<21-8,FOREMAN>为什么你会偷一个能轻易得到的药?
<21-8,FOREMAN>Why would yousteal a drug you could justas easily ask for?

389
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,080
<21-9,CHASE>因为我在帮你逃脱责任
<21-9,CHASE>'Cause I'm tryingto get you off the hook.

390
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,070
<21-10,FOREMAN>一个不能自圆其说的故事只能让我越陷越深
<21-10,FOREMAN>A story that raises morequestions than it answers only puts the hook deeperdown my throat.

391
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,780
<21-10,FOREMAN>好了 我能应付
<21-10,FOREMAN>It's all right.I'll handle it.

392
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,120
<21-11,CHASE>怎样?
<21-11,CHASE>How?

393
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,060
<21-12,FOREMAN>实话实说
<21-12,FOREMAN>By telling the truth.

394
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,760
<22-1,FOREMAN>事实上我没有时间 我没这心情 而且我觉得没意义
<22-1,FOREMAN>The truth is I don't have the time,I'm not in the mood,and I don't see the point.

395
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,180
<22-2,CUDDY>你不想参加"M&M"会议 因为你没心情?
<22-2,CUDDY>You don't want to do the m and m because you're not in the mood?

396
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,020
<22-3,FOREMAN>这孩子命在旦夕 House还在拼命往我身上推责任
<22-3,FOREMAN>This kid is dying and I've got house trying to push all his responsibilities onto me.

397
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,740
<22-4,CUDDY>这不是他的责任 这是你的
<22-4,CUDDY>They're not his responsibilities.They're yours.

398
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,480
<22-5,FOREMAN>- 是你要负责的 - 我是想负责 但不想当傀儡
<22-5,FOREMAN>- You're the one who wanted to be in charge. - I wanted to be in charge,not a figurehead.

399
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,690
<22-6,CUDDY>那就去这个会议 你全权负责
<22-6,CUDDY>Then do the m and M.It's all yours.

400
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,640
<22-7,FOREMAN>你让我去被他们宰割? 为了什么?
<22-7,FOREMAN>You want me to get flogged?For what?

401
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,950
<22-7,FOREMAN>为一个不会再遇到的诊断疑难 做一个学术谈论?
<22-7,FOREMAN>So you can have an academic debate about a diagnostic dilemmano one's ever gonna face again?

402
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,510
<22-8,CUDDY>到底发生了什么事?
<22-8,CUDDY>What the hell'sgoing on here?

403
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,120
<22-9,FOREMAN>我只是不想参加这个会议
<22-9,FOREMAN>I just don't want to do the m and M.

404
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,410
<23-2,FOREMAN>- 成功了吗? - 差得远呢
<23-2,FOREMAN>- Did it work? - Not even close.

405
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,730
<24-1,CUDDY>还好吗?
<24-1,CUDDY>Everything okay?

406
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,780
<24-2,HOUSE>只是在等看到底什么会出问题
<24-2,HOUSE>Just waiting for whatever is about to go wrong.

407
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,390
<24-3,CUDDY>13打电话来了
<24-3,CUDDY>Thirteen called.

408
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,510
<24-4,HOUSE>她有一个比腹型癫痫还好的解释吗?
<24-4,HOUSE>She have a theory that makes more sense than abdominal epilepsy?

409
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,310
<24-5,CUDDY>她说有人黑进了她的Email账号 取消了她的机票预订
<24-5,CUDDY>She said someone hacked in her email account and canceled an airline reservation.

410
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,330
<24-5,CUDDY>我猜是Foreman
<24-5,CUDDY>I'm guessing foreman.

411
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,780
<24-6,HOUSE>真的吗? 你怀疑是Foreman干的 不是我?
<24-6,HOUSE>Really? You're accusing foreman,not me?

412
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,770
<24-6,HOUSE>酷
<24-6,HOUSE>Cool.

413
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,720
<24-7,CUDDY>你真的想让Foreman继续负责这个团队?
<24-7,CUDDY>You really want foreman to stay in charge of the team?

414
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,410
<24-8,HOUSE>这样合理
<24-8,HOUSE>Makes sense.

415
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,640
<24-8,HOUSE>他喜欢权力 我喜欢谜题
<24-8,HOUSE>He loves power,and I love puzzles.

416
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,500
<24-9,CUDDY>你两个都喜欢
<24-9,CUDDY>You love power and puzzles.

417
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,920
<24-9,CUDDY>是的
<24-9,CUDDY>True.

418
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,710
<24-10,HOUSE>那是当我两个都拥有的时候
<24-10,HOUSE>When I had them both.

419
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,880
<24-10,HOUSE>不是Foreman干的
<24-10,HOUSE>It wasn't foreman.

420
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,980
<24-11,CUDDY>你怎么知道?
<24-11,CUDDY>How do you know?

421
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,520
<24-12,HOUSE>他说他向前看了
<24-12,HOUSE>He said he's moved on.

422
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,090
<24-13,CUDDY>你相信他吗?
<24-13,CUDDY>And you believe him?

423
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,470
<24-14,HOUSE>我相信他是这么以为的
<24-14,HOUSE>I believe that he believes it.

424
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,210
<24-14,HOUSE>换我上场了
<24-14,HOUSE>Looks like it's time for me to get off the bench.

425
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,540
<24-14,HOUSE>出什么事了?
<24-14,HOUSE>What's up?

426
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,380
<24-15,ROY>你是House医生吗?
<24-15,ROY>Are you Dr. House?

427
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,150
<24-16,HOUSE>我知道你是个超级粉丝
<24-16,HOUSE>I understand you'rea big fan.

428
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,330
<24-16,HOUSE>我会让人送一张签名照过去的
<24-16,HOUSE>I'll have my guy send overa signed glossy.

429
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,450
<24-17,CAMERON>脑电图显示没有发作间尖峰 这不是腹型癫痫
<24-17,CAMERON>Continuous eeg shows no interictal spikes.It's not abdominal epilepsy.

430
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,240
<24-18,HOUSE>你呼叫我就是告诉我不是吗?
<24-18,HOUSE>You paged me to tell me what it's not?

431
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,390
<24-19,CAMERON>我呼叫你是让你看这个
<24-19,CAMERON>I paged you to show you this.

432
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,590
<24-20,HOUSE>这我倒没料到
<24-20,HOUSE>That I did not expect.

433
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,870
<24-21,ROY>那这究竟意味着什么?
<24-21,ROY>What the hell is that supposed to mean?

434
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,620
<24-22,HOUSE>可恶 我就知道我应该呆在外面
<24-22,HOUSE>Darn it.I knew I should have stayed outside.

435
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,610
<24-22,HOUSE>幻想总比现实好
<24-22,HOUSE>Fantasy's always much better than the reality.

436
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,720
<24-23,ROY>你觉得这是开玩笑的吗?
<24-23,ROY>You think this is a joke?

437
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,240
<24-23,ROY>那是我儿子 他快死了 你们没一个有一点头绪
<24-23,ROY>That's my son,he's dying,and not one of you seem to have the slightest clue hwy.

438
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,240
<24-24,HOUSE>是的
<24-24,HOUSE>I know.

439
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,600
<24-24,HOUSE>这就是为什么它这么有趣
<24-24,HOUSE>That's why it's so interesting.

440
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:55,890
<25-1,HOUSE>发烧 胃痛 痉挛 腹膜和硬膜下积水 现在又是斑点
<25-1,HOUSE>Fever,stomach pain,seizures,peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spots.

441
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,110
<25-2,FOREMAN>可能是对某种药的过敏反应
<25-2,FOREMAN>Could be an allergic reaction to one of his meds.

442
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,000
<25-3,HOUSE>在他用药以后8小时突然发作吗?
<25-3,HOUSE>That suddenly developed eight hours after he started the meds?

443
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,360
<25-4,CAMERON>如果不是癌症 感染 那一定是自体免疫病
<25-4,CAMERON>If it's not cancer infection,it has to be autoimmune.

444
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:08,320
<25-4,CAMERON>全身狼疮加上中枢神经系统血管炎 可以解释红疹 发烧 腹水--
<25-4,CAMERON>Systemic lupus complicated by a cns vasculitis would explain the rash,fever,ascites--

445
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,630
<25-5,HOUSE>中枢神经系统血管炎会出现斜颈 还会伴随头疼
<25-5,HOUSE>cns vasculitis would causea stiff neck along with a headache.

446
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,440
<25-6,FOREMAN>那应该在硬脑膜活检上看出来
<25-6,FOREMAN>And would've showed upon the dural biopsy.

447
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,250
<25-7,CHASE>结节性多动脉炎呢? 小孩子也可能患上
<25-7,CHASE>What about polyarteritisnodosa?It can occur in kids.

448
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,380
<25-8,FOREMAN>但多动脉炎不可能没有炎症
<25-8,FOREMAN>Except you can't have arteritis without inflammation.

449
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,640
<25-9,CHASE>好 你来想个更好的
<25-9,CHASE>Okay,you come up with something better.

450
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,510
<25-10,HOUSE>继续
<25-10,HOUSE>Go on.

451
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,540
<25-11,CHASE>皮肤活检结果有一些炎症 加上他的舒张压偏高
<25-11,CHASE>There was some inflammation in the skin biopsy,plus he's got elevated diastolic pressure.

452
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,840
<25-12,FOREMAN>只是有一点高 考虑到他目前的治疗状况 是完全可预见的
<25-12,FOREMAN>It's barely elevated,which you'd expect given the number of procedure she's undergone.

453
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,390
<25-13,CHASE>有一点总比没有一点强
<25-13,CHASE>Well,barely is more than not barely.

454
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,000
<25-14,HOUSE>不该我决定
<25-14,HOUSE>Not my decision.

455
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,270
<25-14,HOUSE>但如果该我的话 我会说给他用强的松 再做一个睾丸活检
<25-14,HOUSE>But if it was,I'd say start him on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy.

456
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
<25-14,HOUSE>如果他真的有炎症的话 应该在那里
<25-14,HOUSE>If he's gonna have any real inflammation,it'll be down there.

457
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,020
<25-15,FOREMAN>- Cameron和我会去做 - 为什么?
<25-15,FOREMAN>- Cameron and I will do it. - Why?

458
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,510
<25-16,CAMERON>那是Chase的主意
<25-16,CAMERON>It was chase's idea.

459
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,010
<25-17,FORMEAN>家属不会对第四组活检有什么好脸色 而你比较善于打圆场
<25-17,FORMEAN>Kid's father is not gonna be happy  about a fourth set of biopsies,and you've got a better rapport.

460
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,360
<25-17,FORMEAN>实际上是怎么回事?
<25-17,FORMEAN>What's reallygoing on here?

461
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,780
<25-18,CAMERON>你要Chase帮你准备 M&M例会吗?
<25-18,CAMERON>You need chase to help youover-prep for the m and m?

462
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,220
<25-20,CAMERON>- 是的 - 那你就说出来 别像个孩子似的
<25-20,CAMERON>- Yes. - Then say so.Don't be a child.

463
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,320
<25-21,HOUSE>孩子的红疹在他的阴茎上也有吗?
<25-21,HOUSE>Is it on his penis kid's rash?

464
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,700
<25-22,CAMERON>是的 怎么了?
<25-22,CAMERON>Yeah,why?

465
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,000
<25-23,HOUSE>那就不太可能影响到小血管
<25-23,HOUSE>Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels.

466
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,440
<25-23,HOUSE>所以我们在所有活检上都没发现炎症
<25-23,HOUSE>That's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies.

467
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,050
<25-23,HOUSE>这不是多动脉炎
<25-23,HOUSE>It's not polyarteritis.

468
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,700
<25-23,HOUSE>是恶性萎缩性丘疹病
<25-23,HOUSE>It's degos disease.

469
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,630
<25-23,HOUSE>我去吧
<25-23,HOUSE>I'll do it.

470
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,270
<26-1,HOUSE>你儿子得的是恶性萎缩性丘疹病
<26-1,HOUSE>Your son has degos disease.

471
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:04,470
<26-1,HOUSE>导致脑内微型血管 皮肤 胃肠道损坏 出血
<26-1,HOUSE>Causes microblood vessels  in the brain,skin,gi tract to break down,ffclot o.

472
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,110
<26-1,HOUSE>有时会在早期在阴茎上出现萎缩性丘疹
<26-1,HOUSE>It sometimes manifests early on with atrophic papuleson the penis.

473
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:16,500
<26-1,HOUSE>但你儿子的病 不知道为何 丘疹出现得晚很多
<26-1,HOUSE>In your son's case,we don't know why,but they came much later.

474
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,950
<26-2,ROY>怎样治疗呢?
<26-2,ROY>What's the treatment?

475
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,340
<26-3,HOUSE>没有治疗方法
<26-3,HOUSE>There isn't one.

476
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,700
<26-3,HOUSE>无药可治
<26-3,HOUSE>It's incurable.

477
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,190
<26-4,ROY>你错了
<26-4,ROY>You're wrong.

478
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,360
<26-4,ROY>你已经错了很多次
<26-4,ROY>You've already been wrong a bunch of times.

479
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,340
<26-5,HOUSE>我们复查了活检 绝对是恶性萎缩性丘疹病
<26-5,HOUSE>We've rechecked the biopsies.It's definitely degos.

480
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,610
<26-5,HOUSE>我很遗憾 但愿有什么我们能做的
<26-5,HOUSE>I'm sorry.I wish there was something we could do.

<26-6,ROY>还有多久?
<26-6,ROY>How long?

482
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,960

<26-7,HOUSE>Not much longer.

483
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,030
<26-8,ROY>那是什么意思?
<26-8,ROY>What does that mean?

484

<26-9,HOUSE>Day at the most.

<27-2,CHASE>We need to talk.

487
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,150
<27-3,CUDDY>除非是生死攸关 要不然就得等等
<27-3,CUDDY>Unless it's life odeath,it's gonna have to wait.

<27-6,CHASE>- Well,let me rephrase.Unless it's a current life-- foreman can't present the case at the m and M.

490

<27-7,CUDDY>我知道你们很忙 但他得克服 抽出时间
<27-7,CUDDY>I know you guys are busy,but he's just gonna have to suck it up and make the time.

491
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,010
<27-9,CUDDY>- 不是时间的问题 - 那是什么?
<27-9,CUDDY>- It's not the time. - Then what is it?

492

<28-5,OLIVER>Roy,he's right.You're borrowing money to buy options  that are already out of the money.

<28-5,OLIVER>Even you won't be ableto cover the losses.

<29-5,THIRTEEN>Mine and yours.

543
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,630
<29-6,WILSON>- 很显然House觉得他需要你比... - 我早就问过House了
<29-6,WILSON>- Obviously house decided he needs you more than he's-- I already asked house.

544
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,580
<29-8,WILSON>那他就从来不撒谎
<29-8,WILSON>And he'd certainly never lie.

545
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,050
<29-9,THIRTEEN>不是 他会撒谎 除非他想叫我走
<29-9,THIRTEEN>No,he'd lie.Except he wants me gone.

546
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,560
<29-9,THIRTEEN>而且他的撒谎技术比你高明多了
<29-9,THIRTEEN>And he do a lot better job of lying than you just did.

547
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,290
<29-10,WILSON>真的? 这么明显吗?
<29-10,WILSON>Really?It was that bad?

548
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,830
<29-11,THIRTEEN>其实还可以
<29-11,THIRTEEN>No,actually.

549
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,970
<29-11,THIRTEEN>但是这已经无关紧要了
<29-11,THIRTEEN>But it doesn't matter anymore.

550
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,050
<29-11,THIRTEEN>为什么这么做? 是因为House还是Foreman?
<29-11,THIRTEEN>Why?Beuse of house or foreman?

551
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,390
<29-12,WILSON>你对他们都很重要 只是Foreman不是我最好的朋友
<29-12,WILSON>You're good for both of them,but foreman's not my best friend.

552
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,560
<29-13,THIRTEEN>House不会有事的
<29-13,THIRTEEN>House will be fine.

553
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,070
<29-13,THIRTEEN>可能是
<29-13,THIRTEEN>Maybe.

554
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,230
<29-14,WILSON>但是你在组里 他会更好
<29-14,WILSON>But with you on the team,he'd be better.

555
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,810
<29-14,WILSON>他需要一个...并不需要他的人在身边
<29-14,WILSON>He needs someone... who doesn't need him.

556
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,610
<29-14,WILSON>你是唯一个没有被卷入 变态的House旋涡的人
<29-14,WILSON>You're the only one he's never reallybeen able to suck into his crazy house vortex.

557
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,560
<29-14,WILSON>让他知道点分寸 他能自我反省
<29-14,WILSON>Keeps him grounded.His ego in check.

558
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,370
<29-15,THIRTEEN>那你为什么不直接来找我?
<29-15,THIRTEEN>Why didn't you justcome to me?

559
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,710
<29-16,WILSON>我觉得只有House来挽留你才会留下 我知道他到最后是会的
<29-16,WILSON>I figured you'd only stayif house asked and I knewhe would eventually.

560
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,930
<29-17,THIRTEEN>再见 Wilson

<29-18,WILSON>This is a great job.

562
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:37,310
<29-18,WILSON>可能现在更好了 因为House至少 试着认真与人交往
<29-18,WILSON>Maybe even better now that house is at least trying to have real relationshipswith people.

563
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,830
<29-18,WILSON>我是说"试着"
<29-18,WILSON>I said,"trying.

564
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,980

572
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,420
<30-5,WILSON>你想让她留下是因为你要她回来 还是Foreman要她回来?
<30-5,WILSON>You want her to stay becauseyou want her back or because foreman does?

573
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,620
<30-6,HOUSE>我何必关心Foreman要什么?
<30-6,HOUSE>Why would I carewhat foreman wants?
