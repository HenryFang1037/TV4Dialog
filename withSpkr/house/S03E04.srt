<1-3,Dominic>Adam 看我

<1-3,Dominic>Show me what you wantfor lunch.

12
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,250
<2-1,Dominic>还是只顾画线 不看卡片
<2-1,Dominic>Still drawing those linesinstead of looking at the cards.

13
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,160
<2-2,Sarah>还要橙汁吗?
<2-2,Sarah>more juice?

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,500
<2-3,Dominic>如果他想喝橙汁 得说出来
<2-3,Dominic>If he wants more juice,he has to ask for it.

17
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,300
<2-4,Sarah>他累了 Dom
<2-4,Sarah>he's tired,dom.

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,000
<2-5,Dominic>遵守时间表的话 本来不会
<2-5,Dominic>Wouldn't be if westuck to the schedule.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,550
<2-5,Dominic>指出橙汁 孩子
<2-5,Dominic>Show me the juice,buddy.

20
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,380
<2-6,Sarah>越来越没效果
<2-6,Sarah>I think we've reached the point of diminishing returns.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,880
<2-7,Dominic>他必须学会提要求
<2-7,Dominic>He has to ask for it.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,270
<2-7,Dominic>Adam.
<2-7,Dominic>Adam

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,570
<2-8,Sarah>他呛到了
<2-8,Sarah>He's choking.

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,400
<2-9,Dominic>不可能吧 只是汉堡奶酪
<2-9,Dominic>That's impossible.It's mac and cheese.

<3-1,House>10岁的男孩 不明原因死命尖叫
<3-1,House>ten-year-old boy,scscreams for hilife for no reason.

27
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,340
<3-2,Foreman>孤独症
<3-2,Foreman>He's autistic.

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,930
<3-2,Foreman>严重的孤独症
<3-2,Foreman>Severely autistic.

29
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,170
<3-2,Foreman>不说话 不作眼神交流
<3-2,Foreman>Can't talk,can't make eye contact.

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,510
<3-2,Foreman>尖叫也许是他与人交流的方式
<3-2,Foreman>Screaming's probably his way of communicating.

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,900
<3-3,House>看过的三个医生都那么说
<3-3,House>And he went to three different doctors who all said just that.

32
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,150
<3-4,Foreman>明显不是这次病发原因
<3-4,Foreman>Well,so clearly,that can't be the answer.

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,580
<3-4,Foreman>他的大脑不能过滤信息
<3-4,Foreman>His brain can't filter information.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
<3-4,Foreman>对他感官持续攻击
<3-4,Foreman>It's a constant assault on his senses.

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,090
<3-4,Foreman>要是我也会尖叫
<3-4,Foreman>I'd scream too.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,590
<3-5,House>或许有医学方面的解释 比如感觉迟钝
<3-5,House>Or it's something medical sounding,like dysesthesia.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,270
<3-5,House>家长确信儿子出了问题
<3-5,House>Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son.

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,080
<3-6,Cameron>什么时候开始相信家长了
<3-6,Cameron>Since when did we start believing parents?

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,860
<3-6,Cameron>相信任何人?
<3-6,Cameron>Or anyone?

40
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,180
<3-6,Cameron>我们去哪?
<3-6,Cameron>Where are we going?

41
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,940
<3-7,House>搭电梯
<3-7,House>Elevator.

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,520
<3-7,House>爸爸以前在华尔街工作,妈妈是会计师事务所的合伙人
<3-7,House>Dad was on wall street,mom was a partner in an accounting firm.

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,930
<3-7,House>当孩子确诊孤独症后 就都辞职了
<3-7,House>When their son was diagnosed with autism,they both quit.

44
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,520
<3-8,Foreman>他们过度保护这孩子 所以害怕
<3-8,Foreman>So they're overprotective and scared.

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,070
<3-8,Foreman>- 有理由排除,- 他们研究这孩子
<3-8,Foreman>That's all the more reason to discount-- they study this kid.

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,090
<3-9,House>听过他尖叫无数次
<3-9,House>Heard him scream a million times.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,170
<3-9,House>十年来的看护 第一次带他来医院
<3-9,House>But in ten years of caring for him,this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.

48
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,530
<3-10,Foreman>急诊室查过咽喉 没有阻塞 正常
<3-10,Foreman>E.R.Checked his throat. No obstructions,nothing.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
<3-10,Foreman>意味着症状只有尖叫 无助于诊断
<3-10,Foreman>Which means the only symptom was a scream,which is diagnostic of nothing.

50
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,930
<3-11,Chase>孩子紧抓胸部 血压也上升
<3-11,Chase>Kid clutched his chest,B.P.Was elevated.

51
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,990
<3-11,Chase>也许是胸痛
<3-11,Chase>Maybe there was chest pain.

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,930
<3-12,Foreman>心脏检查显示正常
<3-12,Foreman>E.R.Said the heart was fine.

53
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,580
<3-13,House>别这么快忽略疼痛
<3-13,House>Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.

54
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,530
<3-14,Cameron>到底去哪?
<3-14,Cameron>Where are we going?

55
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,860
<3-15,House>下去

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,400
<3-16,Cameron>就因为他尖叫?
<3-16,Cameron>Because he screamed?

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,460
<3-17,Chase>可能是环境应激反应
<3-17,Chase>could also be an environmental reaction.

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,320
<3-17,Chase>过敏症

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,880
<3-18,House>- 毒素 吃了什么...,- 去他家 做肺通气扫描
<3-18,House>A toxin,or something he ate-- check the house and run a lung ventilation scan.

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,410
<3-18,House>肺也在胸腔里 对吧?
<3-18,House>Lungs are in the chest too,right?

65
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,340
<3-19,Foreman>我昨晚跟人约会
<3-19,Foreman>I had a date last night.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,990
<3-19,Foreman>那女的尖叫
<3-19,Foreman>She screamed.

67
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,880
<3-19,Foreman>也要花十万给她检查?
<3-19,Foreman>Should we spend $100,000 testing her?

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,720
<3-20,House>当然不用
<3-20,House>Of course not.

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,580
<3-20,House>这里又不是动物医院
<3-20,House>This isn't a veterinary hospital.

70
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,790

71
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,790
<3-20,House>- 如果觉得这孩子不值得救,- 不是这个意思
<3-20,House>Look,if you don't think this kid is worth saving-- that's not what I'm saying.

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
<3-22,House>那可糟了
<3-22,House>Well,it's too bad.

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,520
<3-22,House>本是个好观点
<3-22,House>It's a good point.

74
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,670
<3-22,House>小孩不过是扁桃腺肿
<3-22,House>Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

<3-28,Cuddy>不管多愚蠢的事 你说 我就得做吗?
<3-28,Cuddy>You think you can get me to do anything you want,regardless of how stupid it is?

<3-28,Cuddy>It's where I work.Where I think.

90
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,190
<3-27,House>救人的地方 你才能向有钱人吹嘘,好投资买MRI或低胸上衣
<3-27,House>Where I save lives,allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on mris and low-cut tops.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,780
<3-27,House>我要原来的地毯

166
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,810
<10-18,House>没法用了
<10-18,House>It's unusable.

167
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,370
<10-18,House>问题不在肺
<10-18,House>So whatever is bothering him,it wasn't his lungs.

168
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,300
<10-18,House>房子怎么样?
<10-18,House>What about the kid's house?

<10-21,House>那个已经讨论过了
<10-21,House>We already had that discussion.

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,500
<10-23,House>不 Cuddy说我得在这儿工作
<10-23,House>No,cuddy saysI have to work here.

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,610
<10-24,Cuddy>不 我说的是 你要么在办公室工作,要么在这工作
<10-24,Cuddy>No,I said you can workin your office or you had to work here.

<10-25,House>由于我不能在办公室工作...
<10-25,House>And since I can't workin my office...

<10-26,Cuddy>这就是你的高明规划吗?
<10-26,Cuddy>is this your master plan?

<10-26,Cuddy>让医院陷入混乱 直到我更换你的地毯?
<10-26,Cuddy>Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?

179
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,170
<10-27,House>迂回
<10-27,House>Devious.

180
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,050
<10-27,House>从James Bond(007)的电影里学来的
<10-27,House>Saw it in a james bond movie.

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,360
<10-27,House>粪便涂片!

<10-31,House>Fecal matter.

186
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,510
<10-31,House>有样本看吗?
<10-31,House>Is there a samplewe can look at?

187
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,870
<10-32,Foreman>父母有涂片样本
<10-32,Foreman>Parents have the smear kit.

188
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,300
<10-32,Foreman>孩子便秘
<10-32,Foreman>The kid is constipated.

189
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,290
<10-33,Cuddy>你尽兴吧
<10-33,Cuddy>Do what you want.

190
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,610
<10-33,Cuddy>就是不换地毯
<10-33,Cuddy>Not replacing your carpet.

191
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,760
<10-34,House>抬起屁股 做涂片
<10-34,House>Go up his rear and get a smear.

192
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,470
<10-34,House>让我想吃面包圈了
<10-34,House>Which reminds me,I kinda feel like a bagel.

193
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,900
<10-35,Cameron>地毯
<10-35,Cameron>Carpets.

194
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,820
<11-1,Foreman>需要粪便样本
<11-1,Foreman>We need a stool sample.

195
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,590
<11-1,Foreman>最好等他玩完那关 是不是?
<11-1,Foreman>We should probably waituntil he's finished playing that level,huh?

196
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,780
<11-2,Sarah>说真的 他今天好些了
<11-2,Sarah>I actually thinkhe's a bit better today.

197
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,420
<11-2,Sarah>恢复老样子
<11-2,Sarah>He seems more like his old self.

198
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,490
<11-3,Foreman>有可能根本没生病
<11-3,Foreman>It is possiblethat he was never sick.

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,680
<11-4,Dominic>我们可能反应过度了
<11-4,Dominic>I guess we,uh,could've overreacted.

200
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,710
<11-7,House>孩子的肺衬为什么充满积液?
<11-7,House>so what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?

201
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,580
<11-8,Cameron>我们为什么在这里?
<11-8,Cameron>Why are we in here?

202
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,650
<11-8,Cameron>某种高压攻势么?
<11-8,Cameron>Is this some sortof power play?

203
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,520
<11-8,Cameron>是
<11-8,Cameron>Yeah.

204
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,680
<11-9,House>你手指戳孩子屁股 他就胸腔积液
<11-9,House>So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave hima pleural effusion.

205
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,820
<11-9,House>指甲该剪了吧?
<11-9,House>You ever consideredgetting a manicure?

206
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,120
<11-10,Foreman>我在他肺部衰竭后 才取大便样
<11-10,Foreman>I took the stool sampleafter his lungs failed.

207
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,850
<11-11,Cameron>你真对地毯有意见?
<11-11,Cameron>Or do you really havea problem with the carpeting?

208
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,920
<11-12,House>- 改变让你抓狂,- 说了是高压攻势
<11-12,House>Change sets you off-- I said it was a power play.

209
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,850
<11-12,House>同意了选项A 就别考虑选项B
<11-12,House>Someone answers "yes"to option a,you don't move on to option B.

210
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,430
<11-13,Chase>胸腔积液 得检查心脏是否衰竭
<11-13,Chase>If there's a pleural effusion,we have to rule out heart failure.

211
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,190
<11-14,Cameron>为什么现在?
<11-14,Cameron>Why now?

212
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,780
<11-14,Cameron>为什么现在用高压攻势?
<11-14,Cameron>Why a power play now?

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,630
<11-15,House>我嗅到了软弱的气味
<11-15,House>I smelled weakness.

<11-15,House>给孩子做一个心回波图
<11-15,House>Get the kidan echocardiogram.

215
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,760
<11-16,Wilson>有...意思
<11-16,Wilson>That'S...funny.

216
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,100
<11-16,Wilson>写着"james wilson" 诡异的错误
<11-16,Wilson>It says "james wilson." A strange typo.

217
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,340
<11-17,House>如果积液是渗出液 用广谱抗生素
<11-17,House>If the fluid comes back an exudate,get him on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

218
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,250
<11-18,Wilson>谢谢光临
<11-18,Wilson>Thank you for coming.

219
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,620

<11-19,Cameron>No problem.

220
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,730
<11-20,House>还以为你不介意 借用办公室一会儿
<11-20,House>Thought you wouldn't mindsharing offices for a while.

<11-21,Wilson>You share stories,feelings...

222
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,030
<11-21,Wilson>玩具
<11-21,Wilson>toys.

223
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,750
<11-21,Wilson>却不能分享办公室
<11-21,Wilson>You don't share offices.

224
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,250
<11-22,House>这可不太有慧根
<11-22,House>That is so not zen.

225
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,620
<11-23,Wilson>这是礼物
<11-23,Wilson>It was a gift.

<11-25,Wilson>You couldn't make cuddy miserable,so you're gonnamake me miserable so I canmake cuddy miserable on your behalf?

229
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,530
<11-26,House>对
<11-26,House>Yeah.

230
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,580
<11-27,Wilson>为什么觉得我能让她痛苦?
<11-27,Wilson>What makes you think I can make her miserable?

231
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,780
<11-28,House>你擅长这套
<11-28,House>Because you're goodat that stuff.

244
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,110
<12-4,Foreman>有问题
<12-4,Foreman>No.

245
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,820
<12-5,Foreman>超声波显示传导异常
<12-5,Foreman>Echo suggesteda conduction abnormality.

246
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,330
<12-5,Foreman>心电图也证实了
<12-5,Foreman>Ekg confirmed it.

247
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,590
<12-6,Chase>还是解释不了渗出
<12-6,Chase>Still doesn't explainthe effusion.

248
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,690
<12-6,Chase>胸腔积液是渗出液
<12-6,Chase>The pleural fluidwas an exudate.

249
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,740
<12-6,Chase>该寻找能同时解释心脏和肺衰竭的病因
<12-6,Chase>We should be looking for something that explains both the heartand lung problems.

250
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,080
<12-6,Chase>感染 寄生虫 癌症
<12-6,Chase>Infection,parasite,cancer.

251

<12-7,Foreman>微生物检测积液中无有机生物,不是感染
<12-7,Foreman>Microbiology showedno organisms in the fluid,so forget infection.

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,190
<11-14,Cameron>这不是高压攻势
<11-14,Cameron>It's not a power play.

<12-8,Cameron>在门诊部会诊还讲得通
<12-8,Cameron>Doing a differential in the clinic makes sense.

256
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,200
<12-8,Cameron>间接起作用
<12-8,Cameron>Works indirectly.

257
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,690
<12-8,Cameron>但现在 我们在会议室
<12-8,Cameron>But now,we are in office space.

258
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,470
<12-8,Cameron>因为你不想呆在自己的办公室
<12-8,Cameron>Because you don't want to be in your own office.

259
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,060
<12-8,Cameron>就是说这和cuddy没关系
<12-8,Cameron>Which means this has nothingto do with cuddy.

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,360
<12-8,Cameron>你真的迷恋你的地毯
<12-8,Cameron>You really are obsessedwith your carpets.

<12-64,House>And everyone insidethe circle is normal.

356
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:26,070
<12-64,House>圈子外的人应该被打击 摧毁 重整,再纳入圈子
<12-64,House>Everyone outside the circle should be beaten,broken,and reset so they can be broughtinto the circle.

357
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,600
<12-64,House>万一失败 就等着送进收容院吧
<12-64,House>Failing that,they should be institutionalized.

358
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,250
<12-64,House>或者更糟 被怜悯
<12-64,House>Or worse,pitied.

359
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,460
<12-65,Cameron>照你说 为那男孩感到难过 是错的?
<12-65,Cameron>So it's wrong to feel sorryfor this little boy?

360
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,670
<12-66,House>为什么要感到难过,他能选择逃离荒唐的繁文缛节
<12-66,House>Why would you feel sorryfor someone who gets to opt out ofthe inane courteous formalities

361
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,370
<12-66,House>虚假且毫无意义的 这令人羞耻么?
<12-66,House>which are utterly meaningless,insincere,and therefore degrading?

<12-66,House>这孩子无需假装关心你的背痛 屎尿,或者你祖母哪里痒痒
<12-66,House>This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain,or your excretions,or your grandma'sitchy place.

<12-67,Wilson>Uh,no cancer.

367
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,060
<12-67,Wilson>因为...
<12-67,Wilson>Because...

368
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,890
<12-67,Wilson>这些不是淋巴细胞
<12-67,Wilson>These aren'tlymph cells.

369
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,600
<12-68,Cameron>那是什么?
<12-68,Cameron>Then what are they?

370
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
<12-69,Wilson>肝细胞

<12-70,House>好奇肝的原位置有什么?
<12-70,House>Wonder what he's got wherehis liver's supposed to be.

<13-1,House>Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?

<13-2,House>就当成自己家
<13-2,House>Make yourself at home.

375
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,930
<13-2,House>也许格氏解剖学完全搞错了?
<13-2,House>So,you think maybe gray's anatomy got it all wrong?

376
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,590
<13-3,Foreman>淋巴液循环 并不转移器官细胞
<13-3,Foreman>Lymph system circulates fluid,not organ cells.

<13-4,Cameron>癌细胞总是可以强行进入淋巴系统
<13-4,Cameron>Cancer cells break into thelymphatic system all the time.

378
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,530
<13-5,Chase>不是讨论癌细胞
<13-5,Chase>But we're not talkingabout cancer cells.

379
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,120
<13-6,House>癌细胞和肝细胞有什么不同?
<13-6,House>What's the difference between cancer cellsand liver cells?

<13-6,House>为什么一个可以通过内壁 另一个却不能?
<13-6,House>Why can one pass through walls but the other can't?

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,270
<13-7,Cameron>癌细胞是受损坏的
<13-7,Cameron>Cancer cells are damaged.

383
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,560
<13-7,Cameron>去任何要去的地方
<13-7,Cameron>Go wherever they want.

384
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,050
<13-8,House>- 如果肝细胞被破坏,- 肝脏没被破坏
<13-8,House>So if the liver cellsare damaged-- liver isn't damaged.

385
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,260
<13-9,Foreman>测试显示正常
<13-9,Foreman>The tests were normal.

386
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,650
<13-10,House>如果肝细胞被破坏,理论上就有可能穿越进入淋巴系统
<13-10,House>So if the liver cellsare damaged,it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system.

387
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,770
<13-10,House>肝脏衰竭可以解释胸膜积液,甚至心脏的问题
<13-10,House>Liver failure could also explainpleural effusion,even the heart issues.

388
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,970
<13-10,House>肝细胞完好
<13-10,House>Liver cells are fine.

389
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,590
<13-11,Cameron>他对甲型和乙型肝炎免疫,这小孩难道有无保护性行为或共用针头?
<13-11,Cameron>He was immunizedfor hep a and b,and do you really thinkthis kid is having unprotected sexor sharing needles?

<13-12,House>So it's not viral.

392
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,960
<13-12,House>就只剩下酒精肝硬化
<13-12,House>That just leaves"lotta-booze-irrhosis.

393
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,960

<13-15,House>肝硬化可解释症状
<13-15,House>Cirrhosis explainsthe symptoms.

396

<13-16,Cameron>- 心脏  肺,-  字典里查"肝硬化"
<13-16,Cameron>Heart problems,lungs-- look up "cirrhosis"in the dictionary.

397
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,140
<13-16,Cameron>有疤痕的意思
<13-16,Cameron>It means "scarring.

398
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,590
<13-17,Chase>父母没干孩子 或对他下毒
<13-17,Chase>" Parents aren't doingor dosing this kid.

410
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,860

424
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,220
<14-1,Wilson>禁制令是不是过头了?
<14-1,Wilson>Don't you think the restrainingorder's a little much?

425
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,060
<14-1,Wilson>他又不是真要和17岁病人发生关系
<14-1,Wilson>He's not actuallygoing to have sex with a 17-year-old patient.

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,330
<16-54,Chase>不能调和
<16-54,Chase>The two don't mix.

576
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,710
<16-54,Chase>得先确认他的病因
<16-54,Chase>We'd better make sure that's what he's got.

577
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,750
<16-55,Foreman>从帕特森的实验室运血清过来,至少要3天
<16-55,Foreman>Serum from the lab in paterson is three days,minimum.

578
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,940
<16-56,Chase>他坚持不了三天
<16-56,Chase>He won't survive three days.

579
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,610
<16-57,House>他几点起床?
<16-57,House>What time does he wake up?

580
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,420
<16-57,House>上午7:35
<16-57,House>7:35 am.

581
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,450
<16-58,Cameron>然后呢?
<16-58,Cameron>Then what?

582
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,360
<16-59,House>一一说来
<16-59,House>Walk me through it.

583
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,470
<16-60,Cameron>7:40到7:50 去了洗手间洗脸
<16-60,Cameron>7:40 to 7:50,he goes tothe toilet,washes his face.

584
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,330
<16-60,Cameron>有必要吗?
<16-60,Cameron>What does this matter?

585
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,680
<16-61,House>我要证明他吃了植物
<16-61,House>I'm trying to provehe ate the plant.

586
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,780
<16-62,Foreman>他的日程和曼陀罗无关
<16-62,Foreman>His schedule has nothingto do with jimsonweed.

587
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,880
<16-63,House>有两种可能性 要么,他父母看着他吃下植物
<16-63,House>There are two possibilities--either the parents saw him eat the plant,

588
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,020
<16-63,House>要么在没人看顾时 不玩积木 吃了植物
<16-63,House>or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants insteadof playing with blocks.

589
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,210
<16-64,Chase>就算找出15分钟的户外自由活动,也证明不了他吃草
<16-64,Chase>Even if you find 15 minutesof free time outside,doesn't mean he spent iteating a bush.

590
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,170
<16-65,House>该怎么办?
<16-65,House>So what do we do?

591
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,980
<16-65,House>什么也不做?
<16-65,House>Nothing?

592
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,240
<16-65,House>等孩子告诉我们?
<16-65,House>Wait for the kidto tell us?

593
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,740
<17-55,Ali>说呀

594
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,490
<16-66,Cameron>你干什么?
<16-66,Cameron>Where are you going?

595
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,410
<16-67,House>跟他谈谈
<16-67,House>To talk to him.

596
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,140
<17-1,House>见过你孩子吃植物吗?
<17-1,House>Ever see your son eat a bush?

<17-4,House>I need you to show mewhat you ate.

602
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,400
<17-5,Dominic>他没法回答你
<17-5,Dominic>He can't answer you.

603
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,990
<17-6,House>你也不行

610
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,370
<17-7,Dominic>他不知道你想要什么
<17-7,Dominic>He doesn't know what you want.

611
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,140
<17-8,House>Adam 你必须告诉我
<17-8,House>Adam,you have to tell me.

612

<17-15,House>被赐予了新的症状 一个奇迹
<17-15,House>We have been blessed with the miracleof a new symptom.

626
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,330
<17-15,House>兄弟 能否查出可怜孩子的眼球为何回滚?
<17-15,House>Brother,can you testifyas to why this poor child's eyeball rolled back into his head?

627
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,090
<17-16,Chase>和曼陀罗的毒性一致 眼球麻痹
<17-16,Chase>It's consistent with jimsonweedpoisoning--ocular paralysis.

628
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,690
<17-16,Chase>对不起
<17-16,Chase>Sorry.

629

<17-17,House>邪恶欺骗汝等 他们背弃了上帝 愚蠢啊
<17-17,House>The wicked shall deceive ye,because they have turned from the lord and are idiots.

630
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,010
<17-17,House>眼肌不是麻痹了,而是在作皮鲁埃特旋转
<17-17,House>His ocular muscle didn't paralyze,it pirouetted.

631
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,830
<17-17,House>多发性硬化症
<17-17,House>M.S.

632
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,990
<17-19,House>睿智之人更易进入天堂
<17-19,House>It is easier for a wise man to gain access to heaven

633
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,540
<17-20,Cameron>能不能停下? 直说不是多发性硬化症好了
<17-20,Cameron>will you stop doing that?Just say "not M.S.

634
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,480
<17-21,Chase>中风
<17-21,Chase>a stroke.

635
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,700
<17-21,Chase>颅内出血
<17-21,Chase>Bleed in the brain.

636
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,070
<17-22,House>除了单眼位移 还会看到别的症状
<17-22,House>We'd be seeingother symptoms besides a single eye misalignment.

637
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,740
<17-22,House>比如昏迷
<17-22,House>Like a coma.

638
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,110
<17-22,House>已经查证过了
<17-22,House>And you've already testified.

639
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,550
<17-23,Foreman>是肿瘤
<17-23,Foreman>it's a tumor.

640
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,710
<17-24,Cameron>所有的成像都没显示出来?
<17-24,Cameron>And all the imagingjust missed it?

641
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,260
<17-23,Foreman>微瘤
<17-23,Foreman>It's a microtumor.

642
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,560
<17-25,Foreman>原发于肺 导致胸腔积液
<17-25,Foreman>Started in his lung,which caused the pleural effusion.

643
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,640
<17-25,Foreman>然后转至肝 使肝细胞脱落
<17-25,Foreman>Then it metastasizedto his liver,which made it slough cells.

644
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,060
<17-25,Foreman>再到大脑 眼球的后方,导致眼球回滚
<17-25,Foreman>And then went to his brain,behind the eye,which caused it to roll back into his head.

645
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,620
<17-26,House>这么说他有三个肿瘤 全漏诊了
<17-26,House>So he has three tumorsand we missed all of them.

646
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,920
<17-26,House>奇迹的反面是什么?
<17-26,House>What's the opposite of a miracle?

647
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,770
<17-27,Foreman>知道从哪里下手 找起来希望就大了
<17-27,Foreman>I have a better chanceof finding it now that I knowexactly where to look.

648
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,130
<17-27,Foreman>那么...
<17-27,Foreman>So...

649
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,340
<17-27,Foreman>除非有更好的主意 我要给他大脑做CT了
<17-27,Foreman>unless you have a better idea,I'm gonna go ct his head.

650
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,940
<17-27,Foreman>然后 如果--有必要 我会移除他的眼球
<17-27,Foreman>And then,if--if I have to,remove his eye.

651
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:15,710
<17-28,House>把这孩子的眼球摘除 ,少了眼神接触 孩子情况更糟
<17-28,House>You remove this kid's eye,he's only gonna behalf as good at not making eye contact.

652
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,950
