77
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,250
<5-13,Cuddy >但不管我们打算接下来干嘛
<5-13,Cuddy >But whatever "Now what" we do decide on...

78

<5-13,Cuddy >你都得先去洗个澡

85
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,340
<6-3,Taub >他来了就见鬼了
<6-3,Taub >I'd be worried if he was here.

<6-3,Taub >25岁
<6-3,Taub >"25-year-old"--

87
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,180
<6-4,Foreman >昨天他的病人死后

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,490
<6-6,Foreman >你没看到他昨天的样子
<6-6,Foreman >You didn't see him.

92
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,630
<6-7,Thirteen >我们现在能做的
<6-7,Thirteen >Best thing we can do for him now

93
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,920
<6-7,Thirteen >也就是给他找个新病例来玩玩
<6-7,Thirteen >is find him a new puzzle to solve.

94
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,060
<6-8,Taub >所以  咱们继续讨论我的25岁

<6-10,Thirteen >I haven't found the right one yet.

98
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,370
<6-11,Chase >估计是因为

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,930
<6-11,Chase >你在忙着申请假期
<6-11,Chase >You were asking for a leave of absence

100
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,920
<6-11,Chase >根本没空去好好看看病例吧
<6-11,Chase >and wouldn't have time to see a case through.

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,900
<6-12,Taub >我可什么都没说
<6-12,Taub >I didn't say anything.

102
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,260
<6-13,Chase >他确实没说  我在豪斯的桌上看到个信封
<6-13,Chase >He didn't...I saw an envelope on house's desk

106
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,190
<6-14,Foreman >你拿蒸汽是不想被人发现么
<6-14,Foreman >You steam an envelope to keep it secret.

107
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,940
<6-15,Foreman >所以我直接撕开看的
<6-15,Foreman >Which is why I just ripped it.

108
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,340
<6-15,Foreman >你能告诉我们你要去哪吗
<6-15,Foreman >You gonna tell us where you're going?

109
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,370
<6-16,Thirteen >没这个打算

<7-1,Cuddy >Couldn't you have just put the mirror down nice and gentle?

112
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,630
<7-2,House >没那心情
<7-2,House >I was in a mood.

113
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,100
<7-3,Cuddy >我马上回来

<7-5,Cuddy >可能有重要的事
<7-5,Cuddy >It could be important.

116
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,170
<7-6,House >这才是重要的事
<7-6,House >This is important.

117
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,170
<7-6,House >现在  我俩的事

118
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,540
<7-6,House >比医院的那些破事重要多了
<7-6,House >than what's going on at the hospital.

119
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,410
<7-6,House >所以  我们都把手机关了

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,130
<12-11,House >好嘛  我说谎了
<12-11,House >Fine. I was lying.

261
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,330
<12-12,Cuddy >我的性交史非常无趣
<12-12,Cuddy >My sexual history is boring and predictable.

262
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,100
<12-12,Cuddy >-我的小动作是什么  -你开什么玩笑
<12-12,Cuddy >- What is my tell?  - Are you kidding?

263
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,860
<12-13,House >如果我告诉了你  你就会改掉它
<12-13,House >If I tell you your tell, you'll get rid of it,

264
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,260
<12-13,House >那我就没那么神了
<12-13,House >Then I won't be able to tell.

265
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,430
<12-14,Cuddy >那你也得告诉我
<12-14,Cuddy >Well, then you have to tell me something

266
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,630
<12-14,Cuddy >我所不了解的你
<12-14,Cuddy >I don't already know about you.

267
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,350
<12-15,House >尽管如此  技术上来说  你也没告诉我
<12-15,House >Even though, technically, you didn't tell me something

268
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,920
<12-15,House >我所不了解的你
<12-15,House >that I didn't already know about you.

269
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,200
<12-16,Cuddy >别再这么逻辑狂  就说些什么吧
<12-16,Cuddy >Quit being so damn logical and just tell me.

270
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,580
<12-17,House >我曾与相片中的你
<12-17,House >I used to have an intimate relationship

271
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,230
<12-17,House >有过一段亲密的感情
<12-17,House >with a photograph of you.

272
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,960
<12-17,House >实际上  还有一只袜子
<12-17,House >Well, actually, a sock and a photograph.

273
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,550
<12-18,Cuddy >我知道
<12-18,Cuddy >I know.

274
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,480
<12-19,House >我在说谎
<12-19,House >I was lying.

275
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,070
<12-20,Cuddy >在万圣节我打扮成睡美人时你拍的照片
<12-20,Cuddy >The photo you took of me as sleeping beauty on Halloween.

276
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,990
<12-20,Cuddy >不然你为什么要拍那张照片
<12-20,Cuddy >Why else would you take that picture?

277
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,780
<12-21,House >我要解个手
<12-21,House >I have to pee.

278
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,040
<12-21,House >你也学会了吧
<12-21,House >Ha! You can tell.

279
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,700
<12-21,House >实际上我想拉粑粑
<12-21,House >'cause actually, I have to poo.

280
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,840
<13-1,House >什么事
<13-1,House >What?

281
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,280
<13-2,Chase >卡迪的助理  决定开动自己的小脑筋解决问题
<13-2,Chase >Cuddy's assistant decided to use his own brain.

282
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,490
<13-2,Chase >谁给他灌输这愚蠢的主意的
<13-2,Chase >Who put that idiot idea into his head?

283
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,220
<13-3,House >你也可以听听这个意见啊
<13-3,House >Perhaps you could follow the same advice.

284
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,640
<13-4,Chase >他通知了公共卫生属
<13-4,Chase >He notified DPH that

285
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,840
<13-4,Chase >说这里没有在班的神经外科医生
<13-4,Chase >there's no neurosurgeon on the premises.

286
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,850
<13-4,Chase >他说法律规定他这么做  他也的确这么做了
<13-4,Chase >Said he legally had to, which he legally had to.

287
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,830
<13-5,House >听起来一切在你掌握之中啊
<13-5,House >Sounds like you got the situation under control.

288
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,020
<13-5,House >不  我没有
<13-5,House >No. I don't.

289
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,300
<13-6,Chase >你知道我没有
<13-6,Chase >You know I don't.

290
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,930
<13-6,Chase >等公共卫生属的人到这里  他们就会关了急诊室
<13-6,Chase >When DPH shows up, they're gonna shut down our E.R.

291
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,110
<13-6,Chase >根本没办法  就这样了  豪斯
<13-6,Chase >This can't be fixed. It is what it is, House.

292
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,490
<13-7,House >很好  我完全有理由相信
<13-7,House >Great. I've got every faith

293
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,630
<13-7,House >你有能力搞定这一切
<13-7,House >in your ability to solve the problem.

294
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,800
<14-1,Thirteen >我给45英里范围以内的
<14-1,Thirteen >I have called every neurosurgeon

295
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,930
<14-1,Thirteen >神经外科医生都打过电话了  一无所获
<14-1,Thirteen >within a 45-mile radius -- nothing.

296
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,270
<14-2,Chase >我觉得豪斯不过是在测试我们
<14-2,Chase >I think House is just testing us.

297
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,610
<14-3,Taub >他一直都在测试我们
<14-3,Taub >He's always testing us.

298
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,260
<14-4,Foreman >不管是不是测试  这是个问题
<14-4,Foreman >Test or not, it's a problem.

299
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,940
<14-5,Chase >这又不是我们的问题
<14-5,Chase >It's not our problem.

300
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,170
<14-5,Chase >这又怎么会是豪斯的问题
<14-5,Chase >Why the hell is it House's problem?

301
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,710
<14-5,Chase >卡迪到底在哪里
<14-5,Chase >Where the hell is Cuddy?

302
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,940
<14-6,Foreman >我们要么报告此事
<14-6,Foreman >We either report this,

303
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,660
<14-6,Foreman >然后半间医院歇业
<14-6,Foreman >and half the hospital gets shut down,

304
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,730
<14-6,Foreman >要么我们隐瞒此事  冒个险
<14-6,Foreman >or we cover it up and run the risk

305
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,840
<14-6,Foreman >运气不好的话整间医院都要歇业
<14-6,Foreman >that the entire hospital gets shut down.

306
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,480
<14-7,Thirteen >或者去找理查森
<14-7,Thirteen >Or we get Richardson.

307
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,450
<14-8,Foreman >他病了
<14-8,Foreman >He's sick.

308
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,070
<14-9,Thirteen >我们是医生  我们能让病人好起来
<14-9,Thirteen >And we're doctors. We get people better.

309
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,730
<14-10,Taub >石头剪刀布
<14-10,Taub >Fing fong fooey?

310
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,660
<15-1,Cuddy >能睁眼了吗
<15-1,Cuddy >Can I open them yet?

311
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,140
<15-2,House >再等一下
<15-2,House >Just a second.

312
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,590
<15-2,House >好了  把手伸出来
<15-2,House >Okay. Hold out your hand.

313
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,960
<15-4,House >我一直都想用这种东西
<15-4,House >I always wanted to open a bottle of champagne

314
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,460
<15-4,House >给香槟开瓶
<15-4,House >with one of these things.

315
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,640
<15-4,House >站我后面
<15-4,House >You might wanna stand behind me for this.

316
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,470
<15-4,House >准备好了
<15-4,House >Okay...

317
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,230
<15-5,House >这下好了
<15-5,House >Yeah!

318
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,320
<15-5,House >我想我大概
<15-5,House >Mm, I think I might have...

319
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,300
<15-5,House >哪里弄错了
<15-5,House >got that slightly wrong.

320
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,000
<15-5,House >好在我总算尝试过了
<15-5,House >Well, good thing I got a case.

321
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,680
<15-6,Wilson >豪斯  开门
<15-6,Wilson >House, open up.

322
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,910
<15-6,Wilson >我们得谈谈
<15-6,Wilson >We need to talk.

323
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,040
<15-7,Cuddy >让他进来吧
<15-7,Cuddy >Just let him in.

324

<15-8,House >不行
<15-8,House >No.

325
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,650
<15-9,Wilson >豪斯
<15-9,Wilson >House!

326
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,700
<15-10,House >如果我们不理他  他会走的
<15-10,House >If we just ignore him, he'll go away.

327
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,390
<15-10,House >豪斯
<15-10,House >House!

328
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,310
<16-1,House >我想他应该走了
<16-1,House >I think he finally left.

329
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,410
<16-1,House >以防万一他还没有离开
<16-1,House >But just in case he hasn't,

330
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,320
<16-1,House >我们能做些什么不用讲话的事呢
<16-1,House >what can we do that does not involve talking?

<17-1,Thirteen >听着  你是我们唯一的神经外科医生
<17-1,Thirteen >Look, you're the only neurosurgeon we've got.

357
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,260
<17-1,Thirteen >你得赶紧好起来  回医院去
<17-1,Thirteen >You have to suck it up and go back to the hospital.

358
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,700
<17-2,Chase >我们不用你做手术  回去就行
<17-2,Chase >We're not asking you to operate, just to be there.

359
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,660
<17-3,Richardson >除非你能给我搬上这个马桶
<17-3,Richardson >Unless you can transport this t-toilet with me,

360
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,640
<17-3,Richardson >否则我不出门

361
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,830
<17-4,Chase >我给你带个桶
<17-4,Chase >I'll get a bucket.

362
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,180
<17-5,Richardson >你不知道问题所在
<17-5,Richardson >You're missing the point.

363
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,160
<17-5,Richardson >我吃了次品寿司  病了  你们走吧
<17-5,Richardson >I ate bad sushi. I'm sick. Go away.

364
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,530
<17-6,Chase >我们可以给你用异丙嗪止吐
<17-6,Chase >We can give you promethazine for the nausea.

365
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,590
<17-7,Richardson >吃过了
<17-7,Richardson >Already took it.

366
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,830
<17-7,Richardson >还有曲美苄胺
<17-7,Richardson >And trimethobenzamide.

367
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,270
<17-8,Thirteen >可能不是食物中毒
<17-8,Thirteen >Maybe this isn't food poisoning.

368
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,530
<17-9,Chase >不管怎样
<17-9,Chase >Whatever it is,

369
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,090
<17-9,Chase >肯定是伤到了他的胃壁
<17-9,Chase >It must have damaged the lining of his stomach.

370
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,020
<17-9,Chase >如果不治好  什么都不顶用
<17-9,Chase >Till that heals, nothing's gonna work.

371
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,290
<17-10,Thirteen >所以我们得治好胃壁和呕吐
<17-10,Thirteen >So we need to treat both that and the nausea.

372
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,570
<17-11,Chase >不管他究竟出了什么问题
<17-11,Chase >And whatever's wrong with him.

373
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,320
<17-12,Thirteen >我们给他用安丹司琼和前列腺素吧
<17-12,Thirteen >We give him ondansetron and prostaglandins.

374
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,880
<17-11,Chase >不管他究竟出了什么问题的话
<17-11,Chase >And whatever's wrong with him.

375
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,870
<17-13,Chase >这两种药都不是能治疗
<17-13,Chase >Neither of those will treat

376
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,260
<17-13,Chase >他可能患上的病

<17-14,Thirteen >是医院的
<17-14,Thirteen >The hospital is.

<17-16,Thirteen >你非常痛苦  不是吗
<17-16,Thirteen >You're pretty miserable, aren't you?

<17-16,Thirteen >你想吃一种有点危险的
<17-16,Thirteen >Would you be willing to take a...fairly risky drug

382
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,670
<17-16,Thirteen >但有可能让你的症状全部消失的药吗
<17-16,Thirteen >If it would make it all go away?

383
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,750
<18-1,Cuddy >为什么不让他进来
<18-1,Cuddy >Why didn't you let him in?

384
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,200
<18-2,House >我们做爱的时候你也想着威尔森吗
<18-2,House >You were thinking about wilson while we were having sex?

<18-3,Cuddy >你把我藏起来  为什么
<18-3,Cuddy >You were hiding me from him. Why?

387
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,170
<18-4,House >我不是金屋藏娇
<18-4,House >I was not hiding you.

388
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,560
<18-4,House >我是在保护你的隐私权
<18-4,House >I was protecting your privacy.

389
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,650
<18-4,House >我不确定你是不是准备好在公众前
<18-4,House >Wasn't sure if you were ready to go public

390
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,890
<18-4,House >暴露"咱俩"的事儿
<18-4,House >With the whole..."us" Thing yet.

391
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,750
<18-5,Cuddy >如果我想要隐私的话
<18-5,Cuddy >Why would I be doing all this

392
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,790
<18-5,Cuddy >还干嘛这样
<18-5,Cuddy >If I wanted it to be private? Ohh...

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,630
<18-5,Cuddy >我从没要求过
<18-5,Cuddy >Oh. I never even asked.

394
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,770
<18-5,Cuddy >可能是你还没准备好
<18-5,Cuddy >Maybe you're not ready yet.

395

<19-1,Chase >你看过那药的副作用说明了吗
<19-1,Chase >Have you read the list of side effects on those drugs?

396
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,720
<19-1,Chase >可能会让他血压失调
<19-1,Chase >We could crash his bp.

397
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,110
<19-2,Thirteen >我没听见动静
<19-2,Thirteen >I haven't heard a thump,

398
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,960
<19-2,Thirteen >所以我猜他还在安静地呕吐
<19-2,Thirteen >So I assume he's still quietly puking.

399
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,810
<19-3,Chase >可能情况更糟呢
<19-3,Chase >We could be making him worse.

400
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,010
<19-4,Thirteen >从大局着想
<19-4,Thirteen >Bigger picture--

401
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,650
<19-4,Thirteen >我们是为了让医院更好
<19-4,Thirteen >We're making the hospital better.

402
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,610
<19-4,Thirteen >我们可以给他做所有你想做的检测
<19-4,Thirteen >We can test for whatever you want to test him for once

403
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,970
<19-4,Thirteen >只要他稳定了  能回到医院去
<19-4,Thirteen >He's stable enough to get back to the hospital.

404
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,520
<19-4,Thirteen >别腻歪了  走啊
<19-4,Thirteen >Now, stop being a girl and move.

405
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,090
<19-4,Thirteen >那么接下来你该问我这次的亨廷顿病治疗了
<19-4,Thirteen >So you gonna ask me about this huntington's trial,

406
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,290
<19-4,Thirteen >顺便也问问你  能给我些建议吗
<19-4,Thirteen >And by ask, I mean give me your opinion?

407
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,710
<19-5,Chase >没  但有件事
<19-5,Chase >No. There is one thing,though.

408
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,990
<19-5,Chase >你会和我做爱吗
<19-5,Chase >Will you have sex with me?

409

<19-7,Chase >-什么  -这次治疗意味着你要马上离开
<19-7,Chase >- What?  - well, this trial means you're leaving right away.

410
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,090
<19-7,Chase >我等了很久了
<19-7,Chase >I was playing a long game.

411
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,780
<19-7,Chase >期限将尽啊
<19-7,Chase >Deadlines have been moved up.

412
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,060
<19-8,Richardson >那玩意不错
<19-8,Richardson >Wow. That stuff is good.

413
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,060
<19-9,Thirteen >我想你能回医院了吧
<19-9,Thirteen >Think you might back to the hospital?

414

<19-10,Richardson >当然  那灯真亮
<19-10,Richardson >Uh-huh. That lamp is shiny.

<19-10,Richardson >我是说  亮的真...
<19-10,Richardson >I mean, the way it shines is...

416
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,720
<19-10,Richardson >璀璨
<19-10,Richardson >Shiny.

417
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,670
<19-11,Chase >我觉得这是药的某种副作用
<19-11,Chase >I take it this is one of the side effects of the drugs.

418
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,950
<19-12,Thirteen >管他呢  走吧
<19-12,Thirteen >Who cares? Let's go.

<20-2,House >我要证明你错了
<20-2,House >I'm gonna prove you wrong.

<20-3,House >一箭双雕啊  咱俩再做一遍
<20-3,House >It's a win-win. We get to do it again,

<20-3,House >而且...  没准他还能学到些东西
<20-3,House >And...he might actually learn something.

426
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,300
<20-4,Cuddy >听起来像是有人要破门而入
<20-4,Cuddy >It sounds like someone's trying to break in.

427
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,610
<20-4,Cuddy >可能没事的
<20-4,Cuddy >It's probably nothing.

<21-5,Wilson >听到了  但就像某人曾告诉我的
<21-5,Wilson >Yeah. But as someone once told me,

<21-7,Wilson >我想你可能在一年没吸毒后又复吸了
<21-7,Wilson >I think you might be throwing away a drug-free year.

465
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,940
<22-4,House >来表达观点
<22-4,House >To make a point.

466
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,490
<22-4,House >也许是与让你闭嘴有关
<22-4,House >Probably something to do with shutting you up.

<22-4,House >是我的原意

<22-9,Wilson >你真的没事吗
