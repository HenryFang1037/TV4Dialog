<6-9,CAMERON>- 胆结石?,- 胆管扩张了
<6-9,CAMERON>- Gallstones?,- Biliary duct is dilated.

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,610
<6-10,HOUSE>可能是结石造成的,一定已经导致严重的胰腺炎了
<6-10,HOUSE>Probably from a stonelodged in it.,Must've caused a nasty caseof pancreatitis.

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,010
<6-11,FOREMAN>她只有六岁,六岁的小孩不会得胆结石
<6-11,FOREMAN>she's six.,Six-year-olds don'tget gallstones.

74
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,600
<6-12,HOUSE>所以她得的不是胰腺炎

<6-13,CAMERON>你的意思是她长了颗隐形胆结石

<6-14,CHASE>他的正确推断是胰腺炎

<6-16,HOUSE>我的意思是...,胆结石消失了
<6-16,HOUSE>my theory is...,vanishing gallstone.

<6-17,HOUSE>She had it,and it passed.,Those thingstravel in packs.

80
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,920
<6-17,HOUSE>其余的胆结石可能藏在她的胆囊里,让她做个B超
<6-17,HOUSE>The rest of them are probablyhiding out,in her gall bladder.Do an ultrasound.

81
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,850
<6-17,HOUSE>如果我正确, 就得切除掉胆囊,对那些结石作分析
<6-17,HOUSE>If I'm right,we'll take out the organ,so we can analyzethe stones.

82
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,540
<7-1,CHASE>我没拍他的马屁
<7-1,CHASE>I wasn't kissing his ass.

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,310
<7-2,FOREMAN>我怎么看着就象
<7-2,FOREMAN>it must've just looked,that way from our angle.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,260
<7-2,FOREMAN>- house一弯腰, 你马上就下跪,- 他说中了胰腺炎
<7-2,FOREMAN>- You on your knees,house bending over.,- He predictedthe pancreatitis.

<7-4,CAMERON>- 这都是他老爸的错,- 我老爸是个混蛋
<7-4,CAMERON>- It's his dad's fault.,- My dad was an ass.

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,390
<7-6,CAMERON>可你却一直对他言听计从,作为回报, 你也得到了自己想要的一切
<7-6,CAMERON>But you did everythinghe wanted you to,,and in return you goteverything you wanted.

87
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,900
<7-7,CHASE>就是这么简单?
<7-7,CHASE>Yeah, it's that simple.

88
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,450
<7-8,CAMERON>这一套很管用, 老爸给他安排轻松的工作,给钱让他过轻松的生活
<7-8,CAMERON>The strategy worked.,Dad got him a cushy job.Paid for his cushy life.

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,100
<7-9,CHASE>然后把我的名字从遗嘱里轻松地划掉
<7-9,CHASE>Cut me outof hisushy will.

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,300
<7-10,FOREMAN>我早说了, 那是他的本性,可怜的家伙生来就是要拍马屁的
<7-10,FOREMAN>I told you.It's just his nature.,Poor guy's hardwiredto kiss ass.

91
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,370
<7-11,CHASE>House说得对,是胆结石
<7-11,CHASE>House was right.,Gallstones.

92
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,490
<8-1,ROB>那么小的孩子也会得胆结石
<8-1,ROB>I didn't know a kidcould get gallstones.

93

<8-2,CHASE>确实很罕见, 所以我们要,弄清楚是什么引起的
<8-2,CHASE>It's unusual.That's why we need,to see what's causing it.

<8-2,CHASE>We'd like to removealice's gallbladder,and analyze the stones.

<8-6,EDIE>- 就因为我说了“没问题”?,- 我的决定与你无关
<8-6,EDIE>- Just 'causeI said sure?,- I am capableof my own thoughts.

97
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,100
<8-7,CHASE>这只是个小手术,胆囊对人体不是很重要
<8-7,CHASE>It's a simple procedure.,The gallbladderisn't essential--

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,900
<8-8,ROB>edie  医生认为该怎么做,我们就该让他们做
<8-8,ROB>if the doctor thinkswe should do it,,we should do it, edie.

99
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,560
<8-9,EDIE>切除掉我们孩子的器官之前,是不是该征询一下其他医生的意见?
<8-9,EDIE>You think maybe we shouldget a second opinion,before we start removingour child's organs?

102

<9-4,CUDDY>大多数人都疲于应付生活中的各种问题,所以没工夫去斤斤计较个人恩怨
<9-4,CUDDY>Most people have enoughgoing on in their lives,that they don't have topersonalize every slight.

<9-5,TRITTER>这不是个人恩怨,不再是了
<9-5,TRITTER>This isn't personal.,Not anymore.

<9-7,TRITTER>I think you're angryat the wrong person.

107

<9-8,CUDDY>你认为Wilson医生活该被冻结财产?
<9-8,CUDDY>You think dr. Wilson deserved,to have his assets seized?

108

<9-8,CUDDY>- 职业毁于一旦?,- 不是
<9-8,CUDDY>- His entire practice ruined?,- No.

109

<9-10,CUDDY>你只是根本不在乎?
<9-10,CUDDY>So you just don't care?

110

<9-11,TRITTER>我就是靠这个来达到目的
<9-11,TRITTER>This is how I getwhat I want.

111
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,880
<9-11,TRITTER>我给别人施压
<9-11,TRITTER>I put pressure on people.

112
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,200
<9-11,TRITTER>就算wilson不肯就范,你已经开始着急了
<9-11,TRITTER>And if it doesn't workon wilson,it'll work on you.

<9-12,CUDDY>你惩罚的是无辜的人
<9-12,CUDDY>You punish the innocent.

<9-14,TRITTER>你们当中没有人是无辜的,没有一个
<9-14,TRITTER>None of youare innocent.,Not one of you.

<9-15,TRITTER>你们谁也不肯告诉我,关于House医生的真相
<9-15,TRITTER>Not one of you has told methe truth.,About dr. House.

116

<9-16,CUDDY>那些药帮助他对付疼痛
<9-16,CUDDY>The pills allow himto cope with the pain.

117
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,850
<9-17,TRITTER>不,  那些药丸扭曲了现实,他是个瘾君子
<9-17,TRITTER>No, the pillsdistort reality.,He is an addict.

118
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,330
<9-18,CUDDY>- 他又没去打劫烈酒商店或者--,- 没错, 可他是个医生
<9-18,CUDDY>- He's not out robbinga liquor store or--,- no, he's treating people.

119
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,970
<9-19,TRITTER>在他弄出人命之前,得想点别的办法解决这个问题
<9-19,TRITTER>He needs to finda different way to cope,before he kills somebody.

120
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,540
<9-19,TRITTER>说不定他已经弄出人命了
<9-19,TRITTER>If he hasn'tdone that already.

<9-20,CUDDY>就算你说得对,他也只不是有病而已
<9-20,CUDDY>If you're right,he has a medical problem.

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,520
<9-20,CUDDY>这应该由医生来解决,而不是--
<9-20,CUDDY>It should be dealt withby doctors, not by--

123
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,240
<9-21,TRITTER>医生们根本就没想要去解决问题,他们只会掩盖真相
<9-21,TRITTER>well, it's not beingdealt with by doctors.,Doctors arecovering it up.

124
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:31,580
<9-22,TRITTER>刑罚体系存在的目的是,当其它一切都失效, 守住最后一道防线
<9-22,TRITTER>The whole point ofthe criminal justice system,is to make things rightwhen everything else fails.

<10-6,EDIE>She's not dying.,She has pancreatitis.

<10-6,EDIE>治好以后,我就带她回家
<10-6,EDIE>Once you've treated that,I'm taking her home.

<10-8,EDIE>My father had gallstones.,They were totally harmless.

<10-10,EDIE>她不该做没必要的手术
<10-10,EDIE>She shouldn't haveunnecessary surgery.

140

<10-11,HOUSE>她也不该有个白痴妈妈,不过这有什么办法呢?
<10-11,HOUSE>Or a moron for a mom,,but what can you do?

141
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,240
<10-12,EDIE>你只是她的医生,而我是她的妈妈
<10-12,EDIE>You're the doctor.,I'm the mother.

<11-8,JUDGE>Reason as defined byslavishly deferring to you.

<11-21,HOUSE>她的观点无足轻重,她又不是这领域的专家
<11-21,HOUSE>She's not a specialistin this area.,Her opinion is worthless.

161
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,000
<11-22,JUDGE>Cuddy医生, 你觉得House医生这人怎样?,是不是象我想的那样--是个大混蛋
<11-22,JUDGE>Dr. Cuddy, what doyou think of dr. House?,Is he as big a jerkas I think he is?

<17-2,JUDGE>You were in here yesterdaytelling me,her father'sguardianship was best for her.

<17-3,HOUSE>我还以为今天会换个法官
<17-3,HOUSE>I honestly figured I'd get,a different judge today.

<17-7,EDIE>她的儿科医生不知道问题出在哪里,只说House医生是最棒的
<17-7,EDIE>Her pediatrician doesn't know,what's wrong with her,says dr. House is the best.

264

<17-8,ROB>她失去了监护权,突然之间  House就成了英雄
<17-8,ROB>She loses guardianship.,All of a sudden,house is a hero.

265
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,740
<17-8,ROB>这完全跟我的决定没--
<17-8,ROB>It's got nothing to dowith me deciding--

268
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,810
<17-11,JUDGE>每个决定都要争来争去,既浪费她的时间, 也浪费我的时间
<17-11,JUDGE>Arguing over every decision,is a waste of her timeand mine.

269
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,860
<17-11,JUDGE>既然她的父母意见不一致
<17-11,JUDGE>Since her parents can'tor won't agree,

270
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:50,880
<17-11,JUDGE>我决定把临时监护权叫给一位,以这孩子的健康为重的医生
<17-11,JUDGE>I'm awarding temporaryguardianship to a doctor,who will place the health of the childabove all else.

271
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,270
<17-12,CUDDY>我不认为House医生有能力--
<17-12,CUDDY>I don't think dr. Houseis capable--

<18-1,HOUSE>3:00.,Give me the pills.

276
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,270
<18-2,CUDDY>我根本不认识这孩子,又怎么能决定什么对她是最有利的
<18-2,CUDDY>I don't evenknow this kid.,How am I supposed to decidewhat's best for her?

<18-4,CUDDY>我们不该给她用广谱抗菌素
<18-4,CUDDY>We're not gonna gobroad-spectrum.

280
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,700
<18-4,CUDDY>万一她真的是过敏
<18-4,CUDDY>If there's any chancethat she's allergic--

<18-8,CUDDY>如果你认为是细菌感染,那就选一种抗生素
<18-8,CUDDY>If you think it's bacterial,,pick one antibiotic.

284
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,300
<18-9,HOUSE>一种不够,我们需要的是广谱抗菌素
<18-9,HOUSE>Not gonna be enough.,We need to gobroad-spectrum.

<18-10,CUDDY>It kills bugs.,That's what you want.

<19-1,TRITTER>你不需要出庭指证他违法
<19-1,TRITTER>you don't have to testifyhe's broken any laws.

<19-1,TRITTER>Though i'm sureyou could.

301
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:44,700

<19-7,TRITTER>Foreman医生, 你说这话,好像你从没做过违法的事似的
<19-7,TRITTER>Dr. Foreman,the way you talk,you'd think,you nevercommitted any crimes yourself.

<19-7,TRITTER>你和House医生,你们都是冷血的家伙
<19-7,TRITTER>You and dr. House.,You areboth cold bastards.

<19-7,TRITTER>你根本不关心你的兄弟,你也不会维护House
<19-7,TRITTER>You don't give a damn about your brother,,and you can't stand house.

<19-7,TRITTER>But I do expect youto take this deal,because you hatehypocrisy more.

<27-7,CUDDY>Let's get her out of here.,I'll call the O.R.

417
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,490
<27-8,ALICE>你说过不疼的!
<27-8,ALICE>You said it wouldn't hurt!

418
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,270
<28-2,CUDDY>- 找到了,- 她体温升高
<28-2,CUDDY>- Found it.,- She's burning up.

<28-4,CUDDY>- 给我几秒钟,- Foreman, 她体温高的吓人
<28-4,CUDDY>- Give me a sec.,- Foreman, she is on fire.

420

<28-5,FOREMAN>就快到了
<28-5,FOREMAN>Almost there.

421
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,230
<28-6,CUDDY>- 给我准备降温毯,- 马上
<28-6,CUDDY>- Get me somecooling blankets now.,- Right away.

422
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,160
<28-8,CAMERON>每次我们一碰这个孩子,总有事情发生
<28-8,CAMERON>Every time we touch this kid,,something goes wrong.

423
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,010
<28-9,HOUSE>归咎于晦气,不是一种诊断
<28-9,HOUSE>Bad mojo is nota diagnosis.

424
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,760
<28-10,CAMERON>你干什么非要在我面前炫耀你的藏货
<28-10,CAMERON>You really had to flashyour private,stashin front of me?

425
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,940
<28-11,HOUSE>如果我不当着你的面,为我撒谎就容易些?
<28-11,HOUSE>You find it easierto lie for me,if it's more subtle?

426
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,860
<28-11,HOUSE>那好
<28-11,HOUSE>Fine.

427
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,240
<29-1,TRITTER>你和你的同事说,我冻结了你的账户
<29-1,TRITTER>Your told your associates thatI had frozen your accounts.

428
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,990
<29-3,TRITTER>- 是的,- 高明
<29-3,TRITTER>- Yes.,- Smart lie.

429
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,570
<29-3,TRITTER>你觉得他们会认为,你被特殊对待是有原因的
<29-3,TRITTER>You figured they'd thinkthere was a reason,that you'd been singled out.

430
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,910
<29-3,TRITTER>比如你已经同意指证House
<29-3,TRITTER>Like that you had agreedto testify against house.

431
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,370
<29-4,CHASE>是的, 我假设那就是你这么做的原因
<29-4,CHASE>Yeah, I assumethat's why you did it.

432
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:02,400
<29-5,TRITTER>你可是有个墙头草的名声在外
<29-5,TRITTER>You have a reputationas a bitof an opportunist.

433
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,390
<29-5,TRITTER>在我听说之前你就出卖过自己的上司
<29-5,TRITTER>You already gave your boss uponce from what I've heard.

434
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,820
<29-6,CHASE>为了保住我的工作,他下台我就会丢饭碗
<29-6,CHASE>To save my job.,He goes down now,I lose my job.

435
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,890
<29-7,TRITTER>辞了这份工作你还能找其他的
<29-7,TRITTER>You lose your job,you fin another one.

436
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
<29-7,TRITTER>你要是被炒得话...
<29-7,TRITTER>You get fired...

437
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,360
<29-7,TRITTER>机会可就没那么多了
<29-7,TRITTER>chances don'tlook so hot.

438
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,060
<29-9,TRITTER>- 为什么他要炒了我?,- 因为你揭发了他
<29-9,TRITTER>- Why would he fire to me?,- Because you rolled on him.

439
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,900
<29-10,CHASE>- 我没有揭发过他,- 我想你会的
<29-10,CHASE>- I haven't rolled on him.,- I think you will.

440
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,830
<29-11,TRITTER>而且他会认为你已经做了
<29-11,TRITTER>And he's gonna thinkyou already did.

441
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,290
<29-12,CHASE>他所知道的是,我的账户和其他人一样被冻结了
<29-12,CHASE>As far as he knows,my accounts are frozen,just like everyone else'S.

442
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,470
<29-13,TRITTER>24小时之内,你们三人的账户就会解冻
<29-13,TRITTER>In 24 hours,all three of youwill,have accessto your accounts again.

443
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,210
<29-14,CHASE>为什么你要--
<29-14,CHASE>Why would you--

444
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:41,810
<29-15,TRITTER>知道吗 如果我是个局外人,我会觉得Tritter警官
<29-15,TRITTER>see, I waslooking at thisas an outsider,,I would sayit was becausedetective tritter had

445
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,550
<29-15,TRITTER>和Chase医生的这顿饭,吃得很愉快
<29-15,TRITTER>what appeared to be a very,pleasant lunch with dr. Chase.

446
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,320
<29-15,TRITTER>不是吗
<29-15,TRITTER>Yeah.

447
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,060
<29-16,TRITTER>他们两个看样子在商量什么
<29-16,TRITTER>The two of themappeared to beworking together.

448
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,740
<30-1,CUDDY>手术室里的冰袋都哪去了?
<30-1,CUDDY>How the hell are there,no ice packs in the O.R.?

449
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,760
<30-2,FOREMAN>血栓清除 冰袋支持不了太久,降温毯在哪?
<30-2,FOREMAN>Clot's out.Ice packs aren't going to,hold her for long.Where are the blankets?

450
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,640
<30-3,CUDDY>在急诊室, 他们正在,处理四车相撞的伤者
<30-3,CUDDY>In the E.R., They're dealing,with a four-car collision.

451
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,560
<30-4,FOREMAN>我们要在烧坏大脑前,把她的体温降下来
<30-4,FOREMAN>We need to coolthis kid downbefore her brain melts.

452
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,710
<30-5,FOREMAN>你在干什么?
<30-5,FOREMAN>What are you doing?

453
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,670
<30-5,FOREMAN>为了稀释血液方便透析,给她用过大量肝素
<30-5,FOREMAN>She got a major doseof heparin,to thin her bloodfor the procedure.

454
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,460
<31-1,CAMERON>可能导致血小板过低
<31-1,CAMERON>Could've induced thrombocytopenia.

455
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,630
<31-2,CHASE>不太可能,透析已经清除了绝大部分的肝素
<31-2,CHASE>That's unlikely.The charcoal,would've absorbeda lot of the heparin.

456
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,890
<31-2,CHASE>她以前就贫血,可能是原发性血液疾病
<31-2,CHASE>She's been anemic.,Could be a primary blood disorder.

457
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:42,620
<31-4,CAMERON>- 或是我们根本就没治愈感染,- 你是说她没有雷亥氏病?
<31-4,CAMERON>- Or we never curedthe infection.,- Are you saying she never had reye's?

458
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,740
<31-4,CAMERON>我们才把这个小姑娘置于极度的痛苦中
<31-4,CAMERON>We just put that little girl,through excruciating pain.

459
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,120
<31-5,CHASE>痛苦也不是House的错
<31-5,CHASE>The pain wasn't house's fault.

460
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,500
<31-5,CHASE>即使血栓是用药的副作用,我们还是能--
<31-5,CHASE>Even if the clot wasa reaction,to what we gave herwe still had--

461
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,860
<31-6,HOUSE>我不需要你来替我掩饰
<31-6,HOUSE>I don't need you to covermy ass!

462
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,130
<31-6,HOUSE>我需要的是维柯丁
<31-6,HOUSE>What I need is my vicodin!

463
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,690
<31-6,HOUSE>每六个小时才两片,好像给零花钱一样
<31-6,HOUSE>Two pills every six hours.,Like I'm on an allowance.

464
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,460
<31-6,HOUSE>她让警察干预医学诊断
<31-6,HOUSE>She's a given a cop leverage,over medical decisions.

465
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,830
<31-6,HOUSE>为什么不叫个水管工,问问他的意见?
<31-6,HOUSE>What the hell?Why don't we get a,plumberin here, ask his opinion?

466
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,030
<31-6,HOUSE>嘿  Cuddy 你知道牛仔竞技前要称重--
<31-6,HOUSE>Hey, cuddy, you know any,rodeo clowns who can weigh in--

467
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,710
<31-7,HOUSE>她人呢?
<31-7,HOUSE>where the hell is she?

468
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,960
<32-1,CUDDY>看看她的手臂
<32-1,CUDDY>Look at her arm.

469
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,240
<32-2,HOUSE>说了是感染
<32-2,HOUSE>I told youit was an infection.

470
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,620
<32-3,CUDDY>- 感染我们已经清除了,- 哦 明显没有
<32-3,CUDDY>- We fixed the infection.,- Well, apparently not.

471
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,790
<32-4,HOUSE>我说让你用广谱抗生素,你却把量减到最小
<32-4,HOUSE>I asked you for broad-spectrum.,You put her onthe bare minimum.

472
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,410
<32-4,HOUSE>没怀上孩子算是好的,因为你根本不是个好母亲
<32-4,HOUSE>It's a good thing you failed to,become a mombecause you suck at it.

473
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,450
<33-1,HOUSE>皮疹给我们提示什么?
<33-1,HOUSE>What's goodabout this rash?

474
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,140
<33-2,HOUSE>猜的好, 但是不对
<33-2,HOUSE>Good guesses, but no.

475
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,560
<33-3,HOUSE>我们碰都没碰她身上那片皮肤
<33-3,HOUSE>It's on parts of her body,that we haven't touched.

476
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,250
<33-3,HOUSE>她烧到103度了,人昏迷又醒了
<33-3,HOUSE>She's got a feverof 103.,She's in and outof consciousness.

477
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,470
<33-3,HOUSE>但都不是因为我们的措施
<33-3,HOUSE>But it's not a reaction,to anything we did.

478
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,860
<33-3,HOUSE>不是晦气的原因,就是说
<33-3,HOUSE>Her mojois off the table.,Which means?

479
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,080
<33-4,HOUSE>哦 就差一点!
<33-4,HOUSE>Oh, so close!

480
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,720
<33-4,HOUSE>因为Cuddy的缩手缩脚,现在用广谱抗生素也没用了
<33-4,HOUSE>Means that thanks to cuddy'scandy-ass approach,broad-spectrum antibioticsare no longer an option.

481
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,060
<33-4,HOUSE>这个东西又长出了角和獠牙来
<33-4,HOUSE>This thing has grownhorns and fangs.

482
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,230
<33-4,HOUSE>我们得弄清楚它的是什么
<33-4,HOUSE>We gotta figure out what species it is.

483
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,010
<33-4,HOUSE>用长矛对准它的心脏
<33-4,HOUSE>Go in with a spearto the heart.

484
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,780
<33-5,HOUSE>你们心里有怨气
<33-5,HOUSE>Okay,you guys are sulking.

485
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,710
<33-5,HOUSE>虽然我不在乎是什么, 但是很明显,不弄清楚的话我没法工作
<33-5,HOUSE>I don't really care why,but apparently,I can't do my jobwithout finding out.

486
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,480
<33-6,CAMERON>- Tritter解冻了我们的银行账户,- 可怕, 真是恐怖的消息
<33-6,CAMERON>- Tritter releasedour bank accounts.,- Horrible,horrible news.

487
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,480
<33-7,HOUSE>真庆幸还没化脓
<33-7,HOUSE>Wow, I'm glad we didn't let that fester.

488
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,780
<33-7,HOUSE>如果是雷亥氏病, 那可能还有水痘病毒,二者经常关联
<33-7,HOUSE>If she did have reye's,then it could be,varicella.They're associated.

489
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,550
<33-8,FOREMAN>他解冻了我们的财产,你很清楚那意味着什么
<33-8,FOREMAN>He released our money.,You do know what that means.

490
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,210
<33-9,HOUSE>你应该问,"如果水痘的话, 她为什么不痒呢?"
<33-9,HOUSE>The correct question is"how could it be varicella,given that she's not itchy"?

491
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,010
<33-11,CAMERON>- 立克次氏体痘导致皮疹发热和疼痛,- 疼痛 但不会麻痹
<33-11,CAMERON>- Rickettisal pox causesrash, fever, and muslepain.,- pain, not paralysis.

492
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,940
<33-11,CAMERON>而落基山斑疹热,正好有皮疹, 发热, 贫血和麻痹
<33-11,CAMERON>Rocky mountain spotted feveron the other hand.,Rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.

493
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,530
<33-12,FOREMAN>- 而且我对Tritter什么也没说,- 我也没说
<33-12,FOREMAN>- And I didn't sayanything to tritter.,- Neither did I.

494
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,310
<33-13,CHASE>或许他就是想让我们以为,其中一个人说过
<33-13,CHASE>Maybe he wants us to think,that one of us talked.

495
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,020
<33-15,CAMERON>- 那奏效了,- 你曾经和他在一起
<33-15,CAMERON>- It worked.,- You were with him.

496
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,960
<33-16,CHASE>- 我们都和他独处过,- 我们可没和他谈笑风生
<33-16,CHASE>- We were all with him.,- We weren't laughingwith him.

497
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,320
<33-18,HOUSE>或许是他放弃了
<33-18,HOUSE>Maybe he just gave up.

498
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,010
<33-18,HOUSE>给孩子用氯霉素对付落基山斑疹热
<33-18,HOUSE>Start the kidon chloramphenicol,for rocky mountainspotted fever.

499
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,230
<33-19,CHASE>- 我们能谈谈吗?,- 不行
<33-19,CHASE>- Can we talk?,- Nope.

500
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,890
<33-21,CHASE>我觉得--
<33-21,CHASE>I really think--

501
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,400
<33-22,HOUSE>要么你指控我, 想让我原谅你,或者你没有, 于是来讨要奖赏
<33-22,HOUSE>either you screwed meand you want absolution,,or you didn'tand you want applause.

502
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,200
<33-22,HOUSE>两个我都不感兴趣
<33-22,HOUSE>Either wayI'm not interested.

503
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,000
<34-1,CUDDY>忙着呢
<34-1,CUDDY>Busy.

504
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,620
<34-3,CUDDY>- 你还好吧?,- 是 当然
<34-3,CUDDY>- You okay?,- Yeah, sure.

505
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,120
<34-4,WILSON>当我问 "你还好吗",我是问House做了什么?
<34-4,WILSON>What I meant by"are you okay"?,Is what the helldid house do?

506
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,130
<34-6,WILSON>- 没什么,- 他说什么了?
<34-6,WILSON>- Nothing.,- What did he say?

507
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,120
<34-7,CUDDY>House的那副粗鲁嘴脸我见得多了,通常都是为了达到某些目的
<34-7,CUDDY>I've seen house be rudea thousand times,,usually to achieve something.

508
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,390
<34-7,CUDDY>我从未听过他无目的的讲那些话
<34-7,CUDDY>I have never seen himbe mean just because he can.

509
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,440
<34-8,WILSON>真的?
<34-8,WILSON>Seriously?

510
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,440
<34-6,WILSON>- 他说什么了?,- 没什么 无关紧要
<34-6,WILSON>- What did he say?,- Nothing.Doesn't matter.

511
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,970
<34-10,WILSON>哦 House对你的口气我也见得多了,但是他从来伤不到你
<34-10,WILSON>Well, I've seen house be rudeto you a thousand times,,but I've never seen itget to you.

512
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,700
<34-11,CUDDY>人们觉得House只是口无遮拦
<34-11,CUDDY>People think house hasno inner censor.

513
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,060
<34-11,CUDDY>实际上他只是没发作,当他想伤害别人
<34-11,CUDDY>But the fact is he holds himself back,,because when he wants to hurt,

514
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,730
<34-11,CUDDY>他很清楚别人的软肋在哪
<34-11,CUDDY>he knows just whereto poke a sharp stick.

515
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,540
<34-11,CUDDY>我一直想要个孩子,House也知道
<34-11,CUDDY>I have been tryingto get pregnant,and house knew.

516
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,140
<34-11,CUDDY>他说我会是个失败的母亲
<34-11,CUDDY>He told me I wouldfail as a mother.

517
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,420
<34-12,WILSON>你这么伤心难道认为他说的对?
<34-12,WILSON>And you're this upset,because you think he's right?

518
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,880
<34-12,WILSON>我已经三次植入胚胎了
<34-12,WILSON>I've had three separateimplantations.

519
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,290
<34-13,CUDDY>前两次没着床,后一个没保住
<34-13,CUDDY>The first twonever took.,The last one I lost.

520
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,620
<34-14,WILSON>我很遗憾 那不是你的错,这些只是生理现象
<34-14,WILSON>I'm sorry.You didn't fail.,Those wherephysical events.

521
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:04,460
<34-15,CUDDY>小女孩疼痛害怕的时候
<34-15,CUDDY>A little girl is...,scared and in pain.

522
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,020
<34-15,CUDDY>我不知该怎么办,只想着不犯错
<34-15,CUDDY>I was awkward, terrified,of doing the wrong thing.

523
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,380
<34-16,WILSON>那很正常,那--
<34-16,WILSON>That's normal.,That's--

524
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,810
<34-17,CUDDY>我没拥抱她
<34-17,CUDDY>I didn't hug her.

525
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,860
<34-17,CUDDY>她的小手也没牵一下
<34-17,CUDDY>I didn't even reach outand hold her hand.

526
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,610
<34-17,CUDDY>只是告诉她没事的
<34-17,CUDDY>I told her it wasgonna be okay.

527
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,910
<34-18,WILSON>她需要你的安慰
<34-18,WILSON>She needed reassurance.

528
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,320
<34-19,CUDDY>我还说她父母会可能会和好
<34-19,CUDDY>I told her her folks,might get back together.

529
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,700
<34-19,CUDDY>当我看见别人和孩子在一起时,一切都是那么自然
<34-19,CUDDY>When I see people with their kids,,it's so natural.

530
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,970
<34-19,CUDDY>就像他们的基因里有个,儿童相处说明书一样
<34-19,CUDDY>It's like they havean instruction book,imprinted on their genes.

531
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,010
<34-19,CUDDY>或许我的基因就是缺少这点
<34-19,CUDDY>Maybe I just didn'tget a copy.

532
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,340
<34-19,CUDDY>或许我成为一个母亲的难度,就像五音不全的人去唱歌剧
<34-19,CUDDY>Maybe my wanting to be a motheris like,a tone deaf personwanting to sing opera

533
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,680
<34-20,WILSON>- 或是瘫痪的想--,- 喔喔喔
<34-20,WILSON>- or a paraplegicwho wants to--,- whoa, whoa, whoa.

534
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,860
<34-20,WILSON>我体会到你说的,"House找准你软肋"的意思了
<34-20,WILSON>Well, I see what you meanabout house,pokingin the right spot.

535
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,410
<35-1,FOREMAN>氯霉素不起作用
<35-1,FOREMAN>Chloramphenicolisn't working.

536
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,340
<35-2,HOUSE>- 用了多大剂量?,- 是啊, 怀疑Chase搞砸了
<35-2,HOUSE>- What dosedid you give her?,- Yeah, maybe chasescrewed up.

537
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,200
<35-4,CHASE>最后总要怀疑到我,我只是帮你们快点到这一步
<35-4,CHASE>We always end up there.,Just getting a jump on it.

538
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,050
<35-5,CHASE>我把药量加倍了
<35-5,CHASE>I doubled her up.

539
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,270
<35-6,HOUSE>病菌变异了
<35-6,HOUSE>The infection's morphed.

540
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,800
<35-6,HOUSE>- 转移到了肌鞘,- 坏死性筋膜炎?
<35-6,HOUSE>- It's moved intoher muscle sheath.,- Necrotizing faciitis?

541
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,900
<35-8,CAMERON>药物不能渗透
<35-8,CAMERON>That's impervious to drugs.

542
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,150
<35-9,HOUSE>唯一的治疗方法...,就是切除坏死的组织
<35-9,HOUSE>The only treatment...,is to cut awaythe infected area.

543
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,830
<35-10,CAMERON>- 只能截肢,- 手臂和腿?
<35-10,CAMERON>- So we amputate.,- Arm and leg?

544
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,790
<35-10,CAMERON>没有准确的诊断,我们不能把一个六岁孩子切成两半
<35-10,CAMERON>We can't cut a six-year-old kid in half,without a confirmeddiagnosis.

545
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,360
<35-11,HOUSE>感染太快而且我们又浪费了太久,没时间做细菌培养了
<35-11,HOUSE>Moves too quicklyand we waited too long.,We don't have timefor a culture.

546
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,080
<35-12,CAMERON>我们至少再观察她几个小时,确定是否会扩散
<35-12,CAMERON>We can at least observe herfor a few hours.,Confirm the rashis spreading.

547
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,400
<35-13,HOUSE>一旦扩散 她就死定了
<35-13,HOUSE>It spreads, she dies.

548
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,480
<35-14,FOREMAN>说的是把她变成瘸子
<35-14,FOREMAN>You're talking about crippling her.

549
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,490
<35-15,CHASE>甚至还没确定是感染
<35-15,CHASE>We're not even certainthis was an infection.

550
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,810
<35-16,HOUSE>是啊! 她才六岁! 她可爱!,所以不可能被病菌蚕食!
<35-16,HOUSE>Right!She's six!She's cute!,She can't haveflesh-eating bacteria!

551
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,550
<35-16,HOUSE>肯定不可能!,我们阳光和宠物去治她好了
<35-16,HOUSE>It's just wrong!,Let's cure her with sunshine and puppies.

552
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,550
<35-16,HOUSE>可爱的孩子病死了,无辜的医生坐监牢
<35-16,HOUSE>Cute kids die of illnesses.,Innocent doctors go to jail.

553
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,190
<35-16,HOUSE>因为你们这些懦弱的人,不敢站出来承担责任
<35-16,HOUSE>And it because cowardslike you,won't stand up and do what's required.

554
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,280
<35-16,HOUSE>就会坐在这抱怨谁更可怜
<35-16,HOUSE>You can sit around and moan,about who's the bigger weakling.

555
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,010
<35-17,HOUSE>我得工作去了
<35-17,HOUSE>I'm gonna go do my job.

556
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,690
<36-3,CUDDY>那该是怎样的生活,要是她失去--
<36-3,CUDDY>what kind of quality of life,will she have without--

557
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,810
<36-4,HOUSE>只有活着
<36-4,HOUSE>great thing about life.

558
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,250
<36-4,HOUSE>才谈得上质量
<36-4,HOUSE>It's got qualities.

559
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,610
<36-7,ROB>如果我们不同意呢?
<36-7,ROB>and if we can't agree?

560
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,890
<36-9,CUDDY>我不知道
<36-9,CUDDY>I don't know.

561
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,150
<37-1,FOREMAN>他以前也这么发飚过
<37-1,FOREMAN>He's yelled at us before.

562
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,550
<37-2,CAMERON>是因为他觉得我们的想法不对,而不是怀疑我们出卖他
<37-2,CAMERON>because he thoughtour theories were dumb.,Not because our theories were sending him to jail.

563
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,120
<37-3,FOREMAN>他正在药瘾戒除期,行为会轻微偏执
<37-3,FOREMAN>He's goingthrough withdrawal.,Could be causing mild paranoia.

564
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,860
<37-3,FOREMAN>总会有这个过程,我们也得跟着忍受
<37-3,FOREMAN>It'll pass, we justhave to suffer thought.

565
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,160
<37-4,CAMERON>我们从来没排除过敏症
<37-4,CAMERON>We never ruled out allergy.

566
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,120
<37-5,FOREMAN>我们给她用药,她也没出现副作用
<37-5,FOREMAN>We gave her drugs.,She had no negative reaction.

567
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,290
<37-6,CAMERON>我们给她腹部手术,她的腹部就出现皮疹
<37-6,CAMERON>We cut open her belly.,She got a rash on her belly.

568
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,000
<37-6,CAMERON>我们在她后背做过敏性测试,她的后背就出现皮疹
<37-6,CAMERON>We did a scratch teston her back.,She got a rash on her back.

569
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,540
<37-6,CAMERON>我知道House排除了晦气因素,但这决不可能是巧合
<37-6,CAMERON>I know house ruled out mojo,,but it can't be a coincidence--

570
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,790
<37-7,CHASE>玩猜诊断的游戏太晚了,不是吗?
<37-7,CHASE>too late to be playing,differential games, isn't it?

571
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,790
<37-8,FOREMAN>把那东西拿开,我可不想被灼伤
<37-8,FOREMAN>Get that thing away from me.,I don't want to get burned.

572
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,940
<37-9,CHASE>激光笔不会灼伤你的 天才
<37-9,CHASE>Laser pointersdon't burn you, genius.

573
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,540
<37-10,FOREMAN>皮肤当然不会,视网膜会
<37-10,FOREMAN>Skin, no.,Retina, yes.

574
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,660
<37-11,CHASE>你不信我的准确度?
<37-11,CHASE>You don't trust my aim?

575
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,060
<37-11,CHASE>或许你该把所有怕光的都遮住--
<37-11,CHASE>Maybe you should cover any sensitive--

576
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,160
<37-12,CHASE>他那通小狗的说辞有问题
<37-12,CHASE>he was wrongabout the puppies.

577
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,010
<38-2,CHASE>House, 你得终止手术
<38-2,CHASE>House, you gottastop the surgery.

578
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,700
<38-3,HOUSE>- 她不是坏死性筋膜炎,- 噢 太好了
<38-3,HOUSE>- She doesn't havenecrotizing faciitis.,- Oh, good.

579
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,460
<38-4,CHASE>她得了红细胞生成性原卟啉症,对光过敏
<38-4,CHASE>She's got erythropoieticprotoporphyria.,She's allergic to light.

580
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,130
<38-4,CHASE>这是遗传性的,父母任何一方携带即可
<38-4,CHASE>It's genetic, either parentcould've carried it.

581
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,470
<38-5,HOUSE>我知道那是什么,感染症状更符合
<38-5,HOUSE>I know what it is.,Infection fits better.

582
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,600
<38-6,CHASE>每次她暴露在手术灯下,病情就会更严重
<38-6,CHASE>She gets worse every time,she goes under surgical lights.

583
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,270
<38-7,HOUSE>- 爸爸带她外出--,- 肝脏也衰竭了
<38-7,HOUSE>- Dad takes her outside--,- liver's shot too.

584
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,920
<38-7,HOUSE>- 难道她吞了手电筒?,- 停止手术
<38-7,HOUSE>- She swallow a flashlight?,- Stop the surgery.

585
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,360
<38-9,HOUSE>- 别挡我的路,- 不行! 我
<38-9,HOUSE>- Get the hellout of my way.,- No, I'm--unh!

586
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,280
<38-10,CHASE>光线破坏了血细胞
<38-10,CHASE>Light damagesthe blood cells.

587
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,100
<38-11,CHASE>被破坏的血细胞里含有原卟啉
<38-11,CHASE>The damaged blood cells contain protoporphyrin.

588
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,340
<38-11,CHASE>原卟啉在肝脏富集
<38-11,CHASE>The protoporphyrinbuilds up in the liver.

589
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,810
<38-11,CHASE>这就是肝功能衰竭的原因
<38-11,CHASE>That's why the liver'sshutting down.

590
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,490
<39-1,NURSE>停下
<39-1,NURSE>Stop.

591
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,530
<39-1,NURSE>她怎么可能对光线过敏?,之前从没有这个问题
<39-1,NURSE>how can she be allergic to light?,She's never had thisproblem before.

592
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,060
<40-1,EDIE>过敏反应一出生就有了
<40-1,EDIE>The negative reactionstarts at birth.

593
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,830
<40-2,CUDDY>随年龄的增长逐渐严重
<40-2,CUDDY>It reaches critical massaround this age.

594
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,940
<40-3,CUDDY>她的血细胞里产生些化学物质,在光照下会发生反应
<40-3,CUDDY>Her blood cellscreate chemicals,in reaction to light.

595
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,930
<40-4,CUDDY>当血液流经肝脏时,受损的细胞被过滤出来
<40-4,CUDDY>When they reach the liver,,it tries to filter outthe bad cells.

596
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,960
<40-4,CUDDY>释放的化学物质损害了肝脏,结果导致结石
<40-4,CUDDY>The chemicals damagethe liver,,and one byproductis gallstones.

597
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,820
<40-5,EDIE>她的情况会越来越糟吗?
<40-5,EDIE>So she'll just keepgetting worse?

598
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:32,240
<40-6,CUDDY>光过敏症是可控制的,我们给她β-胡萝卜素
<40-6,CUDDY>Ep can be managed.,We'll give herbeta-carotene.

599
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,430
<40-6,CUDDY>她需要用特制光源,窗户需要光线过滤装置
<40-6,CUDDY>She's gonna needspecial light bulbs,and filterson the windows.

600
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,150
<40-6,CUDDY>她大概只能在家里上学了
<40-6,CUDDY>She's probably gonnaneed to be home schooled.

<40-6,CUDDY>她的生活会有很多不便,但她能活下去
<40-6,CUDDY>Her life will becomplicated,but she will live.

602
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,120
<40-7,ROB>怎么会得上这病的?
<40-7,ROB>How do you getsomething like this?

603
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,260
<40-9,EDIE>- 是遗传性的,- 那我们之一....
<40-9,EDIE>It's genetic.,So one of us...

604
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,940
<40-10,CUDDY>必须双方都是携带者
<40-10,CUDDY>both of youmust be carriers.

605
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,060
<40-11,CUDDY>她醒来会想见你们  所以..
<40-11,CUDDY>She's gonna want to see you,when she wakes up.So...

606
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,950
<40-11,CUDDY>别再吵了
<40-11,CUDDY>don't screw it up.

607
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,730
<41-1,WILSON>有什么新消息?
<41-1,WILSON>So, what's new?

<41-2,CHASE>- House误诊了,- 以前也有过
<41-2,CHASE>- House missed one.,- That's happened before.

<41-4,CHASE>他差点使小女孩残废,我及时纠正
<41-4,CHASE>He nearly maimeda little girl.,I got it right.

610

<41-4,CHASE>我还告诉他,算了不重要
<41-4,CHASE>And I told him,and it didn't matter.

611
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,720
<41-5,WILSON>Chase 你拯救了一个病人,这是你最大的奖赏
<41-5,WILSON>Chase, you solved one.You helped a patient.,That better beenough for you.

612
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,970
<41-5,WILSON>*贝克特的话剧本来叫"等待House的赞同",后来觉得这那么叫太沮丧了
<41-5,WILSON>Beckett was gonna call his play"waiting for,house's approval"but decidedit was too grim.

614
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,920
<41-6,CHASE>相信我,我不会再等下去了
<41-6,CHASE>Trust me.,I'm not waiting anymore.

615
