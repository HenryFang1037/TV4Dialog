29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,600
<1-19,Short Girl>贱人

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,460
<1-20,Jane>不  她想要帮我
<1-20,Jane>No! She's trying to help me!

31
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,510
<1-20,Jane>放开她  放开我
<1-20,Jane>Get off her! Get off me!

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,490
<1-21,Policeman 1>安静
<1-21,Policeman 1>Settle down!

33
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,850
<1-22,Policeman 2>起来
<1-22,Policeman 2>Move!

34
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,710
<1-23,Policeman 1>天  我压根没碰过她
<1-23,Policeman 1>Geez. I didn't touch her.

35
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,920
<1-24,Policeman 2>这下好了  现在要去医院了
<1-24,Policeman 2>Great. Now we gotta go to a hospital.

36
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,910
<1-24,Policeman 2>病人无家可归
<1-24,Policeman 2>Homeless.

37
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,880
<2-1,Wilson>24小时前入院  怀疑吸毒过量
<2-1,Wilson>Admitted 24 hours ago with a suspected drug overdose.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,780
<2-1,Wilson>毒品检测呈阴性  但仍有妄想症状
<2-1,Wilson>Her tox screen's clean, but she's still delusional.

39
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,120
<2-2,Foreman>"无家可归"通常表示疯狂  没钱
<2-2,Foreman>"Homeless." Usually means crazy, no money.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,400
<2-3,Wilson>-卡迪不会  -我们是教学医院
<2-3,Wilson>- Cuddy's not gonna be - We're a teaching hospital.

41
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,790
<2-3,Wilson>没有身份证  都不知道她叫什么
<2-3,Wilson>No I D. Doesn't even seem to know her name.

42
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,000
<2-3,Wilson>找我来是因为她手臂上的病灶
<2-3,Wilson>I got called in because of some lesions on her arm.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,540
<2-4,Foreman>无家可归通常没有庇护所  会日照过度
<2-4,Foreman>Homeless always means no roof. Leads to too much sun.

44
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,040
<2-5,Wilson>不  病灶是良性的
<2-5,Wilson>No, the lesions were noncancerous.

45
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,290
<2-5,Wilson>不过我注意到她手腕抽搐
<2-5,Wilson>But I noticed a twitch. Her wrist.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,900
<3-2,Foreman>你感觉到了
<3-2,Foreman>You feel that?

47
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,380
<3-3,Jane>当然  我是人
<3-3,Jane>Sure. I'm human.

48
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,120
<3-4,Foreman>握紧我的手指  越紧越好
<3-4,Foreman>Make a fist around my fingers as tight as you can.

49
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,990
<3-5,Jane>-握紧  -我正在握
<3-5,Jane>- Squeeze. - I am.

50
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,180
<3-6,Foreman>行
<3-6,Foreman>All right.

51
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,010
<3-6,Foreman>举起手臂  过头
<3-6,Foreman>Raise your arms above your head for me.

52
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,780
<3-7,Jane>她在痉挛
<3-7,Jane>She's seizing.

53
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,150
<3-8,Wilson>拿安定来
<3-8,Wilson>Get me some Ativan.

54
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,230
<3-9,Foreman>她不想出院  她在骗你
<3-9,Foreman>She doesn't wanna be discharged. She's manipulating you.

55
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,310
<3-10,Wilson>痉挛是真的  检查下血糖
<3-10,Wilson>It's real. Check a finger stick.

56
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,500
<3-11,Foreman>血糖38
<3-11,Foreman>Blood sugar's 38.

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,540
<3-12,Wilson>50%葡萄糖  静推  马上
<3-12,Wilson>I need D-50 I.V. Push, stat.

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,750
<4-1,Wilson>假装低血糖  演技派啊
<4-1,Wilson>Fake low blood sugar. Now, that's acting.

59
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,220
<4-1,Wilson>低血糖是真的
<4-1,Wilson>The blood sugar was real.

60
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,320
<4-2,Foreman>她可能患有糖尿病  胰岛素服用过量
<4-2,Foreman>She's probably diabetic. O.D.'d on her own insulin.

61
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,830
<4-2,Foreman>2032室的病人的随身物品在这里吗
<4-2,Foreman>Room 2032. Do you have her effects out here?

62
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,310
<4-2,Foreman>听着  痉挛的发作
<4-2,Foreman>Look, a seizure

63
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,880
<4-2,Foreman>能让她在医生检查时有个睡觉的地方
<4-2,Foreman>buys her a place to sleep while the nice doctors run their tests.

64
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,340
<4-2,Foreman>或许还有几顿免费餐
<4-2,Foreman>Maybe a few free meals.

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
<4-2,Foreman>20块  赌里面有胰岛素
<4-2,Foreman>Twenty bucks says there's insulin in there.

66
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,640
<4-2,Foreman>哇  求你收起来吧
<4-2,Foreman>Oh! Wow. Put this back, please.

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,070
<4-3,Wilson>-抽搐怎么说  -她胳膊动了
<4-3,Wilson>- What about the twitch? - Her arm moved.

68
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,900
<4-5,Wilson>为何要装抽搐呢  痉挛还不够严重吗
<4-5,Wilson>Why fake a twitch? In case the seizure was too subtle?

69
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,490
<4-5,Wilson>抽搐可能是肿瘤引起  表示
<4-5,Wilson>The twitch could indicate a tumor, which could indicate-

70
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,480
<4-6,Foreman>有必要看神经科医生  也是为何你叫我来
<4-6,Foreman>A need to see a neurologist, which is why you called me.

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,380
<4-6,Foreman>把她留院观察到下午2点
<4-6,Foreman>Keep an eye on her till 2:00 P.M.

72
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,420
<4-6,Foreman>监测她的血糖  给顿热饭吃
<4-6,Foreman>Watch her blood sugar, give her a nice hot lunch.

73
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,360
<5-1,Wilson>然后让她出院
<5-1,Wilson>Then discharge her.

74
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,770
<5-2,House>-他错了  -福曼错了吗
<5-2,House>- He's wrong. - Foreman is wrong?

75
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,870
<5-2,House>神经科医生在神经学问题上搞错了
<5-2,House>The neurologist is wrong about a neurological problem.

76
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,060
<5-3,Wilson>他就看了她一眼  就说她在耍诈
<5-3,Wilson>He took one look at her and figured it was a scam.

77
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,500
<5-4,House>所以你觉得是他主观臆断
<5-4,House>So you figure he's not being objective.

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,440
<5-5,Wilson>豪斯  这个女人抽搐了  突发痉挛
<5-5,Wilson>House, the woman had a twitch. She had a seizure.

79
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,610
<5-7,Wilson>-福曼都看到了吗  -他只想赶她走
<5-7,Wilson>- Both of which Foreman saw? - He just wanted her out the door!

80
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,230
<5-8,House>冷静点  小伙子
<5-8,House>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Back up there, big fella.

81
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,860
<5-8,House>你该去找福曼发泄怒火
<5-8,House>Foreman's the guy you wanna take a swing at.

82
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,320
<5-9,Wilson>我只是希望她能得到应有的治疗
<5-9,Wilson>I just want her to get some medical attention.

83
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,790
<5-10,House>真相绝非如此
<5-10,House>That's not even close to being true.

84
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,840
<5-10,House>肯定是其它原因  私人原因
<5-10,House>It's something else. Something personal.

85
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,620
<5-10,House>把病历给我
<5-10,House>Give me the file.

86
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,490
<5-10,House>看来会很有趣
<5-10,House>Looks like this'll be fun.

87
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,860
<6-1,Cameron>抽搐可能是失神发作  和糖尿病无关
<6-1,Cameron>The twitch could be a miniseizure, unrelated to the diabetes.

88
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,990
<6-2,Chase>脑部肿瘤吗
<6-2,Chase>Brain tumor?

89
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,190
<6-3,House>很高兴你能参与讨论  艾瑞克
<6-3,House>Glad you could join us, Eric.

90
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,760
<6-3,House>腕部抽搐的鉴别诊断是什么
<6-3,House>What's the differential for a twitch in the wrist?

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,470
<6-4,Foreman>病人是个30岁左右的无名氏
<6-4,Foreman>The patient's a 30-ish Jane Doe.

92
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,940
<6-4,Foreman>要我就直接让她出院
<6-4,Foreman>I thought I just discharged her.

93
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
<6-5,Wilson>她是我的病人  听听他人意见也无害
<6-5,Wilson>Well, she's my patient. No harm in a second opinion.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
<6-6,Chase>脑部受过重创吗  硬膜下血肿
<6-6,Chase>A blow to the head? A subdural hematoma?

95
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,090
<6-7,Foreman>看看病历  没有头部创伤迹象
<6-7,Foreman>Read the file. No evidence of cranial trauma.

96
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,970
<6-8,Cameron>抽搐可能是脑部肿瘤症状
<6-8,Cameron>A twitch could indicate a brain tumor.

97
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,790
<6-9,Foreman>或者是无数其它原因
<6-9,Foreman>Or about a dozen other things!

98
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,590
<6-9,Foreman>够了  无家可归者有两件事是拿手的
<6-9,Foreman>Come on. There's two things homeless people are good at-

99
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,120
<6-9,Foreman>生病和耍花招
<6-9,Foreman>getting sick and running scams.

100
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,650
<6-9,Foreman>要是那么担心是脑部肿瘤
<6-9,Foreman>If you're so worried about it being a brain tumor,

101
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,770
<23-15,Chase>就给她做个核磁共振
<23-15,Chase>get her an M.R.I.

102
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,480
<6-9,Foreman>等结果出来不是了  就能赶她走了
<6-9,Foreman>When she's clear on that, then you can bounce her out of here.

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,390
<6-10,Wilson>你都把她看透了啊
<6-10,Wilson>Well, you've got her all figured out.

104
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,360
<6-11,Foreman>我认识的无家可归者比你多得多
<6-11,Foreman>I've known a lot more homeless people than you have.

105
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,160
<6-12,Wilson>是啊  你如此了解无家可归者
<6-12,Wilson>Yes, you've got that going for you.

106
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,230
<6-12,Wilson>我怎么能怀疑你的医学见解呢
<6-12,Wilson>How could I have doubted your medical opinion?

107
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,650
<6-13,House>关键的问题  你们都没注意到
<6-13,House>The big question. You're missing it, all of you.

108
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,180
<6-14,Foreman>天
<6-14,Foreman>Oh, geez.

109
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,250
<6-15,House>她是谁
<6-15,House>Who is she?

110
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,800
<6-15,House>行了  我们为何接这个病例
<6-15,House>Okay, why are we on this case?

111
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,130
<6-16,Foreman>就因为威尔森要求吗
<6-16,Foreman>Just because Wilson asked?

112
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,750
<6-18,House>这个理由还不够充分吗
<6-18,House>Do I need a better reason?

113
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,450
<6-19,Foreman>多数人不要  但你需要
<6-19,Foreman>Well, most people wouldn't. You do.

114
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,880
<6-20,House>关于无名氏  我们唯一确定的是
<6-20,House>The only thing we know for sure about Jane Doe

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,560
<6-20,House>她的名字不是无名氏
<6-20,House>is that her name isn't Jane Doe,

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
<6-20,House>就是说没有医疗记录
<6-20,House>which means no medical history.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,500
<6-20,House>过敏  用药史  过往诊断  治疗
<6-20,House>Allergies, medication, previous diagnoses, treatment-

118
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,420
<6-20,House>我们没有原始资料以及治疗相关背景
<6-20,House>We have no baseline, no context for medical treatment.

119
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,150
<6-21,Foreman>哇  看着像是胰岛素
<6-21,Foreman>Wow. Looks just like insulin.

120
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,290
<6-22,House>呕吐  还湿的
<6-22,House>Vomit. Still moist.

121
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,170
<6-22,House>你怎么想  几天前的吗
<6-22,House>What do you think? Couple of days old?

122
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,640
<6-23,Chase>噢  你想让我骂人吗
<6-23,Chase>Ugh! You trying to make me hurl?

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,810
<6-24,House>对  精彩收场
<6-24,House>Yeah. And here's the big finish.

124
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,580
<6-26,House>咸的
<6-26,House>Salty.

125
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,000
<6-26,House>化学物质失衡
<6-26,House>Chemical imbalance.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,430
<6-27,Wilson>-低镁血症会导致抽搐  -或者高钙
<6-27,Wilson>- Low magnesium could cause a twitch. - Or high calcium.

127
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,240
<6-28,House>或者是个巧合  重点是
<6-28,House>Or it's a coincidence. The point is,

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,110
<6-28,House>我们什么都不知道
<6-28,House>we don't know anything.

129
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,660
<6-29,Foreman>所以做核磁共振  找出来
<6-29,Foreman>So do the M.R.I. Find out.

130
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,970
<6-30,House>核磁共振可以等等再做  先补充电解质
<6-30,House>The M.R.I. can wait. Hang a banana bag.

131
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,110
<6-30,House>维持24小时  纠正电解质紊乱
<6-30,House>Give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

132
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,450
<6-30,House>然后我们再继续
<6-30,House>We'll take it from there.

133
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,960
<6-31,Wilson>不错  多谢
<6-31,Wilson>Great. Thanks.

134
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,730
<6-32,Foreman>好的  就算她没装
<6-32,Foreman>Okay, even if she's not faking,

135
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,290
<6-32,Foreman>这个病例哪点吸引着你
<6-32,Foreman>what's so fascinating about this case

136
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,640
<6-33,House>目前而言  你那不想我接这个病例的态度
<6-33,House>At the moment, how much you don't want me to take it.

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,530
<6-33,House>让我觉得十分有趣
<6-33,House>That's pretty fascinating.

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,300
<7-1,Chase>把福曼医生的画的真像啊
<7-1,Chase>Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman.

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,430
<7-1,Chase>这是有史以来最帅的一张了
<7-1,Chase>In fact, he's never looked better.

140
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,240
<7-2,Jane>看的出他不喜欢我
<7-2,Jane>He doesn't like me. I can tell.

141
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,780
<7-3,Chase>没关系  他也不喜欢我
<7-3,Chase>It's okay. He doesn't like me either.

142
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,810
<7-4,Jane>谁是詹姆斯
<7-4,Jane>Who's James?

143
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,260
<7-5,Chase>头疼吗
<7-5,Chase>Pain in your head?

144
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,190
<7-6,Jane>放开我
<7-6,Jane>Get away from me!

145
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,600
<7-6,Jane>让她冷静下来
<7-6,Jane>let's cool her out.

146
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,460
<7-7,Foreman>1毫克安定  推注
<7-7,Foreman>One milligram Ativan, push.

147
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,020
<7-8,Jane>不要  不要  不要
<7-8,Jane>No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

148
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,840
<7-9,Foreman>她咬我
<7-9,Foreman>She bit me!

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,470
<7-10,Chase>好消息是  她没有艾滋和丙肝
<7-10,Chase>Good news is, she's negative for HIV and Hep "C."

150
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,240
<7-11,Foreman>我去打针破伤风  给她做核磁共振
<7-11,Foreman>Yeah? I'm getting a tetanus shot. She's getting an M.R.I.

151
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,270
<7-12,Chase>非紧急核磁共振要等两天
<7-12,Chase>There's a two-day wait for nonemergency M.R.I.'s.

152
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,470
<7-13,Foreman>马上给她做核磁共振  做完就送走
<7-13,Foreman>She's getting an M.R.I.! Then she's outta here.

153
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,200
<8-1,Angela>不过泰哈克医生明确说过
<8-1,Angela>But Dr. Terhark specifically said

154
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,990
<8-1,Angela>我的核磁共振检查在上午10点
<8-1,Angela>I'd have the M.R.I. At 10:00.

155
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,090
<8-1,Angela>现在都快11点了  我预检都还没呢
<8-1,Angela>It's almost 11:00, and I haven't even had the pre-test yet.

156
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,970
<8-2,Nurse>抱歉  我们有点忙
<8-2,Nurse>Sorry. We're a little backed up.

157
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,720
<8-4,Foreman>打扰  你是泰哈克医生10点的病人吗
<8-4,Foreman>Excuse me. You're Dr. Terhark's 10:00?

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,350
<8-5,Patient>我是安吉拉·惠特尼
<8-5,Patient>I'm Angela Whitney.

159
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,710
<8-5,Patient>我11点半要见我的装璜师
<8-5,Patient>I'm meeting my decorator at 11:30.

160
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,490
<8-5,Patient>她大老远从纽约来
<8-5,Patient>She's coming all the way from New York.

161
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,390
<8-5,Patient>泰哈克医生曾许诺我能及时赶上
<8-5,Patient>Dr. Terhark promised I'd be home in time.

162
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,520
<8-6,Foreman>当然
<8-6,Foreman>Of course.

163
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,730
<8-7,Cuddy>她打算做核磁共振的预检吗
<8-7,Cuddy>She just about prepped for her M.R.I.?

164
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,600
<8-7,Cuddy>惠特尼太太吗
<8-7,Cuddy>Mrs. Whitney?

165
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,700
<9-1,Cuddy>你们企图偷别人的检查
<9-1,Cuddy>You tried to steal someone else's test.

166
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,850
<9-2,Foreman>泰哈克医生是整形外科医生
<9-2,Foreman>Dr. Terhark is a plastic surgeon.

167
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,790
<9-2,Foreman>这女人是为6个月前的下颚填充术做复诊
<9-2,Foreman>The woman was getting a six-month checkup on her chin implants.

168
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,290
<9-3,Cuddy>-不敢相信你竟然允许他们这么做  -真的吗
<9-3,Cuddy>- I can't believe you authorized this. - Really?

169
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,340
<9-4,House>听着就是我的一贯作风
<9-4,House>It sounds exactly like something I'd do.

170
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,700
<9-4,House>她不能做核磁共振
<9-4,House>She can't have an M.R.I.

171
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,730
<9-5,Cuddy>断层扫描显示她手臂里有接骨钉
<9-5,Cuddy>The C.T. Scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm.

172
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,930
<9-5,Cuddy>核磁共振会把它从她体内吸出来的
<9-5,Cuddy>The M.R.I. Magnet would have ripped it out of her body.

173
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,920
<9-5,Cuddy>你们看喜欢外星人电影吗
<9-5,Cuddy>You like the Alien movies?

174
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,970
<9-5,Cuddy>你们没有医疗记录  在想什么呢
<9-5,Cuddy>You had no medical history. What were you thinking?

175
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,430
<9-6,House>我们会手术取出接骨钉
<9-6,House>We'll surgically remove the pin,

176
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,190
<9-6,House>然后做核磁共振  行吗
<9-6,House>then do the M.R.I. Does that sound good?

177
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,090
<9-7,Cuddy>她是电解质失衡
<9-7,Cuddy>She has an electrolyte imbalance.

178
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,770
<9-8,House>福曼医生  一个神经科专家
<9-8,House>Dr. Foreman, a neurologist,

179
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,580
<9-8,House>他相信这女人有脑部肿瘤
<9-8,House>believes this woman has a brain tumor.

180
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,960
<9-9,Foreman>实际上  我
<9-9,Foreman>Actually, I-

181
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,270
<9-10,House>永远不要为医学见解道歉
<9-10,House>Hey, don't ever apologize for a medical opinion.

182
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,800
<9-10,House>要是他对了而我们没做检查  病人会死
<9-10,House>If he's right and we don't do this test, the patient dies.

183
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,860
<9-10,House>我知道你有你的专长领域
<9-10,House>I realize that you have a specialty of your own,

184
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,800
<9-10,House>不过你的专长和大脑有关吗
<9-10,House>but does yours have anything to do with the brain?

185
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,810
<9-10,House>那可是他的专长领域
<9-10,House>His does.

186
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,910
<9-10,House>行
<9-10,House>Fine.

187
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,340
<9-11,Cuddy>不过在弄清她身份前  不准做其它检查了
<9-11,Cuddy>But nothing more until you find out who she is.

188
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,650
<9-12,Foreman>我们怎么才能
<9-12,Foreman>How are we supposed to-

189
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,740
<9-13,House>他认识的无家可归者多了去了  无人能及啊
<9-13,House>Hey! He knows more homeless people than any of us.

190
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,300
<9-13,House>去问问她的邻居  跟踪狂
<9-13,House>Go check out the hood, dog.

191
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
<10-1,Homeless Man>我不知道
<10-1,Homeless Man>I don't know.

192
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
<10-1,Homeless Man>我在附近见过好多人
<10-1,Homeless Man>I've seen a lot of faces around here,

193
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,210
<10-1,Homeless Man>但我不记得见过她
<10-1,Homeless Man>but I don't think I know her.

194
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,020
<10-2,Foreman>好吧
<10-2,Foreman>Great.

195
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,600
<10-3,Homeless Man>那个...我喜欢你的外套
<10-3,Homeless Man>Say, I, uh, like that jacket.

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,240
<10-3,Homeless Man>对  现在想起来了
<10-3,Homeless Man>Yeah, uh, it's all comin' to me now.

197
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
<10-3,Homeless Man>我知道她的东西放哪里
<10-3,Homeless Man>I know where she keeps her stuff.

198
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,090
<10-3,Homeless Man>就是蝙蝠罢了
<10-3,Homeless Man>Just bats.

199
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,850
<10-3,Homeless Man>我以为衬里会厚点
<10-3,Homeless Man>I thought the lining would be thicker.

200
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,230
<12-1,Cameron>没有肿瘤  什么都没  她的大脑没事
<12-1,Cameron>No tumor. Nothing. Her brain is clear.

201
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,380
<12-2,Chase>意味着那女孩要去做手术
<12-2,Chase>Which means that girl had surgery

202
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,640
<12-2,Chase>那样你才不会被卡迪骂
<12-2,Chase>just so you wouldn't get reamed out by Cuddy.

203
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,940
<12-3,Wilson>没必要  她仍有可能有些神经上的问题
<12-3,Wilson>Not necessarily. There could still be something neurological going on.

204
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,620
<12-4,Foreman>是啊  她没骗我们  骗我们的是核磁共振
<12-4,Foreman>Sure. She's not conning us. The M.R.I. is.

205
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,350
<12-5,House>这种天气不穿外套
<12-5,House>Not wearing a coat in this weather.

206
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,930
<12-5,House>-太不正常了  -她画了这些
<12-5,House>- That is so wrong. - She drew these.

207
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,090
<12-6,Foreman>可能给我们些提示
<12-6,Foreman>They might give us a clue.

208
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,000
<12-7,House>她签名了吗  可以从她的名字着手
<12-7,House>She sign them? Her name would be a start.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,640
<12-8,Foreman>所有的神秘故事  地点
<12-8,Foreman>All the mythology, the locations,

210
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,790
<12-8,Foreman>都源于她的生活经历
<12-8,Foreman>they'd all depend on her life experience.

211
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,620
<12-8,Foreman>费城
<12-8,Foreman>Philadelphia.

212
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,460
<12-9,House>看那天际线
<12-9,House>Look at that skyline.

213
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,530
<12-9,House>非常有共鸣啊
<12-9,House>It's very evocative.

214
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,040
<12-9,House>克莱斯勒大厦
<12-9,House>The Chrysler Building.

215
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,590
<12-11,Cameron>-那是云  -克莱斯勒大厦在纽约
<12-11,Cameron>- That's a cloud. - And the Chrysler Building's in New York.

216
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,310
<12-12,House>我越来越费城了
<12-12,House>Ehh, I'm getting Philly.

217
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,160
<12-12,House>仙人掌  那是  那是一辆撞烂了的车
<12-12,House>And that cactus, well, it's a- it's a smashed car.

218
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,390
<12-13,Cameron>-是车祸  -仙人掌在费城吗
<12-13,Cameron>- It's a car accident. - A cactus in Philadelphia?

219
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,540
<12-14,House>-水  10月是雨季  对吗  -对
<12-14,House>- Water. Well, water's October, right? - Obviously.

220
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,410
<12-15,Wilson>22页  那就是2002年10月2号
<12-15,Wilson>Well, the page number 22, so that's October 2, 2002.

221
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,750
<12-16,House>因此  病人2年前10月经历一场车祸
<12-16,House>Ergo, the patient was in a car accident two years ago last October.

222
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,240
<12-17,Wilson>老天  她没事吗
<12-17,Wilson>My goodness. Was she okay?

223
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,580
<12-18,House>断了胳膊吧
<12-18,House>Broke her arm, I think.

224
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,920
<12-18,House>他们用这个修复了
<12-18,House>They fixed it with this.

225
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,630
<12-19,House>接骨钉
<12-19,House>Surgical pin.

226
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,140
<12-19,House>比钱包好多了
<12-19,House>Better than a wallet.

227
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,140
<12-19,House>为了以备召回  接骨钉序列号和病人姓名对应

<14-19,Wilson>他们看了  找不到原因  10个月后
<14-19,Wilson>They look, they can't find anything. Ten months later,

282
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,850
<14-19,Wilson>她为何还要再去
<14-19,Wilson>why should she subject herself to that again?

<14-26,Foreman>And the cancer wouldn't account for the alleged twitch

291
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,380
<14-26,Foreman>或者任何其它所谓症状
<14-26,Foreman>or any ofher other alleged symptoms.

<17-8,House>已经到女童子军饼干义卖时间了吗
<17-8,House>Time for Girl Scout cookies already?

341
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,000
<17-9,Wilson>给我来点薄荷味巧克力华夫
<17-9,Wilson>Get me some thin mints.

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,340
<17-10,Cuddy>既然你病情严重  无法进行门诊工作
<17-10,Cuddy>Since you're too sick to work in the clinic-

343
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,800
<17-11,House>行
<17-11,House>Okay.

344
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,550
<17-12,Cuddy>我想你
<17-12,Cuddy>I thought you- -

345
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,060
<17-14,Cuddy>我想你能做点教学工作  病史课
<17-14,Cuddy>I thought you could do some teaching. Patient histories.

346
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,130
<17-15,House>我的领域
<17-15,House>My specialty.

347
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,440
<17-16,Cuddy>教学相长  不觉得吗
<17-16,Cuddy>When you teach, you learn so much. Don't you think?

348
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,040
<17-17,House>这纯粹就是报复
<17-17,House>It's all about the giving back.

349
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,140
<17-17,House>老好人卡迪  总是在算计
<17-17,House>Good old Cuddy. Always thinking.

350
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,240
<17-17,House>她安排你们去询问病人病史了吗
<17-17,House>She assign you a patient to interview?

351
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,340
<17-19,House>那么你们还在这里干嘛
<17-19,House>Then why are you still here?

352
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,640
<18-1,Chase>为什么我们接这个病人
<18-1,Chase>Why are we on this case?

353
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,730
<18-2,Cameron>因为威尔森让豪斯帮忙
<18-2,Cameron>'Cause Wilson asked House to do him a favor.

354
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,290
<18-3,Chase>我觉得豪斯就是想证明她是病了
<18-3,Chase>I think House just wants to prove she's sick

355
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:27,890
<18-3,Chase>福曼错了
<18-3,Chase>so Foreman will be wrong.

356
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,330
<18-4,Cameron>哦  你们这些家伙
<18-4,Cameron>Oh, you boys.

357
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,230
<18-5,Chase>我在做本职工作罢了
<18-5,Chase>Hey, I'm just doing my job.

358
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,230
<18-5,Chase>等福曼发现了她真的有癌症  他就要糗大了
<18-5,Chase>Foreman's gonna be so embarrassed when he finds out she's got cancer.

359
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,630
<18-5,Chase>我以为你病得下不来了呢
<18-5,Chase>Ah. I thought you were too sick to be down here.

360
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,670
<19-1,Wilson>我得甩开那些学生  所以伪造了个寻呼
<19-1,Wilson>I had to get away from those students, so I faked a page.

361
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,160
<19-2,House>福曼的父母  40年幸福婚姻
<19-2,House>Foreman's parents, happily married, 40 years.

362
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,660
<19-3,Wilson>恭喜[希伯来语  多用于婚礼祝福]
<19-3,Wilson>Mazel tov.

363
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,160
<19-3,Wilson>福星高照啊
<19-3,Wilson>Kein ayin hara.

364
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,650
<19-4,House>那么为何他讨厌无家可归者呢
<19-4,House>So why does he hate homeless people?

365
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,190
<19-4,House>要是有个叔叔或者祖父母曾流落街头
<19-4,House>I mean, if it's an uncle or a grandparent,

366
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,830
<19-4,House>通常他会在大学申请陈述里提到
<19-4,House>you'd think he'd use it in his college application essay.

367
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,260
<19-4,House>家庭不幸总比平均绩点4.0有竞争力
<19-4,House>Family struggles beats a 4.0 G.P.A. Any day.

368
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,750
<19-5,Wilson>我觉得他已经有4.0了
<19-5,Wilson>I think he had a 4.0.

369
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,670
<19-6,House>或许他就是个势利眼
<19-6,House>Maybe he's just a snob.

370
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,390
<19-7,Wilson>真的没必要事无巨细
<19-7,Wilson>You really don't need to know everything about everybody.

371
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,180
<19-8,House>我没必要看《橘子郡男孩》  不过看了开心
<19-8,House>I don't need to watch The O.C., but it makes me happy.

372
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,790
<19-9,Wilson>对  狂喜啊  另一个文件是什么
<19-9,Wilson>Yeah, delirious. What's the other file?

374
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,340
<19-10,House>你认识他吗
<19-10,House>You know him?

375
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,440
<19-11,Wilson>要知道  在一些文化传统中
<19-11,Wilson>You know, in some cultures,

376
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,850
<19-11,Wilson>窥探朋友生活几乎是被认为是无礼行为
<19-11,Wilson>it's considered almost rude for one friend to spy on another.

377
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,070
<19-11,Wilson>当然   "朋友"这个词翻成瑞典语
<19-11,Wilson>Of course, in Swedish, the word "Friend" Can also

378
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,910
<19-11,Wilson>就是"瘸腿蠢蛋"
<19-11,Wilson>be translated as "Limping twerp."

379
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,990
<19-12,Wilson>你的呼机是真的响了
<19-12,Wilson>Did your pager really just go off,

380
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,730
<19-12,Wilson>还是你想逃避对话
<19-12,Wilson>or are you ditching the conversation?

381
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,910
<19-13,House>为什么不能都是真的呢  走吧
<19-13,House>Why can't both be true? Come on.

382
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,700
<20-1,Wilson>左侧卵巢非囊性实体瘤

<20-1,Wilson>Central necrosis.

385
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,150
<20-1,Wilson>唯一的疑问就是
<20-1,Wilson>The only question is

386
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,850
<20-1,Wilson>她是两个月内死还是3个月
<20-1,Wilson>whether she dies in two months or three.

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,310
<20-3,Wilson>天  你是对的
<20-3,Wilson>God. You were right.

388
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,370
<20-3,Wilson>我们回天乏术了
<20-3,Wilson>There's nothing we can do for her here.

389
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,940
<20-3,Wilson>不如把她送回大街上去吧
<20-3,Wilson>Might as well put her back on the street.

390
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,450
<20-4,House>除非这不是癌症
<20-4,House>Unless it's not cancer.

391
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,270
<20-5,Chase>-你开玩笑  -多逗啊
<20-5,Chase>- Ah, you're joking. - Well, hard not to.

392
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,930
<20-6,House>癌症最有意思了
<20-6,House>Nothing funnier than cancer.

393
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,100
<20-6,House>或许是结核瘤
<20-6,House>What if it's a tuberculoma?

394
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,390
<20-6,House>她流落街头  全年无休地呼吸那些废气
<20-6,House>She's living out on the streets, breathing all kinds of crap 24-7.

395
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,470
<20-6,House>她可能得了肺结核
<20-6,House>The odds are, she's got T.B.

396
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,640
<20-6,House>为什么就不能是良性的呢
<20-6,House>Why can't she have a nice, benign growth to go with it?

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,740
<20-7,Wilson>实体瘤在她卵巢内

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
<20-7,Wilson>卵巢癌的可能性更大

399
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,890
<20-8,House>没错  差远了
<20-8,House>You're right. It's not even close.

400
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,940
<20-8,House>开始给她用异烟肼  利福平和链霉素
<20-8,House>Start her on I.N.H., rifampin and streptomycin.

401
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,070
<20-9,Cameron>但这是对结核瘤的治疗
<20-9,Cameron>But that's the treatment for a tuberculoma.

402
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,970
<20-10,House>那么晚期卵巢癌怎么治
<20-10,House>And what is the treatment for advanced ovarian cancer?

<21-1,Victoria>-给我用的是什么药  -第二剂抗生素
<21-1,Victoria>- What are you giving me? - A second dose of antibiotics.

405
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,860
<21-2,Foreman>要是你得的是结核瘤  会有帮助的
<21-2,Foreman>If you've got a tuberculoma, it should help.

406
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,760
<21-3,Victoria>我得的不是结核瘤  是吗
<21-3,Victoria>I don't have a tuberculoma, do I?

407
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,070
<21-4,Foreman>可能不是
<21-4,Foreman>Probably not.

408
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,560
<21-6,Foreman>听着  我很抱歉曾不信任你
<21-6,Foreman>Hey, listen. I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

<21-8,Foreman>你结过婚吗  维多利亚
<21-8,Foreman>Were you ever married, Victoria?

413
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,930
<21-8,Foreman>不过在漫画里
<21-8,Foreman>But in the comic, it- Well,

414
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,180
<21-9,Victoria>就是漫画罢了  漫画都是虚构的
<21-9,Victoria>it's a comic. Comics are just made up.

415
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,950
<21-9,Victoria>那么詹姆斯是谁
<21-9,Victoria>So who's James?

416
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,540
<21-10,Foreman>真有这个人吗  还是你虚构的
<21-10,Foreman>Is he real, or did you make him up?

417
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,460
<21-11,Victoria>他是真的
<21-11,Victoria>He's real.

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,670
<22-1,Foreman>不是结核瘤
<22-1,Foreman>It's not a tuberculoma.

441
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,190
<22-1,Foreman>肯定不是
<22-1,Foreman>Can't be.

442
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,770
<22-2,House>我不知道活检结果已经出来了
<22-2,House>I didn't know the biopsy was back.

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,350
<22-4,House>她奄奄一息了

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,300
<22-6,Foreman>她高烧得吓人
<22-6,Foreman>Her temp's through the roof.

<22-7,Chase>活检报告  结核瘤无误
<22-7,Chase>The lab results from the biopsy. It's definitely a tuberculoma.

450
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,570
<22-8,House>那么  我们的诊断是对的
<22-8,House>So, we're right about the diagnosis,

451
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,280
<22-8,House>可是相应的治疗却要害死她
<22-8,House>and the treatment for that diagnosis is killing her.

452
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,090
<22-8,House>棒极了
<22-8,House>Perfect.

453
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,120
<23-1,Chase>实验室复查了活检
<23-1,Chase>The lab checked the biopsy again, twice.

454
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,900
<23-2,Foreman>好吧  结核瘤不会导致105度高烧
<23-2,Foreman>Well, a tuberculoma doesn't give you a temperature of 105.

455
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,110
<23-3,Chase>那么就是结核瘤和其他什么
<23-3,Chase>Then it's a tuberculoma and something else.

456
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,450
<23-4,Wilson>这"其他什么"要把她脑子烧化掉
<23-4,Wilson>The "Something else" Is gonna melt her brain.

457
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,660
<23-5,House>水煮了
<23-5,House>Poach.

458
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,020
<23-5,House>这个比喻更恰当点
<23-5,House>Better metaphor.

459
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,330
<23-6,Chase>这么烫  应该是细菌引起的
<23-6,Chase>A fever that high has to be bacterial.

460
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,500
<23-7,Wilson>或许活检过程中肠部破裂
<23-7,Wilson>Maybe the bowel got nicked in the biopsy.

461
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,540
<23-8,Foreman>我亲手做的活检  肠部没有破裂
<23-8,Foreman>I did the biopsy. No nick.

462
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,750
<23-8,Foreman>她可能是在大街上染上的
<23-8,Foreman>She could have picked up an infection on the streets.

463
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,490
<23-9,Wilson>她入院的时候并没有发烧
<23-9,Wilson>She didn't have a fever when I admitted her.

464
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,530
<23-10,Cameron>百忧解可能会诱发血清素综合征
<23-10,Cameron>The Prozac we gave her could have triggered serotonin syndrome,

465
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,230
<23-10,Cameron>能解释发烧
<23-10,Cameron>which would explain the fever.

466
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,580
<23-11,Wilson>不  杰弗逊医院也给她用百忧解了
<23-11,Wilson>No. Jefferson put her on Prozac

467
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,660
<23-12,Foreman>-没有问题  -她可能从未遵医嘱
<23-12,Foreman>- and it wasn't a problem. - She probably never took it!

468
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,460
<23-12,Foreman>他们很有可能只接诊了她一次
<23-12,Foreman>Most likely, they saw her one time

469
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,120
<23-12,Foreman>就给了个证明  把她赶出急诊室
<23-12,Foreman>and dumped her out of the E.R. with a scrip.

470
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,240
<23-13,Wilson>-就想你打算做的  -够了 你们两个
<23-13,Wilson>- Oh, just like you were gonna do! - Okay, you two.

471
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,140
<23-14,House>拿把手术刀  像个医生一样解决问题
<23-14,House>Grab some scalpels and settle this like doctors.

472
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,540
<23-14,House>送血和尿细菌培养  做胸部X光检查
<23-14,House>Send blood and urine cultures and get a chest X-ray.

473
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,360
<23-14,House>好  停用百忧解
<23-14,House>Fine, take her off the Prozac and

474
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,790
<23-14,House>改用治疗血清素综合征的溴隐亭
<23-14,House>put her on Bromocryptene for the serotonin syndrome.

475
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,660
<23-15,Chase>要是我们想她活着到检查结果出来
<23-15,Chase>Might wanna get her in an ice bath as well,

476
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,480
<23-15,Chase>最好同时让她冰浴降温
<23-15,Chase>assuming we want her to live long enough to see those test results.

477
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,520
<24-1,Victoria>我说了抱歉
<24-1,Victoria>I said I was sorry.

478
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,860
<24-2,Foreman>你高烧105度  要是不尽快降温
<24-2,Foreman>Your fever's 105. If we don't bring it down fast-

479
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,690
<24-3,Victoria>福曼  为什么这么对我
<24-3,Victoria>Foreman, why are you doing this to me?

480
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,540
<24-4,Foreman>我在救你的命
<24-4,Foreman>I'm saving your life.

481
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,530
<24-4,Foreman>不  我不想进去
<24-4,Foreman>No, don't make me go in there,

482
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,050
<24-5,Victoria>求你  我不想进去  求你
<24-5,Victoria>please. Don't make me do it, please!

483
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,190
<24-6,Foreman>我不想进去
<24-6,Foreman>I don't wanna go!

484
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,930
<24-6,Foreman>坚持下  你能行的
<24-6,Foreman>Come on. You can do this.

485
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,670
<24-6,Foreman>求你
<24-6,Foreman>Please.!

486
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,980
<25-1,Student 1>17岁的女性  手腕呈现擦伤
<25-1,Student 1>Seventeen-year-old female presents with abrasions

487
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,880
<25-1,Student 1>和明显外伤
<25-1,Student 1>and apparent trauma injury to her wrist.

488
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,640
<25-2,House>-豪斯医生  -继续
<25-2,House>- Dr. House? - Continue.

489
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,310
<25-3,Student 1>你在看漫画
<25-3,Student 1>You're reading a comic book.

490
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,690
<25-3,Student 1>你穿了件低领上衣想让人注意你的胸部
<25-3,Student 1>And you're calling attention to your bosom by wearing a low-cut top.

491
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,060
<25-3,Student 1>对不起
<25-3,Student 1>Oh, I'm sorry.

492
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,460
<25-3,Student 1>我以为我们在进行"大家来找茬"比赛
<25-3,Student 1>I thought we were having a"State the obvious" Contest.

493
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,410
<25-3,Student 1>我天性要强
<25-3,Student 1>I'm competitive by nature.

494
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,040
<26-1,Student 2>你觉得你该听我们陈述病史
<26-1,Student 2>I thought you were supposed to be listening to our patient histories.

495
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,900
<26-2,House>不  我该教你们
<26-2,House>No, I'm supposed to be teaching you.

496
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,530
<26-2,House>要是我不用听就能教  我就更牛了
<26-2,House>If I can do that without listening, more power to me.

497
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,320
<26-3,Student 2>-17岁女性  -这家伙要是拥有号称
<26-3,Student 2>- Seventeen-year-old female - If this guy's supposed to have

498
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,030
<26-4,House>能抗拒地球引力的宇宙力量
<26-4,House>uiversal power over all gravity,

499
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,020
<26-4,House>他的头发怎么还是下垂的呢
<26-4,House>how come his hair won't stay down?

500
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,520
<26-4,House>太笨了
<26-4,House>That's just stupid.

501
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,420
<26-5,Student 2>她在县里骑马时不慎落马
<26-5,Student 2>She fell off her horse while riding in the county fair.

502
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,340
<26-6,Student 1>不是  她是从沙滩别墅台阶上摔下来的
<26-6,Student 1>No, she didn't. She fell off the steps of her beach house.

503
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,790
<26-6,Student 1>你肯定走错房间了
<26-6,Student 1>You must have gone to the wrong room.

504
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,860
<26-7,House>不敢相信  病人能躲过卡迪
<26-7,House>Hard to believe that one patient could slip past Cuddy

505
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,670
<26-7,House>仅凭手腕扭伤入院
<26-7,House>and get herself admitted with a sprained wrist.

506
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,700
<26-7,House>两个就更不可能了  哪个房间
<26-7,House>Two seems almost impossible. What room?

507
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,970
<26-8,Students>2106室
<26-8,Students>Room 2106.

508
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,150
<26-9,House>病人撒谎  不过通常一次撒一个
<26-9,House>Patients lie, but usually only one lie at a time.

509
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,430
<26-9,House>她体重多少
<26-9,House>How much does she weigh?

510
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,910
<26-10,Student 1>-是她的手腕  不是体重  -体重  女士们
<26-10,Student 1>- It's her wrist, not her weight- - Poundage, ladies.

511
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,050
<26-11,House>-顺别问下  她鼻子什么颜色  -她很瘦
<26-11,House>- And by-the-by, what color's her nose? - She's thin.

512
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,540
<26-14,Student 1>-肤色  -这和她的手腕有什么关系
<26-14,Student 1>- Flesh tone? - What does this have to do with her wrist?

513
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,250
<26-15,House>几乎无关
<26-15,House>Almost nothing.

514
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,110
<26-15,House>她不是低于90磅
<26-15,House>She's either under ninety pounds

515
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,830
<26-15,House>就是红鼻子  我该走了
<26-15,House>or she has a red nose. I gotta go.

516
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,220
<26-16,Student 1>她有什么问题
<26-16,Student 1>What's wrong with her? -

517
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,230
<26-17,House>那就是揭露谜底了
<26-17,House>That would be telling.

518
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,920
<26-17,House>我太善良了
<26-17,House>Oh, I am just too nice.

519
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,120
<26-17,House>病名是"C"打头的
<26-17,House>It starts with "C."

520
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,140
<27-1,Chase>-尿检阴性  -胸片也是
<27-1,Chase>- Urine cultures are negative. - So is the chest X-ray.

521
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,240
<27-3,House>下一个就该是阳性了吧
<27-3,House>I assume there's a positive coming.

522
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,060
<27-4,Foreman>腰椎穿刺结果提示蛋白含量升高
<27-4,Foreman>Lumbar punctures reveal elevated proteins

523
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,420
<27-4,Foreman>白细胞数上升
<27-4,Foreman>and white counts.

524
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,310
<27-5,Wilson>-脑脊液培养呢  -进行中
<27-5,Wilson>- C.S.F. Cultures? - Still brewing.

525
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,730
<27-6,Cameron>革兰氏染色没有结果  看着像脑膜炎
<27-6,Cameron>Nothing on gram stain. It looks like meningitis.

526
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,070
<27-7,Chase>我们知道绝对是感染  知道感染部位
<27-7,Chase>We know it's definitely an infection, and we know where it is.

527
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,540
<27-8,House>脑膜炎合理简单
<27-8,House>Well, meningitis is nice and simple.

528
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,780
<27-8,House>隔离她  用头孢曲松
<27-8,House>Get her in isolation and start her on Ceftriaxone.

529
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,020
<27-8,House>她要不好转  要不完蛋
<27-8,House>Either she gets better, or she dies.

530
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,860
<27-8,House>告诉我结果
<27-8,House>Let me know which one happens.

531
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,480
<28-1,Cameron>老天  给她用了镇静剂的
<28-1,Cameron>Oh, my God! She was sedated.

532
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,950
<28-2,Chase>一定是失效了
<28-2,Chase>It must have worn off.

533
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,240
<28-3,Foreman>我半小时前亲自给的药
<28-3,Foreman>I did it myself a half hour ago.

534
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,040
<28-4,Chase>我去护士站问问
<28-4,Chase>I'll check the nurse's station.

535
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,060
<28-4,Chase>柯林达伊卡
<28-4,Chase>Calendraica.

536
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,730
<28-6,Foreman>她会死在外面的
<28-6,Foreman>She's gonna die out there.

537
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,770
<28-6,Foreman>用了10毫克氟哌丁苯制剂
<28-6,Foreman>You don't walk out of a room

538
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,890
<29-1,Wilson>是无法离开房间的
<29-1,Wilson>with 10 milligrams of Haldol in your system.

539
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,150
<29-1,Wilson>走都不能走
<29-1,Wilson>You don't walk at all.

540
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,840
<29-2,Foreman>我可给她注射了10毫克啊
<29-2,Foreman>It was 10 milligrams! I gave it to her.

541
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,010
<29-3,Cuddy>不重要了  细菌性脑膜炎  高感染性
<29-3,Cuddy>It doesn't matter! Bacterial meningitis- highly contagious.

542
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,350
<29-3,Cuddy>要是她出了医院  我们绝对要负责的
<29-3,Cuddy>If she is out of the hospital, we are so liable.

543
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,740
<29-4,Wilson>不用担心  她感染别人前就会完蛋
<29-4,Wilson>Not to worry. She'll be dead before she can kill anybody.

544
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,710
<29-5,Chase>监控录像确认了  她偷了衣服  跑了
<29-5,Chase>Security tape confirms it. She stole some clothes and she's gone.

545
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,010
<29-6,House>衣服错了  大衣在衣柜里  干洗过了
<29-6,House>Wrong coat. The cape's in the closet. I had it cleaned.

546
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,010
<29-8,House>-有意思  -你打算救她吗
<29-8,House>- Funny. - You gonna save her?

547
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,620
<29-9,Foreman>在她的漫画里  弗利先生住斯隆港
<29-9,Foreman>In her comics, Mr. Fury lives in Sloan Harbor.

548
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,690
<29-9,Foreman>入院那晚  她在斯隆街1408号发狂
<29-9,Foreman>The night she came in, she was at a rave at 1408 Sloan Street.

549
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,650
<29-10,House>你看了漫画  天啊  斗转星移啊
<29-10,House>You've been reading. My, how you've changed.

550
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,020
<29-11,Cuddy>你是医生  做医生该做的
<29-11,Cuddy>You are a doctor. Do what doctors do.

551
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,080
<29-11,Cuddy>拿起电话  拨911
<29-11,Cuddy>Pick up the phone, dial 911,

552
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,400
<29-11,Cuddy>然后警察那头会做他们份内的事
<29-11,Cuddy>and a cop on the other end does what cops do...

553
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,200
<29-11,Cuddy>去找失踪人士
<29-11,Cuddy>and finds the missing person.

554
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,380
<29-11,Cuddy>我想剩下的有医生分内的事要做
<29-11,Cuddy>I assume the rest of you have doctor things to do.

555
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,700
<29-11,Cuddy>我知道你有
<29-11,Cuddy>I know you do.

557
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,100
<30-2,House>知道那是什么吗
<30-2,House>Do you even know what that is?

558
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,230
<30-2,House>还是你就是随便猜个C开头的
<30-2,House>Or are you just guessing everything that starts with "C"?

559
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,680
<30-3,Student 2>肾脏问题可能导致体重下降
<30-3,Student 2>The kidney problems could result in weight loss.

560
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,580
<30-4,House>卡-里二氏病  C-A-C-
<30-4,House>Cacchi. C-A-C-

561
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,860
<30-4,House>老天  她还真按字母顺序来的
<30-4,House>Oh, geez, she's going alphabetically.

562
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,760
<30-5,Student 1>医生  你为什么带那个鸟的别针
<30-5,Student 1>Doctor, why are you wearing that bird pin?

563
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,800
<30-6,House>能衬出我的眼睛
<30-6,House>It sets off my eyes.

564
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,960
<30-6,House>你好  约迪  我是豪斯医生
<30-6,House>Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.

565
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,580
<30-6,House>你为什么入院的
<30-6,House>What brings you to the hospital?

566
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,170
<30-7,Jodi>我的手腕
<30-7,Jodi>My wrist.

567
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,560
<30-8,House>怎么回事
<30-8,House>How did that happen?

568
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,340
<30-9,Jodi>那时我在坐摩天轮
<30-9,Jodi>I was riding the Ferris wheel,

569
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,520
<30-9,Jodi>然后有个巨型海鸥朝我飞来
<30-9,Jodi>and this huge seagull flew right at me.

570
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,170
<30-10,House>太恐怖了
<30-10,House>How horrifying.

571
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,670
<30-11,Jodi>我冲着它挥胳膊  结果撞到了摩天轮
<30-11,Jodi>I swung my arm at the bird, but I hit the Ferris wheel.

572
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,920
<30-13,Student 2>都是她编的吗
<30-13,Student 2>She's making it all up?

573
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,820
<30-14,House>没有  她的手腕真伤了
<30-14,House>No, her wrist really does hurt.

574
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,400
<30-15,Jodi>我没撒谎
<30-15,Jodi>I'm not lying.

575
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,860
<30-16,House>当然撒了  你根本不知道发生什么
<30-16,House>Of course you are. You have no idea what happened.

576
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,120
<30-16,House>你的记忆一片空白
<30-16,House>You have no memory.

577
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,960
<30-16,House>科萨科夫综合征
<30-16,House>Korsakoff's syndrome.

578
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,610
<30-16,House>过量饮酒或营养不良导致大脑损伤
<30-16,House>Her brain is damaged by excessive drinking or insufficient diet,

579
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,730
<30-16,House>显然是后者
<30-16,House>pretty obviously the latter.

580
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,490
<30-16,House>她没有新的记忆  没有思维
<30-16,House>She has no new memories, no new ideas.

581
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,440
<30-16,House>甚至不能处理这个事实
<30-16,House>Can't even process that idea.

582
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,990
<30-16,House>所以大脑用视觉线索尽可能填补断层
<30-16,House>So her brain fills the gaps as best it can using visual clues.

583
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,010
<30-16,House>你衣服上的马让她联想到骑马事故
<30-16,House>The horse on your shirt led her to the riding accident,

584
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,080
<30-16,House>你笔记板上的冲浪带她去了海滩
<30-16,House>and the surfscene on your clipboard led her to the beach.

585
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,570
<30-17,Student 2>"科萨科夫综合征"不是C开头的
<30-17,Student 2>"Korsakoff" Doesn't start with a "C."

586
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,340
<30-18,House>我没说C
<30-18,House>I didn't say "C."

587
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,900
<30-18,House>我说了吗
<30-18,House>Or did I?

588
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,600
<30-18,House>学好了
<30-18,House>Lesson to be learned-

589
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
<30-18,House>把所有人都要当成科萨科夫综合征患者
<30-18,House>treat everybody as if they have Korsakoff's.

590
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,380
<30-18,House>我们都撒谎
<30-18,House>We all lie anyway.

591
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,560
<30-18,House>马上给她用维生素B1  她很快会没事
<30-18,House>Give her thiamine right away. She'll bounce back pretty quickly.

592
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,070
<30-18,House>然后让她吃点蛋糕冰淇淋
<30-18,House>And then get her to eat some cake and ice cream.

593
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,260
<30-20,House>什么
<30-20,House>Yes?

594
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,170
<30-21,Student 1>你非要那么残忍吗  我觉得她在哭
<30-21,Student 1>Did you need to be so cruel? I think she's crying.

595
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,530
<30-22,House>你好  约迪  我是豪斯医生
<30-22,House>Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.

596
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,890
<30-22,House>你的手腕怎么了
<30-22,House>What happened to your wrist?

597
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,490
<30-23,Jodi>有个古怪的老头  他有个拐杖
<30-23,Jodi>There was this weird old guy. He had a cane.

598
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,400
<30-24,House>看见没  她若无其事
<30-24,House>See? It's like it never happened.

599
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,790
<30-24,House>忘得一干二净
<30-24,House>Perfect forgiveness.

600
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,680
<31-2,Foreman>-心率加快  -你测体温了吗
<31-2,Foreman>- Pulse is rapid. - You got a temp?

601
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,880
<31-3,EMT>不知道  她很热 不过
<31-3,EMT>Don't know. She's warm, but

602
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,160
<31-4,Foreman>或许有什么可以查查  她有脑膜炎
<31-4,Foreman>might be something to look into. She has meningitis.

603
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,890
<31-5,EMT>对不起  我更担心她心跳过快
<31-5,EMT>Sorry. I was more worried about her heart blowing up.

604
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,750
<31-5,EMT>脉搏150
<31-5,EMT>Pulse is 150.

605
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,930
<31-6,Foreman>-心律正常吗  -是
<31-6,Foreman>- Rhythm regular? - Yeah.

606
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,330
<31-8,Foreman>准备  1  2  3
<31-8,Foreman>Ready? One, two, three.

607
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,320
<31-10,Policeman>-在哪里找到她的  -州立战场公园
<31-10,Policeman>- Where'd you find her? - Battlefield State Park.

608
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,020
<31-11,Foreman>-她是窄QRS波群房室折返性心动过速吗  -嗯
<31-11,Foreman>- She narrow complex? - Uh-huh.

609
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,750
<31-12,Policeman>-她不是在斯隆吗  -她晕倒在草地上
<31-12,Policeman>- She wasn't at Sloan? - She was just passed out on the grass.

610
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,510
<31-13,Victoria>福曼  我要福曼
<31-13,Victoria>Foreman. I need Foreman.

611
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,070
<31-13,Victoria>好  室上性心动过速
<31-13,Victoria>All right. Supraventricular tachycardia.

612
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,790
<31-14,Foreman>上1毫克腺苷  静推
<31-14,Foreman>Get me adenosine, one milligram, I.V. Push.

613
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,330
<31-14,Foreman>马上  谢谢
<31-14,Foreman>Right away. Thank you.

614
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,860
<31-14,Foreman>坚持住
<31-14,Foreman>Hang in there.

615
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,490
<32-1,Foreman>心率失常稳定住了
<32-1,Foreman>Her arrhythmia's stabilized.

616
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,650
<32-2,Chase>说不通啊
<32-2,Chase>Doesn't make sense.

617
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,770
<32-2,Chase>什么能导致她的心率到150  脱水吗
<32-2,Chase>what would push her heart rate over 150? Dehydration?

618
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,490
<32-3,Cameron>-高烧  -不像啊  都不可能啊
<32-3,Cameron>- Fever? - Unlikely. By themselves, neither one would do it.

619
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,350
<32-4,Foreman>我们一定错了  不是脑膜炎
<32-4,Foreman>We must be wrong about the meningitis.

620
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,020
<32-4,Foreman>可能是器质性心脏病
<32-4,Foreman>Maybe it's structural heart disease.

621
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,380
<32-5,House>你给予腺苷后  她的心率下来了
<32-5,House>Her heart rate dropped when you administered the adenosine.

622
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,340
<32-6,Foreman>马上就降下来了
<32-6,Foreman>In two seconds.

623
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,310
<32-7,House>还是脑膜炎
<32-7,House>It's still meningitis.

624
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,790
<32-8,Foreman>若是如此  延误治疗
<32-8,Foreman>If it is, with the delay in treatment,

625
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,560
<32-8,Foreman>那岂不是回天乏术
<32-8,Foreman>she's-she's got almost no chance.

626
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,660
<32-9,House>开始治疗
<32-9,House>Start the treatment.

627
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,200
<33-1,Policeman>看报告  我发现她躺在草地上
<33-1,Policeman>Read the report. I found her lying on the grass.

628
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,980
<33-2,House>你该看我的报告  我总是瞎编
<33-2,House>You should read my reports. I make up stuff all the time.

629
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,150
<33-2,House>到底发生什么了
<33-2,House>What really happened?

630
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,500
<33-3,Policeman>好吧  既然你
<33-3,Policeman>Well, since it's you-

631
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,500
<33-1,Policeman>我发现她躺在草地上
<33-1,Policeman>I found her lying on the grass.

632
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,450
<33-4,House>好枪啊
<33-4,House>That is a great-looking gun.

633
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,630
<33-5,Policeman>不是枪  是泰瑟枪
<33-5,Policeman>It's not a gun. It's a Taser.

635
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,270
<33-6,House>看着很棒  干什么用的
<33-6,House>It's so cool-looking. What does it do?

636
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,270
<33-6,House>发射6万伏电压吗
<33-6,House>Fire about 60,000 volts?

637
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,610
<33-6,House>至少这能让人的心率飙到150
<33-6,House>At least that's what it would take to jack someone's heart up to 150.

638
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,130
<33-6,House>好吧  好吧
<33-6,House>Okay, okay.

639
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,490
<33-7,Policeman>就算我告诉你发生什么了
<33-7,Policeman>Let's just say I tell you what happened.

640
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,060
<33-7,Policeman>就你知我知  好吗
<33-7,Policeman>It stays between you and me. Right?

641
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,890
<33-7,Policeman>我发现她  躺在草地上
<33-7,Policeman>I found her lying on the grass.

642
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,700
<33-8,House>好吧
<33-8,House>Fine.

643
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,920
<33-8,House>别告诉我
<33-8,House>Don't tell me.

644
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,210
<33-8,House>告诉我朋友  本·富兰克林
<33-8,House>Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.

645
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,850
<33-8,House>沃顿医生请到实验室
<33-8,House>Dr. Wharton to the research lab.

646
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,270
<33-8,House>沃顿医生请到实验室
<33-8,House>Dr. Wharton to the research lab.

647
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,260
<33-8,House>我看过不少警匪片
<33-8,House>I watch a lot of cop shows.

648
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,960
<34-1,House>好消息是
<34-1,House>The good news is,

649
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,610
<34-1,House>心率和她的病情无关
<34-1,House>the heart rate thing is not connected to her condition.

650
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,210
<34-2,Foreman>那么她快完了
<34-2,Foreman>Well, then she's dying,

651
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,800
<34-2,Foreman>因为脑膜炎治疗没有起效  病情在恶化
<34-2,Foreman>'cause the meningitis treatment isn't helping her. She's getting worse.

652
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,020
<34-3,House>还有个坏消息
<34-3,House>Well, that brings us to the bad news.

653
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,490
<34-3,House>警察电击了她
<34-3,House>The cop Tasered her.

654
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,420
<34-3,House>混蛋  大概来不及掏真枪
<34-3,House>Jerk. Probably couldn't get to his real gun fast enough.

655
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,680
<34-4,House>他第一次电击在大腿
<34-4,House>First time he hit her in the thigh...

656
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,460
<34-4,House>她没有停下来  若无其事的继续走
<34-4,House>and she just kept going, like it was nothing.

657
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,500
<34-4,House>大概在这里
<34-4,House>Right about here.

658
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,580
<34-4,House>她感觉不到泰瑟枪
<34-4,House>She didn't feel the Taser.

659
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,130
<34-6,House>-局部麻痹吗  -对  就那一处
<34-6,House>- Localized numbness? - Yeah, in that one spot.

660
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,180
<34-7,Foreman>糖尿病吗
<34-7,Foreman>The diabetes?

661
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,270
<34-8,House>不是
<34-8,House>I don't think so.

662
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,880
<34-9,Foreman>没有酒精  不是卡压综合征
<34-9,Foreman>Well, no alcohol. Not entrapment syndrome.

663
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,500
<34-9,Foreman>也不可能是维生素缺乏
<34-9,Foreman>Can't be a vitamin deficiency.

664
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,210
<34-9,Foreman>我们不能排查每一种感觉神经病变
<34-9,Foreman>We can't chase down every sensory neuropathy.

665
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,170
<34-10,House>-她咬的这里吗  -对
<34-10,House>- Is that where she bit you? - Yeah.

666
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,490
<34-12,Foreman>干嘛
<34-12,Foreman>What the hell!

667
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,140
<34-13,House>要是你没感觉到  你就不会发怒
<34-13,House>Can't get angry if you don't feel anything.

668
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,640
<34-13,House>首先  是局部性麻痹
<34-13,House>First, there's localized numbness,

669
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,630
<35-1,House>接着是光敏感
<35-1,House>then sensitivity to light,

670
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,890
<35-1,House>方向障碍  妄想
<35-1,House>disorientation, paranoia,

671
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,170
<35-1,House>镇静剂无效  然后恐水
<35-1,House>ineffectiveness of sedatives, and then hydrophobia.

672
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,000
<35-1,House>怕水
<35-1,House>Fear of water.

673
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,200
<35-2,Foreman>狂犬病

689
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,450
<36-3,Foreman>还是说"不过别担心  我们会让你好受些的"
<36-3,Foreman>"But don't worry, we can make you comfortable"?

690
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,530
<36-3,Foreman>不重要了
<36-3,Foreman>Doesn't matter.

739
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,250
<38-18,House>所以你穿雨靴唯一的理由就是你想走路

747
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,720
<38-25,Wilson>因为他不再是我生活的一部分了
<38-25,Wilson>Because he's not in my life anymore.

748
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,020
<38-26,House>这样的话  就是有关的
<38-26,House>Well, that's relevant.
