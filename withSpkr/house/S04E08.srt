400
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,850

406
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,050
<16-23,TAUB>那么大肿块在别的地方
<16-23,TAUB>so the main mass is somewhere else...

407
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,640
<16-23,TAUB>产生血栓 堵塞心脏动脉 造成心脏停跳
<16-23,TAUB>throws up a clot,blocks an artery/in his heart,causes the arrest.

408
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,430
<16-23,TAUB>很好!

<17-17,AMBER>You're probably expecting/me to bash the others,

436
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,480
<17-17,AMBER>列举他们败事有余的例子

<17-21,AMBER>His timetable may be right on.

448
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,700

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,810
<18-1,COLE>病人预言了自己的死亡
