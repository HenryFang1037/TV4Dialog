00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,580
<1-1,Brandon>我昨晚没睡好  醒来之后嗓子很疼
<1-1,Brandon>I didn't sleep well last night, and I woke up with a scratchy throat.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,410
<1-1,Brandon>我就是不太舒服  咳嗽
<1-1,Brandon>I just don't feel so good. Uh, cough.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,150
<1-1,Brandon>我的胃也不太舒服  我觉得我发烧了
<1-1,Brandon>I have a bit of an upset stomach too, and I think I'm running a fever.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,220
<1-1,Brandon>我怕这个会传染
<1-1,Brandon>I'm just worried I might be contagious.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,370
<1-1,Brandon>明天的总结报告  是的
<1-1,Brandon>Inventory. Tomorrow. I'm-Yeah,

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,130
<1-1,Brandon>我肯定我明天会好一点
<1-1,Brandon>I'm sure I'll be feeling better by then.

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,470
<1-2,Mindy>谢谢  伊纳比先生
<1-2,Mindy>Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,230
<1-2,Mindy>真不敢相信你竟然撒谎
<1-2,Mindy>I cannot believe you just did that.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,140
<1-3,Brandon>我确实咳嗽了
<1-3,Brandon>I really do have a cough.

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,540
<1-4,Mindy>这么说你没说谎喽
<1-4,Mindy>Oh. So you weren't lying.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,280
<1-4,Mindy>你宁愿乖乖躺在床上喝鸡汤
<1-4,Mindy>You'd be curled up in bed with a bowl of chicken soup-

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,510
<1-4,Mindy>即使你床上有个饥渴难耐的姑娘
<1-4,Mindy>even if you didn't have a horny girl in your bed?

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,580
<1-5,Brandon>是啊  因为我确实
<1-5,Brandon>Yes. Because I really do- Hey.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,320
<1-6,Mindy>-我确实咳嗽  -你还起疹子了
<1-6,Mindy>- I really do have a cough. - You also have a little rash.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,060
<1-7,Brandon>我们不该接吻吧  会传染
<1-7,Brandon>Um, I'm not sure we should be kissing.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,300
<1-8,Mindy>没关系  反正我对光吻你也没兴趣
<1-8,Mindy>Oh. It's okay. Because I have almost no interest in kissing you.

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,860
<1-8,Mindy>-很好  -好
<1-8,Mindy>- Perfect. - Good.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,420
<1-8,Mindy>宝贝
<1-8,Mindy>Oh, baby.

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,450
<2-1,Mindy>布兰登
<2-1,Mindy>Oh, Brandon.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,510
<2-1,Mindy>布兰登
<2-1,Mindy>Brandon.

21
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,060
<2-1,Mindy>我知道我超棒  快起来啦
<2-1,Mindy>I know I'm good, but come on.

22
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,660
<2-1,Mindy>布兰登
<2-1,Mindy>Brandon?

23
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,630
<2-1,Mindy>布兰登  布兰登  布兰登
<2-1,Mindy>Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.

24
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,870
<2-1,Mindy>布兰登  布兰登
<2-1,Mindy>Brandon.! Brandon.!

25
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,910
<2-1,Mindy>请空闲的护士到外科门诊
<2-1,Mindy>Any additional R.N. to surgical.

26
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,200
<2-1,Mindy>请空闲的护士到外科门诊
<2-1,Mindy>Any additional R.N. to surgical.

27
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,120
<3-1,House>你为什么要我去给他看病
<3-1,House>Why do you want me to treat this guy?

28
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,190
<3-2,Wilson>血压对静脉推注没有反应
<3-2,Wilson>Blood pressure's not responding to I.V. fluids.

29
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,860
<3-3,House>不  我没问你打算怎么骗我上钩去治他
<3-3,House>No, no. I didn't ask how you plan to con me into treating him.

30
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,600
<3-3,House>我是问为什么是你  想要我给他治病
<3-3,House>I asked you why you want me to treat him.

31
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,330
<3-4,Wilson>我动了恻隐之心  我真可悲啊
<3-4,Wilson>He's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.

32
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,070
<3-5,House>全世界生病的人多了去了  为什么偏偏治他
<3-5,House>There are about a billion sick people on the planet. Why this one?

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,420
<3-6,Wilson>因为他在我们的急诊室里
<3-6,Wilson>Because this one's in our emergency room.

34
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,140
<3-7,House>所以是就近原则喽
<3-7,House>Ah, so it's a proximity issue.

35
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,030
<3-7,House>要是有人在三层的楼梯间病倒了
<3-7,House>If somebody was sick in the third-floor stairwell,

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,210
<3-7,House>根据就近原则我该先给他看病
<3-7,House>that's who'd we be talking about.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,450
<3-8,Wilson>是的  我去楼梯间看过了  没人
<3-8,Wilson>Yes. I checked the stairwell. It's clear.

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,010
<3-9,House>好吧  那就急诊室的这位吧
<3-9,House>Okay, then. Emergency room guy it is.

39
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,750
<3-10,Wilson>-等等  这次怎么这么容易  -你懂的
<3-10,Wilson>- Wait. Why was that so easy? - You know why.

40
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,430
<3-10,Wilson>-因为血压对静脉推注没反应吗  -是啊
<3-10,Wilson>- Blood pressure's not responding to I.V. fluids? - Yeah.

41
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,660
<3-10,Wilson>这太诡异了
<3-10,Wilson>That's just weird.

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,370
<4-1,House>和某电视台一样  血细胞计数没看点
<4-1,House>C.B.C. was unremarkable.

43
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,270
<4-1,House>同学们  鉴别诊断  她什么病
<4-1,House>So, people, differential diagnosis. What's wrong with her?

44
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,280
<4-3,House>-是他  -他  她  有关系吗
<4-3,House>- Him. - Him. Her. Does it matter?

45
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,250
<4-3,House>有人觉得是睾丸问题吗  没有吧
<4-3,House>Does anyone think it's a testicular problem? No.

46
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,510
<4-3,House>奇斯
<4-3,House>So, Chase?

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,570
<4-5,Foreman>-耶尔森氏菌感染  -不  那不会咳嗽或出疹
<4-5,Foreman>- Yersinia infection? - No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.

48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,990
<4-5,Foreman>是不是关节炎  并发脉管炎导致神经损伤
<4-5,Foreman>What about arthritis? Accompanying vasculitis causes nerve damage-

49
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,620
<4-6,Cameron>不  那不会导致血压问题  过敏症吗
<4-6,Cameron>No. It wouldn't cause the blood pressure problems. Allergy?

50
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,860
<4-7,Chase>那孩子有腹痛
<4-7,Chase>The kid's got abdominal pain.

51
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,190
<4-8,Foreman>-可能是良性肿瘤  -不  那不会出现
<4-8,Foreman>- Maybe carcinoid? - No. But then you wouldn't get the-

52
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,880
<4-9,House>福曼  你要是想把不符合的疾病全列出来
<4-9,House>Foreman, if you're going to list all the things it's not,

53
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,860
<4-9,House>按字母顺序来会比较快
<4-9,House>it might be quicker to do it alphabetically.

54
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,430
<4-9,House>来看看  犁头霉属  很好
<4-9,House>Let's see, now. "Absidia." Excellent.

55
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,060
<4-9,House>以上症状都不包括
<4-9,House>Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.

56
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,970
<4-10,Cameron>-没有疾病包括全部这些症状  -太好了
<4-10,Cameron>- No condition accounts for all these symptoms. - Oh, good.

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,570
<4-11,House>我还以为他生病了呢
<4-11,House>Because I thought maybe he was sick.

58
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,100
<4-11,House>现在看来  他健康的很
<4-11,House>But, apparently, he's not.

59
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,740
<4-11,House>谁自愿去帮他办理出院手续
<4-11,House>Who wants to do up the discharge papers?

60
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
<4-11,House>好吧  除非我们控制住血压
<4-11,House>Okay. Unless we control the blood pressure,

61
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,650
<4-11,House>不然在我们得出结论之前
<4-11,House>he's gonna start circling the drain before we can

62
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,950
<4-11,House>他就生命垂危了
<4-11,House>figure out what's wrong with him.

63
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,290
<4-11,House>按败血症来治疗  用广谱抗生素
<4-11,House>Treat him for sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics,

64
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,550
<4-11,House>做一个皮质醇过量测试和心脏超音波
<4-11,House>and I want a cort-stim test and an echocardiogram.

65
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,370
<5-1,Chase>-你没事吧  -没事
<5-1,Chase>- You all right? - Yeah.

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,920
<5-3,Foreman>皮质醇过量测试可以显示
<5-3,Foreman>The Cort-stim test will tell us

67
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,600
<5-3,Foreman>你的脑垂体和肾上腺是否正常
<5-3,Foreman>if your pituitary and adrenal glands are working properly.

68
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,080
<5-4,Mindy>他的腺体  那什么意思
<5-4,Mindy>His glands? What does that mean?

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
<5-5,Chase>我们在根据得出的一些理论研究病情
<5-5,Chase>We have a few theories we're working on.

70
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,570
<5-6,Mindy>-意思是说你不知道什么病  -敏蒂
<5-6,Mindy>- You mean you don't know. - Mindy.

71
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,640
<5-7,Brandon>如果他们知道的话就不会给你做测试
<5-7,Brandon>I'm just saying, if they knew they wouldn't be testing you,

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,410
<5-8,Mindy>而是治疗你
<5-8,Mindy>they'd be treating you.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,510
<5-9,Foreman>是啊  可过程就是这样
<5-9,Foreman>Yeah, well, that's the way it works.

74
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,440
<5-9,Foreman>我们先诊断出病因  然后对症下药
<5-9,Foreman>First we find out what it is, then we get you better.

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,260
<6-1,Cuddy>-你迟到了半小时  -手头病例太多了
<6-1,Cuddy>- You're half an hour late. - Busy caseload.

76
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,700
<6-3,Cuddy>就一个病例算不上多
<6-3,Cuddy>One case is not a load.

77
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,600
<6-4,House>今天的棉棒够用吗
<6-4,House>So how are we doing on cotton swabs today?

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
<6-4,House>如果不够的话  我可以跑回家去
<6-4,House>If there's an acute shortage, I could run home-

79
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,160
<6-5,Cuddy>-看来你"跑"不了  -很好
<6-5,Cuddy>- No, you couldn't. - Nice.

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,250
<6-6,House>患者以及其亲朋好友  你们好
<6-6,House>Hello, sick people and their loved ones.

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,620
<6-6,House>为了节省时间  还有避免大量无聊的闲谈
<6-6,House>In the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring chitchat later,

82
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,650
<6-6,House>我是格利高里·豪斯医生
<6-6,House>I'm Dr.Gregory House.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
<6-6,House>你们可以叫我格雷戈
<6-6,House>You can call me Greg.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,990
<6-6,House>我是今早在门诊出诊的三个医生之一
<6-6,House>I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.

85
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,710
<6-7,Cuddy>简洁  可爱  拿个病例走人
<6-7,Cuddy>Short. Sweet. Grab a file.

86
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,190
<6-8,House>这位就是总能温暖人心的丽莎·卡迪医生
<6-8,House>This ray of sunshine is Dr.Lisa Cuddy.

87
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,630
<6-8,House>卡迪医生是这间医院的院长
<6-8,House>Dr.Cuddy runs this whole hospital,

88
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,760
<6-8,House>所以很不幸  她没时间给你们看病
<6-8,House>so, unfortunately, she's much too busy to deal with you.

89
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,430
<6-8,House>我是个经过认证的诊断师
<6-8,House>I am a board-certified diagnostician,

90
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,100
<6-8,House>专业是传染病学和肾脏学
<6-8,House>with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology.

91
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,410
<6-8,House>我也是整个门诊部门目前值班的医生中
<6-8,House>I'm also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic

92
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,010
<6-8,House>唯一一个被逼出诊的
<6-8,House>who is forced to be here against his will.

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,570
<6-8,House>这是实话  对吧  不过别担心
<6-8,House>That is true, isn't it? But not to worry.

94
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,750
<6-8,House>对你们大多数人的病情来说
<6-8,House>Because for most of you,

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,340
<6-8,House>这工作简单到猴子拿瓶布洛芬就能解决了
<6-8,House>this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.

96
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,960
<6-8,House>说到这儿  如果你是特别烦人的病人
<6-8,House>Speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying,

97
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,510
<6-8,House>你会看到我吃这个东西
<6-8,House>you may see me reach for this.

98
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,250
<6-8,House>这是维科丁  是我的  你们吃不到
<6-8,House>This is Vicodin. It's mine. You can't have any.

99
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,320
<6-8,House>我没有什么疼痛处理障碍  我就是疼而已
<6-8,House>And, no, I do not have a pain management problem. I have a pain problem.

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,390
<6-8,House>谁知道呢  也许我错了
<6-8,House>But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong.

101
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,700
<6-8,House>也许我浑浑噩噩的所以分不清了
<6-8,House>Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.

102
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,800
<6-8,House>那好  谁要我看病
<6-8,House>So, who wants me?

103
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,170
<6-8,House>谁宁愿等另外那两个医生来
<6-8,House>And who would rather wait for one of the other two guys?

104
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,370
<28-1,House>很好  如果你们改变主意
<28-1,House>Okay. Well, I'll be in exam room one

105
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,610
<8-16,House>去1号门诊室找我
<8-16,House>if you change your mind.

<6-9,Cuddy>Dr.Chase.

109
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,980
<7-2,Chase>我认为目前来说
<7-2,Chase>I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend

110
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,260
<7-2,Chase>吓唬你男友对他的病情没有帮助
<7-2,Chase>is the best medicine for him right now.

111
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,350
<7-3,Mindy>我知道  我害怕的时候就会变得笨笨的
<7-3,Mindy>I know. I get stupid when I'm scared.

112
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,670
<7-4,Chase>那千万别去攀岩
<7-4,Chase>Don't go rock climbing.

113
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,070
<7-5,Mindy>我想问问你  他病发之前  我们在做爱
<7-5,Mindy>Look, I was wondering. Before this happened, we were having sex.

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,470
<7-6,Chase>怎么了  你想知道你是不是被他传染了
<7-6,Chase>What? You're wondering if whatever he has, you might've gotten it?

115
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,540
<7-6,Chase>没事的  我们做了全面的性传播疾病检测
<7-6,Chase>It-It's unlikely. We ran a complete S.T.D. panel, so-

116
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,860
<7-7,Mindy>不是  我想知道这是不是因我而起
<7-7,Mindy>No. I'm wondering if maybe I did this to him.

117
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,280
<7-7,Mindy>我当时有点粗暴
<7-7,Mindy>I was kind of rough.

118
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,260
<8-1,Jodi>-之前是黄色的  -之前
<8-1,Jodi>- It was yellow. - It was?

119
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,460
<8-4,House>-现在不是了  -那真遗憾
<8-4,House>- It's not anymore. - Well, that's a shame.

120
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,200
<8-5,Jodi>我想这么说你不太懂  所以我带了这个来
<8-5,Jodi>I thought that might be a problem, so I brought you this.

121
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,710
<8-6,House>你的黏液是  浅金黄色
<8-6,House>Your mucus was "pale goldenrod."

122
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,480
<8-7,Jodi>-上周是这情况  严重吗  -非常之严重
<8-7,Jodi>- Last week, yes. Should I be worried? - Oh, yes. Very.

123
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,990
<8-9,Jodi>是吗  我觉得现在已经没事了
<8-9,Jodi>Really? I thought it was okay now.

124
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,550
<8-10,House>可你来医院了  怎么回事
<8-10,House>And yet, here you are. What happened?

125
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,190
<8-10,House>医护人员花了一周来回复你的急救电话吗
<8-10,House>Paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?

126
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,160
<8-11,Jodi>你不算是个友善的医生  对吧
<8-11,Jodi>You're not a very nice doctor, are you?

127
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,960
<8-12,House>而你呢  成事不足败事有余
<8-12,House>And you are very bad at whatever it is you do.

128
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,330
<8-13,Jodi>-你根本不认识我  -我知道你要被炒了
<8-13,Jodi>- You don't even know me. - I know you're gonna get fired.

129
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,350
<8-14,House>所以你才买了新眼镜
<8-14,House>That's why you got the new glasses.

130
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,500
<8-14,House>而且做了牙齿漂白
<8-14,House>That's why your teeth are sparkly white.

131
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,070
<8-14,House>失业之前你在最大限度地利用医疗保险
<8-14,House>You're getting the most of your health insurance while you still can.

132
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,570
<8-15,Jodi>可能是我辞职呢
<8-15,Jodi>I might be quitting.

133
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,700
<8-16,House>如果是你辞职  一周之前你就会注意到
<8-16,House>If you were quitting, you'd have known that last week

134
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,140
<8-16,House>你的鼻涕是浅金黄色  你要被炒了
<8-16,House>when your snot was still pale goldenrod. You're getting fired.

135
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,480
<8-17,Jodi>我只是讨厌被呼来唤去的
<8-17,Jodi>I just don't like being told what to do.

136
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,120
<8-18,House>过几天我可以给你安排做一个全身检查
<8-18,House>I can get you in for a full body scan later this week.

137
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,690
<8-19,Jodi>谢了
<8-19,Jodi>Thanks.

138
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,200
<9-1,Foreman>肯定是病毒  我们应该做凝胶和滴度的检验
<9-1,Foreman>It's got to be viral. We should start running gels and titers.

139
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,760
<9-1,Foreman>也许我们该研究一下他女朋友的理论
<9-1,Foreman>Maybe we should look into the girlfriend's theory.

140
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,370
<9-2,Chase>她觉得是她把他"做"出毛病的
<9-2,Chase>She thinks she rode him to death.

141
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,810
<9-3,Foreman>你怎么说的
<9-3,Foreman>What'd you tell her?

142
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,350
<9-4,Chase>我说一个22岁的男性不会死于性爱
<9-4,Chase>I told her 22-year-old men don't die of sex.

143
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,510
<9-6,Chase>-你问她什么了  -你什么意思
<9-6,Chase>- What'd you ask her? - What do you mean?

144
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,580
<9-7,Cameron>我希望你有好好了解一下具体情况
<9-7,Cameron>I mean, I hope you got some specifics on exactly what was going on.

145
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,220
<9-7,Cameron>如果那女孩觉得男性会死于性爱
<9-7,Cameron>If the girl thinks it could kill you,

146
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,490
<9-7,Cameron>那你绝对有备案的必要
<9-7,Cameron>it's worth knowing about.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,020
<9-8,Chase>那你曾经"杀"过人吗
<9-8,Chase>Have you ever taken a life?

148
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,540
<9-9,Foreman>我们得停止使用抗生素了
<9-9,Foreman>We should stop the antibiotics.

149
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,540
<9-10,Cameron>现在断定它们不起作用为时过早
<9-10,Cameron>It's too soon to say they're not having an effect.

150
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,700
<9-10,Cameron>已经起作用了
<9-10,Cameron>They're having an effect.

151
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,880
<9-10,Cameron>他血压急降  肺部有积液
<9-10,Cameron>His B.P.'s falling fast. There's fluid filling his lungs.

152
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,220
<9-10,Cameron>他的肌氨酸酐在上升
<9-10,Cameron>His creatinine is rising.

153
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,220
<9-10,Cameron>他的肾功能正在衰竭
<9-10,Cameron>His kidneys are shutting down.

154
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,930
<9-10,Cameron>我们的治疗没有让他好转  是要他的命
<9-10,Cameron>Our treatment isn't making him better. It's killing him.

155
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,400
<10-1,House>这么说  我们有6个毫无意义的症状
<10-1,House>So, we had six symptoms that didn't add up to anything.

156
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,340
<10-1,House>现在出现了第7个  有人激动不
<10-1,House>Now we got seven. Who's excited?

157
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,980
<10-2,Foreman>我认为它没有使问题复杂化
<10-2,Foreman>I don't think it complicates things.

158
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,070
<10-2,Foreman>肾衰竭是由抗生素引起的
<10-2,Foreman>The kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.

159
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,480
<10-4,Foreman>-可能  -通常来说  低血压
<10-4,Foreman>- Maybe. - Typically, low blood pressure

160
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,810
<10-4,Foreman>和腹痛说明是感染
<10-4,Foreman>and abdominal pain means an infection.

161
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,790
<10-4,Foreman>腹腔感染导致败血症  低血压
<10-4,Foreman>An abdominal infection causes sepsis, low blood pressure.

162
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,790
<10-5,Chase>不过我们已经测试过腹腔感染
<10-5,Chase>Except we checked for abdominal infections.

163
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,430
<10-6,Foreman>我知道  不过如果顺序颠倒一下呢
<10-6,Foreman>I know. But what if it's the other way around?

164
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,850
<10-6,Foreman>如果是低血压造成腹痛呢
<10-6,Foreman>What if the low blood pressure's causing the abdominal pain?

165
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,000
<10-7,Cameron>病毒性心脏感染
<10-7,Cameron>Viral heart infection.

166
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,420
<10-7,Cameron>肠道得不到足够血液  导致了腹部疼痛
<10-7,Cameron>The intestines aren't getting enough blood, and the result is belly pain.

167
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,790
<10-8,Foreman>我知道这套说法站不住脚
<10-8,Foreman>I know it's not the standard presentation.

168
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,460
<10-9,Chase>这只有千万分之一的可能性
<10-9,Chase>It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.

169
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,200
<10-10,Foreman>所以才要我们来解决
<10-10,Foreman>I thought that's what we dealt with here.

170
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,940
<10-10,Foreman>这能解释心肌病  疼痛  低血压和发烧
<10-10,Foreman>It explains the cardiomyopathy, the pain, the low B.P., the fever.

171
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,110
<10-11,House>你真的读那本书了  不错啊
<10-11,House>You read the book. Impressive.

172
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,920
<10-11,House>这理论荒唐且冒险  解释了所有症状
<10-11,House>It's a ludicrously long shot that explains every one of those symptoms

173
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,680
<10-11,House>除了咳嗽和皮疹
<10-11,House>except for the cough and the rash.

174
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,590
<10-11,House>咱们是不是该擦掉那两个
<10-11,House>Should we just erase those?

175
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,420
<10-12,Foreman>任何东西都能引起皮疹
<10-12,Foreman>Well, anything can cause a rash.

176
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,130
<10-13,House>好吧  心脏传染病
<10-13,House>Okay. Cardiac infection.

177
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,970
<10-13,House>卡梅隆  你认为是过敏症
<10-13,House>Cameron, you thought allergy.

178
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,430
<10-13,House>奇斯  你怎么想的来着  良性肿瘤
<10-13,House>Chase, what was it you thought? Carcinoid?

179
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,270
<10-13,House>还有甲状腺机能减退
<10-13,House>Then there's hypothyroidism.

180
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,760
<10-13,House>可能是寄生虫
<10-13,House>Could be parasites.

181
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,410
<10-13,House>最后是鼻窦感染
<10-13,House>Finally, sinus infection.

182
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,870
<10-14,Foreman>你要是打算标上所有可能的  颜色不够
<10-14,Foreman>If you're gonna list all the things it can be, you're gonna need more colors.

183
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,620
<10-15,House>卡梅隆是对的
<10-15,House>Cameron was right.

184
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,510
<10-15,House>没有任何一种情况可以解释全部症状
<10-15,House>No condition explains all these symptoms.

185
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,930
<10-15,House>但是橙色和绿色一起  涵盖全部
<10-15,House>But orange and green covers everything.

186
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,820
<10-16,Chase>橙色和绿色吗
<10-16,Chase>Orange and green?

187
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,150
<10-16,Chase>两种疾病同时存在吗
<10-16,Chase>Two conditions contracted simultaneously?

188
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,520
<10-17,Foreman>奥坎简化律  最简单的解释是最好的
<10-17,Foreman>Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is always the best.

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,910
<10-18,House>你觉得一个比两个简单
<10-18,House>And you think one is simpler than two?

190
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,630
<10-19,Cameron>相当确定
<10-19,Cameron>Pretty sure it is, yeah.

191
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,650
<10-20,House>那小孩出生来说
<10-20,House>Baby shows up.

192
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,290
<10-20,House>奇斯说是两个人交换体液的结果
<10-20,House>Chase tells you that two people exchanged fluids to create this being.

193
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,520
<10-20,House>我说是仙鹤把小孩扔到尿布里的
<10-20,House>I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper.

194
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,740
<10-20,House>你相信哪一个
<10-20,House>Are you gonna go with the two or the one?

195
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,540
<10-21,Foreman>-你强词夺理  -你的领带难看
<10-21,Foreman>- I think your argument is specious. - I think your tie is ugly.

196
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,880
<10-21,Foreman>为什么认为一个比两个简单
<10-21,Foreman>Why is one simpler than two?

197
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,750
<10-22,House>更低等  更单一  就更简单吗
<10-22,House>It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?

198
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,050
<10-22,House>任何一个病症都是约千分之一的概率
<10-22,House>Each one of these conditions is about a thousand-to-one shot.

199
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,370
<10-22,House>意味着任何两个同时发生的概率是十万分之一
<10-22,House>That means that any two of them happening at the same time is a million-to-one shot.

200
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,470
<10-22,House>奇斯提出的心脏感染概率是百万分之一
<10-22,House>Chase says the cardiac infection is a 10 million-to-1 shot,

201
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,430
<10-22,House>所以我的提议比你们的好十倍
<10-22,House>which makes my idea 10 times better than yours.

202
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,950
<10-22,House>找个计算器  好好算算
<10-22,House>Get a calculator. Run the numbers.

203
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,790
<10-23,Chase>-我们会做检查  -检查太耗时间
<10-23,Chase>- We'll run the tests. - Tests take time.

204
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,950
<10-24,House>治疗更快  给他用优立新针对鼻窦感染
<10-24,House>Treatment's quicker. Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection,

205
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,370
<10-24,House>-橙色是什么来着  -甲状腺机能衰退
<10-24,House>- and... what was orange? - Hypothyroidism.

206
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,450
<11-1,Brandon>我叔叔也有甲状腺机能衰退
<11-1,Brandon>My uncle has hypothyroidism.

207
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,270
<11-2,Cameron>不太一样
<11-2,Cameron>Not like this.

208
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,600
<11-2,Cameron>静注左甲状腺素是合成甲状腺药物
<11-2,Cameron>Intravenous Levothyroxin is an artificial thyroid medication

209
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,050
<11-2,Cameron>针对此症
<11-2,Cameron>that should take care of it.

210
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,330
<11-2,Cameron>同时  护士会开始用优立新
<11-2,Cameron>Also, the nurses are going to start you on Unasyn.

211
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,920
<11-2,Cameron>是一种更有针对性的抗生素
<11-2,Cameron>It's a more targeted antibiotic.

212
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,560
<11-3,Mindy>-针对鼻窦感染吗  -是
<11-3,Mindy>- For the sinus infection? - Yes.

213
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,600
<11-5,Mindy>-两者完全不同  -很倒霉吧
<11-5,Mindy>- And the other stuff is for something else entirely. - Bad luck, huh?

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,700
<11-6,Cameron>别担心  他很快就能继续干活了
<11-6,Cameron>Don't worry. He should be back to ditching work in no time.

215
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,400
<11-6,Cameron>布兰登
<11-6,Cameron>Brandon?

216
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,170
<11-7,Brandon>妈妈
<11-7,Brandon>Hey, Mom.

217
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,430
<11-7,Brandon>我们是他的父母  他怎样了
<11-7,Brandon>We're his parents. How's he doing?

218
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,190
<11-8,Cameron>布兰登是
<11-8,Cameron>Um, Brandon is-

219
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,560
<11-9,Brandon>妈  爸  这是敏蒂
<11-9,Brandon>Uh, Mom. Dad This is Mindy.

220
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,900
<11-9,Brandon>我原打算圣诞节带她回家  我们订婚了
<11-9,Brandon>I was gonna bring her home for Christmas. Um, we're engaged.

221
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,520
<11-9,Brandon>霍尔医生请到术后特别病房  霍尔医生
<11-9,Brandon>Dr. Hall to the recovery room. Dr. Hall-

222
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,100
<12-1,Chase>你和家属说了豪斯的理论吗
<12-1,Chase>Did you tell the family House's theory?

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,470
<12-2,Foreman>两种罕见病症极为巧合的同时发生
<12-2,Foreman>Two odd conditions striking completely coincidentally at the exact same time?

224
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,050
<12-3,Cameron>-我可没这么说  -他们同意治疗吗
<12-3,Cameron>- I didn't phrase it quite that way. - They agree to treatment?

225
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,570
<12-5,Foreman>当然同意了  我们是医生
<12-5,Foreman>Of course they did. We're doctors.

226
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,260
<12-5,Foreman>我们说什么他们都相信
<12-5,Foreman>They believe whatever we tell them.

227
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,610
<12-5,Foreman>这就是我们的工作  豪斯的木偶吗
<12-5,Foreman>So, is that our job? House's puppets?

228
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,590
<12-5,Foreman>他冒出个疯狂的想法  我们却置若罔闻吗
<12-5,Foreman>He comes up with an insane idea, we get to pretend it's not?

229
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,450
<12-6,Cameron>他的疯狂想法通常是对的
<12-6,Cameron>His insane ideas are usually right.

230
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,820
<12-7,Foreman>我们在这里足够长时间
<12-7,Foreman>We've been here long enough to-

231
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,060
<12-7,Foreman>足够长时间患上斯德哥尔摩综合征[人质情节]
<12-7,Foreman>We've been here long enough to have Stockholm syndrome.

232
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,460
<12-8,Chase>什么  就因为我们不讨厌他吗
<12-8,Chase>What, because we don't hate him?

233
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,800
<12-8,Chase>他能跳出框框思考  就是恶人了吗
<12-8,Chase>He thinks outside the box. Is that so evil?

234
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,970
<12-9,Foreman>他根本不知道框子在哪里
<12-9,Foreman>He has no idea where the box is.

235
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,370
<12-9,Foreman>要是你们觉得他是对的  回家吧
<12-9,Foreman>If you guys think he's right, go home.

236
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,020
<12-9,Foreman>放松  等着病人好转
<12-9,Foreman>Relax. Just wait for the kid to get all better.

237
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,770
<12-9,Foreman>我去化验室  检查病毒感染
<12-9,Foreman>I'm going to the lab to test for viral infections.

238
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,660
<13-1,Foreman>B型柯萨奇病毒检测呈阴性
<13-1,Foreman>Negative for Coxsackie "B" virus.

239
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,450
<13-2,Chase>排除7个  还有5000多个
<13-2,Chase>Seven down, about 5,000 to go.

240
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,320
<13-2,Chase>你真的以为靠凝胶实验
<13-2,Chase>You really think we're gonna

241
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,110
<13-2,Chase>加上我们随意的猜测
<13-2,Chase>come up with your mystery virus just by running gels

242
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,180
<13-2,Chase>就能找到你的神秘病毒
<13-2,Chase>till we guess it right?

243
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,160
<13-3,Foreman>不  我觉得  站着看别人干活就可以
<13-3,Foreman>No. I think we're gonna do it by standing around watching other people work.

244
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,210
<13-4,Chase>我在等EB病毒检测结果
<13-4,Chase>I'm waiting for the Epstein-Barr virus.

245
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,790
<13-5,Foreman>-她很古怪  不是吗  -不是好主意
<13-5,Foreman>- She's weird, isn't she? - Bad idea.

246
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,730
<13-7,Foreman>-什么  -不是好主意  你们是同事
<13-7,Foreman>- What? - Bad idea. You work with her.

247
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,780
<13-8,Chase>我说什么了
<13-8,Chase>What did I say?

248
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,600
<13-8,Chase>古怪是黑人对性感的委婉说法吗
<13-8,Chase>Is weird some new ghetto euphemism for sexy,

249
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
<13-8,Chase>就像坏是好  漂亮是好
<13-8,Chase>like bad is good and phat is good?

250
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,120
<13-8,Chase>-那么好又指什么  -黑人委婉说法
<13-8,Chase>- Then what the hell does "good" mean? - "Ghetto euphemism"?

251
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,760
<13-9,Foreman>你不觉得她很性感吗
<13-9,Foreman>You don't think she's hot?

252
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,890
<13-10,Chase>不
<13-10,Chase>No.

253
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,480
<13-11,Foreman>明智  这个明智是委婉说法
<13-11,Foreman>Wow. Then you're brilliant. And I am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.

254
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,940
<13-12,Chase>显然  她很性感  你不是就美学角度讨论
<13-12,Chase>Obviously, the girl is hot. Y-You're not talking about her aesthetics.

255
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,810
<13-12,Chase>你在说我想和她上床  我不想
<13-12,Chase>You're talking about if I want to jump her. I don't.

256
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,920
<13-11,Foreman>明智
<13-11,Foreman>Brilliant.

257
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,930
<13-13,Foreman>你的EB病毒检测好了
<13-13,Foreman>Your Epstein-Barr is ready.

258
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,150
<14-1,Clinic patient>-你在干吗  -第四关
<14-1,Clinic patient>- What are you doing? - Level four.

259
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,450
<14-3,Patient>不  我是说
<14-3,Patient>No, no. I mean

260
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,610
<14-4,House>我知道你什么意思  我们等着
<14-4,House>I know what you meant. We're waiting.

261
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,960
<14-5,Patient>-我喉咙痛  -那是你说的
<14-5,Patient>- My throat hurts. - So you said.

262
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,970
<14-7,Patient>我们等了多久了
<14-7,Patient>How long are we waiting?

263
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,260
<14-8,House>比两分钟前你问的时候少了两分钟
<14-8,House>Two minutes less than when you asked me two minutes ago.

264
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,630
<14-9,Patient>-你好  -你好  我是卡迪医生
<14-9,Patient>- Hi. - Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.

265
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,830
<14-10,Cuddy>很高兴见到你
<14-10,Cuddy>Nice to meet you.

266
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,770
<14-11,House>卡迪医生  多谢前来会诊
<14-11,House>Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult.

267
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,450
<14-11,House>他的喉咙有些不适
<14-11,House>His throat seems to have some condition.

268
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,260
<14-12,Cuddy>-说"啊"  -啊
<14-12,Cuddy>- Say "Ah." - Ah.

269
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,390
<14-13,Cuddy>他喉咙痛
<14-13,Cuddy>He has a sore throat.

270
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,660
<14-14,House>当然  是  我怎么就没
<14-14,House>Of course. Yes, why didn't l-

271
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,340
<14-14,House>我是说  因为他说疼
<14-14,House>I mean, because he said that it hurt,

272
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,120
<14-14,House>我应该推断是痛的
<14-14,House>and I should have deduced that meant it was sore.

273
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,350
<14-15,Cuddy>我在开董事会议
<14-15,Cuddy>I was in a board meeting.

274
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,570
<14-16,House>病人优先  不是吗
<14-16,House>Patients come first, right?

275
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,250
<14-17,Cuddy>止咳糖疗效仍有疑问  就不打算开药是吗
<14-17,Cuddy>Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there's any doubt about its efficacy, huh?

276
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,290
<14-18,House>你曾问我为何我总认为自己是对的
<14-18,House>You once asked me why I think I'm always right,

277
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,490
<14-18,House>我意识到  你是对的
<14-18,House>and I realized that you're right.

278
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,630
<14-18,House>至少我认为你对
<14-18,House>At least, I think you're right.

279
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,650
<14-18,House>我并不真的知道  怎么能知道呢
<14-18,House>I don't really know, how do I?

280
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,520
<14-20,Cuddy>-我在这里呢  -回家  喝点热茶
<14-20,Cuddy>- Hey. I'm here. - Go home. Drink some hot tea.

281
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,380
<14-21,House>出色的会诊
<14-21,House>Excellent counsel.

282
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,190
<15-1,Cameron>细小病毒B-19阴性
<15-1,Cameron>Negative on parvovirus B-19.

283
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,270
<15-3,Cameron>-了不起啊  -多谢  天生跑胶的料
<15-3,Cameron>- I'm impressed. - Thank you. I was born to run gels.

284
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,480
<15-4,Foreman>-我说奇斯呢  -奇斯怎么了
<15-4,Foreman>- I meant about Chase. - What about Chase?

285
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,210
<15-6,Foreman>这个人对你的外貌没有兴趣
<15-6,Foreman>Well, the man has no physical interest in you.

286
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,760
<15-6,Foreman>绝对的同事关系
<15-6,Foreman>He has a completely professional relationship with you,

287
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,780
<15-6,Foreman>尊重你  如同对同事和医生
<15-6,Foreman>respects you as a colleague and a doctor.

288
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,850
<15-6,Foreman>还有  看着你  满脑袋想的是做爱
<15-6,Foreman>And yet, he can't look at you without thinking sex.

289
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,870
<15-7,Cameron>就因为我问什么样的性爱能害死人吗
<15-7,Cameron>Because I asked what kind of sex could kill you?

290
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,720
<15-8,Foreman>你俩的关系  现在你说了算
<15-8,Foreman>You now have total control over your relationship with him.

291
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,070
<15-9,Cameron>女性必须占据主导
<15-9,Cameron>So, a woman can't express her interest in sex

292
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,410
<15-9,Cameron>才能表示对性的兴趣吗
<15-9,Cameron>without it being some professional power play?

293
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,880
<15-10,House>不  但是如果回想下你所说  所做的
<15-10,House>No. If you look the way you do and you say what you said,

294
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,730
<15-10,House>当心这样做对一个男人产生的影响
<15-10,House>you have to be aware of the effect that it's going to have on men.

295
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,670
<15-11,Cameron>男人总也长不大
<15-11,Cameron>Men should grow up.

296
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,810
<15-12,House>对  狗改不了吃屎
<15-12,House>Yeah, and dogs should stop licking themselves.

297
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,430
<15-12,House>-不会发生的  -出什么事了
<15-12,House>- It's not gonna happen. - What's going on?

298
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,350
<15-14,Cameron>-对了  你在这里干嘛  -找你们
<15-14,Cameron>- Yeah, what are you doing here? - Looking for you guys.

299
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,340
<15-15,House>为什么不呼我们
<15-15,House>Why didn't you page us?

300
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,420
<15-17,House>因为我知道你们在这里
<15-17,House>'Cause I knew you'd be here.

301
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,580
<15-18,Chase>-谁告诉他的  -没人
<15-18,Chase>- Who told him? - No one.

302
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,980
<15-19,House>料到你们想要证明我疯狂的两病同发理论是错的
<15-19,House>I assume you're trying to prove my crazy, two-illness theory wrong,

303
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,460
<15-19,House>所以  显然  你们会在化验室
<15-19,House>so, obviously, you're gonna be in the lab.

304
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,280
<15-19,House>-尿沉渣检验好了吗  -还没
<15-19,House>- You spin the urine? - Not yet.

305
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,850
<15-21,House>做完了通知我
<15-21,House>Talk to me when you have.

306
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,330
<16-1,House>发现什么了
<16-1,House>What'd you find out?

307
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,180
<16-2,Foreman>肾衰  急性间质性肾炎
<16-2,Foreman>Kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.

308
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,020
<16-3,House>我在想这重要吗
<16-3,House>I wonder if that's significant.

309
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,050
<16-4,Foreman>那就表示抗生素并非肾衰诱因
<16-4,Foreman>It means the antibiotics didn't cause the kidney failure.

310
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,910
<16-4,Foreman>你怎么知道的
<16-4,Foreman>How'd you know?

311
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,140
<16-5,House>要是你们没有忙着挑我的刺
<16-5,House>If you guys hadn't been so busy trying to prove me wrong,

312
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,900
<16-5,House>就会有空观察可怜的男孩
<16-5,House>you might've checked in on the poor kid.

313
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,360
<16-6,Foreman>你看过病人了吗
<16-6,Foreman>You visited a patient?

314
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,550
<16-7,House>我在他床边坐了一个早上
<16-7,House>I was sitting by his bed all morning,

315
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,540
<16-7,House>让他知道还有人关心他
<16-7,House>just so he'd know someone was there for him.

316
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,310
<16-8,Wilson>我看过他了  好多了
<16-8,Wilson>I looked in on him. He's much better.

317
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,910
<16-9,House>因此  治疗起效了
<16-9,House>Ergo, the treatment's working.

318
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,550
<16-9,House>因此  我对  你们错
<16-9,House>Ergo, me right, you wrong.

319
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,550
<16-10,Foreman>我为男孩高兴
<16-10,Foreman>Hey, I'm glad for the kid.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,430
<16-11,Wilson>装模作样的确是你的魅力所在
<16-11,Wilson>That smugness of yours really is an attractive quality.

321
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,470
<16-11,Wilson>谢谢
<16-11,Wilson>Thank you.

322
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,590
<16-12,House>要不我就去把头发染了
<16-12,House>It was either that or get my hair highlighted.

323
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,370
<16-12,House>装模作样保持起来要容易得多
<16-12,House>Smugness is easier to maintain.

324
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,930
<16-13,Wilson>我明白你不相信蜂蜜抓苍蝇的方法
<16-13,Wilson>I get that you're not a big believer in the "catching flies with honey" approach,

325
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,280
<16-13,Wilson>但你真的相信嘲弄法能抓一罐子吗
<16-13,Wilson>but do you honestly think you'll collect a jarful by cleverly taunting them?

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,290
<16-14,House>苍蝇  不行  医生  一定
<16-14,House>Flies, no. Doctors, sure.

327
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,110
<16-14,House>要是我和福曼说
<16-14,House>If I'd said to Foreman,

328
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,530
<16-14,House>"尝试的好  猜得不错
<16-14,House>"Nice try. Great guess,

329
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,620
<16-14,House>但是对不起  不对"
<16-14,House>but sorry, not this time,"

330
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,630
<16-14,House>你觉得他现在会在干嘛
<16-14,House>what do you think he'd be doing right now?

331
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,530
<16-15,Wilson>我想他回家时不会觉得自己一无是处
<16-15,Wilson>I think he'd go home not feeling like a piece of crap.

332
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,450
<16-16,House>没错
<16-16,House>Exactly.

333
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,080
<16-17,Wilson>你想让他觉得自己一无是处吗
<16-17,Wilson>You want him to feel like a piece of crap?

334
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,360
<16-18,House>不  我不想让他回家
<16-18,House>No. I don't want him going home.

335
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,110
<17-1,Brandon>福曼医生
<17-1,Brandon>Dr. Foreman.

336
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,620
<17-3,Brandon>-还是咳嗽吗  -但感觉好多了
<17-3,Brandon>- Still have the cough. - I'm feeling a lot better though.

337
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,290
<17-4,Foreman>他的烧退了  疹子也退了
<17-4,Foreman>His fever is gone. His rash is going away.

338
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,260
<17-5,Mindy>-知道了  -一切都好吗
<17-5,Mindy>- I see. - Is everything okay?

339
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,000
<17-6,Foreman>就是预约几个检查  没有什么可担心的
<17-6,Foreman>Just ordering some tests. Absolutely nothing to worry about.

340
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,270
<18-1,Patient>还要多久
<18-1,Patient>How much longer?

341
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,270
<18-2,House>9点半  我想我呼她的时候  她在8号洞
<18-2,House>9:30. I figure she was on the eighth hole when I paged her.

342
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,600
<18-2,House>大概能玩半个小时
<18-2,House>You probably got another half hour.

343
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,940
<18-3,Foreman>我检测了促甲状腺激素  三碘甲状腺素
<18-3,Foreman>I ran a T.S.H., T3

344
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,050
<18-3,Foreman>甲状腺素  不是甲状腺机能减退
<18-3,Foreman>and T4. The patient's negative for hypothyroidism.

345
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,290
<18-3,Foreman>说的不是你
<18-3,Foreman>I'm not talking about you.

346
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,350
<18-4,House>事实是  他在好转
<18-4,House>The fact that he's getting better would

347
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,040
<18-4,House>说明检测结果不可靠
<18-4,House>indicate the unreliability of the tests.

348
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,020
<18-5,Foreman>如果我是对的  是病毒感染
<18-5,Foreman>If I'm right and it's a viral infection,

349
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,330
<18-5,Foreman>下面两种情况必有其一
<18-5,Foreman>one of two things always happen:

350
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,160
<18-5,Foreman>病人死亡  或病人免疫系统抗击感染
<18-5,Foreman>The patient dies, or the patient's immune system fights off the invader.

351
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,010
<18-5,Foreman>她怎么回事
<18-5,Foreman>What's with her?

352
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,240
<18-6,House>跑了6英里后  她腿疼
<18-6,House>Her leg hurts after running six miles.

353
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,390
<18-6,House>谁知道呢  什么都有可能
<18-6,House>Who knows? Could be anything.

354
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,740
<18-7,Foreman>他在好转并不证明你是对的
<18-7,Foreman>He's getting better. That doesn't prove you're right.

355
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,910
<18-7,Foreman>仅证明他在好转
<18-7,Foreman>That just proves he's getting better.

356
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,950
<18-7,Foreman>不是两病同发  不可能是两病同发
<18-7,Foreman>It-It's not two illnesses. It can't be two illnesses.

357
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,640
<18-8,House>你在这里工作  我太高兴了
<18-8,House>I am so glad you work here.

358
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,630
<18-9,Foreman>如果我是对的  你开的抗生素
<18-9,Foreman>If I'm right, the antibiotics you prescribed...

359
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,930
<18-9,Foreman>会阻断肝肾  抑止抵抗病毒的能力
<18-9,Foreman>could box his kidneys and liver, impeding his ability to fight off the virus.

360
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,770
<18-10,House>-会害死他的  -这的确值得考虑
<18-10,House>- It could kill him. - Well, that certainly would be a concern.

361
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,860
<18-10,House>赌50元吗
<18-10,House>Fifty bucks?

362
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,550
<18-10,House>别走神  太空猴子会打败你的
<18-10,House>Don't look away. The space monkeys will be all over you.

363
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,660
<18-11,Foreman>你要那病人的健康打赌
<18-11,Foreman>You wanna bet on the patient's health?

364
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,220
<18-12,House>你认为不吉利吗
<18-12,House>You think that's bad luck?

365
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,300
<18-12,House>你认为上帝会因我们的无动于衷而惩罚他吗
<18-12,House>You think that God will smite him because of our insensitivity?

366
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,710
<18-12,House>要是这样  白送你50块
<18-12,House>Well, if God does, you make a quick 50.

367
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,020
<18-12,House>-噢  -检查他的白细胞计数
<18-12,House>- Oh. - Go check his white blood count.

368
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,950
<18-12,House>若如你想的是病毒感染  会显著升高
<18-12,House>If he's fighting off a virus like you think, it'll be way up.

369
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,920
<18-13,Wilson>卡迪说你要求会诊  什么事  我忙呢
<18-13,Wilson>Hey. Cuddy said you needed a consult. What's up? I'm busy.

370
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,340
<19-2,Cameron>-我就是一时嘴快  -你什么也没说
<19-2,Cameron>- I was just being glib. - You haven't said anything.

371
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,640
<19-4,Cameron>不  之前  我说布兰登女友
<19-4,Cameron>No. Before, when I was talking about Brandon's girlfriend

372
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,140
<19-4,Cameron>认为做爱能害死人的时候
<19-4,Cameron>thinking sex could kill you.

373
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,600
<19-4,Cameron>我就是开玩笑  因为我不是很自在
<19-4,Cameron>I was just making a joke because I was uncomfortable.

374
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,350
<19-5,Chase>我连你说过什么都不记得了
<19-5,Chase>Oh, I don't even remember what you said.

375
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,630
<19-6,Cameron>性让我心神不安
<19-6,Cameron>I'm uncomfortable about sex.

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,630
<19-7,Chase>-我们没有必要讨论这个  -性能害死你
<19-7,Chase>- Well, we don't have to talk about this. - Sex could kill you.

377
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,800
<19-8,Cameron>你知道在做爱时人体会发生什么变化吗
<19-8,Cameron>Do you know what the human body goes through when you have sex?

378
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,360
<19-8,Cameron>瞳孔放大  动脉收缩
<19-8,Cameron>Pupils dilate. Arteries constrict.

379
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,470
<19-8,Cameron>体温上升  心跳加速  血压猛涨
<19-8,Cameron>Core temperature rises, heart races, blood pressure skyrockets.

380
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,840
<19-8,Cameron>呼吸短浅而急促
<19-8,Cameron>Respiration becomes rapid and shallow.

381
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,120
<19-8,Cameron>大脑肆意地
<19-8,Cameron>The brain fires bursts of

382
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,250
<19-8,Cameron>放射电脉冲
<19-8,Cameron>electrical impulses from nowhere to nowhere.

383
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,120
<19-8,Cameron>各腺体排放分泌物
<19-8,Cameron>Secretions spit out of every gland,

384
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,800
<19-8,Cameron>肌肉的收缩程度
<19-8,Cameron>and the muscles tense and spasm

385
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,350
<19-8,Cameron>相当于你在举起你体重三倍的重物
<19-8,Cameron>Like you're lifting three times your body weight.

386
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,090
<19-8,Cameron>它就是暴力  丑陋与肮脏的混合体
<19-8,Cameron>It's violent, it's ugly, and it's messy.

387
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,120
<19-8,Cameron>如果上帝没有把性变得难以置信地有趣
<19-8,Cameron>and if god hadn't made it unbelievably fun,

388
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,000
<19-8,Cameron>那么人类早已灭绝了
<19-8,Cameron>the human race would've died out eons ago.

389
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,560
<19-8,Cameron>男人只有一次性高潮是很幸运的事情
<19-8,Cameron>Men are lucky they can only have one orgasm.

390
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,670
<19-8,Cameron>你知道女人会有长达一小时的性高潮吗
<19-8,Cameron>You know that women can have an hour-long orgasm?

391
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,740
<19-9,Chase>嘿  福曼  怎么了
<19-9,Chase>Hey, Foreman. What's up?

392
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,040
<19-9,Chase>-嘿  福曼  -嗨
<19-9,Chase>- Hey, Foreman. - Hey.

393
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,770
<19-11,House>白血球数量不高  是吧
<19-11,House>White cell count isn't up, is it?

394
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,280
<19-12,Foreman>是的  我们都错了
<19-12,Foreman>No. We were both wrong.

395
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,520
<19-12,Foreman>白血球数量极低  而且还在下降
<19-12,Foreman>White cell count is down- way down-and dropping.

396
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,080
<19-12,Foreman>他的免疫系统衰竭了  我们要把他带到无菌室
<19-12,Foreman>His immune system is shot. We need to get him into a clean room.

397
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,090
<20-1,Chase>你还能走吗  布兰登
<20-1,Chase>Can you walk, Brandon?

398
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,160
<20-2,Brandon>嗯  勉强可以吧
<20-2,Brandon>Yeah. A little.

399
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,700
<20-3,Chase>很好  因为我们不能把轮椅带进去  谢谢了
<20-3,Chase>Okay. 'Cause we'll need to leave the chair outside. Thank you.

400
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,410
<20-3,Chase>艾普尔在哪里  艾普尔
<20-3,Chase>Where's April? April?

401
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,560
<20-3,Chase>麻烦把轮椅拿出去  谢谢了
<20-3,Chase>Can you take that chair, please? Thank you.

402
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,290
<20-3,Chase>没问题  罗伯特
<20-3,Chase>Yes, Robert.

403
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,720
<20-3,Chase>我要把你的口罩和长袍脱下
<20-3,Chase>I'll need to take your, um- your mask and your robe too.

404
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,190
<20-3,Chase>塞住你的耳朵的吧  会很吵的
<20-3,Chase>You might wanna block your ears for this, it's quite loud.

405
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,940
<20-4,Foreman>某些东西使他的免疫减弱了
<20-4,Foreman>Something's made him immuno-compromised.

406
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,910
<20-5,Cameron>他的白血球含量很低
<20-5,Cameron>His white blood cell count is down,

407
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,510
<20-5,Cameron>就是说他的身体不能抵抗感染
<20-5,Cameron>which means his body can't fight off infections.

408
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,680
<20-6,Foreman>如果他稍有生病  他就会死了
<20-6,Foreman>If he gets sick, he'll die.

409
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,330
<20-6,Foreman>稍有生病  什么样的病
<20-6,Foreman>Sick? How sick?

410
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,650
<20-7,Foreman>如果他感冒了  他就会死
<20-7,Foreman>If he gets a cold, he'll die.

411
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,940
<21-1,Foreman>好了  我会把针穿进你的髋骨取出一些骨髓
<21-1,Foreman>Okay. I'm gonna push the needle into your hip bone and take some of the marrow.

412
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,480
<21-2,Brandon>这也没多疼啊
<21-2,Brandon>That's not so bad.

413
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,390
<21-2,Brandon>这只是麻醉而已
<21-2,Brandon>That was just the anesthetic.

414
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,120
<21-3,Foreman>真正的活组织检查针头  有点大了
<21-3,Foreman>The core biopsy needle, it's a bit bigger.

415
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,360
<21-3,Foreman>兄弟  深呼吸吧  这将是非一般的疼
<21-3,Foreman>Hey, man. Take a deep breath. This-this is gonna hurt... A lot.

416
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,240
<21-3,Foreman>你的骨髓制造血细胞
<21-3,Foreman>Your marrow makes the blood cells.

417
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,940
<21-3,Foreman>我们在显微镜下观察一下
<21-3,Foreman>We take a peek at it under a microscope,

418
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,000
<21-3,Foreman>也许就会发现病毒感染
<21-3,Foreman>and maybe we find a viral infection.

419
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,110
<21-3,Foreman>也可能会发现纤维变性
<21-3,Foreman>Maybe we find some fibrosis.

420
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,180
<21-3,Foreman>反正是可以解释你血细胞数量那么低的东西
<21-3,Foreman>Something to explain why your blood count is so low.

421
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,120
<21-3,Foreman>搞定了
<21-3,Foreman>There we go.

422
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,850
<21-3,Foreman>离答案又近了一步了
<21-3,Foreman>One step closer to an answer.

423
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,220
<21-4,Brandon>如果你找不到的话
<21-4,Brandon>If you don't find one,

424
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,360
<21-4,Brandon>我也不能一直在无菌室里待着
<21-4,Brandon>I can't stay here forever.

425
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,640
<22-1,House>-病人可能会死  -肌肉拉伤那个吗
<22-1,House>- The patient could've died. - The one with the pulled muscle?

426
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,550
<22-2,Cuddy>还有很多种疾病可以出现这个症状
<22-2,Cuddy>Those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions.

427
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,790
<22-3,House>我有权参加会诊啊
<22-3,House>I'm entitled to a consult.

428
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,520
<22-4,Cuddy>你逃不掉门诊任务的
<22-4,Cuddy>You are not getting out of clinic duty.

429
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,590
<22-5,House>拜托  你还有一堆白痴医生能很热情
<22-5,House>Come on. You got a hundred other idiot doctors in this building who go...

430
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,310
<22-5,House>富有同情心  去给别人拿出鼻子里的玩具车
<22-5,House>warm and fuzzy every time they pull a toy car out of a nose,

431
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,990
<22-5,House>你根本不用我在这里
<22-5,House>you don't need me here.

432
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,890
<22-5,House>我是不需要
<22-5,House>No, I don't.

433
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,230
<22-6,Cuddy>但是和他人一起工作能让你进步
<22-6,Cuddy>But working with people actually makes you a better doctor.

434
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,620
<22-7,House>我什么时候报名上这堂课了
<22-7,House>When did I sign up for that course?

435
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,390
<22-8,Cuddy>我什么时候让你觉得我在意了
<22-8,Cuddy>When did I give you the impression that I care?

436
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,400
<22-9,House>在门诊工作显然会慢慢变得更有同情心
<22-9,House>Working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion.

437
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,280
<22-9,House>我有你家的电话号码的吧
<22-9,House>I've got your home number, right?

438
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,970
<22-9,House>就怕凌晨3点会有突发事件
<22-9,House>In case anything comes up at 3:00 in the morning.

439
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,670
<22-9,House>没有用的  知道为什么吗
<22-9,House>It's not gonna work. You know why?

440
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,240
<22-10,Cuddy>因为这挺好玩的
<22-10,Cuddy>Because this is fun.

441
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,290
<22-10,Cuddy>你想尽办法让我悲惨
<22-10,Cuddy>You think of something to make me miserable.

442
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,220
<22-10,Cuddy>我也想尽办法让你悲惨
<22-10,Cuddy>I think of something to make you miserable.

443
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,950
<22-10,Cuddy>这是个游戏  我会赢的
<22-10,Cuddy>It's a game, and I'm gonna win

444
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,950
<22-10,Cuddy>我已经有个好的开端了  你已经很悲惨了
<22-10,Cuddy>Because I got a head start. You are already miserable.

445
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,830
<22-12,Cuddy>这很重要吗
<22-12,Cuddy>Is this important?

446
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,830
<22-13,Wilson>-不  -很好
<22-13,Wilson>- Uh, no. - Good.

447
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,770
<22-15,Wilson>-你和她怎么了  -别问了
<22-15,Wilson>- What's with you and her? - Don't.

448
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,700
<22-17,Wilson>你喜欢她的是吧  唯一可以让你...
<22-17,Wilson>You have a thing for her? The only people who can get to you-

449
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,830
<22-18,House>不  恨与爱不只有一线之隔
<22-18,House>No. There is not a thin line between love and hate.

450
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,940
<22-18,House>事实上  爱与恨之间是有一道长城
<22-18,House>There is, in fact, a great wall of china,

451
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,150
<22-18,House>每隔20尺还有武装的哨兵
<22-18,House>with armed sentries posted every 20 feet between love and hate.

452
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,480
<22-19,Pharmacist>-36片维科丁  -病人是谁
<22-19,Pharmacist>- Thirty-six vicodin. - Who's the patient?

453
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,380
<22-20,House>-我  -你不能
<22-20,House>-I am. - You can't-

454
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,940
<22-22,House>-威尔森医生是处方医师  -是的
<22-22,House>- Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician. - Yeah.

455
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,230
<22-23,Wilson>你为了拿到你想要的会撒谎  欺骗和偷窃
<22-23,Wilson>You will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want,

456
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,180
<22-23,Wilson>但是你不会拍马屁
<22-23,Wilson>but you're incapable of kissing a little ass?

457
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,190
<22-24,House>我们都有不足之处
<22-24,House>We all have our limitations.

458
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,490
<22-25,Wilson>豪斯  你拿错药了  帮我个忙
<22-25,Wilson>House? Wrong bottle. Do me a favor.

459
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,610
<22-25,Wilson>吃一片药  等个5分钟
<22-25,Wilson>Take one of these, wait five minutes

460
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,560
<22-25,Wilson>让它发挥药性  然后去找卡迪拍拍马屁
<22-25,Wilson>for it to kick in, then find Cuddy and kiss her ass.

461
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,230
<22-26,House>那孩子最先的症状是什么
<22-26,House>What was the kid's first symptom?

462
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,510
<22-26,House>你整理的病历  他的800个症状
<22-26,House>You did the history. Of his 800 symptoms,

463
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,800
<22-26,House>哪个是第一个
<22-26,House>which one hit him first?

464
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,810
<22-27,Wilson>咳嗽
<22-27,Wilson>Uh, the cough.

465
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,700
<23-1,House>痛风
<23-1,House>Gout.

466
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,170
<23-2,Chase>-我们在讨论布兰登吗  -痛风吗
<23-2,Chase>- Are we talking about Brandon? - Gout?

467
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,180
<23-3,Foreman>关节里有尿酸结晶吗
<23-3,Foreman>Uric acid crystals in the joints?

468
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,860
<23-3,Foreman>症状是疼痛  肿胀  发红
<23-3,Foreman>The symptoms are pain, swelling, redness,

469
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,120
<23-3,Foreman>四肢强直  我在白板上一个都看不到啊
<23-3,Foreman>stiffness. Not one of which do I see on that board.

470
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,480
<23-5,Chase>因为他没有得痛风
<23-5,Chase>Because he doesn't have gout.

471
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,150
<23-4,House>每一天  细胞都会死
<23-4,House>Every day, cells die.

472
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,280
<23-4,House>我们还活着是因为
<23-4,House>We survive because the

473
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,620
<23-4,House>活细胞分裂取代死掉的细胞
<23-4,House>remaining cells divide and replace the losses.

474
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,690
<23-4,House>秋水仙素  治疗痛风的药物
<23-4,House>The colchicine, a gout medicine,

475
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,280
<23-4,House>阻挡了有丝分裂和停止了细胞分裂
<23-4,House>blocks mitosis and stops cell division,

476
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,980
<23-4,House>会引起腹部的疼痛  皮疹
<23-4,House>which will result in abdominal pain, rash,

477
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,420
<23-4,House>恶心  发烧  肾衰竭  低血压
<23-4,House>nausea, fever, kidney failure, low blood pressure...

478
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,820
<23-4,House>还会在骨髓里捣乱
<23-4,House>and will also mess with the bone marrow.

479
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,050
<23-5,Chase>但是他没有痛风  为什么他会吃痛风药
<23-5,Chase>But he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?

480
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,320
<23-5,Chase>因为你们是正确的
<23-5,Chase>Because you guys were right.

481
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,590
<23-6,House>他没有同时出现两个状况
<23-6,House>He didn't have two conditions at the exact same time.

482
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,770
<23-6,House>首先  他咳嗽
<23-6,House>First, he got a cough.

483
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,120
<23-6,House>又因为他是个白痴  他去找医生了
<23-6,House>And because he's an idiot, he went to a doctor.

484
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,820
<23-6,House>为了不愧对收他的两百美金
<23-6,House>In order to justify charging $200,

485
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,160
<23-6,House>那医生就觉得他应该做些什么
<23-6,House>that doctor felt he should actually do something.

486
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,900
<23-6,House>他写了一个处方
<23-6,House>Oops. He wrote a prescription.

487
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,810
<23-6,House>每年有7千人死于药房的错误
<23-6,House>Seven thousand people die each year from pharmacy screwups.

488
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,810
<23-6,House>不亚于死于医生的出错
<23-6,House>Not nearly as many as die from doctor screwups,

489
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,510
<23-6,House>但仍然  不会影响医生们的晋升
<23-6,House>But still, not something they use in their promotional materials.

490
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,080
<23-6,House>药剂师没给他咳嗽药反而给他痛风药
<23-6,House>The pharmacist gave him gout medicine instead of cough medicine.

491
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,310
<23-6,House>唯一不会有的一个作用就是
<23-6,House>And the only thing it wouldn't do,

492
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,380
<23-6,House>不会治好他的咳嗽
<23-6,House>it would do absolutely nothing to relieve his cough.

493
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,490
<23-7,Cameron>奥坎简化律
<23-7,Cameron>Occam's razor-

494
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,940
<23-7,Cameron>最简单的解释
<23-7,Cameron>The simplest explanation

495
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,360
<23-7,Cameron>经常就是什么人出错了
<23-7,Cameron>is almost always that somebody screwed up.

496
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,590
<23-7,Cameron>但当他住进来我们医院的时候
<23-7,Cameron>But once he checked into this hospital,

497
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,430
<23-7,Cameron>他就完全在我们控制之下了
<23-7,Cameron>he was completely in our control.

498
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,660
<23-7,Cameron>我们提供的食物  药物  一切东西
<23-7,Cameron>Our food, our pills, our everything.

499
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,400
<23-7,Cameron>所以即使你是对的  断绝痛风药之后
<23-7,Cameron>So even if you're right, no more gout medication.

500
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,130
<23-7,Cameron>要么他的病情持续恶化
<23-7,Cameron>He'd either continue to deteriorate,

501
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,470
<23-7,Cameron>要么就好了
<23-7,Cameron>or he would've gotten better.

502
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,380
<23-7,Cameron>但是他是先转好  然后再恶化的
<23-7,Cameron>But he got better, and then he got worse.

503
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,920
<23-7,Cameron>这不对头啊  没有道理啊
<23-7,Cameron>It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.

504
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
<23-8,House>好吧  两个人出错了
<23-8,House>Okay. Two people screwed up.

505
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,580
<23-8,House>没有一个人出错那么简单  但是
<23-8,House>Not as simple as one, but-

506
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,060
<24-1,Mindy>-他在休息呢  -我是豪斯医生
<24-1,Mindy>- He's resting. He's - I'm Dr. House.

507
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,420
<24-2,House>是你们孩子的医生
<24-2,House>I'm your son's physician.

508
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,130
<24-2,House>哦  是那个我们还没有见过的医生
<24-2,House>Oh. You're the one we haven't met yet.

509
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,890
<24-2,House>也是他没有见过的医生
<24-2,House>You're the one he hasn't met.

510
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,610
<24-3,House>没有见过病人你怎么治疗病人呢
<24-3,House>How can you treat someone without meeting them?

511
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,840
<24-3,House>只要不和他说什么废话就很容易
<24-3,House>It's easy if you don't give a crap about him.

512
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,400
<24-3,House>那是件好事
<24-3,House>That's a good thing.

513
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,420
<24-3,House>如果感情让你理性行事
<24-3,House>If emotions made you act rationally,

514
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,750
<24-3,House>那就不会叫做感情了  是吧
<24-3,House>well, they wouldn't be called emotions, right?

515
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,120
<24-3,House>那就是我们为什么有分工合作的原因
<24-3,House>That's why we have this nice division of labor.

516
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,790
<24-3,House>你握着他的手  我让他好转
<24-3,House>You hold his hand, I get him better.

517
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,210
<24-3,House>如果我晚上来守着他
<24-3,House>If I start tucking him in at night,

518
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,320
<24-3,House>那就对你们不公平了
<24-3,House>well, that's not fair to you guys.

519
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,790
<24-3,House>而如果你们去写处方
<24-3,House>And if you start prescribing medicine,

520
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,830
<24-3,House>那就对我不公平了
<24-3,House>well, that's not fair to me.

521
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,630
<24-3,House>所以  我想知道的是  谁踏进我这半场了
<24-3,House>So, what I wanna know is, who stepped on my side of the net?

522
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,350
<24-3,House>谁那么过于关心他
<24-3,House>Who cared enough to get

523
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,570
<24-3,House>笨到又让他吃咳嗽药了
<24-3,House>stupid enough to give him his cough medicine?

524
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,570
<24-4,Mindy>当我们入住的时候  福曼医生
<24-4,Mindy>When we checked in, Dr. Foreman-

525
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,630
<24-5,House>星期二  他好转了  星期三  又恶化了
<24-5,House>Tuesday, he's getting better. Wednesday, he's getting sick again.

526
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,410
<24-5,House>某人让他在星期三的时候吃了咳嗽药
<24-5,House>Somebody gave him his cough medicine wednesday.

527
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,310
<24-5,House>拜托  没有人会生气的
<24-5,House>Come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.

528
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,880
<24-5,House>我只是想知道谁试图杀了那小孩
<24-5,House>I just wanna know who tried to kill the kid.

529
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,360
<24-6,Foreman>-豪斯医生  我们或许  -他喉咙疼
<24-6,Foreman>- Dr. House, maybe we should... - His throat was sore.

530
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,700
<24-7,House>-呼叫奥克姆医生  他会想听听  -抱歉
<24-7,House>- Page Dr. Occam. He's gonna wanna hear about this.  - I'm sorry.

531
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,610
<24-7,House>他那时候在咳嗽  我只是想帮他
<24-7,House>He was coughing, and I just wanted to help him.

532
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,940
<24-8,House>你真可爱
<24-8,House>Aren't you a dear.

533
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,540
<24-8,House>药呢
<24-8,House>Where are the pills?

534
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,880
<25-3,Chase>在他换到那间病房之前他吃掉最后一片了
<25-3,Chase>He took the last of'em before he was switched into that room.

535
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,610
<25-4,Pharmacist>-都吃完了嘛  -那只是咳嗽药
<25-4,Pharmacist>- They're all gone? - It was just cough medicine.

536
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,310
<24-10,House>那不是咳嗽药  瓶子在哪
<24-10,House>No, it wasn't. Where's the bottle?

537
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,360
<25-1,Chase>我们要知道你到底放了什么药进这瓶子里
<25-1,Chase>We need to know exactly what you put in this bottle.

538
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,360
<25-1,Chase>我们认为是秋水仙素  治疗痛风的药
<25-1,Chase>We think it was colchicine, a gout medication.

539
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,420
<25-2,Pharmacist>如果处方上写的是咳嗽药  我装瓶的就是
<25-2,Pharmacist>If the prescription said cough medicine, that's what I dispensed.

540
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,660
<25-3,Chase>他们不打算追究责任  好吧
<25-3,Chase>The family is prepared to waive liability, all right?

541
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,570
<25-3,Chase>我们只是想知道里面是什么
<25-3,Chase>We just need to know what it was,

542
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,900
<25-4,Pharmacist>-剂量是多少  -就是咳嗽药
<25-4,Pharmacist>- What dosage it was... - It was cough medicine.

543
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,470
<25-5,Chase>再装一次
<25-5,Chase>Refill it.

544
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,250
<25-6,Mindy>-他会没事的  -谁知道呢
<25-6,Mindy>- He's gonna be okay.  - You don't know that.

545
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,640
<25-6,Mindy>布兰登就喜欢你这种性格的人吗
<25-6,Mindy>Does Brandon like that quality in you?

546
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,880
<25-7,Mindy>你有些消极
<25-7,Mindy>You're a little negative.

547
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,100
<25-7,Mindy>事情不全是往好的方面发展的
<25-7,Mindy>Things don't always work out for the best.

548
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,100
<25-7,Mindy>希望它好也没有坏处啊
<25-7,Mindy>Doesn't hurt to hope they do.

549
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,140
<25-8,Mindy>是的  直到让你认为
<25-8,Mindy>No. Not unless that makes you figure you

550
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,000
<25-8,Mindy>你可以为所欲为  就像给别人吃咳嗽药
<25-8,Mindy>can do whatever you want, like give people cough medicine.

551
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,130
<25-9,Chase>这是咳嗽药
<25-9,Chase>This is cough medication.

552
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,900
<25-9,Chase>这是布兰登应该拿到的药
<25-9,Chase>This is what Brandon was supposed to get.

553
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,670
<25-9,Chase>圆形黄色小药片
<25-9,Chase>They're small, round and yellow.

554
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,740
<25-9,Chase>你可以告诉这个人到底
<25-9,Chase>Can you tell this man what the pills

555
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,280
<25-9,Chase>你孩子的药瓶里装的药是怎样的吗
<25-9,Chase>in your son's medicine bottle actually looked like?

556
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,210
<25-9,Chase>就是像这样的圆形黄色小药片
<25-9,Chase>They were small, round and yellow, exactly like this.

557
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,350
<25-10,Mindy>这就是布兰登当时吃的药
<25-10,Mindy>Those were the pills that Brandon was taking.

558
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,260
<25-11,Pharmacist>嘿  也许我只是个小小药剂师
<25-11,Pharmacist>Hey, I'm just a pharmacist,

559
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,140
<25-11,Pharmacist>但我认得止咳药什么样  医生
<25-11,Pharmacist>but I know what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.

560
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,410
<26-1,House>原本是多么完美  多么美好
<26-1,House>It was so perfect. It was beautiful.

561
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,910
<26-2,Wilson>美好常常在通往真理的路上诱惑我们
<26-2,Wilson>Beauty often seduces us on the road to truth.

562
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,100
<26-3,House>而陈腐把我们推入泥沼
<26-3,House>And triteness kicks us in the nads.

563
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,690
<26-5,House>-如此真实  -你不感到困扰吗
<26-5,House>- So true. - This doesn't bother you?

564
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,230
<26-6,Wilson>为你的错误吗  我努力走出痛苦
<26-6,Wilson>That you were wrong? I try to work through the pain.

565
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,270
<26-7,House>我没有错  我说的全部都是事实
<26-7,House>I was not wrong. Everything I said was true.

566
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,040
<26-7,House>切合病情  一流的诊断
<26-7,House>It fit. It was elegant.

567
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,330
<26-8,Wilson>这么说  是现实错了吗
<26-8,Wilson>So, reality was wrong?

568
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,150
<26-9,House>现实几乎总是错的
<26-9,House>Reality's almost always wrong.

569
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,210
<26-9,House>他吃的止咳药肯定有问题
<26-9,House>The cough medicine did something.

570
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,200
<26-9,House>加重了病情
<26-9,House>Aggravated the condition.

571
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,980
<26-9,House>扩散到全身  一定在他的血液里
<26-9,House>It's all over the place. Must be in his blood.

572
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,110
<26-10,Wilson>-如果是血液本身呢  -淋巴瘤
<26-10,Wilson>- What if it is his blood? - Lymphoma?

573
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,340
<26-12,Wilson>除非你有更好的解释
<26-12,Wilson>Unless you've got something better.

574
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,610
<26-13,House>我们愚蠢地排除了淋巴瘤
<26-13,House>We foolishly ruled out lymphoma

575
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,000
<26-13,House>因为他的CT扫描没有淋巴结肿大
<26-13,House>because his C.T. scan showed no adenopathy,

576
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,940
<26-13,House>全血细胞计数正常
<26-13,House>C.B.C. Showed a normal differen-smear,

577
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,800
<26-13,House>-骨髓也没有...  -别管这些检查了
<26-13,House>- bone marrow showed no-- - Screw the tests.

578
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,890
<26-14,Wilson>做个剖腹探查  找出是什么在作怪
<26-14,Wilson>Do an exploratory laparotomy and find out what's in there.

579
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,510
<26-15,House>他没有血压  没有免疫系统  也没有肾
<26-15,House>He has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys.

580
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,520
<26-15,House>手术会要了他的命
<26-15,House>Surgery will kill him.

581
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,170
<26-16,Wilson>对  你说得对
<26-16,Wilson>Yeah, you're right.

582
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,620
<26-16,Wilson>我们就继续认为他吃错药好了
<26-16,Wilson>Let's stick with the wrong pill theory.

583
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,960
<26-17,House>我来给他安排手术时间
<26-17,House>I'll schedule him for surgery.

584
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,660
<27-1,Foreman>准备好  布兰登
<27-1,Foreman>Okay, Brandon,

585
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,340
<27-1,Foreman>我们正在用电子导管检视你的心脏
<27-1,Foreman>we're running this tube through your heart...

586
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,870
<27-1,Foreman>然后进入肺动脉
<27-1,Foreman>and into the pulmonary arteries in your lungs.

587
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,840
<27-2,Cameron>传感器会给我们提供
<27-2,Cameron>The sensors will give us information we need

588
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,210
<27-2,Cameron>下午探查手术所需信息
<27-2,Cameron>for the exploratory surgery later this afternoon.

589
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,410
<27-3,Brandon>-我手指没感觉了  -尽量不要动
<27-3,Brandon>- My fingers are numb. - Try not to move.

590
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,560
<27-4,Foreman>现在导管到了右心房
<27-4,Foreman>We're in the right atrium,

591
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,410
<27-4,Foreman>我们正试图截取三尖瓣血流图像
<27-4,Foreman>trying to catch the flow through the tricuspid valve.

592
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,720
<27-5,Chase>我认为导管在心房处弯曲了
<27-5,Chase>I think the catheter's curling in the atrium.

593
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,100
<27-6,Foreman>了解  现在在右心室
<27-6,Foreman>Got it. We're in the R.V. Now.

594
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,580
<27-7,Chase>异位搏动
<27-7,Chase>Ectopy.

595
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,110
<27-7,Chase>-肯定是你刺激到了心壁  -会平稳下来的
<27-7,Chase>- You must've irritated the heart wall. - It'll calm down.

596
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,210
<27-9,Chase>他经不起任何心律失常
<27-9,Chase>He can't tolerate any cardiac arrhythmia.

597
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,100
<27-10,Foreman>-拉回去  -他需要手术
<27-10,Foreman>- Pull back. - He needs the surgery.

598
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,220
<27-11,Cameron>血压下降
<27-11,Cameron>Pressure's dropped.

599
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,650
<27-12,Chase>-能听到我们吗  布兰登  -拉上窗帘
<27-12,Chase>- You still with us, Brandon? - Get the curtains.

600
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,910
<27-12,Chase>室颤
<27-12,Chase>V.F.

601
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,920
<27-14,Chase>充电  闪开
<27-14,Chase>Charging. Clear.

602
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,320
<27-14,Chase>窦心律
<27-14,Chase>Sinus rhythm.

603
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,490
<27-15,Cameron>有脉搏了
<27-15,Cameron>I got a pulse.

604
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,850
<27-16,Foreman>是  但今天做不成手术了
<27-16,Foreman>Yeah, but no surgery today.

605
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,720
<27-17,House>-你好吗  -还行
<27-17,House>- How're you doing? - Okay.

606
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,510
<27-18,Patient>很好  我也不错
<27-18,Patient>Great. I'm doing good too.

607
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,800
<27-19,House>我今天可以提前一小时下班  知道为啥吗
<27-19,House>I get to knock off an hour early today. You know why?

608
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,190
<27-19,House>因为我拍了我老板的马屁  用过这招吗
<27-19,House>Because I kissed my boss's ass. Do you ever do that?

609
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,450
<27-19,House>我想她同意我早下班
<27-19,House>I think she just said yes

610
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,210
<27-19,House>是因为她想强化我的拍马屁行为
<27-19,House>'cause she wants to reinforce that behavior.

611
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,360
<27-19,House>希望我多拍拍别人的马屁
<27-19,House>Wants me to kiss a lot of other people's ass,

612
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,890
<27-19,House>比方说拍你马屁
<27-19,House>like she wants me to kiss yours.

613
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,040
<27-19,House>给你选择  你会要哪种
<27-19,House>What would you want?

614
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,450
<27-19,House>在弥留之际握住你的手的医生
<27-19,House>A doctor who holds your hand while you die,

615
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,840
<27-19,House>还是不理睬你却能让你好转的医生呢
<27-19,House>or a doctor who ignores you while you get better?

616
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,260
<27-19,House>我猜要是摊上个在你快死的时候
<27-19,House>I guess it would particularly suck

617
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,340
<27-19,House>对你不理不睬的医生一定相当郁闷
<27-19,House>to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.

618
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,440
<27-20,Patient>我还是走吧
<27-20,Patient>I should go.

619
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,230
<27-21,House>你以为那玩意儿自己会出来
<27-21,House>You think it's gonna come out on its own?

620
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,660
<27-21,House>不会是比胃还严重吧
<27-21,House>Are we talking bigger than a breadbasket?

621
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,530
<27-21,House>因为实际来讲  是会自己跑出来的
<27-21,House>Because, actually, it will come out on its own.

622
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,690
<27-21,House>东西不大的话没什么问题
<27-21,House>Which for small stuff is no problem.

623
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,590
<27-21,House>被软绵绵的漂亮东西包裹着  扑通一声
<27-21,House>It's wrapped up in a nice, soft package, and plop.

624
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,500
<27-21,House>东西大的话  你要拽一拽才能出来
<27-21,House>Big stuff, you're gonna rip something,

625
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,500
<27-21,House>从医学角度讲
<27-21,House>which, speaking medically,

626
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,270
<27-22,Patient>-就比较无趣了  -你怎么知道...
<27-22,Patient>- is when the fun stops. - How did you--

627
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,870
<27-22,Patient>你在这儿半个钟头了
<27-22,Patient>You've been here half an hour,

628
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,370
<27-23,House>坐都不坐一下  说明是某个特殊位置
<27-23,House>you haven't sat down. That tells me its location.

629
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,070
<27-23,House>你到现在还没告诉我是什么
<27-23,House>You haven't told me what it is.

630
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,960
<27-23,House>说明是个丢人的事
<27-23,House>That tells me it's humiliating.

631
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,660
<27-23,House>你手臂上有个小鸟纹身
<27-23,House>You have a little birdie carved on your arm.

632
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,830
<27-23,House>这说明你对丢人有高度忍受能力
<27-23,House>That tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation.

633
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,270
<27-23,House>所以我估计不是痔疮
<27-23,House>So I figure it's not hemorrhoids.

634
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,710
<27-23,House>我行医二十年了  不会被你吓到的
<27-23,House>I've been a doctor 20 years. You're not gonna surprise me.

635
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,220
<27-24,Patient>是个MP3
<27-24,Patient>It's an MP3 player.

636
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,760
<27-25,House>你是  你是因为它大小正好  形状适合
<27-25,House>Is it- Is it because of the size, or the shape,

637
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,770
<27-25,House>还是重低音效果好
<27-25,House>or is it the pounding bass line?

638
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,910
<27-26,Patient>我们要怎么办
<27-26,Patient>What are we gonna do?

639
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,600
<27-27,House>-我打算等  -等什么
<27-27,House>- I'm gonna wait. - For what?

640
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,940
<28-1,House>好了  三点到了  我走了
<28-1,House>Okay. It's 3:00. I'm off.

641
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,850
<28-1,House>麻烦告诉卡迪医生
<28-1,House>Would you tell Dr. Cuddy

642
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,310
<28-1,House>二号检查室有个病人需要她治疗
<28-1,House>there's a patient in Exam Room Two needs her attention?

643
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,900
<28-1,House>另外美国唱片工业协会希望她查一查非法下载
<28-1,House>And the R.I.A.A. wants her to check for illegal downloads.

644
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,810
<28-2,Cameron>-布兰登还不能做手术  -行啊
<28-2,Cameron>- Brandon's not ready for surgery. - Okay.

645
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,060
<28-3,House>让我们等上几个星期
<28-3,House>Let's leave it a couple of weeks.

646
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,570
<28-3,House>到时候他应该会感觉好些
<28-3,House>He should be feeling better by then.

647
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,320
<28-3,House>噢  等会儿  时间走哪条道
<28-3,House>Oh, wait. Which way does time go?

648
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,630
<28-4,Cameron>他术前准备差点不行了
<28-4,Cameron>He crashed during prep.

649
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,650
<28-5,House>而且他的手指疼
<28-5,House>He's also experiencing pain in his fingers.

650
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,480
<28-4,Cameron>可能无菌室有虫子飞进去了
<28-4,Cameron>Think some bug may have gotten in the clean room.

651
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,860
<28-4,Cameron>我们是不是应该加倍
<28-4,Cameron>I think we should double

652
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,700
<28-4,Cameron>粒细胞集落刺激因子的剂量
<28-4,Cameron>his dosage of G-CSF

653
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,240
<28-4,Cameron>让他临时增加白血球数量
<28-4,Cameron>to temporarily boost his white blood cell count.

654
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,970
<28-5,House>手指上的疼痛感  对了
<28-5,House>Pain in his fingers. Right.

655
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,690
<29-1,House>-又见面了  -他不能...他去哪儿
<29-1,House>- Hi again. - He can't-- Where's he going?

656
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,520
<29-1,House>嘿  大伙儿好吗
<29-1,House>Hey. How you all doing?

657
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,040
<29-2,House>有趣的事实
<29-2,House>Interesting fact.

658
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,150
<29-2,House>每隔七年  就是一个全新的你
<29-2,House>Every seven years, it's a whole new you.

659
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,670
<29-2,House>鼓舞人心的比喻  对吧
<29-2,House>Inspiring metaphor, huh?

660
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,770
<29-3,Chase>-豪斯医生这是无菌室  -是  我看标志了
<29-3,Chase>- Dr. House, this is a clean room. - Yeah. I read the sign.

661
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,070
<29-4,House>但是器官不同  细胞繁殖速度也不一样
<29-4,House>But cells of different organs reproduce at different rates.

662
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,310
<29-4,House>于是乎  每三年你有个新肾
<29-4,House>So, you get a new kidney every three years.

663
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,210
<29-4,House>每星期有新的胃壁
<29-4,House>Get a new stomach lining every week.

664
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,280
<29-4,House>这就是为什么秋水仙素中毒引起这些症状
<29-4,House>This is why colchicine poisoning causes all these symptoms,

665
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,530
<29-4,House>但不是全部同时显现
<29-4,House>but not all at once.

666
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,480
<29-4,House>但我们去了药房  我们看到药片了
<29-4,House>But we went to the pharmacy. We saw the pills.

667
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,130
<29-5,House>秋水仙素发挥毒性是有特定顺序的
<29-5,House>Colchicine does its damage in a very specific order.

668
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,360
<29-5,House>首先
<29-5,House>First of all,

669
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,730
<29-5,House>会有腹痛  皮疹  发热
<29-5,House>there's the pain in the abdomen, the rash, the fever.

670
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,890
<29-5,House>这些不就是你起初的症状吗
<29-5,House>Isn't that what you got first?

671
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,080
<29-5,House>然后肾脏受损  这正是发生在...
<29-5,House>Then the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to--

672
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,290
<29-6,Cameron>-布兰登身上  -对
<29-6,Cameron>- Brandon. - Right.

673
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,910
<29-7,House>接着骨髓出问题  然后神经病变
<29-7,House>Then it screws up your bone marrow, and then neuropathy.

674
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,910
<29-7,House>手指和脚趾出现刺痛
<29-7,House>A painful tingling in the fingers and toes.

675
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,980
<29-7,House>再然后你猜会发生什么呢
<29-7,House>And what do you suppose happens after that?

676
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,910
<29-7,House>头发脱落  告诉你个坏消息...
<29-7,House>Hair loss. The bad news is...

677
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,910
<29-7,House>-你的宝贝儿子在吸毒  -错  他没有
<29-7,House>- your special boy is doing drugs. - No, he's not.

678
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,400
<29-8,House>-迷幻药  -不可能
<29-8,House>- Ecstasy? - No.

679
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,760
<29-9,Brandon>两次  和丹还有麦克一起
<29-9,Brandon>Twice with Dan and Mike.

680
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,500
<29-10,House>你知不知道那东西用什么合成的
<29-10,House>You know what they cut that stuff with?

681
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,420
<29-10,House>显然  秋水仙素
<29-10,House>Apparently, colchicine.

682
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,830
<29-10,House>除非你体内的秋水仙素是通过
<29-10,House>Unless you ingested the colchicine

683
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,220
<29-10,House>隐形眼镜溶液  护肤霜
<29-10,House>through your contact lens solution,

684
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,640
<29-10,House>或者其它你不肯说的药物吸收到的
<29-10,House>or skin cream or some other drug you're lying about.

685
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,160
<29-10,House>我不知道这是怎么发生的  我也不在意
<29-10,House>I don't know how it happened. I don't care how it happened.

686
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,670
<29-10,House>总之是发生了  给...
<29-10,House>It happened. Start, uh-

687
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,280
<29-12,House>-布兰登  -可爱的名字
<29-12,House>- Brandon. - Lovely name.

690
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,910
<29-12,House>再给他几片泰诺[解热镇痛]
<29-12,House>and get him some Tylenol

691
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,270
<29-12,House>我拔了他头发怪疼的
<29-12,House>for the hair I pulled out.

692
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,060
<29-12,House>给里面透透气
<29-12,House>And get some air in here.

693
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,600
<29-12,House>记下这条  我永远不该怀疑自己
<29-12,House>Make a note. I should never doubt myself.

694
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,100
<29-13,Wilson>我想你会记得的
<29-13,Wilson>I think you'll remember. You know,

695
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,220
<29-13,Wilson>知道吗  你偶尔出个错不会伤你自尊的
<29-13,Wilson>it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong every now and then.

696
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,180
<29-14,House>怎么  你不担忧病人的安危吗
<29-14,House>What, you don't care about these people?

697
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,910
<30-1,Foreman>秋水仙素会妨碍
<30-1,Foreman>The colchicine interferes

698
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,090
<30-1,Foreman>心肌收缩能力

699
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,860
<30-1,Foreman>使血液回流  血压降低
<30-1,Foreman>pumping blood, lowering your blood pressure.

700
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,370
<30-1,Foreman>我们给你的抗体
<30-1,Foreman>The antibodies we're giving you

701
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,750
<30-1,Foreman>可以中和秋水仙素

<30-1,Foreman>让你的心脏以正常速率跳动
<30-1,Foreman>allowing your heart to beat at its normal rate.

703
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,980
<30-2,Brandon>什么时候能知道起作用了
<30-2,Brandon>When will you know?

704
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,760
<30-3,Cameron>现在已经知道了
<30-3,Cameron>We know now.

705
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,140
<30-3,Cameron>感谢上帝
<30-3,Cameron>Thank God.

706

<31-1,Wilson>周末过足瘾吗
<31-1,Wilson>Big weekend?

707
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,540
<31-2,House>不是我要药  我的存货充足
<31-2,House>It's not for me. I'm fully stocked.

708
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,710
<31-3,Wilson>-卡迪要你盘点药房库存  -不是
<31-3,Wilson>- Cuddy got you doing inventory? - Nope.

709
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,550
<31-4,House>想要解决那孩子的病案
<31-4,House>Trying to solve that kid's case.

710
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,880
<31-5,Wilson>-痛风药服食过量那个吗  -对啊
<31-5,Wilson>- The gout medicine O.D.? - Yeah.

711
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,460
<31-6,House>事实是我知道是痛风药过量
<31-6,House>The fact that I know it's a gout medicine O.D.

712
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,160
<31-7,Wilson>就意味着这个病案已经完结
<31-7,Wilson>would indicate the case is already solved.

713
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,480
<31-8,House>你这么想就错了
<31-8,House>Well, you'd be wrong.

714
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,800
<31-9,Wilson>那么另一事实呢  这个孩子现在已经
<31-9,Wilson>What about the fact that the kid is now-

715
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,940
<31-9,Wilson>用术语来说应该是"痊愈"
<31-9,Wilson>I believe the technical term is-- "Not sick"?

00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,700
<31-10,House>你知道市面上
<31-10,House>You know how many forms

<31-12,House>Pills, powders, liquids, I. V. Fluids.

720
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,940

<31-12,House>Somewhere at a party,

721
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,400

<31-12,House>这小子有过一些
<31-12,House>this kid had some.

723
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,170
<31-13,Wilson>这么说你对迷幻药的说法不满意
<31-13,Wilson>So you're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?

724
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,330
<31-14,House>-他承认用过两次  -人都会说谎
<31-14,House>- He said he used it twice. - People lie.

725
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,930
<31-16,House>没错  如果你要说谎  那是...
<31-16,House>Yeah. If you're gonna lie, it's--

726
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,890
<31-17,Wilson>你猜怎么着  我没兴趣听
<31-17,Wilson>You know what? I'm not interested.

727
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,020
<31-19,Wilson>-不好奇吗  -不  因为我心里满足了
<31-19,Wilson>- Not curious? - No. Because I'm well-adjusted.

728
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,770
<31-20,House>确实

<32-2,Brandon>-体温正常  -我想雪伦表妹在场
<32-2,Brandon>- Temperature's normal. - I want cousin Sharon there.

<32-2,Brandon>如果我们邀请雪伦

<32-3,Mindy>So what? My side of the family doesn't need anything.

733
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,160
<32-4,Brandon>我觉得
