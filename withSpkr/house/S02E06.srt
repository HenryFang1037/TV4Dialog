<2-23,House>It's so familiar,so comforting.

<4-5,House>有清洁螺旋胸部ct就不同了
<4-5,House>Not with a clean spiralchest ct.

126
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,650
<4-6,Cameron>这家伙在高压氧仓睡觉
<4-6,Cameron>Guy's sleepingin an hyperbaric chamber.

127
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,900
<4-6,Cameron>过度供养可导致细胞毁损,如果毁损细胞在肺部……
<4-6,Cameron>Over-oxygenation cancause cell damage,and if the cellsin the lungs are damaged--

128
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,400
<4-7,House>会导致肺水肿，但他却没有
<4-7,House>that'd causepulmonary edema,which he doesn't have.

129
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,600
<4-8,Chase>他所用的补养品含育亨宾,可导致神经瘫痪
<4-8,Chase>The supplements he's beentaking contain yohimbe,which can causenerve paralysis.

130
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,200
<4-9,House>总氧化值正常
<4-9,House>Tox screen was normal.

131
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,500
<4-9,House>所有的测试都正常
<4-9,House>All the tests were normal.

132
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,550
<4-9,House>没有肿块、腺体瘤，但他依然无法呼吸
<4-9,House>There's no clot,no edema,and yet he still can'tbreathe.

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,350
<4-9,House>所以有我们没看见的东西
<4-9,House>So there's somethingin here that we can't see.

134
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,400
<4-10,Foreman>哦，空气
<4-10,Foreman>Oh. Air.

135
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,650
<4-11,House>到爸爸这来吧
<4-11,House>Come to papa.

136
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,250
<4-12,Foreman>这家伙一直都给自己注射，多少次一天？
<4-12,Foreman>This guy's been injectinghimself how many times a day?

137
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,900
<4-12,Foreman>只是针头一个小的疏忽,就可导致空气栓塞
<4-12,Foreman>All it'd take is oneslip of the needle to cause an air embolus.

138
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,850
<4-13,House>于是空气阻碍了他呼吸空气
<4-13,House>So air is keeping himfrom breathing air.

139
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,500
<4-13,House>我们就当它是个讽刺吧
<4-13,House>Let's go with that for the irony.

140
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,000
<4-13,House>取VQ扫描仪来检查气泡吧
<4-13,House>Get a vq scan and checkhis veins for bubbles.

141
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,100
<5-1,Foreman>氙气133
<5-1,Foreman>Xenon 133.

142
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,600
<5-1,Foreman>其放射性足以使我们,能够追踪在你肺部的空气运动
<5-1,Foreman>It's just radioactive enough for us to track the airmoving through your lungs.

143
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,300
<5-2,Jeff>我的意外上新闻了吗?
<5-2,Jeff>My accident on the news?

144
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,300
<5-3,Foreman>对，没准要闹上个一个星期呢
<5-3,Foreman>Yeah. You madeplays of the week.

145
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,550
<5-4,Jeff>再加把劲，自行车就跟赛车一样风尚了
<5-4,Jeff>Few more of those and cycling will beas popular as nascar.

146
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,800
<5-5,Foreman>我们注射类似的东西进去以观察它的流动
<5-5,Foreman>We inject similar stuffinto your blood so we can watch itcirculate.

147
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
<5-5,Foreman>那么如果你不小心地注射了一个气泡进去
<5-5,Foreman>Now if you accidentallyinjected a bubble,

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,550
<5-5,Foreman>那我们就可以看到空气流通顺畅,但血液流动吃力
<5-5,Foreman>we'll see good air flowbut poor blood flow.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
<5-6,Jeff>嗯，我现在很小心了，伙计
<5-6,Jeff>Un-huh.I'm careful,man.

150
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,050
<5-7,Foreman>还有应有的尊重，伙计
<5-7,Foreman>With all due respect,man,

151
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,250
<5-7,Foreman>我怀疑你对自己还有没有错的事情没做过
<5-7,Foreman>I doubt there's anythingwrong with you that you didn't doto yourself.

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,700
<6-1,Cameron>肿瘤科有个孩子，她床头有杰的照片
<6-1,Cameron>There's this kidin oncology. She's got a pictureof jeff above her bed.

153
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,600
<6-2,Chase>超级米奇是个酒鬼
<6-2,Chase>Mickey mantlewas an alcoholic.

154
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,950
<6-3,Cameron>至少他赢了家乡的比赛
<6-3,Cameron>At least he hithis own home runs.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
<6-3,Cameron>他也不自己吃有毒的东西
<6-3,Cameron>He didn't physicallyalter himself.

156
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,900
<6-4,Chase>我们去药店是想入睡或保持清醒
<6-4,Chase>We take drugsto help us fall asleep,to stay awake.

157
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,050
<6-5,Cameron>我们又不靠看谁能清醒最久论事业成败
<6-5,Cameron>We don't make careers out of who can stayawake the longest.

158
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,700
<6-6,Chase>真的？你上过……嗯,不知道，医科大学吗？
<6-6,Chase>Really? Ever been to,oh,I don't know,med school?

159
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,700
<6-7,Foreman>伙计们，他是为生计比赛,谁管呢？
<6-7,Foreman>Uh,guys,he plays a gamefor a living. Who cares?

160
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,350
<6-7,Foreman>你根本就不看体育台
<6-7,Foreman>You don't even like sports.

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,550
<6-8,Cameron>他赚了上百万的钱欺骗拥护者
<6-8,Cameron>He's making millionsof dollars ripping off fans.

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,900
<6-9,Foreman>任何人觉得该为一个人
<6-9,Foreman>Anyone who thinks they should pay a guy money

163
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,700
<6-9,Foreman>扔球甚远，或蹬脚甚快而付钱
<6-9,Foreman>because he can throw a ball really far,

164
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,800
<6-9,Foreman>都该被骗
<6-9,Foreman>or pedal really fast deservesto be ripped off.

165
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,950
<6-10,Cameron>没错，愚蠢，愚蠢的小孩
<6-10,Cameron>Yeah,stupid,stupid kids.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,850
<6-11,Foreman>我曾有个叔叔能把樱桃核吐50码远
<6-11,Foreman>I've got an uncle. He can spit a cherry pit50 yards.

<6-11,Foreman>他在商店兼职卖润滑油,生活不公
<6-11,Foreman>He's working part-time ata lube shop. Life isn't fair.

168
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,150
<6-12,Cameron>或许是
<6-12,Cameron>Maybe it is.

169
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,450
<7-1,Chase>你是对的
<7-1,Chase>you were right.

170
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,450
<7-2,House>这三个字是浪费
<7-2,House>Now there wentthree wasted words.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,850
<7-3,Chase>他的肺部是有气泡
<7-3,Chase>There is a bubblein his lung.

172
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,200
<7-3,Chase>我们该做个导入检查
<7-3,Chase>We should do a swan-ganzcatheterization.

173

<7-4,House>我喜欢你把两人的话一个人都说了
<7-4,House>I love when you do both sidesof the conversation.

174
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,700
<7-4,House>象白噪音一样，很平和
<7-4,House>It's like white noise.It's very peaceful.

175
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
<7-5,Wilson>是不是我一吃饭就有灯亮啊?
<7-5,Wilson>Is there a lightsomewhere that goes on when I have food?

176
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,850
<7-6,House>绿色是食物，黄色是饮料,红色是不洁的念头
<7-6,House>Green for food,orange for beverages,red for impure thoughts.

177
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
<7-6,House>大胡子两星期出来一次
<7-6,House>That bulb burns outevery two weeks.

178
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,600
<7-7,Wilson>你的骑手怎么样了?

<7-11,House>I'm just tryingto function. He's trying to win himselfsome little yellow jerseys.

<7-12,Wilson>哦，什么?
<7-12,Wilson>Uh-oh.What?

<7-14,Wilson>Your two o'clockor my two o'clock?

186
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,250
<7-15,House>那里
<7-15,House>There.

187
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,900
<7-16,Wilson>她看上去挺高兴的
<7-16,Wilson>She seems perfectly happy.

188
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,000
<7-16,Wilson>很明显，他们在你没机会后,把个马戏表演搞的挺有声色
<7-16,Wilson>Obviously,they huddledin the hall and worked upthis circus act on the off-chanceyou'd be in here.

189
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,650
<7-17,House>她三小时前很生气来着
<7-17,House>She was unbelievably pissythree hours ago.

190

<7-18,Wilson>跟你生气，跟她丈夫挺高兴
<7-18,Wilson>Hmm. Pissy with you.Happy with her husband.

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,050
<7-18,Wilson>对，而且只有一个合理的解释
<7-18,Wilson>Yes,there could only be onepossible explanation for that.

192
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,500
<7-19,House>她生气的时候就讽刺人
<7-19,House>When she's angry,she gets sarcastic.

193
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,150
<7-19,House>而苦恼的时候就很有趣
<7-19,House>When's she annoyed,she's funny.

194
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,950
<7-19,House>但当她失败的时候就很生气
<7-19,House>But when she's frustrated,she gets pissy.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,650
<7-20,Wilson>是，我还能跟上你
<7-20,Wilson>Yes,yes,I'm with you so far.

196
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,050
<7-21,House>她跟马克在一起时糟透了，因为他不是我
<7-21,House>She's miserable with mark because he's not me.

197
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,600
<7-21,House>所以她要把我改变的不象我
<7-21,House>So she's gotta makeme not me,

198
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,350
<7-21,House>所以她把我的专业生涯弄的不成样
<7-21,House>so she makes my professionallife miserable.

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
<7-21,House>如果我不能尽职……
<7-21,House>If I can't do my job--

200
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,600
<7-22,Wilson>你真的，真得找点什么了
<7-22,Wilson>you really,reallyneed to get some.

201
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,100
<7-23,House>哦，我老能找到什么的
<7-23,House>Oh,I get some "some"all the time.

202
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,700
<7-23,House>那就是我老需要借钱的原因
<7-23,House>That's why I always needto borrow some money.

203
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
<7-24,Stacy>嗨，詹姆

206
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,400
<7-26,Stacy>什么?
<7-26,Stacy>Pardon me?

207
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,200
<7-27,House>我太忙了
<7-27,House>I've been busy.

208
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,350
<7-27,House>你救人命后，他们永远欠你的
<7-27,House>When you savesomeone's life,they owe you forever.

209
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
<7-28,Mark>说的对
<7-28,Mark>You're right.

210
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,750
<7-28,Mark>带上斯黛希吧
<7-28,Mark>Take stacy.

211
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
<7-28,Mark>哦，等等
<7-28,Mark>Oh,wait.

212
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,850
<7-28,Mark>她恐怕还是会离开你的
<7-28,Mark>She'd probably justleave you all over again.

213
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,300
<7-29,House>你恢复的怎样?
<7-29,House>How's your recovery going?

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,200
<7-29,House>小肌肉长出来了吗?
<7-29,House>Gotten aroundto the small muscles yet?

215
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,000
<7-30,Mark>你知道跟肌肉的尺寸无关
<7-30,Mark>You know,it's notthe size of the muscle.

216
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,850
<7-30,Mark>跟放的地方有关
<7-30,Mark>It's whereyou get to put it.

217
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,300
<7-31,Stacy>天啊，象在三年级,看王尔德的《圣诞胆小鬼》一样
<7-31,Stacy>My goodness. It's likewatching oscar wilde and noel cowardin the third grade.

218
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,550
<7-31,Stacy>请原谅
<7-31,Stacy>Excuse us.

219
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,050
<7-32,House>多怪啊?
<7-32,House>How awkward was that?

220
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
<7-32,House>他跑这来到底干什么啊?
<7-32,House>What's he doing here anyway?

221
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,600
<7-32,House>他周二和周五做理疗
<7-32,House>He's got physio tuesdaysand fridays.

222
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,350
<7-33,Wilson>马克参加给残疾人做的小组心理治疗
<7-33,Wilson>Uh,mark is ingroup therapy for people copingwith disability.

223
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,300
<7-33,Wilson>他本想药物成瘾
<7-33,Wilson>He was thinking aboutdeveloping a drug addiction,

224
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,250
<7-33,Wilson>可那多愚蠢
<7-33,Wilson>but that would be stupid.

225
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,900
<7-34,House>嘿，你……你又来了
<7-34,House>Hey,you're--you again.

226
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,200
<7-35,Wilson>不开马克做心理治疗的玩笑吗?
<7-35,Wilson>Not gonna make some joke about mark being in therapy?

227
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,550
<7-36,House>有什么可说的?
<7-36,House>What's there to say?

228
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,900
<7-36,House>他在做负责任的事情
<7-36,House>He's doingthe responsible thing.

229
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,600
<7-36,House>我确信他要应对的还多着呢
<7-36,House>I'm sure he's gota lot to deal with.

230
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
<7-37,Wilson>你让我紧张
<7-37,Wilson>You're making me nervous.

231
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,300
<8-1,Manager>每当有个运动员倒下,你们就以为是毒品的事
<8-1,Manager>every time an athlete goes down,you guys assume it's drugs.

232
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,300
<8-1,Manager>看，医生说可能是药反流
<8-1,Manager>Look,the doctors sayits probably acid reflux.

233
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,700
<8-1,Manager>对，明天打给我,他能出院的可能性很大
<8-1,Manager>Yeah,look,call me tomorrow. There's a good chance he'll be released.

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,400
<8-1,Manager>好，再见
<8-1,Manager>Okay. Bye-bye.

235
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,450
<8-1,Manager>这样说合适吗?
<8-1,Manager>So is this fixing him?

236
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,300
<8-2,Chase>如果他的药反流不比我们想的差的话
<8-2,Chase>If his acid reflux isn'tworse than we thought,yeah.

237
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,200
<8-3,Jeff>我四天内得赶到西班牙
<8-3,Jeff>I've gotta be in spainin four days.

238
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,850
<8-4,Chase>不该成问题
<8-4,Chase>Shouldn't be a problem.

239
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,000
<8-5,Manager>太好了
<8-5,Manager>Great.

240
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,300
<8-6,Chase>只要我找到那个小坏蛋就可以把它吸出来
<8-6,Chase>If I can just findthe little bugger,I should be ableto suck it out.

241
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,950
<8-7,Jeff>我的腿觉得很虚弱
<8-7,Jeff>Hmm. My legs feel weak.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,800
<8-8,Chase>你在中级镇静条件下做试验
<8-8,Chase>You're under mild sedationfor the test.

243
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,750
<8-8,Chase>会逐渐减弱
<8-8,Chase>It'll wear off.

244
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,750
<8-8,Chase>那里
<8-8,Chase>There it is.

245
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
<8-9,Chase>嗯，逮到了
<8-9,Chase>Ah. Got it.

246
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,600
<8-10,Manager>哦，太好了，我来收拾他的东西
<8-10,Manager>Oh,fantastic.I'll pack his things.

247
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,200
<8-11,Chase>还不行，我要监测他几个小时,确保他没事
<8-11,Chase>Not yet. I want to monitor himfor a couple of hours. Make sure he's okay.

248
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,500
<8-11,Chase>给他时间给我签字，没准是件运动衫呢
<8-11,Chase>Give him time to signa picture for me. Maybe even a jersey.

249
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,800
<8-12,Jeff>"给蔡大夫，我欠你太多了"
<8-12,Jeff>"To dr. Chase,I owe you everything."

250
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,450
<8-13,Chase>不必那么私人化吧
<8-13,Chase>It doesn't have tobe that personal.

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,300
<8-14,Jeff>易趣上没那么多叫“蔡大夫”的是吧?
<8-14,Jeff>Oh. Not too many ebay shoppersnamed dr. Chase,huh?

252
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,850
<8-15,Chase>还想得那个吐口水大奖呢
<8-15,Chase>Still trying to unloadthe barbara walters spit cup.

253
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,950
<8-16,Manager>给你这个
<8-16,Manager>here you go.

254
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,300
<8-17,Chase>认真的，什么都行
<8-17,Chase>Seriously,anything's fine.

255
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,600
<8-18,Manager>杰?
<8-18,Manager>Jeff?

256
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,700
<8-19,Chase>你没事吧?
<8-19,Chase>You all right?

257
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,350
<8-19,Chase>杰，你能吞咽吗?
<8-19,Chase>Jeff,can you swallow?

258
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,550
<9-1,House>什么让一个家伙开始流口水
<9-1,House>What makes a guy,start drooling?

259
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,700
<9-1,House>Chace，你穿内裤了吗?
<9-1,House>Chase,were you wearingyour short shorts?

260
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,900
<9-2,Chase>他的脖子和腭部肌肉无力
<9-2,Chase>Muscle fatiguein his neck and jaw.

261
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,050
<9-2,Chase>－他肯定有比空气栓塞更严重的问题,－为什么？
<9-2,Chase>He's obviously got somethingworse than an air embolus. Why?

262
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,300
<9-4,Chase>因为肺不会流口水啊
<9-4,Chase>Because you don't droolfrom your lungs.

263
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,550
<9-5,House>也许问题不是栓塞本身
<9-5,House>Maybe the problem'snot the embolus itself.

264
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
<9-5,House>也许是治疗的问题
<9-5,House>Maybe it's the treatment.

265
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,750
<9-5,House>也许你伤到了神经，看上去
<9-5,House>Maybe you hit a nerve.Literally.

266
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,300
<9-6,Chase>栓子切除术很干净
<9-6,Chase>The embolectomy was clean.

267
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,900
<9-6,Chase>他的腿很疲倦
<9-6,Chase>His legs were tired too.

268
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,400
<9-6,Chase>我以为是镇静作用，如果不是
<9-6,Chase>I thought it was fromthe sedation,but if not,

269
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,700
<9-6,Chase>那就是全身性的
<9-6,Chase>it means he's gotsomething systemic.

270
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,400
<9-7,Cameron>意思就是说跟他的营养药无关了
<9-7,Cameron>Which means it wouldhave nothing to do with the stuntshe's been pulling.

271
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,100
<9-8,Chase>狼疮或者是多肌炎
<9-8,Chase>Lupus or polymyositis.

272
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,850
<9-8,Chase>那可以解释肌肉无力
<9-8,Chase>It explains the progressivemuscle weakness.

273
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,700
<9-9,Cameron>着地无力？
<9-9,Cameron>It could be als.

274
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,950
<9-10,Foreman>太年轻了不会
<9-10,Foreman>He's too young for that.

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,550
<9-11,Cameron>某种肌肉营养不足?
<9-11,Cameron>Some type of muscular dystrophy?

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,950
<9-12,Foreman>岁数够大了不会
<9-12,Foreman>He's too old for that.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,750
<9-13,House>那到底是什么呢，喇叭花?
<9-13,House>So what would bejust right,goldilocks?

278
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,700
<9-13,House>全面的血液检查，包括狼疮的ANA监测
<9-13,House>full blood workup,including ana for lupus.

279
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,550
<9-13,House>同时做肌肉活检
<9-13,House>And get a muscle biopsy.

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,700
<9-13,House>看看到底是肌肉的问题,还是神经系统的问题
<9-13,House>Find out if we're talkingmyopathy or neuropathy.

281
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,800
<9-13,House>我开会晚了
<9-13,House>I'm late for my session.

282
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
<9-14,Cameron>开会?
<9-14,Cameron>Session?

283
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,800
<10-1,Dr Harper>是程序的一部分
<10-1,Dr Harper>It's all a partof the process.

284
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,850
<10-1,Dr Harper>你会生气，然后……
<10-1,Dr Harper>You get angryand then you get--

285
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,300
<10-2,Mark>对，我正合这个程序
<10-2,Mark>yeah,I'm right on schedule.

286
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,550
<10-2,Mark>那么什么时候才能结束呢?
<10-2,Mark>So when am I gonna be done?

287
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
<10-2,Mark>不，我需要知道因为我有计划
<10-2,Mark>No,I need to know because I've gotplans to make.

288
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,550
<10-2,Mark>我的意思是，我什么时候能预定壁球比赛?
<10-2,Mark>I mean,when can I safelybook a game of squash?

289
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,800
<10-2,Mark>我什么时候能不生气?
<10-2,Mark>When am I gonna stop being angry?

290
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,500
<10-3,House>不是今天
<10-3,House>Not today.

291
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,700
<10-3,House>我做康复治疗
<10-3,House>I've comefor the healing.

292
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,550
<10-3,House>哈医生，你知道
<10-3,House>Dr. Harper,as you know,

293
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,250
<10-3,House>我，嗯，有条坏腿
<10-3,House>I,uh--ahem.I have a bum leg.

294
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,600
<10-3,House>但是你不知道我对它很生气
<10-3,House>What you don't know is I'm upset about it.

295
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,200
<10-3,House>我需要倾诉
<10-3,House>I need to talk.

296
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,750
<10-4,Mark>你了解豪斯，你知道我们有过节
<10-4,Mark>-You know house. -You know we have a history.

297
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,500
<10-5,House>你跟我说过多年我该参加
<10-5,House>You've been telling me for yearsthat I should come by.

298
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,050
<10-5,House>我来了
<10-5,House>Here I am.

299
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,150
<10-5,House>大家好
<10-5,House>Hi,guys.

300
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,450
<10-6,Dr Harper>周四有小组
<10-6,Dr Harper>got a thursday group.

301
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
<10-7,House>打扑克
<10-7,House>Poker night.

302
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,550
<10-8,Dr Harper>周一上午?
<10-8,Dr Harper>Monday morning?

303
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,950
<10-9,House>读书会
<10-9,House>Book club.

304
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,100
<10-9,House>嗯，你看，如果有问题……
<10-9,House>Well,look,if it's a problem,

305
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,100
<10-9,House>我干脆离开，自己对付我的愤怒去好了
<10-9,House>I'll just go dealwith my rage privately.

306
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,300
<10-9,House>等等
<10-9,House>Wait.

307
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,400
<10-10,Dr Harper>如果你俩能解决这种紧张气氛,你们真的可以互相帮助
<10-10,Dr Harper>If you two could resolvethis tension,you could reallyhelp each other.

308
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,150
<10-11,House>我懒得争吵
<10-11,House>I'm tired of fighting.

309
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,750
<10-12,Mark>看来除非我同意要么我就是混蛋喽?
<10-12,Mark>So either I say yesor I'm the jerk?

310
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,350
<10-13,House>哦，上帝，我知道那种感觉
<10-13,House>Oh,god,I knowthat feeling.

311
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
<11-1,Cameron>我从杰的大腿取了样本
<11-1,Cameron>I took the muscle specimenfrom jeff's thigh.

312
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,250
<11-1,Cameron>我猜那是我们能发现问题的最佳机会了
<11-1,Cameron>I figured that's wherewe'd have the best chance at finding something.

313
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,950
<11-2,Chase>也是最疼的切入点
<11-2,Chase>And the most painfulplace to cut into.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,200
<11-3,Chase>我猜是无咖啡因的
<11-3,Chase>I assume that's caffeine-free.

315
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,600
<11-3,Chase>不能人工增加你的性能
<11-3,Chase>Wouldn't want to be artificiallyboosting your performance.

316
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,150
<11-4,Foreman>别再惹她了
<11-4,Foreman>Don't start her up again.

317
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
<11-5,Cameron>咖啡因是合法的
<11-5,Cameron>Caffeine's legal.

318
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,950
<11-6,Chase>都是规矩的事，对吧?
<11-6,Chase>All about the rules,eh?

319
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
<11-7,Cameron>只是个自行车比赛
<11-7,Cameron>It's a bike race.

320
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,500
<11-7,Cameron>都是由委员们定的
<11-7,Cameron>A completely arbitraryset of rules that everyone complies withfor no other reason

321
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,550
<11-7,Cameron>武断的规矩决定他们得遵守
<11-7,Cameron>than that some committeesays that they should.

322
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,600
<11-9,Cameron>但是那就是关键，那就是比赛
<11-9,Cameron>But that's the point. That's what the game is.

323
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,900
<11-10,Foreman>所以，如果你违背了武断的规定,卡梅伦就要你下地狱
<11-10,Foreman>So if you breakan arbitrary rule,cameron damns you to hell,

324
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,350
<11-10,Foreman>但如果你破坏的规矩是设计来保护人们的
<11-10,Foreman>but if you break a rulethat actually has a reason,that's designedto protect people,

325
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
<11-10,Foreman>卡梅伦就会疯狂地爱上你
<11-10,Foreman>cameron developsa crazy crush on you.

326
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,750
<11-11,Cameron>豪斯并没刻意打扮自己
<11-11,Cameron>House doesn't pretendto be some golden boy.

327
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,900
<11-11,Cameron>他是想帮助别人，不是美化自己
<11-11,Cameron>He does it to help people,not to glorify himself.

328
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,750
<11-12,Foreman>那你干嘛不向自行车专家举报杰?
<11-12,Foreman>So why don't you report jeff to the biking authorities?

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,050
<11-13,Cameron>嗯，道德规范
<11-13,Cameron>Um,ethics.

330
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,350
<11-14,Foreman>嗯，你不是要美化自己
<11-14,Foreman>Well,you wouldn'tbe doing it to glorify yourself.

331
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,050
<11-14,Foreman>你是想建立美好社会
<11-14,Foreman>You'd just be tryingto make a better world.

332
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,250
<12-1,Mark>至少你还能自理
<12-1,Mark>At least you can stillget around on your own.

333
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
<12-2,House>对，我知道
<12-2,House>Yeah,I know.

334
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,950
<12-2,House>但你正开始重新站立
<12-2,House>But you'restarting to walk.

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,750
<12-2,House>你会好起来
<12-2,House>You're gonna get better.

336
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,400
<12-3,Mark>你有职业，可以有所作为
<12-3,Mark>You have a job,a way to be productive.

337
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,150
<12-4,House>你有妻子
<12-4,House>You have a wife.

338
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,800
<12-4,House>那更有意义?
<12-4,House>Which givesgreater meaning?

339
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,700
<12-4,House>妻子可以使事情更复杂，我想
<12-4,House>A wife could make thingsharder,too,I suppose.

340
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,050
<12-5,Mark>这跟斯黛希无关
<12-5,Mark>This isn't about stacy.

341
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,300
<12-6,House>当我出事时，斯黛希表现很好
<12-6,House>When it happened to me,stacy was great.

342
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,800
<12-6,House>她一直让我不要太急躁
<12-6,House>She kept telling menot to rush it.

343
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,850
<12-6,House>但我从不相信她
<12-6,House>But I never believed her.

344
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,950
<12-7,Mark>她很真诚
<12-7,Mark>She means it.

345
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,200
<12-4,House>我知道，但...
<12-4,House>I know,but...

346
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,500
<12-5,Mark>斯黛希...
<12-5,Mark>stacy...

347
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,150
<12-8,House>她不必等，对吧?
<12-8,House>she didn'thave to wait,right?

348
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
<12-8,House>而且你也知道她有同感
<12-8,House>And you knowshe feels it too.

349
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,300
<12-8,House>就是在工作上花更多时间,从工作中得到更多满足
<12-8,House>Means more time at work,means more satisfaction from work.

350
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,300
<12-8,House>她并不是要结婚作保姆的
<12-8,House>She didn't get marriedto be a nursemaid.

351
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,150
<12-8,House>她需要一个男人
<12-8,House>She wants a man.

352
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,600
<12-9,Mark>他怎么会爱一个象你这样,操纵别人的混蛋？
<12-9,Mark>How the hellcould she have loved a manipulativeson of a bitch like you?

353
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,250
<12-10,House>那是个有趣的问题
<12-10,House>That's an interesting question.

354
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
<12-10,House>也许她被我俩之间不同的东西所吸引
<12-10,House>Maybe she was attractedto different things in the two of us.

355
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,150
<12-11,Mark>她背离了你
<12-11,Mark>She left you.

356
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
<12-12,House>那又为什么跟我重新开始关系?
<12-12,House>Then why was she with meto begin with?

357
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,500
<12-13,Mark>她犯了个错
<12-13,Mark>She made a mistake.

358
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,700
<12-14,House>或许就那么简单
<12-14,House>Maybe it's that simple.

359
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,550
<12-14,House>又或许是她看到我身上有你没有的东西
<12-14,House>Or maybe she sawsomething in me,something she doesn'tget from you.

360
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,650
<12-15,Mark>我不是混蛋
<12-15,Mark>I'm not an ass.

361
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,950
<12-16,House>或许她需要个混蛋，显然她曾有过一个
<12-16,House>Maybe she wanted an ass.She obviously did once.

362
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,350
<12-17,Mark>要么他走要么我走
<12-17,Mark>Either he goes or I go.

363
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,750
<12-18,House>你以为那是你关掉就可以解决的吗?
<12-18,House>You think that's the kind ofthing you can just turn off?

364
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
<12-19,Mark>把他轰走
<12-19,Mark>Get him out of here!

365
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,400
<12-20,Dr Harper>豪斯医生，取消你的读书会
<12-20,Dr Harper>Dr. House,cancel your book group.

366
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,900
<12-20,Dr Harper>你周一来
<12-20,Dr Harper>You're coming on mondays.

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,300
<13-1,House>我有新理论
<13-1,House>Here's my new theory.

368
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,050
<13-1,House>流口水是另一个竞争优势
<13-1,House>The drooling's another competitive edge.

369
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,200
<13-1,House>没人能在他后面跑，因为路面太滑
<13-1,House>Nobody can draft behind him.Road gets slick.

370
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,850
<13-1,House>他是唯一一个不在雨天比赛的人
<13-1,House>He's the only onenot racing in the rain.

371
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,450
<13-2,Foreman>他几乎不能挪动手脚
<13-2,Foreman>He can barely movehis arms or legs.

372
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,450
<13-3,House>瘫痪?
<13-3,House>Paralysis?

373
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
<13-4,Foreman>不，是全面的虚弱
<13-4,Foreman>No,justgeneral weakness.

374
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,200
<13-5,Cameron>肌肉活检显示多肌炎测试阴性
<13-5,Cameron>Muscle biopsy is negativefor polymyositis.

375
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,750
<13-6,Chase>ALS和肌肉营养失调都不对
<13-6,Chase>And als.And muscle dystrophy.

376
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,800
<13-7,Foreman>狼疮的ＡＮＡ监测也是阴性
<13-7,Foreman>ana for lupus also negative.

377
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,650
<13-8,Cameron>也许是他的骑手短裤太紧了
<13-8,Cameron>maybe his bike shorts were just on too tight.

378
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,400
<13-9,Chase>那么按照你的原理，豪斯不该用拐棍
<13-9,Chase>So by your rationale,house shouldn't use a cane.

379
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,200
<13-9,Chase>他该象上帝所意愿的那样拖着他的坏腿？
<13-9,Chase>He should just drag his bumleg around as god intended?

380
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,450
<13-10,Cameron>豪斯有障碍
<13-10,Cameron>house has a handicap.

381
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,300
<13-10,Cameron>他的发泄方式是正常的
<13-10,Cameron>All he's aiming foris normality.

382
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,900
<13-11,Chase>那由谁来决定是否正常?
<13-11,Chase>and who decides what's normal?

383
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,450
<13-11,Chase>我们发明一种可以,令人类活多２０年的药又如何?
<13-11,Chase>What if we find a drug that makes people live 20 years longer?

384
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,750
<13-11,Chase>我们该因为那不正常就禁止吗?
<13-11,Chase>Should we ban thatbecause it's not normal?

385
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,700
<13-12,Cameron>杰并不是要正常，他要超能力
<13-12,Cameron>Jeff doesn't want normal. He wants super powers.

386
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,000
<13-13,House>那他又为什么正常呢?
<13-13,House>So why is he normal?

387
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,050
<13-14,Foreman>哦，上帝啊，你也来吗？
<13-14,Foreman>Oh,god. You too?

388
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,550
<13-15,House>他因出色而遭枪毙啊
<13-15,House>He's shooting for extraordinary.

389
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,400
<13-13,House>干嘛所有事都非得平凡呢？
<13-13,House>So why is everythingso ordinary?

390
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,850
<13-15,House>我是说，这家伙呼吸、喝酒
<13-15,House>I mean,this guy'sbreathing,drinking,

391
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,350
<13-15,House>注射他能找到的一切
<13-15,House>and injecting himselfwith everything he can find

392
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,050
<13-15,House>来增强他身体的化学指标,但一切检查都那么正常
<13-15,House>to amp up his body chemistry,and yet every test is normal.

393
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
<13-15,House>他人为提高血红细胞含量,但又为什么没增加呢?
<13-15,House>He's artificially raisinghis red blood count,so why isn't it raised?

394
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,450
<13-16,Chase>也许已经提高了
<13-16,Chase>Maybe his count is raised.

395
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,400
<13-16,Chase>也许已经正常到药检局可以搞他的地步了
<13-16,Chase>Maybe what's normal for usis out of whack for him.

396
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
<13-17,House>什么也瞒不了你
<13-17,House>Can't slip a anythingby you.

397
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,350
<13-18,Foreman>如果是事实，那么他的白血球也增加了
<13-18,Foreman>well,if that's true,his white cells are up too,

398
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
<13-18,Foreman>那就意味着有感染
<13-18,Foreman>which would point tosome kind of infection.

399
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,300
<13-19,Chase>肌肉虚弱、极度虚弱
<13-19,Chase>Muscle weakness,exhaustion.

400
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,650
<13-19,Chase>可能是脑炎
<13-19,Chase>He could have encephalitis.

401
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,200
<13-20,Cameron>那是长程的
<13-20,Cameron>That's kind of a long shot.

402
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,700
<13-21,House>一个多小时了,该用尖利的东西戳病人了
<13-21,House>But it's been over an hour since we poked the patientwith something sharp,

403
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,800
<13-21,House>那么做腰椎穿刺吧
<13-21,House>so get a lumbar puncture.

404
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,800
<13-21,House>再申请广谱抗生素
<13-21,House>And order broad-spectrumantibiotics.

405
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,850
<14-1,Cuddy>不，跟评价无关
<14-1,Cuddy>no,it's not about judging.

406
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,400
<14-1,Cuddy>但安排约会你该提供照片啊
<14-1,Cuddy>It's just thaton a dating service you should post a photo.

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,050
<14-2,Cuddy>我得走了
<14-2,Cuddy>I have to go.

408
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
<14-3,Manager>我很抱歉打扰你
<14-3,Manager>I'm so sorryto bother you.

409
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,500
<14-4,Cuddy>没关系，我……是会计
<14-4,Cuddy>No,not a problem.I was just,uh...accounting.

410
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,300
<14-5,Manager>我是弗杰的经纪人
<14-5,Manager>I'm jeff forster's manager.

411
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,000
<14-5,Manager>他已经在这一天了，但还是没有任何诊断
<14-5,Manager>He's been here a whole dayand it doesn't seem like we're any closerto a diagnosis.

412
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,450
<14-6,Cuddy>弗杰，一整天了吗?
<14-6,Cuddy>Jeff forster.A whole day,huh?

413
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,650
<14-7,Manager>嗯，我是想看看是否,我可以使事情加速进行
<14-7,Manager>Mm-hmm.I was just wondering if I could helpspeed things up.

414
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,550
<14-8,Cuddy>你的客户做了肌肉活检
<14-8,Cuddy>Your client's hada muscle biopsy,

415
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
<14-8,Cuddy>全套血液检查
<14-8,Cuddy>a full blood workup,

416
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,550
<14-8,Cuddy>而且他还约了明天上午的腰椎穿刺
<14-8,Cuddy>and he's scheduledfor a lumbar puncture at 10:00 A.M. Tomorrow.

417
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
<14-9,Manager>杰是卢卡的队员
<14-9,Manager>Jeff is in the lucas wing.

418
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,600
<14-9,Manager>如果卢卡先生需要做个腰椎穿刺,他需要等到明天上午吗？
<14-9,Manager>If mr. Lucas showed upneeding a lumbar puncture,would he have to waituntil tomorrow?

419
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,050
<14-10,Cuddy>卢卡先生已经死了
<14-10,Cuddy>Mr. Lucas is dead.

420
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,800
<14-11,Manager>好，这是个开始
<14-11,Manager>Good. Then there'san opening.

421
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,600
<14-12,Cuddy>杰过去尽全力争当第一，对吧？
<14-12,Cuddy>Jeff is used to doing whatever he has toto be first,isn't he?

422
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,350
<14-13,Manager>那对他很有利
<14-13,Manager>It's been verylucrative for him.

423
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
<14-13,Manager>他觉得他应该尽量回馈
<14-13,Manager>He feels it's importantthat he give something back.

424
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,950
<14-13,Manager>我听说你象扩充你的核药物研究部门
<14-13,Manager>I hear you've beenraising funds for your nuclearmedicine department.

425
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700
<14-13,Manager>或者管他呢
<14-13,Manager>Or whatever.

426
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,400
<15-1,Jeff>谢谢大家，干的这么晚
<15-1,Jeff>Thank you,guys,for working so late.

427
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,600
<15-2,Foreman>很高兴到这
<15-2,Foreman>Glad to be here.

428
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,750
<15-2,Foreman>腰椎穿刺会告诉我们发生了什么事
<15-2,Foreman>The lumbar puncture will tell us what kind of infection you've got.

429
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,300
<15-2,Foreman>同时我们给抗生素
<15-2,Foreman>In the meantime,we're administering antibiotics.

430
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,050
<15-3,Cameron>你喜欢当英雄是吧?
<15-3,Cameron>Do you like being a hero?

431
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
<15-4,Jeff>那是生计
<15-4,Jeff>It's a living.

432
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,900
<15-5,Cameron>你不感到有责任吗?
<15-5,Cameron>You don't feel a senseof responsibility?

433
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,350
<15-5,Cameron>外面有不少孩子崇拜你
<15-5,Cameron>There's kids out therethat worship you.

434
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,900
<15-6,Jeff>在我巡回比赛时
<15-6,Jeff>When I was a rookieon the tour,

435
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,650
<15-6,Jeff>我收到威斯康辛的一个人的信
<15-6,Jeff>I got a letter from a guy in wisconsin

436
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,200
<15-6,Jeff>他要我给他儿子发信
<15-6,Jeff>who wanted me to senda note to his son.

437
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,550
<15-6,Jeff>说他崇拜我
<15-6,Jeff>Said he worshipped me.

438
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,950
<15-6,Jeff>你知道崇拜的意思吗?
<15-6,Jeff>You know what"worship" means?

439
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,900
<15-6,Jeff>我查过
<15-6,Jeff>I looked it up.

440
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,600
<15-6,Jeff>意思是：不容置疑的、不予评价的爱
<15-6,Jeff>It means to love...unquestioningly and uncritically.

441
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,250
<15-6,Jeff>而那个孩子根本不认识我,
<15-6,Jeff>So the kid doesn't even know me,

442
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,800
<15-6,Jeff>但他不容置疑的、不予评价的爱我
<15-6,Jeff>but he loves meunquestioningly and uncritically.

443
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,500
<15-7,Cameron>所以你决定占个便宜？
<15-7,Cameron>So you decided to takeadvantage of that.

444
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,100
<15-8,Jeff>那我该怎么做?
<15-8,Jeff>What should I have done?

445
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,950
<15-8,Jeff>"亲爱的先生,
<15-8,Jeff>"Dear sir,

446
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,800
<15-8,Jeff>"我只是个自行车骑的不错的家伙
<15-8,Jeff>"I'm just a guy who ridesa bike pretty good.

447
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,800
<15-8,Jeff>你和你儿子疯了吗"?
<15-8,Jeff>You and your kidare out of your minds"?

448
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,950
<15-8,Jeff>我的胳膊感觉奇怪
<15-8,Jeff>My arms feel funny.

449
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,800
<15-9,Foreman>他的呼吸器掉了，呼吸停止
<15-9,Foreman>His sats are dropping.He's in respiratory arrest.

450
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,950
<15-10,Cameron>他不会的，我们固定好了
<15-10,Cameron>He can't be.We fixed that.

451
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,150
<15-11,Foreman>显然没有
<15-11,Foreman>Apparently not.

452
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,700
<16-1,House>幸好我们治好了他的呼吸停止
<16-1,House>so glad we cured his respiratory arrest.

453
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,000
<16-1,House>不加呼吸器就会呼吸停止
<16-1,House>Freed him up to developrespiratory arrest.

454
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,250
<16-2,Foreman>脑炎测试阴性
<16-2,Foreman>Lp was negativefor encephalitis.

455
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,550
<16-3,Cameron>白血球数量正常
<16-3,Cameron>the white count'sstill the same,

456
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,850
<16-3,Cameron>红血球数量减至29%
<16-3,Cameron>but the red count'sfallen to 29%.

457
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
<16-4,House>我昨天的理论是什么?
<16-4,House>What was my the ory yesterday?

458
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,600
<16-5,Chase>我搞砸了栓子清楚术
<16-5,Chase>That I screwed upthe embolectomy.

459
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,000
<16-6,Foreman>我们做个胸部X光片检查
<16-6,Foreman>We'll get a chestx-ray to check.

460
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,500
<16-7,Chase>我没搞砸，你干嘛……
<16-7,Chase>I didn't screw up.Why would you--

461
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,000
<16-8,House>你怎么能这么可怜呢，小蔡，,他都下降了一品脱
<16-8,House>how can you beso petty,chase? He's down a quart.

462
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,700
<16-8,House>他失血要不就是因为你伤到他,
<16-8,House>Either he's losing bloodbecause you nicked something,

463
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,400
<16-8,House>要不就是他停止造血，如果那样的话,我们说的就是贫血造成的肌肉失效

<16-9,Foreman>肾上腺综合症?
<16-9,Foreman>Paraneoplastic syndrome?

465
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,550
<16-10,House>要么就是你搞砸了,要么就是他得了癌症
<16-10,House>Either you screwed upor he's got cancer.

466
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
<17-1,Patient>我觉得我该开始抽烟了
<17-1,Patient>I think I should startsmoking again.

467
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,100
<17-2,House>你的那个结论需要一个医学支持吗?
<17-2,House>You want a medical opinionsupporting that decision?

468
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,100
<17-3,Patient>我一戒除症状就开始
<17-3,Patient>The symptoms startedas soon as I quit.

469
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,700
<17-4,House>症状的意思是...
<17-4,House>Symptoms meaning...

<17-5,Patient>一天10到12次，太尴尬了
<17-5,Patient>Ten or twelve times a day.It's really embarrassing.

472
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,450
<17-5,Patient>我是飞行服务生……
<17-5,Patient>I'm a flight attendantand--

473
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,800
<17-6,House>往上点，我的打嗝停止了
<17-6,House>on the upside,my hiccups are gone.

474
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,600
<17-7,Stacy>你去过他的小组治疗了
<17-7,Stacy>You went to his group.

475
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,900
<17-8,House>都是你曾说的,“格里，你该面对你的感觉”
<17-8,House>You were the one who was all,"greg,you needto confront your feelings."

476
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,100
<17-9,Stacy>那是五年前的事
<17-9,Stacy>That was five years ago.

477
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,300
<17-10,House>嗯，我很生气
<17-10,House>Well,I've been pissy.

478
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,900
<17-11,Stacy>好，你不想接受帮助,那就是说别人也甭想喽？
<17-11,Stacy>Fine. You don't want help. Does that meannobody should get it?

479
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,800
<17-12,House>马克寻求帮助是为什么呢? 他很愤怒吗?
<17-12,House>Mark's looking for help because what? He's resentful?

480
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,200
<17-12,House>挫败感？我是因为关心才问的
<17-12,House>Overwhelmed?I'm asking because I care.

481
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,200
<17-13,Stacy>不是针对他，你还对我有邪念,所以你不管是谁的婚姻……
<17-13,Stacy>Not about him.You still want to jump me,so you don't carewhose marriage--

482
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,950
<17-14,House>听着，我可以随时卸掉包袱的
<17-14,House>listen,I can getmy rocks off any time I want.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,450
<17-14,House>我不能应付的是,你在我的工作中到处找我麻烦
<17-14,House>What I don't seem to beable to do is my job without you hangingover my shoulder.

484
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,050
<17-15,House>一天几盒?
<17-15,House>How many packs?

485
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,350
<17-16,Patient>一天一盒多点，是清型的，而且我戒了
<17-16,Patient>A bit over one a day,but they were lightsand I quit.

486
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,550
<17-16,Patient>你曾跟她交往吗?
<17-16,Patient>You used to go outwith her?

487
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,600
<17-17,House>是啊，我在想什么呢?
<17-17,House>Yeah. What was I thinking?

488
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,650
<17-17,House>我是在说你正嚼着的替代香口胶
<17-17,House>I'm talking aboutthe gum you're chewing to replace smokingas an oral fixation.

489
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,100
<17-17,House>多少块?
<17-17,House>How many packs?

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,100
<17-18,Patient>六块，或者七块

00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,550
<17-19,Stacy>我想保护你
<17-19,Stacy>I'm trying to protect you.

492
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
<17-19,Stacy>卡迪和我或许是想制止你跳崖的……
<17-19,Stacy>Cuddy and I may be the only people stopping youfrom jumping off a cliff...

<17-21,Stacy>-你呕气,-不是，我生气,-呕气
<17-21,Stacy>-you're pissy. -No,I am angry. -Pissy.

494

<17-22,House>你失败的时候就呕气
<17-22,House>You get pissywhen you're frustrated.

495
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,400
<17-23,Stacy>-闭嘴,-好吧，我错了
<17-23,Stacy>-Shut up. -Okay,I'm wrong.

496
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,700
<17-25,Stacy>这对马克来说难度非比寻常,你该知道的
<17-25,Stacy>This is unbelievablydifficult for mark,which you should know.

497
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,100
<17-25,Stacy>而你该比旁人更能理解
<17-25,Stacy>Which you should be ableto summon up some level of empathy for.

498
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,300
<17-26,House>没错，一对瘸子,我们该成立个乐队组合
<17-26,House>Right. The crippled boys.We should start a band.

499
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,250
<17-27,Stacy>我跟马克相处融洽
<17-27,Stacy>I have a good thingwith mark.

500
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,550
<17-27,Stacy>我们尽全力对待这个事件
<17-27,Stacy>We are handling thisthe best way we know how.

501
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,550
<17-28,House>而这些与我无关?
<17-28,House>And none of this hasanything to do with me?

502
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,450
<17-29,Stacy>没有，除非是你不想也不让它过去,让它过去
<17-29,Stacy>No,nothing. Except that you can'tor won't just let it go. Let it go.

503
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,700
<17-30,House>你被下毒了
<17-30,House>You're being poisoned.

504
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
<17-31,Patient>香口胶吗?
<17-31,Patient>By gum?

505
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,950
<17-32,House>无糖口香糖用山梨酸产生甜味
<17-32,House>Sugarless gum usessorbitol as a sweetener.

506
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,150
<17-32,House>我们用山梨酸作为缓泻剂
<17-32,House>We use sorbitolas a laxative.

507
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,850
<18-1,Manager>这可以证明他是否有血癌?
<18-1,Manager>This'll tell you if he'sgot cancer in his blood?

508
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,250
<18-2,Wilson>如果有在骨髓内可看到变异细胞
<18-2,Wilson>If he does,we'll seeabnormal cells in the marrow.

509
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,550
<18-3,Manager>检查需要多少时间?
<18-3,Manager>How long willthe test take?

510
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,050
<18-4,Wilson>我会尽快
<18-4,Wilson>I'll get them inas soon as I can.

511
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,700
<18-5,Manager>如果没癌,
<18-5,Manager>And if doesn'thave cancer,

512
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,050
<18-5,Manager>会是什么?
<18-5,Manager>what else could it be?

513
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,250
<18-6,Wilson>可能是早前给他做测试带来的伤害
<18-6,Wilson>It's possiblesome damage was done during one of the testswe gave him.

514
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,000
<18-7,Manager>所以要么是你的医生搞砸了简单的检查,要么是他得癌了？
<18-7,Manager>So eitherone of your doctors screwed upa simple procedure,or he's got cancer.

515
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,100
<18-8,Wilson>在活检报告出来前我们什么都不能确定
<18-8,Wilson>We can't knowanything for sure until the biopsy comes back.

516
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,250
<18-9,Wilson>有点刺痛，我知道
<18-9,Wilson>It stings,I know.

517
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,800
<18-10,Manager>不，他要把管子拔出来
<18-10,Manager>No,he wants the tube out.

518
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,150
<18-10,Manager>不行，杰
<18-10,Manager>Can't do that,jeff.

519
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
<18-11,Wilson>如果你想说话只能写出来了
<18-11,Wilson>If you want to say something,you've got to write it down.

520
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,650
<18-11,Wilson>好吗?
<18-11,Wilson>Okay?

<18-12,Manager>Here.

522
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,650
<18-13,Wilson>如果是癌症，有可能
<18-13,Wilson>If it's cancer,it's possible.

523
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,050
<18-13,Wilson>还不得而知
<18-13,Wilson>There's no way to know for sure.

524
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,550
<19-1,Wilson>电话坏了吗?
<19-1,Wilson>Phone not working?

525
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,600
<19-1,Wilson>一个太平间服务员让我给你这个
<19-1,Wilson>One of the morgue attendantsasked me to bring this to you.

526
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,850
<19-2,Cameron>奇怪他们找我干嘛？
<19-2,Cameron>I wonder whythey're calling me.

527
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,250
<19-3,Wilson>对，我也是
<19-3,Wilson>Yeah,me too actually.

528
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,200
<19-3,Wilson>是，我也奇怪为什么《时代》周刊,为什么会回复你的电话？
<19-3,Wilson>I was why the times was returning your call.

529
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,400
<19-3,Wilson>你是医生还是自行车警察?
<19-3,Wilson>You a doctoror the bicycle police?

530
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,200
<19-4,Cameron>他骗人
<19-4,Cameron>He's cheating.

531
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,350
<19-4,Cameron>他不该得逞
<19-4,Cameron>He shouldn't get away with it.

532
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,350
<19-5,Wilson>你已经告诉他们什么了吗?
<19-5,Wilson>Have you actually told them anything yet?

533
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,500
<19-6,Cameron>你是担心先例吗?
<19-6,Cameron>You worriedabout the precedent?

534
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,000
<19-7,Wilson>我担心你
<19-7,Wilson>I'm worried about you.

535
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,200
<19-8,Cameron>你要告发我吗?
<19-8,Cameron>You gonna turn me in?

536
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
<19-8,Cameron>不会
<19-8,Cameron>No.

537
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,700
<19-9,Wilson>他犯了错
<19-9,Wilson>He's made a mistake.

538
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,150
<19-9,Wilson>揭露真相并不能逆转已做的
<19-9,Wilson>Revealing the truthdoesn't undo it.

539
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,100
<19-10,Cameron>孩子们喜欢他，而他名不副实
<19-10,Cameron>Kids love him and he's notwho they think he is.

540
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,000
<19-10,Cameron>那样不对
<19-10,Cameron>It's not right.

541
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,550
<19-11,Wilson>谁在乎他是否名副其实?
<19-11,Wilson>Who cares if he'swhat he says he is?

542
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,350
<19-11,Wilson>谁能名副其实?
<19-11,Wilson>Who the hell is?

543
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,800
<19-11,Wilson>如果爱基于一个谎言,那么是否就不是真感情呢?
<19-11,Wilson>If love's based on lies,does that mean it's nota real feeling?

544
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,800
<19-11,Wilson>难道就没有愉悦吗？
<19-11,Wilson>Doesn't bringthe same pleasure?

545
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,650
<19-12,Cameron>你还是在谈论病人吗?
<19-12,Cameron>Are we still talkingabout the patient?

546
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,450
<19-13,Wilson>你没骗过人吗?
<19-13,Wilson>Have you ever cheated?

547
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,550
<19-13,Wilson>我骗过
<19-13,Wilson>Well,I have.

548
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
<19-13,Wilson>你想惩罚他，你去做吧
<19-13,Wilson>You want to punish him,good for you.

549
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,250
<19-13,Wilson>但是你无法使爱他的人不同时受罚
<19-13,Wilson>But you can't do itwithout punishing the people who love him.

550
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
<19-14,Cameron>是因为你骗了你妻子吗?
<19-14,Cameron>Is that you justifiedlying to you wives?

551
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,600
<19-15,Wilson>我说了的
<19-15,Wilson>I always told them.

552
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,050
<20-1,Foreman>没有出血症状
<20-1,Foreman>Well,he's negativefor bleeds.

<20-2,House>恭喜你，小蔡，是癌症
<20-2,House>Congratulations,chase.It's cancer.

554
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,850
<20-2,House>把他弄干净给肿瘤科送去，,是他们的事儿了
<20-2,House>Clean him upand let oncology have him. It's their party now.

555
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,150
<20-2,House>他不是癌症
<20-2,House>He doesn't have cancer.

556
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,950
<20-3,Wilson>活检显示他是单纯性血红细胞先天萎缩
<20-3,Wilson>biopsy shows he's gotpure red cell aplasia.

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,850
<20-4,Chase>没理由PRCA检查这么清楚
<20-4,Chase>There's no way prca couldmanifest so suddenly.

558
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,250
<20-5,Cameron>除非是药物导致
<20-5,Cameron>Unless it's drug-induced.

559
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,200
<20-5,Cameron>他说没用EPO是说谎的
<20-5,Cameron>He's lying about not being on epo.

560
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,850
<20-6,House>他干嘛说谎?
<20-6,House>Why would he lie?

561
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,050
<20-7,Cameron>有什么关系?
<20-7,Cameron>What does it matter?

562
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,900
<20-8,House>人们有成千的理由说谎
<20-8,House>People liefor thousands of reasons,

563
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,300
<20-8,House>但总要有理由
<20-8,House>but there's alwaysa reason.

564
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,750
<20-9,Foreman>有趣的哲理，但与医学无关
<20-9,Foreman>Philosophically interesting,medically irrelevant.

565
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,900
<20-10,House>除非他没说谎
<20-10,House>Unless he's not lying.

566
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,050
<20-11,Cuddy>你泄露消息了
<20-11,Cuddy>You've got a leak.

567
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,450
<20-11,Cuddy>传媒到处报道弗杰的故事
<20-11,Cuddy>The press is all overthe jeff forster story.

568
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,600
<20-12,Stacy>机率虽小，但没准你们中有人愚蠢到从,自己的办公室打电话……
<20-12,Stacy>On the off-chance thatone of you was stupid enough to call from your own office,

569
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,100
<20-12,Stacy>我要提取你们的电话记录
<20-12,Stacy>I'm pulling your phone records.

<20-12,Stacy>Including your cell phones.

571
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,700
<20-13,Foreman>我假设如果我能证实你无权如此作为
<20-13,Foreman>I assume if I point outthe fact that you have no rightto do that

572
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,450
<20-13,Foreman>你就会内疚的予以解释了
<20-13,Foreman>you'll interpret that as a sign of guilt.

573
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,100
<20-14,House>威尔胡扯的
<20-14,House>Wilson's chatty.

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,950
<20-14,House>再加上他有两个妻子要供养
<20-14,House>Plus he's gottwo ex-wives to support.

575
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,350
<20-14,House>你想让我告诉他他被解雇了吗?
<20-14,House>You want meto tell him he's fired?

576
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
<20-15,Stacy>在查到是谁的作为前,我会跟你们一起办公
<20-15,Stacy>Until we figure outwho's behind this,I'm sitting inwith you guys.

577
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,500
<20-15,Stacy>如果你们的道德跟4岁孩子一样,我就当你们是4岁一样对待
<20-15,Stacy>You have the ethicsof a four-year-old. I'm gonna treat youlike one.

578
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,600
<20-16,House>一个律师坐我肩上,我怎么干医生的行当?
<20-16,House>How am I supposedto practice medicine with a lawyersitting on my shoulder?

579
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,700
<20-17,Cuddy>负责任的干
<20-17,Cuddy>Responsibly.

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,700
<20-18,House>你知道我不行
<20-18,House>You know I can't do that.

581
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
<20-19,Wilson>卡梅伦
<20-19,Wilson>Cameron.

582
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,100
<20-20,Cameron>我没泄露
<20-20,Cameron>I'm not the leak.

583
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,750
<20-21,Stacy>某人曾告诉我所有人都说谎
<20-21,Stacy>Somebody once told methat everybody lies.

584
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
<20-21,Stacy>既然你是唯一一个知道他得癌的人……
<20-21,Stacy>And since you're the only people who know he has cancer--

585
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,050
<20-22,House>他没得癌
<20-22,House>he doesn't have cancer.

586
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
<20-23,Cuddy>重点是你是他的医疗小组
<20-23,Cuddy>the point is you're his medical team.

587
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,000
<20-23,Cuddy>他威胁要诉讼
<20-23,Cuddy>He's threatening to sue.

588
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,950
<20-24,House>为什么卡梅伦放水说癌症?
<20-24,House>Why would cameron leak cancer?

589
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,050
<20-24,House>癌症又怎么会令他难看?
<20-24,House>How does cancermake the guy look bad?

590
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
<20-24,House>他用EPO
<20-24,House>He's on epo.

591
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,350
<21-1,House>你的贫血由单纯血红细胞萎缩造成
<21-1,House>Your anemia is caused by pure red blood cellaplasia.

592
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,550
<21-1,House>这会挺疼的，但我们要谈谈
<21-1,House>This is gonna hurt,but we've gotta talk.

593
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,850
<21-2,Manager>你到底干什么啊?
<21-2,Manager>What the hellare you doing?

594
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,900
<21-3,House>他会没事的
<21-3,House>He'll be fine.

595
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,050
<21-3,House>没准
<21-3,House>Sort of.

596
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,500
<21-3,House>我只是没时间看他写出答案来
<21-3,House>I just don't have time to watch himwrite out answers.

597
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,300
<21-3,House>Prca 有两种结果：急性、慢性
<21-3,House>Prca comes in two varieties. Chronic and acute.

598
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,050
<21-3,House>因为来势甚快，所以你是急性的
<21-3,House>Since it came on fast,you have the acute version.

599
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,300
<21-4,Manager>他没有癌症
<21-4,Manager>He doesn't have cancer.

600
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,400
<21-5,House>这是好消息
<21-5,House>Is the good news.

601
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,150
<21-5,House>坏消息是...
<21-5,House>The bad new is...

602
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,350
<21-5,House>裤子着火了
<21-5,House>pants are on fire.

603
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,200
<21-5,House>急性PRCA由药物导致,最常见的是EPO
<21-5,House>Acute prca is causedby drugs. Most commonly,epo.

604
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,300
<21-5,House>准备－－开拍！
<21-5,House>Ready,and--action!

605
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,700
<21-6,Jeff>可我没用epo
<21-6,Jeff>But I haven't used epo.

606
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,550
<21-6,Jeff>好
<21-6,Jeff>Okay.

607
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,700
<21-7,House>但这次表现更多愤怒
<21-7,House>But this timewith more anger.

608
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,200
<21-7,House>记住，这家伙可是在指控你欺诈
<21-7,House>Remember,this guy'saccusing you of cheating.

609
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,950
<21-8,Jeff>我没用那些东西
<21-8,Jeff>I haven't used that stuff.

610
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,950
<21-9,House>哦，我信了
<21-9,House>Oh! Mwah!I believed it.

611
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,250
<21-9,House>简单、纯情，你相信他吗?
<21-9,House>It was simple. It was pure.Did you believe it?

612
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,000
<21-9,House>我猜头一次试演就定人选太傻了
<21-9,House>I guess it's silly to cast someone after the first audition.

613
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,300
<21-9,House>你来表演一下如何?
<21-9,House>Why don't you do a reading?

614
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,950
<21-10,Manager>给我，他没用epo
<21-10,Manager>Give me that.He doesn't do epo.

615
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
<21-11,House>嗯，你觉得呢?
<21-11,House>Hmm. What did you think?

616
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,900
<21-11,House>我的意思是，很难
<21-11,House>I mean,it's a differentway to go,

617
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,350
<21-11,House>但是，我不知道，我就是不信
<21-11,House>but I don't know,I just didn't buy it.

618
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,050
<21-11,House>是她在给你注射吧?
<21-11,House>Does she handleany of your injections?

619
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,000
<21-12,Manager>你以为是我给他的吗?
<21-12,Manager>You thinkI'm giving it to him?

620
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,400
<21-12,Manager>给他做试演
<21-12,Manager>Test him.

621
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,700
<21-13,House>嗯，这主意真不错
<21-13,House>Gee. That's a great idea.

622
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,900
<21-13,House>我希望EPO不是那种注射6小时后,就查不出来的药品
<21-13,House>I sure hope that epo'snot one of those drugs that's undetectableafter six hours.

623
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,950
<21-13,House>嘿，你知道我们可以查什么吗?
<21-13,House>Hey,you know whatwe can test for?

624
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,500
<21-13,House>电话
<21-13,House>Phone calls.

625
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,250
<21-13,House>拿她的手机，按重播键
<21-13,House>Take her cell phone, push the redial button.

626
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,800
<21-13,House>连钱都会说你放水给报纸,泄露癌症的消息
<21-13,House>Even money says you'll be connected to the newspaper thatleaked your cancer story.

627
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,150
<21-14,Manager>好吧
<21-14,Manager>Okay.

628
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,500
<21-14,Manager>好吧，我该告诉你的
<21-14,Manager>Okay,I should'vetold you.

629
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,550
<21-14,Manager>跟比赛无关，杰
<21-14,Manager>It's not just about the races,jeff.

630
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,550
<21-14,Manager>事关你的形象，好吗?
<21-14,Manager>It's about your image.Okay?

631
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,850
<21-14,Manager>如果你能战胜癌症,那些赞助商会蜂拥而至的
<21-14,Manager>If you come back from cancer,those sponsors will beall over you.

632
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,000
<21-14,Manager>好吧，我搞砸了
<21-14,Manager>Okay,so I messed up.

633
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,550
<21-14,Manager>好吧，可我没给你epo
<21-14,Manager>Okay. But I did notgive you epo.

634
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,500
<21-15,Jeff>那玩意会要了我的命
<21-15,Jeff>That stuff could kill me.

635
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,500
<21-16,House>好了，饶了她吧
<21-16,House>Come on,give her a break.

636
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,700
<21-16,House>她只是尽力提升自己的事业而已
<21-16,House>She's only doingwhat she has to do to advance her career.

637
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,350
<21-16,House>你身上不也有那样的纹身吗?
<21-16,House>Don't you have thattattooed on your tushie?

638
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,650
<21-17,Manager>我不会做伤害你的事
<21-17,Manager>I would neverdo anything to hurt you.

639
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,650
<21-17,Manager>你要信谁?
<21-17,Manager>Who are you gonna believe?

640
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,350
<21-18,House>你多年信任的经纪人吗?
<21-18,House>The manager you'vetrusted for years?

641
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,950
<21-18,House>我上过大学
<21-18,House>Pff! I've been to college.

642
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,500
<21-19,Jeff>你被炒了
<21-19,Jeff>You're fired.

643
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,600
<21-19,Jeff>好吧
<21-19,Jeff>Okay.

644
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,200
<21-20,Manager>你把诊断，所有的事情
<21-20,Manager>You're basing this wholediagnosis,everything,

645
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,350
<21-20,Manager>都建立在我给他违禁药品的基础上
<21-20,Manager>on the idea that I wasslipping him illegal drugs.

646
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,800
<21-20,Manager>你会杀了他
<21-20,Manager>You're gonna kill him.

647
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,550
<22-1,Jeff>如果豪斯医生那么确定,你为什么需要留医？
<22-1,Jeff>If dr. House is so sure,why do you need to stay?

648
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,200
<22-2,Foreman>他很谨慎
<22-2,Foreman>He's a very cautious man.

649
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,550
<22-2,Foreman>你呼吸状况好多了
<22-2,Foreman>You're breathing's better.

650
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,350
<22-2,Foreman>让强尼松发挥功效,好好睡觉吧
<22-2,Foreman>Let the prednisonedo its job. Get some sleep.

651
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,550
<22-2,Foreman>杰?
<22-2,Foreman>Jeff?

652
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,100
<22-2,Foreman>他的血红细胞读数下降到16%了
<22-2,Foreman>His red blood cell count plummeted to 16%.

653
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,350
<23-1,Foreman>他昏迷了，得唤醒他,还是不能移动双腿
<23-1,Foreman>He passed out,had to be resuscitated, and he still can'tmove his legs.

654
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,250
<23-2,Cameron>不可能啊
<23-2,Cameron>That's not possible.

655
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,450
<23-2,Cameron>药品该已经被冲出体外了
<23-2,Cameron>The drugs should be flushingout of his system.

656
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,350
<23-3,House>如果不存在就无法消失
<23-3,House>Can't leaveif they don't exist.

657
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,350
<23-4,Cameron>epo通常可以解释有他这种症状的人
<23-4,Cameron>The epo use explainsevery one of his symptoms.

658
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,100
<23-4,Cameron>他撒谎骗人，现在这些找上他了
<23-4,Cameron>He's been lyingand cheating, and now it's comingback to bite him.

659
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,950
<23-5,House>那个假设的理论基础是,宇宙其实只是个位置而已
<23-5,House>The only problem withthat theory is it's based on the assumption thatthe universe is a just place.

660
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,050
<23-5,House>如果真是，那他的经纪人,就不会无由被炒
<23-5,House>If it were,then his poor manager wouldn't have been firedfor no reason.

661
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,450
<23-7,Cameron>-兰伊顿,-他的肺没事
<23-7,Cameron>-Lambert-eaton. -His chest was clear.

662
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,750
<23-8,Chase>那我们来做肌电图测试
<23-8,Chase>so we run an electromyography test.

663
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,000
<23-9,Cameron>还是不能解释prca
<23-9,Cameron>You're stillnot explaining the prca.

664
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,500
<23-10,House>现在血红细胞读数是多少?
<23-10,House>What's his red count now?

665
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,700
<23-11,Foreman>我得输血使他到30
<23-11,Foreman>I had to give hima blood transfusion. He's back around 30.

666
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,700
<23-12,House>他需要输血?
<23-12,House>He needed a transfusion?

667
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,200
<23-13,Foreman>嗯，他失血，所以我想他需要输血
<23-13,Foreman>Well,he was losing blood,so I thoughtmaybe he needed blood.

668
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,000
<23-14,House>快去扫描他的颈部
<23-14,House>Go forth and scan his neck.

<23-15,Chase>His neck?

670
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,800
<23-16,House>或者是用疑问句形式重复我说的话也可以
<23-16,House>Or repeat everythingI say in question form.

671

<24-1,House>她闯进诊所对我大喊大叫
<24-1,House>She came into the clinicand yelled at me.

672
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,200
<24-1,House>然后就离开了
<24-1,House>Then she left,

673
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,550
<24-1,House>然后又回来又喊了一通
<24-1,House>then she came backand yelled some more.

<24-3,House>我知道叫喊的意思
<24-3,House>Well,I know whatthe yelling means.

<24-4,Wilson>-是不理智,-生气是不理智的
<24-4,Wilson>-It's not rational. -Anger's not rational.

679
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,000
<24-5,House>有的生气是的
<24-5,House>Some anger is.

680
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,550
<24-5,House>她可以把我拉到一边,私下里跟我喊啊
<24-5,House>She could'vepulled me aside, screamed at my privately.

<24-5,House>她简单又好强
<24-5,House>Her beef is simpleand well-founded.

682
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,800
<24-5,House>但是失控了
<24-5,House>But she wasout of control.
