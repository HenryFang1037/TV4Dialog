<4-3,Park>你这话说的有些随意了吧
<4-3,Park>that seems arbitrary.

149
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,090
<4-4,Young man>你是朴克智  对吗
<4-4,Young man>You're Chi Park, right?

150
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,830
<4-5,Park>你是谁
<4-5,Park>Who's asking?

151
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,730
<4-6,Young man>你打过我吉他宣传弹上的电话
<4-6,Young man>Uh, you called about my guitar flyer.

152
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,940
<4-7,Park>你是麦迦
<4-7,Park>You're Micah.

153
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,820
<4-7,Park>他卖的一款1974年烟草色吉布森SG吉他
<4-7,Park>This guy's selling a 1974 Gibson SG standard

154
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,870
<4-7,Park>吉普森吉他  美国知名乐器品牌
<4-7,Park>该款吉他属经典收藏款

155
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,050
<4-7,Park>开价只要1250美元
<4-7,Park>in tobacco for $1,250.

156
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,520
<4-8,Micah>其实  我是来告诉你我已经把它卖了
<4-8,Micah>Yeah, actually, I came in to tell you I already sold it.

157
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,390
<4-8,Micah>抱歉
<4-8,Micah>Sorry.

158
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,990
<4-9,Park>那也谢谢了
<4-9,Park>Thanks anyway.

159
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,390
<4-9,Park>血液化验结果同之前非常相近
<4-9,Park>Blood panel results seem pretty much the same as before,

160
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,070
<4-10,Park>还有刚才那人喜欢你
<4-10,Park>and that guy likes you.

161
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,850
<4-10,Park>也许我们应该检查一下糖尿病的指标
<4-10,Park>Maybe we should check for diabetes,

162
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,600
<4-10,Park>糖尿病可以导致结膜血管变弱
<4-10,Park>could weaken conjunctival vessels.

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,710
<4-10,Park>还有闭嘴
<4-10,Park>And shut up.

164
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,430
<4-11,Taub>如果我说错了  那他为什么回来呢
<4-11,Taub>If I'm wrong, then why is he coming back?

165
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,730
<4-12,Micah>我们乐队明晚会彩排
<4-12,Micah>My band is rehearsing tomorrow night.

166
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,430
<4-12,Micah>你可以过来一起
<4-12,Micah>You should come by and jam with us.

167
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,370
<4-12,Micah>听上去不错
<4-12,Micah>That...sounds fun.

168
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,180
<4-13,Micah>我考虑考虑
<4-13,Micah>I'll think about it.

169
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,070
<4-13,Micah>太好了  回头打我电话
<4-13,Micah>Great. Call me.

170
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,950
<4-13,Micah>朴克有男友了
<4-13,Micah>Park has a boyfriend.

171
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,660
<4-14,Park>小心我揍你
<4-14,Park>I'll break your face.

172
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
<5-1,House>这是面试的才艺展示阶段
<5-1,House>This is the talent portion of the interview.

173
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,820
<5-1,House>好的
<5-1,House>Okay.

174
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,050
<5-2,Adams>你喜欢玩扑克
<5-2,Adams>You like cards.

175
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,770
<5-2,Adams>但你自己也能玩啊
<5-2,Adams>But you can juggle.

176
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,930
<5-2,Adams>我看不出她们这些对你有啥好处
<5-2,Adams>I fail to see how this would be of benefit to you.

177
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,040
<5-3,House>我要是没空玩呢
<5-3,House>What if I'm busy?

178
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,380
<5-3,House>还有什么绝活吗
<5-3,House>Have you got anything else?

179
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,870
<5-3,House>当然
<5-3,House>Sure.

180
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,180
<5-4,Adams>CT未显脑梗塞或血管畸形
<5-4,Adams>CT showed no clots or malformations.

181
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,350
<5-4,Adams>朴克和陶博已排除
<5-4,Adams>Park and Taub ruled out

182
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,950
<5-4,Adams>淋巴细胞增多症和糖尿病
<5-4,Adams>lymphocytosis and diabetes.

183
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,570
<5-5,House>要是你没什么可汇报的
<5-5,House>Well, since you have nothing of relevance to report,

184
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,320
<5-5,House>我就假设你是来加入她们的
<5-5,House>I assume that you're here to toss your panties in the ring.

185
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,570
<5-6,Adams>患者有一位神秘女友
<5-6,Adams>Patient's got a mysterious girlfriend

186
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,210
<5-6,Adams>他想见她
<5-6,Adams>he really wants to see.

187
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,580
<5-6,Adams>电话联系不上
<5-6,Adams>She's unreachable by phone,

188
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,240
<5-6,Adams>邻居也从未见过她
<5-6,Adams>and the neighbor's never even seen her.

189
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,390
<5-6,Adams>你怎么看
<5-6,Adams>What do you think?

190
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,870
<5-7,Debbie>他是同性恋
<5-7,Debbie>He's gay.

191
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,180
<5-8,Adams>我认为他是个瘾君子
<5-8,Adams>I think he's a junkie.

192
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,880
<5-8,Adams>女朋友只是幻想
<5-8,Adams>The girlfriend is a fix.

193
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,800
<5-8,Adams>他在吸毒
<5-8,Adams>The guy's inhaling glue.

194
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,170
<5-9,House>你会修搅拌机吗
<5-9,House>Can you repair a blender?

195
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,530
<5-10,Adams>不会修你能把我怎么样
<5-10,Adams>Can you bite me?

196
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,090
<5-10,Adams>去搜查患者的家
<5-10,Adams>Go search the patient's home.

197
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,930
<5-10,Adams>感谢两位
<5-10,Adams>Well, thank you, ladies.

198
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,710
<5-10,Adams>我见识了很多多才多艺的人
<5-10,Adams>I've seen a lot of very talented candidates.

199
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,930
<5-10,Adams>接下来就是艰难的选择了
<5-10,Adams>Got a tough decision the next few days.

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
<5-10,Adams>我最讨厌这个环节
<5-10,Adams>This is the part I hate.

201
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,540
<6-1,Chase>看起来也不像是个瘾君子的窝
<6-1,Chase>Well...this is not exactly a crack den.

202
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,240
<6-2,Adams>也不像是有女人居住的地方
<6-2,Adams>Doesn't exactly look like a woman lives here, either.

203
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,710
<6-3,Chase>"致艾米
<6-3,Chase>"To amy.

204
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,030
<6-3,Chase>"我爱你"
<6-3,Chase>I love you."

205
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,840
<6-4,Adams>好吧  她确实存在
<6-4,Adams>Okay. She exists.

206
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,770
<6-4,Adams>并不证明他没在吸毒啊
<6-4,Adams>Doesn't mean he's not a drug addict.

207
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,610
<6-5,Chase>你能冷静对待豪斯很好
<6-5,Chase>It's good you're playing it cool with House.

208
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,980
<6-5,Chase>他一但成功地把谁惹恼了...
<6-5,Chase>Once he gets a rise out of someone...

209
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,930
<6-6,Adams>我对招妓什么的虽然不怎么认同
<6-6,Adams>Yeah, I'm not crazy about the whole hooker thing,

210
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,490
<6-6,Adams>但是我懂
<6-6,Adams>but I get it.

211
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,450
<6-6,Adams>抛开这行业对于女性的欺压和危险不说
<6-6,Adams>Other than the fact that it's exploitative and dangerous for women,

212
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,660
<6-6,Adams>招妓行为本身既能满足自身需求
<6-6,Adams>you get what you need

213
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,890
<6-6,Adams>又不会背上感情包袱
<6-6,Adams>without any of the emotional baggage.

214
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,680
<6-7,Chase>看来你现在没男朋友吧
<6-7,Chase>You're not seeing anyone, I take it.

215
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,680
<6-8,Adams>我近来在特伦顿免费门诊做义工
<6-8,Adams>I've been volunteering at the Trenton Free Clinic.

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
<6-8,Adams>充实生活
<6-8,Adams>Keeps me busy.

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,860
<6-9,Chase>你每晚每个周末都在做义工吗
<6-9,Chase>You volunteer every night and every weekend?

218
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,430
<6-9,Chase>没时间出去吃顿饭
<6-9,Chase>No time to grab dinner?

219
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,330
<6-10,Adams>哪一个更重要
<6-10,Adams>What's more important?

220
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,060
<6-10,Adams>是吃着意式馄饨聊天
<6-10,Adams>Making small talk over ravioli

221
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,990
<6-10,Adams>还是帮助那些不幸的人们
<6-10,Adams>or helping people who are less fortunate?

222
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,590
<6-11,Chase>以你这样说  我们谁也别再吃饭了
<6-11,Chase>With that rationale, none of us should ever eat again.

223
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,810
<6-12,Adams>只能说我现在对吃东西没什么兴趣
<6-12,Adams>Let's just say I'm not hungry right now.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,570
<6-13,Adams>天啊
<6-13,Adams>Oh, god...

225
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,570
<6-14,Adams>她好像停止呼吸了
<6-14,Adams>I don't think she's breathing.

226
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,400
<6-14,Adams>是不是吸毒过量了
<6-14,Adams>Do you think she OD'd?

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,010
<6-15,Chase>或是被他杀了
<6-15,Chase>That or he killed her.

228
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,160
<6-15,Chase>还有脉搏吗
<6-15,Chase>Pulse?

229
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,820
<6-16,Adams>没了
<6-16,Adams>No.

230
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,640
<6-17,Chase>我给验尸官打电话
<6-17,Chase>I'll call the coroner.

231
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,840
<6-18,Adams>我想没这个必要
<6-18,Adams>I don't think that's gonna be necessary.

232
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,740
<7-1,Dominika>这位在金融界工作
<7-1,Dominika>This one works in financial district.

233
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,170
<7-1,Dominika>她能给你提供信息  在市场上给与你帮助
<7-1,Dominika>She can get tips, give you leg up in market.

234
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,320
<7-1,Dominika>什么是"冈萨雷斯巧克力"
<7-1,Dominika>What is "Fudgey Gonzalez"?

235
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,000
<7-2,House>想象一下"冈萨雷斯香草"
<7-2,House>Uh, imagine a "Vanilla Gonzalez,"

236
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,630
<7-2,House>但是肤色不同
<7-2,House>but from the other side.

237
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,670
<7-3,House>我马上就要做出决定了
<7-3,House>I'm about to make a decision,

238
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,230
<7-3,House>但你现在加入还来得及
<7-3,House>but there's still time for you to sneak under the wire.

239
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,510
<7-3,House>我最喜爱的伍迪·艾伦电影是
<7-3,House>My favorite Woody Allen movie

240
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,990
<7-4,Adams>《双生美莲达》
<7-4,Adams>is Melinda and Melinda.

241
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,740
<7-4,Adams>患者并没在吸毒
<7-4,Adams>Our patient is not a junkie,

242
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,250
<7-4,Adams>但是他的确有个女朋友
<7-4,Adams>but he does have a girlfriend.

243
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,160
<8-1,Henry>我称她为女朋友是因为
<8-1,Henry>I call her my "girlfriend"

244
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,730
<8-1,Henry>其他人比较容易理解
<8-1,Henry>because people understand that.

245
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,330
<8-1,Henry>要是我解释了
<8-1,Henry>If I explained it,

246
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,330
<8-1,Henry>他们也只会觉得我很奇怪
<8-1,Henry>they'd just think I was a weirdo.

247
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,860
<8-2,Chase>我们不是来评判别人的癖好的
<8-2,Chase>We're not here to judge anyone's fetish.

248
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,940
<8-3,Henry>我不是变态
<8-3,Henry>I'm not a pervert.

249
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,120
<8-3,Henry>并不是说我喜欢充气娃娃胜过喜欢活生生的人
<8-3,Henry>It's not like I'm more attracted to dolls than humans.

250
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,060
<8-4,Chase>你没和她发生性关系吗
<8-4,Chase>So you don't have sex with her?

251
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,750
<8-5,Henry>这不仅仅是单纯的性关系
<8-5,Henry>It's not just about that.

252
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,370
<8-6,Adams>娃娃还和你聊天吗
<8-6,Adams>Does the doll talk to you?

253
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,330
<8-7,Henry>我知道她不是真人
<8-7,Henry>I know she's not a real person.

254
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,090
<8-7,Henry>很多方面来说  她比真人更好
<8-7,Henry>In a lot of ways, she's better than a person.

255
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,610
<8-7,Henry>我可以向她倾诉
<8-7,Henry>I can tell her things,

256
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,690
<8-7,Henry>她不会跟我争论  不会取笑我
<8-7,Henry>and she won't argue with me or make fun of me.

257
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,740
<8-7,Henry>我每晚回到家中
<8-7,Henry>I come home every night,

258
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,640
<8-7,Henry>都知道她会在家等着我
<8-7,Henry>and I know she'll be there waiting.

259
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,280
<8-8,Adams>你的面包机也在家等着呢
<8-8,Adams>So is your toaster.

260
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,360
<8-9,Henry>这世上没人会对面包机产生感情
<8-9,Henry>No one in the world has an emotional attachment to a toaster.

261
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,450
<8-9,Henry>但很多人会愿意花7000美金
<8-9,Henry>But a lot of people are willing to spend $7,000

262
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,110
<8-9,Henry>买一个像艾米这样的女人
<8-9,Henry>on women like Amy.

263
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,940
<8-10,Chase>你有试过和真人
<8-10,Chase>Have you ever tried an actual--

264
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,150
<8-11,Henry>有啊  我都35岁了
<8-11,Henry>Yeah, I'm 35.

265
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,260
<8-11,Henry>我谈过恋爱
<8-11,Henry>I've been in relationships.

266
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,470
<8-11,Henry>但是没有一段感情能让我心满意足的
<8-11,Henry>None of them fulfilled me.

267
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,090
<8-11,Henry>有一天  我发现了这个网站...
<8-11,Henry>And one day, I saw this website, and...

268
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,740
<8-11,Henry>也许我的真命天女确实存在
<8-11,Henry>Maybe the perfect woman's out there somewhere,

269
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,880
<8-11,Henry>但是花费很多精力去寻找她也一点不值得
<8-11,Henry>but it's not worth going through what it would take to find her.

270
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,740
<8-11,Henry>艾米让我很开心
<8-11,Henry>Amy makes me happy.

271
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,420
<8-13,Henry>-你的脸肿了  -这里挺热的
<8-13,Henry>- You're swelling. - It's sort of hot in here.

272
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,760
<8-13,Henry>也没你那么热
<8-13,Henry>Not that hot.

273
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,390
<9-1,Adams>出血加上两个新症状
<9-1,Adams>Bleeding plus two more symptoms:

274
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,250
<9-1,Adams>发热和神经系统症状
<9-1,Adams>Fever and neurological.

275
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,630
<9-2,Chase>我对后者不怎么确定
<9-2,Chase>I'm not sure about that last one.

276
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,040
<9-2,Chase>我觉得他只是有一点  奇怪
<9-2,Chase>I think he's just...weird.

277
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,380
<9-2,Chase>他没有产生幻觉
<9-2,Chase>He wasn't hallucinating.

278
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,050
<9-2,Chase>没有思维混乱
<9-2,Chase>He didn't have a thought disorder.

279
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,720
<9-3,Park>你不觉得和充气娃娃谈话是
<9-3,Park>And you don't think it's "disordered" to talk to--

280
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,260
<9-4,Chase>其实这和跟猫跟玩具熊说话没什么区别
<9-4,Chase>It's not all that different from talking to your cat or a teddy bear.

281
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,250
<9-5,Adams>可你不会和你的猫或玩具熊搞上啊
<9-5,Adams>You don't have sex with your cat or teddy bear.

282
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,780
<9-5,Adams>要是你搞上了
<9-5,Adams>If you did,

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,550
<9-6,House>说不定会和它们聊得更欢
<9-6,House>you'd probably talk to them more.

284
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,580
<9-6,House>这家伙爱上了一个虚拟情人
<9-6,House>Guy loves an imaginary being

285
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,540
<9-6,House>一个永远不会作出任何回应的东西
<9-6,House>who's never going to respond to him.

286
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,570
<9-6,House>也就跟百万教徒一般疯狂
<9-6,House>He's no crazier than millions of churchgoers.

287
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,690
<9-7,Adams>你一直以为
<9-7,Adams>You think anything off

288
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,250
<9-7,Adams>患者有任何的不对劲都是一种症状
<9-7,Adams>about any patient is a symptom.

289
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,800
<9-7,Adams>这家伙买了鲜花
<9-7,Adams>This guy buys flowers.

290
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,760
<9-7,Adams>为一个穿着裙子的塑料人买鲜花
<9-7,Adams>Real flowers for a piece of plastic in a dress.

291
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,560
<9-7,Adams>你知道什么事更荒唐吗
<9-7,Adams>You know what's really crazy?

292
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,190
<9-8,Taub>和活生生的人住在一起
<9-8,Taub>Living with a human being.

293
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,890
<9-8,Taub>一个有主见有感情的人
<9-8,Taub>Someone with opinions and feelings.

294
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,190
<9-8,Taub>就因为你想每周和她去上一堂
<9-8,Taub>Gets mad just 'cause you want to take Salsa classes

295
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,980
<9-8,Taub>萨尔萨舞课  她就闹脾气
<9-8,Taub>with them one night a week.

296
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,550
<9-8,Taub>每周就一次
<9-8,Taub>One night.

297
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,150
<9-8,Taub>他只是在逃避
<9-8,Taub>He's just running away.

298
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,260
<9-8,Taub>和一个充气娃娃过日子
<9-8,Taub>He hangs out with a doll,

299
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,940
<9-8,Taub>就永远不用担心会被拒绝
<9-8,Taub>he never needs to fear rejection.

300
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,680
<9-9,Park>真是凄惨
<9-9,Park>It's sad.

301
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,460
<9-10,House>你们知道最讽刺的是什么吗
<9-10,House>You do understand the irony here?

302
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,950
<9-10,House>这屋里的所有人都有个充气娃娃
<9-10,House>Every person in this room has a sex doll.

303
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,240
<9-10,House>至少这患者还有胆承认
<9-10,House>At least the patient has the stones to be honest about it.

304
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,130
<9-11,Taub>打的比喻是吧
<9-11,Taub>Ooh, a metaphor.

305
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,210
<9-11,Taub>你没想到的是
<9-11,Taub>What you didn't foresee is that

306
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,180
<9-11,Taub>我还真的有一个
<9-11,Taub>I actually do have a sex doll.

307
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,580
<9-12,House>你的娃娃是你两个孩子
<9-12,House>Your doll is your kids.

308
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,610
<9-12,House>你的是你父母
<9-12,House>Yours is your parents,

309
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,930
<9-12,House>你的是慈善机构
<9-12,House>Yours is your charity.

310
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,770
<9-12,House>这些都是你们不谈恋爱的借口
<9-12,House>All excuses for not being in a relationship.

311
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,410
<9-13,Chase>他说的没错
<9-13,Chase>He's not wrong.

312
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,140
<9-14,Chase>-还有你  -我随意和陌生人上床
<9-14,Chase>- And you-- - I have meaningless sex with random strangers.

313
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,270
<9-14,Chase>谢谢你分享见解
<9-14,Chase>Thanks for the insight,

314
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,310
<9-14,Chase>但我几个月前就不再那样了
<9-14,Chase>but I stopped that months ago.

315
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,750
<9-14,Chase>还谈了一场恋爱
<9-14,Chase>I actually had a relationship.

316
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,230
<9-14,Chase>和一位患者
<9-14,Chase>With a patient.

317
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,130
<9-15,Chase>谁从你门前过你就和谁约会
<9-15,Chase>You just date whoever happens to cross your path.

318
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,560
<9-15,Chase>你是说我的恋爱阻碍了我的爱情生活吗
<9-15,Chase>My dating is getting in the way of my dating?

319
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,220
<9-16,House>你从不认真去找个适合你的人
<9-16,House>You don't go looking for the right person.

320
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,690
<9-16,House>随便拉个人就能同居
<9-16,House>You just shack up with whoever's in the room,

321
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,910
<9-16,House>之后出点状况
<9-16,House>and then you get surprised and/or divorced

322
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,290
<9-16,House>不是倍感吃惊就是离婚收场
<9-16,House>when it doesn't work out.

323
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,890
<9-16,House>真惊讶你到现在都还没约亚当斯出去
<9-16,House>I'm surprised you haven't asked Adams out yet.

324
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,420
<9-16,House>知会你一声
<9-16,House>Uh, for your information,

325
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,750
<9-16,House>今晚我要去约会了
<9-16,House>I've got a date tonight.

326
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,620
<29-1,Park>和一小帅哥还有他的乐队
<29-1,Park>I'll be jamming with a cute guy and his band.

327
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,760
<9-17,House>-你会放鸽子  -没错
<9-17,House>- You'll bail. - He's right.

328
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,540
<9-18,Taub>最明智的做法  就是让你父母帮我带孩子
<9-18,Taub>The obvious solution is for me to hand my kids over to your parents.

329
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,340
<9-19,House>我们能停止这类争论
<9-19,House>Can we stop trying to argue the premise

330
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,430
<9-19,House>想想为什么
<9-19,House>and move onto figuring out

331
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,600
<9-19,House>你们都是些社交白痴吗
<9-19,House>why it is that you're all social morons?

332
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,690
<9-19,House>你不觉得这很讽刺吗
<9-19,House>You do understand the irony here.

333
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,340
<9-20,Taub>你嘲笑我们回避感情
<9-20,Taub>You mocking us for avoiding relationships,

334
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,310
<9-20,Taub>自己却无法忍受失去你的"娃娃"
<9-20,Taub>but you can't handle losing your "Doll."

335
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,230
<9-20,Taub>所以才花这么多时间精力
<9-20,Taub>Your spending all this time and energy

336
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,290
<9-20,Taub>就为找一个新的
<9-20,Taub>interviewing for a new one.

337
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,740
<9-21,House>你说得对  这太蠢了
<9-21,House>You're right. That is stupid.

338
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,500
<9-22,Adams>病人怎么说
<9-22,Adams>What about the patient?

339
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,480
<9-23,House>这人和充气娃娃搞上了
<9-23,House>Dude's banging a sex doll.

340
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,180
<9-23,House>那货无异于一个充满体液和细菌的污水池
<9-23,House>A festering cesspool of bodily fluids and associated bacteria.

341
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,100
<9-23,House>从她体内取些标本化验下  看看是什么细菌
<9-23,House>Swab her out and find out which one.

342
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,330
<10-1,House>我需要你
<10-1,House>I need you.

343
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,130
<10-1,House>不要退隐江湖
<10-1,House>Please don't quit.

344
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,710
<10-1,House>你是我认识的唯一一个会弹钢琴的妓女
<10-1,House>You're the only hooker I know who can tune a piano.

345
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,440
<10-1,House>如果是钱的问题
<10-1,House>If it's about the money,

346
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,380
<10-1,House>我可以每周叫你三个晚上
<10-1,House>then I can up you to three nights a week.

347
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,510
<10-2,Emily>我要结婚了  豪斯
<10-2,Emily>I'm getting married, House.

348
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,210
<10-2,Emily>他叫哈里斯
<10-2,Emily>His name's Harris.

349
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,190
<10-2,Emily>是名注册会计师
<10-2,Emily>He's a certified accountant,

350
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,190
<10-2,Emily>喜欢蹩脚的恐怖电影
<10-2,Emily>he loves schlocky horror movies,

351
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,770
<10-2,Emily>刚和我搬到一起住
<10-2,Emily>and he just moved in.

352
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,730
<10-2,Emily>我们很幸福
<10-2,Emily>We're very happy.

353
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,360
<9-20,Taub>你们很幸福
<9-20,Taub>Well, you're happy?

354
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,340
<9-21,House>是因为他不知道
<9-21,House>Yeah, you're happy because he doesn't know

355
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,890
<9-22,Adams>你之前的职业经历吧
<9-22,Adams>about your employment history.

356
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,160
<10-3,Emily>他知道
<10-3,Emily>He knows.

357
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,510
<10-3,Emily>我们谈过
<10-3,Emily>We've talked about it,

358
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,240
<10-3,Emily>他接受了这样的我
<10-3,Emily>and he accepts me for who I am.

359
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,140
<10-4,House>不  他
<10-4,House>No. He...

360
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,510
<10-4,House>如果他接受这样的你
<10-4,House>If he accepted who you were,

361
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,060
<10-4,House>就不会让你放弃你的事业
<10-4,House>he would not be making you give up your career.

362
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,830
<10-4,House>女人要有自己的个性
<10-4,House>Women need their own identities,

363
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,610
<10-4,House>自己的营生
<10-4,House>their own livelihoods.

364
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,200
<10-4,House>不然为什么我还在抽女士烟呢
<10-4,House>Otherwise, why was I smoking all those virginia slims?

365
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,450
<10-5,Emily>我知道这对你来说很奇怪
<10-5,Emily>I know this is weird for you,

366
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,460
<10-5,Emily>但你要试着去接受
<10-5,Emily>but you need to figure out a way to be okay with it.

367
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,220
<10-5,Emily>我也会想你的
<10-5,Emily>I'll miss you, too.

368
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,520
<11-1,Chase>把她放妇科检查台上也太过了
<11-1,Chase>I feel like the stirrups are overkill.

369
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,320
<11-2,Adams>我之前没查过充气娃娃
<11-2,Adams>I've never done a pelvic on a doll before.

370
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,560
<11-2,Adams>对流程不是很熟悉
<11-2,Adams>I'm unfamiliar with the protocol.

371
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,340
<11-2,Adams>现在  我感觉是挺诡异的
<11-2,Adams>I'm pretty skeeved out right now.

372
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,730
<11-2,Adams>这点不假
<11-2,Adams>I'm not gonna lie.

373
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,790
<11-3,Chase>豪斯之前说的
<11-3,Chase>What House said back there--

374
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,230
<11-3,Chase>之前豪斯说了很多话
<11-3,Chase>House says a lot of things.

375
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,200
<11-4,Chase>我不是见一个爱一个的
<11-4,Chase>I don't just date whoever shows up.

376
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,570
<11-4,Chase>我的确是把过在医院认识的姑娘
<11-4,Chase>I mean, I did meet women in the hospital,

377
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:14,940
<11-4,Chase>但我并不只是玩玩的
<11-4,Chase>but they weren't just flings.

378
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,590
<11-5,Adams>基本上  你是在解释为什么你不约我出去
<11-5,Adams>Basically, you're explaining why you're not going to ask me out.

379
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
<11-6,Chase>我不是这个意思
<11-6,Chase>That's not what I was--

380
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,980
<11-6,Chase>你想让我约你出去吗
<11-6,Chase>Did you want me to ask you out?

381
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,000
<11-6,Chase>是啊
<11-6,Chase>Yeah.

382
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,680
<11-7,Adams>我让朴克去告诉陶博
<11-7,Adams>I told Park to tell Taub

383
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,250
<11-7,Adams>转告豪斯向你透露我是这么想的
<11-7,Adams>to tell House to pass you that note.

384
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,460
<11-7,Adams>里面非常干净
<11-7,Adams>It's completely clean in there.

385
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,360
<11-8,Chase>他说了他刚给她洗过澡
<11-8,Chase>He said he just bathed her.

386
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,700
<11-8,Chase>亚当斯...
<11-8,Chase>Adams...

387
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
<11-8,Chase>皮下有一处凸起
<11-8,Chase>There's a swelling beneath the skin...

388
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,320
<11-8,Chase>三英寸大小
<11-8,Chase>3-inch mass.

389
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,830
<11-8,Chase>会不会是
<11-8,Chase>Is it...

390
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,970
<11-9,Chase>娃娃骨架的一部分
<11-9,Chase>part of the doll's skeleton?

391
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,480
<11-9,Chase>摸上去像肿瘤
<11-9,Chase>It feels like a tumor.

392
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,190
<12-1,Adams>CT显示娃娃腹部有一处气泡
<12-1,Adams>CT showed an air-filled mass in the doll's abdomen.

393
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,990
<12-1,Adams>可能只是化学反应
<12-1,Adams>It's probably just a chemical reaction.

394
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,700
<12-1,Adams>可能亨利把她放得离暖气管太近了
<12-1,Adams>Henry left her too close to a heating pipe or something.

395
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,500
<12-2,Chase>这人每天早上给她梳头发
<12-2,Chase>This guy brushes her hair every morning,

396
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,750
<12-2,Chase>带影片回家和她一起看
<12-2,Chase>brings home movies for them to watch together.

397
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,410
<12-2,Chase>你觉得晚上他会把她和扫帚一起
<12-2,Chase>You think he tosses her in a broom closet

398
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,480
<12-2,Chase>扔进柜子里吗
<12-2,Chase>at the end of each day?

399
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,010
<12-3,Adams>这总比说它得了胃癌来的靠谱
<12-3,Adams>More likely than it getting stomach cancer.

400
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,620
<12-4,Chase>会不会是梭状芽胞杆菌
<12-4,Chase>How about clostridium?

401
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,690
<12-4,Chase>杆菌被困在密闭腔内
<12-4,Chase>Bacteria got trapped in the airtight cavity,

402
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,130
<12-4,Chase>代谢出气体
<12-4,Chase>produced gas...

403
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,120
<12-5,Adams>它不能解释神经系统的问题
<12-5,Adams>It doesn't explain the neurological issue.

404
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,370
<12-6,Chase>我们就是这样
<12-6,Chase>We can explain that the same way

405
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,230
<12-6,Chase>解释牙仙的
<12-6,Chase>we explain the tooth fairy.

406
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,430
<12-7,House>我要去演所罗门王
<12-7,House>Oh, I get to play Solomon.

408
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,070
<12-7,House>去把充气娃娃切开
<12-7,House>Cut the doll open.

409
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,490
<12-8,Chase>我们不能就这样破坏病人的财产
<12-8,Chase>We can't just destroy the patient's property.

410
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,890
<12-8,Chase>那东西值七千美金呢
<12-8,Chase>That thing cost 7 grand.

411
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,190
<12-9,House>没错  问问他同不同意
<12-9,House>Exactly. Ask him for consent.

412
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,030
<12-9,House>如果他说同意
<12-9,House>If he says yes,

413
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,490
<12-9,House>那我们就开始找芽孢杆菌
<12-9,House>then we get to go hunting bacteria.

414
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,450
<12-9,House>他不同意  说明他疯了  也不用找杆菌了
<12-9,House>If he says no, there's no need because he's crazy,

415
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,280
<12-9,House>我们就要另找病因了
<12-9,House>And we need a different theory.

416
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,730
<12-9,House>再见啦
<12-9,House>See ya.

417
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,520
<12-9,House>得去搭一座庙了
<12-9,House>Gotta go build a temple.

419
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,560
<13-1,Henry>好吧
<13-1,Henry>Okay.

420
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,450
<13-2,Adams>你确定吗
<13-2,Adams>You sure?

421
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,140
<13-2,Adams>切开之后可就修不好了
<13-2,Adams>It won't be able to heal when we're done.

422
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,950
<13-3,Henry>但你们觉得她能告诉你们我究竟怎么了
<13-3,Henry>But you think she could tell you what's wrong with me.

423
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,000
<13-4,Adams>是的
<13-4,Adams>Yes.

424
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,990
<13-4,Adams>好吧
<13-4,Adams>Okay.

425
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,670
<13-5,Chase>我们不把她推到手术室吗
<13-5,Chase>Should we take her to the procedure room?

426
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,790
<13-6,Adams>她不是人  所以我们在哪里手术都行
<13-6,Adams>It's not a her, which means we can do this anywhere.

427
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,670
<13-6,Adams>亚当斯
<13-6,Adams>Adams...

428
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,340
<13-7,Chase>有时你知道有些东西虽然不是真实的
<13-7,Chase>You can know something's not real

429
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,870
<13-7,Chase>但你仍然爱它
<13-7,Chase>and still love it.

430
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,450
<13-8,Adams>去手术室进行也许更好一点
<13-8,Adams>I think the procedure room might be better for this.

431
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,180
<14-1,Wilson>你真的太坏了
<14-1,Wilson>You are a horrible person.

432
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,230
<14-2,House>我只想要破坏一次婚姻
<14-2,House>All I need is to break up one marriage.

433
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,690
<14-2,House>你都已经毁了三次你自己的婚姻了
<14-2,House>You've broken up three of your own.

434
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,820
<14-2,House>你就像离婚界的斯蒂芬·霍金
<14-2,House>You're like the Stephen Hawking of killing relationships.

435
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,690
<14-2,House>不  实际上他算是...
<14-2,House>Actually, no, Stephen Hawking is the Stephen Hawking of--

436
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,770
<14-3,Wilson>行了  我有事要做
<14-3,Wilson>Okay. I have work to do.

437
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,500
<14-4,House>你电脑没开
<14-4,House>Your computer is off.

438
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,650
<14-5,Wilson>对不起  音响太大声  听不见你讲话
<14-5,Wilson>Sorry, I can't hear you over my "Stereo."

439
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,380
<14-6,House>你凭什么认为婚姻比招妓好
<14-6,House>Why do you assume that marriage is better than hooking?

440
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,330
<14-6,House>我们对他完全不了解
<14-6,House>We don't know anything about the guy.

441
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,650
<14-6,House>可能是个连环杀手呢
<14-6,House>He could be a serial killer.

442
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,100
<14-7,Wilson>即使真有这事
<14-7,Wilson>Even if that were true,

443
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,340
<14-7,Wilson>这两者的优劣还有待商讨
<14-7,Wilson>it would still be a toss-up.

444
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,260
<14-7,Wilson>什么人会愿意娶一个妓女
<14-7,Wilson>What kind of guy marries a hooker?

445
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,240
<14-7,Wilson>招妓的人
<14-7,Wilson>Somebody who hires hookers.

446
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,410
<14-8,Wilson>但招妓的人
<14-8,Wilson>And someone who hires hookers

447
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,920
<14-8,Wilson>不是那种专一的类型
<14-8,Wilson>is not exactly the monogamous type.

448
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,040
<14-8,Wilson>如果我们揭露他的本性
<14-8,Wilson>If we expose him as a cheater...

449
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,240
<14-8,Wilson>你是个胆小鬼
<14-8,Wilson>You're a coward.

450
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,480
<14-8,Wilson>你见过哪个胆小鬼奋战到底挽救少女
<14-8,Wilson>Would a coward fight to the end

451
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,030
<14-8,Wilson>于即将被证实的痛苦绝望之境吗
<14-8,Wilson>to save a damsel in soon-to-be-proved distress?

452
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,310
<14-9,Wilson>当然  如果他怕的是其他的少女的话
<14-9,Wilson>Absolutely, if what he's afraid of is other damsels.

453
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,900
<14-9,Wilson>你上一次的恋情结局太惨
<14-9,Wilson>Your last relationship failed so miserably,

454
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,080
<14-9,Wilson>你进了监狱
<14-9,Wilson>you ended up in jail.

455
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,930
<14-9,Wilson>所以现在你把妓女当做寄托
<14-9,Wilson>Now you're clinging to this hooker

456
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,440
<14-9,Wilson>虽然还有大约30亿的
<14-9,Wilson>when there are about 3 billion other women out there

457
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,010
<14-9,Wilson>非妓女在这世上
<14-9,Wilson>who aren't call girls,

458
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,930
<14-9,Wilson>其中不乏迷人聪颖的
<14-9,Wilson>some of whom are attractive and intelligent,

459
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,470
<14-9,Wilson>其中一个还住在你的公寓里
<14-9,Wilson>one of whom is living in your apartment

460
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,520
<14-9,Wilson>还和你结婚了
<14-9,Wilson>and is married to you!

461
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,560
<14-9,Wilson>你说得对
<14-9,Wilson>You're right.

462
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,920
<14-9,Wilson>我来找你帮什么忙
<14-9,Wilson>Why am I asking you for help?

463
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,740
<15-1,Park>你不该和奇斯上床
<15-1,Park>You shouldn't sleep with Chase.

464
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,680
<15-2,Adams>谢天谢地  你来得真及时
<15-2,Adams>Thank, god. You got here just in time.

465
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,480
<15-2,Adams>你反感他什么
<15-2,Adams>What do you have against him?

466
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,800
<15-3,Park>没什么  只是豪斯对洗脑有一手
<15-3,Park>Nothing, but House has a way of getting into people's heads.

467
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,820
<15-4,Adams>就像上周
<15-4,Adams>Just like last week

468
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,570
<15-4,Adams>他刺探你和奇斯之间那样
<15-4,Adams>when he was prying into your relationship with Chase?

469
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,080
<15-4,Adams>那是件蠢事  现在也是
<15-4,Adams>It was silly then, and it's silly now.

470
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,180
<15-5,Park>为什么说那是件蠢事
<15-5,Park>Why was it silly then?

471
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,630
<15-5,Park>我没有高挑的身材  卷卷的长发
<15-5,Park>I'm not 5'9" With curves and flowing hair,

472
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,930
<15-5,Park>所以我就不可能
<15-5,Park>so it's impossible for me to get it on

473
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,270
<15-5,Park>和帅哥在一起吗
<15-5,Park>with a good-looking guy?

474
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,600
<15-6,Adams>你在怨我吗
<15-6,Adams>Wow. Do you resent me?

475
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,580
<15-6,Adams>就好像你是奇怪的努力学习的大二学生
<15-6,Adams>You're the quirky, hardworking sophomore

476
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,380
<15-6,Adams>而我是专偷男生的邪恶啦啦队长一样
<15-6,Adams>and I'm the evil cheerleader who steals boys?

477
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,240
<15-6,Adams>你没男朋友可不是我的错
<15-6,Adams>If you're not getting any, it's not my fault.

478
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,010
<16-1,Taub>我们应该买上面有熊猫的还是有鸟的呢
<16-1,Taub>Should we get the one with the panda on it or the bird?

479
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,980
<16-1,Taub>选的好
<16-1,Taub>Good choice.

480
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,720
<16-1,Taub>熊猫只吃竹子
<16-1,Taub>Pandas eat only bamboo,

481
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,920
<16-1,Taub>他们不懂麦片
<16-1,Taub>they know nothing about cereal.

482
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,950
<16-2,Woman>你的小女儿太可爱了
<16-2,Woman>Your little girl is adorable.

483
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,680
<16-2,Woman>谢谢
<16-2,Woman>Thanks.

484
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,300
<16-3,Taub>她让我忙坏了
<16-3,Taub>She keeps me very busy.

485
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,900
<16-4,Woman>你和她母亲一定很自豪
<16-4,Woman>You and her mom must be very proud.

486
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,280
<16-5,Taub>她母亲...分娩时去世了
<16-5,Taub>Her mother... died in childbirth.

495
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,910
<16-5,Taub>艾米
<16-5,Taub>Amy.

496
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,130
<16-6,Adams>情况怎么样
<16-6,Adams>How'd it go?

497
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,490
<16-6,Adams>我们正在进行组织培养
<16-6,Adams>We're growing cultures now,

498
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,690
<16-6,Adams>不过她看上去很干净  也没有明显的味道
<16-6,Adams>but she looked clean, and there was no telltale smell.

499
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,560
<16-6,Adams>我猜那肿块只是成型时
<16-6,Adams>I'm guessing the lump was just an air bubble

500
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,470
<16-6,Adams>困在里面的气泡
<16-6,Adams>that got trapped in the mold.

501
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,830
<16-7,Henry>你还给她上了绷带
<16-7,Henry>You bandaged her up.

502
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,880
<16-8,Adams>我还给她缝了几针
<16-8,Adams>I threw in some stitches, too.

503
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,400
<16-8,Adams>只是希望她看起来最好
<16-8,Adams>Just wanted to make her look her best.

504
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,720
<16-8,Adams>需要我把她放在椅子上吗
<16-8,Adams>Do you want me to put her in her chair?

505
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,540
<16-8,Adams>亨利
<16-8,Adams>Henry?

506
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,900
<16-8,Adams>叫急救
<16-8,Adams>Call a code!

507
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,290
<17-1,House>你是在看人家的房间
<17-1,House>You looking at the apartment with those

508
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,640
<17-1,House>还是在看温度计的变化
<17-1,House>or the transit of mercury?

509
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,670
<17-2,Dominika>到了晚上你会感谢我的
<17-2,Dominika>If night comes, you'll be thanking me.

510
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,540
<17-2,Dominika>他们正在找暖气
<17-2,Dominika>They're seeking heat.

511
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,160
<17-3,House>他是名会计
<17-3,House>He's an accountant.

512
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,970
<17-3,House>你觉得他多晚才会去参加派对
<17-3,House>How late do you think he's going to party?

513
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,460
<17-4,Dominika>我买了罐子来撒尿
<17-4,Dominika>I bought jar to pee in.

514
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:05,980
<17-5,House>说吧
<17-5,House>Yeah.

515
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,260
<17-6,Adams>我们在亨利的肺里听到湿罗音
<17-6,Adams>We heard crackles in Henry's lungs.

516
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,380
<17-6,Adams>我们给他用了利尿药  但他仍然需要氧气
<17-6,Adams>We diuresed him, but he still needs oxygen.

517
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,140
<17-7,Chase>超声心电图显示心功能正常
<17-7,Chase>Echo shows normal heart function.

518
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,240
<17-7,Chase>可能是贫血导致的高输出衰竭
<17-7,Chase>Could be high output failure from anemia.

519
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,520
<17-8,Taub>红细胞压积没有任何问题
<17-8,Taub>Hematocrit was rock normal.

520
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,720
<17-8,Taub>这是什么  蘑菇吗
<17-8,Taub>What is this? Mushroom?

521
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,910
<17-9,Dominika>说蘑菇  两块
<17-9,Dominika>Say "Mushroom," charge $2.

522
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,920
<17-9,Dominika>说松露  五块
<17-9,Dominika>Say "Truffle," charge $5.

523
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,700
<17-9,Dominika>那就是那个想娶个妓女的男人吗
<17-9,Dominika>Is that the man who wants to marry hooker?

524
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,020
<17-10,House>可能吧
<17-10,House>Probably.

525
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,900
<17-10,House>但他不是我们要跟踪的对象
<17-10,House>But he's not the one we're after.

526
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,440
<17-11,Park>我们该提问吗
<17-11,Park>Should we ask?

527
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,870
<17-12,Chase>不
<17-12,Chase>Nope.

528
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,050
<17-13,House>让你们等着实在是太无理了
<17-13,House>How rude of me not to situate you.

529
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,690
<17-13,House>我正在帮艾米丽的忙
<17-13,House>I'm doing Emily a favor.

530
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,820
<17-13,House>我们正在跟踪她的未婚夫
<17-13,House>We're going to track her fiance

531
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,250
<17-13,House>直到多米尼卡能成功引诱并让他暴露
<17-13,House>until Dominika can seduce and expose him

<17-13,House>我需要的他骗子的本性
<17-13,House>as the lying cheater I need him to be.

533
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,530
<17-14,Taub>我估计她并没让你帮这个忙
<17-14,Taub>I'm guessing she didn't ask for this favor.

536
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,050
<17-16,Adams>湿罗音是非特异性的
<17-16,Adams>Crackles are nonspecific.

537
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,860
<17-16,Adams>组织缺氧和出血可能是弥漫性血管内凝血
<17-16,Adams>Hypoxia plus bleeding could indicate D.I.C.

538
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,390
<17-16,Adams>或其它
<17-16,Adams>Or some other--

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,010
<17-17,House>没有神经系统症状吗
<17-17,House>No neurological symptoms?

540
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,580
<17-17,House>我知道你那颗流血的心让你内心复苏了
<17-17,House>I knew your bleeding heart would bring you around.

541
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,680
<17-17,House>很遗憾也使你失去了市场
<17-17,House>Too bad it's also taking you off the market.

542
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,270
<17-17,House>我说的市场指的是奇斯
<17-17,House>And by market, I mean Chase.

<17-17,House>快点  加把劲  奇斯
<17-17,House>Come on, buck up, Chase.

<17-17,House>There's always Park. Unless...

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,740
<17-17,House>乐队的训练进行的如何
<17-17,House>How did band practice go?

546
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,600
<17-19,House>-很好  -她看上去像是在撒谎吗
<17-19,House>- Great. - Does she look like she's lying?

547
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,410
<17-20,Adams>有点
<17-20,Adams>Kind of.

<17-21,Park>姥姥需要人陪去看医生
<17-21,Park>Popo needed a ride to the doctor,

549
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,750
<17-21,Park>我妈没空所以...
<17-21,Park>and my mom couldn't, so--

550
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,000
<17-22,House>你害怕和某人约会因为...
<17-22,House>You're terrified of dating because...

551
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,240
<17-22,House>你上一段感情之所以结束是因为
<17-22,House>a previous relationship ended because your latent rage

552
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,200
<17-22,House>你隐藏的愤怒使你在争吵中变得十分恶毒
<17-22,House>made you vicious in arguments.

553
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,790
<17-23,Taub>-或者  -或者是因为转世
<17-23,Taub>- Or-- - Or reincarnation.

<17-23,Taub>上辈子她是安·波林
<17-23,Taub>In a past life, she was Anne Boleyn.

557
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,350
<17-24,House>陶博有足够的自信
<17-24,House>Taub feels confident enough

558
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,280
<17-24,House>把枪口转向自己
<17-24,House>to turn the spotlight on himself.

559
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,350
<17-24,House>这几乎是肯定希望我问他...
<17-24,House>It's almost as if he wants me to ask...

560
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,310
<17-24,House>她叫什么
<17-24,House>What's her name?

<17-26,House>Nice choice.

564
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,870
<17-26,House>考虑到你已经有两个家庭需要被治疗了
<17-26,House>Since you got two families to "Therapize."

565
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,600
<17-27,Taub>初次约会
<17-27,Taub>First date,

566
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,530
<17-27,Taub>我们并没把所有重要的事都讨论过来
<17-27,Taub>we didn't discuss everything important--

567
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,030
<17-28,House>这么说是一夜情了
<17-28,House>So it was just a one-night stand.

568
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,500
<17-29,Taub>你错了  我挺喜欢她的
<17-29,Taub>You're wrong. I actually like her.

<17-30,House>Mazel tov.

571
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,240
<17-30,House>一段成功感情的开始往往源于希望证明
<17-30,House>Great relationships often start with snap decisions

572
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,600
<17-30,House>我是错的这类草率的决定
<17-30,House>aimed at proving me wrong.

573
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,210
<17-31,Adams>娃娃里的气泡可能意味着硅胶降解了
<17-31,Adams>Air bubble in the doll could mean the silicone is degrading.

574
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,640
<17-31,Adams>如果他粘上了一些颗粒...
<17-31,Adams>If he hailed some particles...

575
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,220
<17-32,House>硅胶沉积
<17-32,House>Silicone deposition.

576
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,130
<17-32,House>很有可能
<17-32,House>That could work.

577
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,210
<17-32,House>给他进行血浆过滤治疗
<17-32,House>Start him on plasmapheresis.

578
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,430
<17-32,House>现在  回到亚当斯的问题
<17-32,House>Now, turning to Adams,

579
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,830
<17-32,House>我的理论分为三部分...
<17-32,House>My theory is tripartite--

580
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,760
<17-33,House>想听听我的论点吗
<17-33,House>Want to hear my thesis?

581
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,950
<17-33,House>挺有意思的
<17-33,House>It's kind of interesting.

582
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,320
<17-34,Dominika>没有男人出来
<17-34,Dominika>No man comes out.

583
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,500
<17-34,Dominika>不过3C房间有个全裸的大妈正在吃一大块奶酪
<17-34,Dominika>But old naked lady in 3-C is eating whole block of cheese.

584
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,260
<18-1,Henry>这会疼吗
<18-1,Henry>Will this hurt?

585
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,700
<18-2,Adams>不  不过你可能会觉得有点凉
<18-2,Adams>No, you might feel a little cold, though.

586
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,400
<18-2,Adams>该死
<18-2,Adams>Crap.

587
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,540
<18-2,Adams>我只有一点时间
<18-2,Adams>I only have a second,

588
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,500
<18-3,Henry>不过我刚去听了个时间旅行的讲座
<18-3,Henry>but I went to the time travel lecture.

589
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,550
<18-3,Henry>那真是...太棒了
<18-3,Henry>That is...awesome.

590
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,530
<18-3,Henry>这是什么
<18-3,Henry>What is it?

591
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,360
<18-3,Henry>这太...
<18-3,Henry>It's so...

592
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,860
<18-4,Henry>跟真的似的
<18-4,Henry>Oh, realistic.

593
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,020
<18-4,Henry>还绑了绷带
<18-4,Henry>Oh, and it's all bandaged up.

594
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,180
<18-4,Henry>这是用来练习心肺复苏的吗
<18-4,Henry>It is one of those CPR things?

595
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,050
<18-4,Henry>不
<18-4,Henry>No.

596
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,890
<18-5,Henry>我们要开始进行一些治疗
<18-5,Henry>We're starting a procedure.

597
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,260
<18-5,Henry>-需要一点私人空间  -不不...
<18-5,Henry>- A little privacy-- - No, no, it's--

598
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,560
<18-5,Henry>她在这挺好
<18-5,Henry>it's good that she's here.

599
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,080
<18-5,Henry>莫莉
<18-5,Henry>Molly,

600
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,380
<18-5,Henry>见过艾米
<18-5,Henry>I'd like you to meet Amy.

601
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,230
<18-5,Henry>什么
<18-5,Henry>What?

602
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,240
<18-6,Henry>我是认真的
<18-6,Henry>I'm serious.

603
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,100
<18-6,Henry>我知道这看上去有点奇怪
<18-6,Henry>I know it seems a little strange,

604
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,180
<18-6,Henry>但她对我很重要
<18-6,Henry>but she means a lot to me.

605
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,140
<18-6,Henry>我得回去工作了
<18-6,Henry>I, um, got to get back to work.

606
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,100
<18-7,Henry>但你才刚来  坐会儿
<18-7,Henry>But you just got here. Sit down.

607

<18-8,Molly>是啊  但我...
<18-8,Molly>Yeah, but I--

608
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,610
<18-8,Molly>我说过我只有一点时间
<18-8,Molly>I said that I only had a second.

609
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,140
<18-8,Molly>你可以看看讲义
<18-8,Molly>Enjoy the handouts.

610
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,060
<19-1,Taub>听着  我得坦白一些事情
<19-1,Taub>Listen, um, I have to admit something.

611
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,720
<19-2,Wendy>好吧
<19-2,Wendy>Okay.

612
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,450
<19-3,Taub>她妈妈还活着
<19-3,Taub>Her mom isn't dead.

613
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,540
<19-3,Taub>我们分手了
<19-3,Taub>We're separated.

614
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,300
<23-1,Adams>你是自那以后我约的第一个人
<23-1,Adams>You're the first person I've asked out since then.

615
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,840
<23-2,Henry>我不知道该怎么解释  当时口不择言
<23-2,Henry>I'm not used to explaining... I panicked.

616
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,530
<23-3,Adams>我现在后悔了  因为认识你以后
<23-3,Adams>Which I regret, because now that I've gotten to know you,

617
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,100
<23-4,Henry>我挺喜欢你的
<23-4,Henry>I like you.

618
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,720
<23-5,Adams>真不该乱扯谎
<23-5,Adams>It was a really stupid lie.

619
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,740
<23-6,Henry>对不起
<23-6,Henry>I'm sorry.

620
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,550
<19-5,Wendy>这是另一个婴儿吗
<19-5,Wendy>Was that a different baby?

621
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,540
<18-3,Henry>不是
<18-3,Henry>No...

622
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,470
<18-4,Henry>还真是另一个婴儿啊
<18-4,Henry>That was a different baby.

623
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,460
<18-5,Henry>有你在这里陪我真好
<18-5,Henry>It's nice having you here.

624
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,480
<18-5,Henry>真希望你能过来陪我在床上待着
<18-5,Henry>I wish you could come over and get in bed with me.

625
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,200
<20-1,Amy>像这样吗
<20-1,Amy>Like this?

626
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,920
<20-2,Henry>你竟然能说话
<20-2,Henry>You're talking?

627
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,390
<20-3,Amy>我还能做很多事呢
<20-3,Amy>It's not all I can do.

628
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,250
<20-5,Amy>艾米  外面有医生
<20-5,Amy>Amy, there are doctors...

629
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,590
<20-6,Henry>我不知道怎么做好
<20-6,Henry>I don't know.

630
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,370
<20-7,Amy>把你的手放上来
<20-7,Amy>Just put your hands on me.

631
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,930
<20-7,Amy>好疼
<20-7,Amy>It hurts.

632
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,350
<20-8,Chase>推注劳拉西泮
<20-8,Chase>Pushing lorazepam.

633
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,950
<20-8,Chase>如果之前不是神经系统症状的话  现在肯定是了
<20-8,Chase>If it wasn't neurological before, it sure is now.

634
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
<20-9,Adams>右上腹部膨隆
<20-9,Adams>Right upper quadrant's distended.

635
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,990
<20-9,Adams>他会产生幻觉是因为他肝脏衰竭了
<20-9,Adams>He's hallucinating because his liver's failing.

636
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,310
<21-1,Taub>转氨酶升高证实了肝衰竭
<21-1,Taub>Elevated transaminases confirm liver failure.

637
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,450
<21-1,Taub>用不了几天他的名字就该上移植手术名单了
<21-1,Taub>We'll have to put him on the transplant list in a couple days.

638
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,010
<21-2,Adams>这显然不是硅酮  可能是血管炎
<21-2,Adams>It's clearly not the silicone. Could be vasculitis.

639
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,520
<21-3,Chase>血清学检测结果呈阴性
<21-3,Chase>Serologies were negative.

640
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,580
<21-4,House>我说  如果你想让亚当斯听见[听取意见]
<21-4,House>Yeah, if you want Adams to hear,

641
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,960
<21-4,House>就别站那么远说话[就别直接否定她]
<21-4,House>you might want to not stand so conspicuously far away.

642
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,170
<21-5,Chase>我在煮咖啡
<21-5,Chase>I'm making coffee.

643
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,610
<21-5,Chase>偶尔地  我是会跟同事约会
<21-5,Chase>And sometimes, I date co-workers.

644
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,020
<21-5,Chase>地球人都一样
<21-5,Chase>Like everyone else on the planet.

645
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,120
<21-5,Chase>肝硬化
<21-5,Chase>Hepatic fibrosis.

646
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,660
<21-6,Park>如果肝硬化破坏了他的血小板
<21-6,Park>If it damaged his platelets,

647
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,780
<21-6,Park>就能解释出血症状
<21-6,Park>it'd explain the bleeding.

648
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,650
<21-7,House>出人意料
<21-7,House>Unexpected.

649
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,390
<21-7,House>我还以为你会同意我的观点呢
<21-7,House>I actually thought you might agree with my theory.

650
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,440
<21-7,House>那就表示你什么错都没有
<21-7,House>Because that would mean nothing's your fault.

651
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,920
<21-7,House>人们因为近距离接触而发展关系
<21-7,House>You fell into relationships based on proximity.

652
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,790
<21-7,House>当然肯定长久不了
<21-7,House>Of course they failed.

653
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,190
<21-7,House>看来是我错了
<21-7,House>But I guess I was wrong.

654
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,440
<21-7,House>你选对了人  却搞砸了
<21-7,House>You picked perfect women. You just screwed it up.

655
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,760
<21-8,Adams>我们五个人住一起
<21-8,Adams>How about all five of us live together

656
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,610
<21-8,Adams>外加一个7000美元的充气娃娃  怎样
<21-8,Adams>and the $7,000 sex doll?

657
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,710
<21-8,Adams>所有的包袱一概解决了
<21-8,Adams>It'll solve all our hang-ups.

658
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,600
<21-9,Taub>7000美元
<21-9,Taub>$7,000?

659
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,640
<21-10,House>亚当斯建议我们一起睡
<21-10,House>Adams suggests that we all sleep together,

660
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,490
<21-10,House>你却在乎娃娃的价格
<21-10,House>and your issue is high prices?

661
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,540
<21-11,Taub>我确信她那是玩笑话
<21-11,Taub>Pretty sure she was joking.

662
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,840
<21-12,House>我也几乎相信你说得没错
<21-12,House>Yes, I'm 99% sure that you're right,

663
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,300
<21-12,House>但我不会原谅自己
<21-12,House>but I would never forgive myself--

664
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,100
<21-13,Taub>那娃娃售价5000
<21-13,Taub>Those dolls are only $5,000.

665
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,690
<21-13,Taub>他肯定是依个人喜好定制的
<21-13,Taub>He must have had it customized somehow.

666
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,240
<21-13,Taub>别一副你们没上网看过的样子
<21-13,Taub>Oh, like, you didn't check the website?

667
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,780
<21-14,House>看来我们不必多嘴问你约会如何了
<21-14,House>I guess we don't need to ask how your dating life is going.

668
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,910
<21-15,Taub>好奇而已
<21-15,Taub>I was curious.

669
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,160
<21-16,Adams>肝硬化不会导致呼吸困难
<21-16,Adams>Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't cause difficulty breathing.

670
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,130
<21-17,Chase>如果肝衰竭导致了肺部动静脉分流的话就有可能
<21-17,Chase>It would if liver failure opened pulmonary av shunts.

671
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,640
<21-18,House>肝硬化符合病症  给病人用类固醇
<21-18,House>Fibrosis fits. Start the patient on steroids

672
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,950
<21-18,House>弄清楚他是怎么定制他的坐骑的
<21-18,House>and find out how he pimped his ride.

673
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,590
<21-19,Taub>为什么
<21-19,Taub>Why?

674
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,010
<21-20,House>好奇而已嘛
<21-20,House>Because I don't know the answer.

675
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,610
<21-21,Wilson>玩桌上足球吗
<21-21,Wilson>Foosball?

676
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,150
<21-22,House>没空  有婚姻要破坏
<21-22,House>Can't. Marriage to destroy.

677
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,450
<21-23,Wilson>好的吧
<21-23,Wilson>Okay...

678
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,230
<21-24,House>欲擒故纵逆反心理的"好吧"
<21-24,House>"Okay" as in passive-aggressive reverse psychology?

679
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,520
<21-24,House>还是逆来顺受的"好吧"
<21-24,House>Or as in depressed resignation

680
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,480
<21-25,Wilson>我改变主意的意思
<21-25,Wilson>"Okay" as in I changed my mind.

681
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,940
<21-26,House>也就是
<21-26,House>Expand.

682
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,970
<21-27,Wilson>破坏他人幸福应受道义谴责且注定失败
<21-27,Wilson>Oh, it's morally reprehensible and bound to fail,

683
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,320
<21-27,Wilson>但怎么说起来  你都是向前迈了一步
<21-27,Wilson>but in a weird way, it's a step forward.

684
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,110
<21-27,Wilson>就艾米丽的事情而言
<21-27,Wilson>This thing with Emily.

685
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,040
<21-28,House>也就是说
<21-28,House>Contract.

686
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,000
<21-29,Wilson>虚假才是真实
<21-29,Wilson>It's real without being real.

687
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,660
<21-29,Wilson>这样的长久关系伤不到你
<21-29,Wilson>It's a long-term relationship that can't actually hurt you.

688
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,160
<21-29,Wilson>这是  一块踏脚石
<21-29,Wilson>It's, um...A stepping stone.

689
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,590
<21-29,Wilson>说明你想要更多
<21-29,Wilson>It means you want more.

690
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,550
<21-30,House>看来是欲擒故纵逆反心理
<21-30,House>So, passive-aggressive reverse psychology.

691
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,370
<21-30,House>懂了
<21-30,House>Got it.

692
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,370
<22-1,House>别太直白了
<22-1,House>Try not to come on too strong, okay?

693
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,680
<22-1,House>稍微打探一下  顺势切入主题
<22-1,House>Just get to know him a little. Ease into it.

694
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,990
<22-2,Domonika>我为什么要慢慢来
<22-2,Domonika>Why would I ease?

695
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:27,920
<22-2,Domonika>也对
<22-2,Domonika>True.

696
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,740
<22-3,House>你可以大步流星走过去直接海底捞月
<22-3,House>You could just walk up and stick your hand down his pants,

697
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,510
<22-3,House>但好像漏掉了些步骤
<22-3,House>but I heard there's a middle step.

698
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,340
<22-4,Dominika>男人都想做爱
<22-4,Dominika>Men want to have sex.

699
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,850
<22-4,Dominika>对象不能是怪人
<22-4,Dominika>Not with crazy people.

700
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,370
<22-5,Dominika>好吧  很多男人会跟怪人做
<22-5,Dominika>Well, yes, a lot with crazy people,

701
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,830
<22-5,Dominika>但不是疯子
<22-5,Dominika>but not that kind of crazy.

702
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,030
<22-6,Harris>好吧  也是有选疯子的
<22-6,Harris>Well, yeah, that kind of crazy--

703
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,990
<22-6,Harris>有我这般姿色的他们才不在乎是不是疯子呢
<22-6,Harris>They don't care how crazy if she look like me.

704
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,080
<22-7,Dominika>好了  放轻松
<22-7,Dominika>Okay. Easing.

705
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,750
<22-7,Dominika>我叫詹妮弗  市场部新来的
<22-7,Dominika>I'm Jennifer, new to marketing department.

<22-8,Harris>Harris. Accounts receivable.

707
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,830
<22-9,Dominika>有意思
<22-9,Dominika>Oh, interesting.

708
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,360
<22-9,Dominika>想到别处去做爱吗
<22-9,Dominika>Do you want to get out of here and have sex?

709
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,450
<22-10,Harris>好啊
<22-10,Harris>Uh, sure.

710
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,540
<22-10,Harris>我午餐时间还剩45分钟
<22-10,Harris>You know, I got 45 minutes left on my lunch break.

711
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,140
<22-12,Harris>-好的  -你想去哪里
<22-12,Harris>- Mm-hmm. - Where you wanna go?

712
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,100
<22-15,Harris>去一个男人不会背叛自己爱妻的地方
<22-15,Harris>Off to a place where men don't cheat on the women they love.

713
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,780
<22-16,House>你明显是去不成了
<22-16,House>You're not invited, obviously.

714
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,670
<22-13,Harris>背叛  你说什么呢
<22-13,Harris>Cheating? What are you talking about?

715
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,570
<22-14,House>我希望你现在说的话
<22-14,House>Why, I hope you're speaking

716
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,060
<22-14,House>是出于深层次的道德相对主义  因为
<22-14,House>out of some deep kind of moral relativism because--

717
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,190
<22-15,Harris>你们是什么人啊
<22-15,Harris>Who are you people?

718
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,880
<22-16,House>你不是艾米丽的未婚夫
<22-16,House>You're not Emily's fiance.

719
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,110
<22-17,Harris>艾米丽是我妹妹
<22-17,Harris>Emily's my sister.

720
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,890
<23-1,Adams>我们联系了艾米的制造商
<23-1,Adams>We called the company that made Amy.

721
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,340
<23-1,Adams>他们说是根据你提供的照片定制的
<23-1,Adams>They said they modeled her after some photos you sent them.

722
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,770
<23-1,Adams>她是谁
<23-1,Adams>Who is she?

723

<23-2,Henry>去年圣诞节的时候认识的

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,500
<23-2,Henry>她是名瑜珈教练
<23-2,Henry>She's a yoga instructor.

725
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,610
<23-2,Henry>跟我完全不是一类人
<23-2,Henry>Totally different from me.

726
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,780
<23-2,Henry>她喜欢肖邦  讨厌印度菜
<23-2,Henry>She--she loved Chopin, hated Indian food.

727
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,460
<23-2,Henry>那17周她彻底改变了我的生活
<23-2,Henry>She changed entire my life for 17 weeks.

728
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,360
<23-3,Adams>我丈夫背叛了我
<23-3,Adams>My husband cheated on me...

729
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,120
<23-3,Adams>和从我们蜜月归来的飞机上认识的女孩
<23-3,Adams>With a girl he met on the plane coming back from our honeymoon.

730
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,730
<23-3,Adams>这种事情很难让人释怀
<23-3,Adams>It's not easy to get past things like that.

731
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,230
<23-4,Henry>不是她不忠  她没有背叛我
<23-4,Henry>She wasn't unfaithful. She didn't betray me.

732
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,630
<23-4,Henry>她根本  就不爱我
<23-4,Henry>She just...she just wasn't in love with me.

733
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,570
<23-5,Adams>我明白艾米不会伤你的心
<23-5,Adams>I know Amy's not going to break your heart.

734
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,020
<23-5,Adams>但她也不能改变你的生活
<23-5,Adams>But she's also not going to change your life.

735
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,680
<23-5,Adams>灯光好刺眼
<23-5,Adams>The lights are bright.

736
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,420
<23-6,Henry>抱歉  我这是怎么了
<23-6,Henry>Sorry. What's happening to me?

00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,460
<24-1,Emily>我没有要离开这个行业
<24-1,Emily>I'm not leaving the business.

741
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,490
<24-1,Emily>只是要  离开你
<24-1,Emily>I'm just leaving you.

742
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,650
<24-1,Emily>我不想让你伤心
<24-1,Emily>I didn't want you to feel bad.

743
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,960
<24-2,House>那我来帮你理顺这意思
<24-2,House>So let me get this straight.

744
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,150
<24-2,House>我被一个妓女给甩了
<24-2,House>I'm being dumped by a hooker...

745
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,550
<24-2,House>她还在乎我的感受
<24-2,House>Who's worried about my feelings?

746
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,490
<24-3,Emily>你已婚了
<24-3,Emily>You're married.

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,260
<24-4,House>你半数的客人都是已婚
<24-4,House>Half your clients are married.

748
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,760
<24-4,House>何况你是个妓女
<24-4,House>And you're a hooker.

749
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,460
<24-5,Emily>我的其他客人会在外面搞
<24-5,Emily>My other guys sneak around,

750
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,150
<24-5,Emily>你直接带我登堂入室
<24-5,Emily>but you'll take me into the bedroom

751
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,690
<24-5,Emily>而你老婆就在隔壁
<24-5,Emily>while your wife's in the next room.

752
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,620
<24-5,Emily>实在是  太过分了
<24-5,Emily>That's just...mean.

753
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,650
<24-7,Emily>上帝啊
<24-7,Emily>Oh, my god.

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,090
<24-8,House>这个婚姻就是个幌子
<24-8,House>The marriage, it's a sham.

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,220
<24-6,House>唯一真实的就是婚姻结束时
<24-6,House>The only really thing about it is the green card

756
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,670
<24-6,House>她要拿到的那张绿卡
<24-6,House>she's going to get at the end of it.

757
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,960
<24-6,House>所以如果你乐意重启进程...
<24-6,House>So, if you want to get the meter running...

758
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,560
<24-7,Emily>还是很过分
<24-7,Emily>It's still mean.

759
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,770
<24-8,House>这不是婚姻  这是罔顾法度
<24-8,House>It's not a marriage. It's a felony.

<24-9,Emily>我见过你们在一起时她看你的样子

765
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,420
<25-1,Adams>照这样发展下去
<25-1,Adams>At this rate, he'll be dead

766
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,150
<25-1,Adams>没等我们拿到培养结果他就死了

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,000
<25-14,Park>没错
<25-14,Park>Yes...

785

<27-3,Park>I have stuffy clothes, and I hate my hair.

<27-4,Taub>亚当斯一周花80小时帮流浪汉医腱膜
<27-4,Taub>Adams works 80 hours a week fixing bunions on hobos

838
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,160
<27-4,Taub>因为她不敢结识新面孔
<27-4,Taub>because she can't face getting to know someone new.

844
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,510
<28-3,Adams>为了气朴克  还是为了证明豪斯是错的
<28-3,Adams>To annoy Park or to prove House wrong?

845
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,610
<28-4,Adams>我...  至少...
