55
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,820
<1-10,Dugan>那是因为你总是让我做那些必须要做的
<1-10,Dugan>Because you have always let me do what's needed to be done.

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,140
<3-22,Taub>我不想夺走我们的小奇迹说话的机会
<3-22,Taub>Hate to steal the spotlight from small wonder over here,

141
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,830
<3-22,Taub>但也有可能是中毒
<3-22,Taub>but what about toxic exposure?

142
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,100
<3-23,Chase>可能是四氯乙烯
<3-23,Chase>Tetrachloroethylene.

143
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,670
<3-23,Chase>甚至是薄荷油或黄樟油
<3-23,Chase>Could even be pennyroyal or sassafras oil.

144
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,440
<3-24,House>去他家看看  找出化学品
<3-24,House>Go to his house, get me some chemicals.

145
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,300
<3-24,House>如果你想在这个团队呆下去
<3-24,House>You wanna stay on this team,

146
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,670
<3-24,House>就要发表意见
<3-24,House>have an opinion.

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,190
<4-1,Masters>酷
<4-1,Masters>Oh, cool!

148
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,200
<4-1,Masters>都铎复兴式的建筑
<4-1,Masters>Tudor revival architecture.

149
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,300
<4-1,Masters>入口上方是不对称的尖顶
<4-1,Masters>Steeply pitched, asymmetrical roof over the entrance.

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,700
<4-1,Masters>但是外墙并没有用半木质机构
<4-1,Masters>But it doesn't have the half timbering over the facade.

151
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,020
<4-2,Taub>一点医学有关的都没说
<4-2,Taub>Doesn't say anything about medicine,

152
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,160
<4-2,Taub>说起建筑倒是滔滔不绝  很好
<4-2,Taub>can't shut up about architecture. Great.

153
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,000
<4-3,Masters>我明白  我不知道为什么
<4-3,Masters>I know. I don't know what happened.

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,430
<4-3,Masters>一靠近豪斯...
<4-3,Masters>Being around House...

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,950
<4-3,Masters>他就是个传说  他太有威严了
<4-3,Masters>He's such a legend, he's so intimidating.

156
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,770
<4-3,Masters>我不喜欢跟泛泛之辈混在一起
<4-3,Masters>I'm not like that around ordinary people.

157
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,990
<4-3,Masters>我不是说你们是泛泛之辈
<4-3,Masters>Uh, not that you guys are ordinary.

158
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,990
<4-3,Masters>只是他太睿智了
<4-3,Masters>It's just that he's so brilliant

159
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,840
<4-3,Masters>你们在他手下干  你们就没那么耀眼了
<4-3,Masters>and you work under him, so you're not as imposing.

160
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,040
<4-3,Masters>我该闭嘴了
<4-3,Masters>Um... I'm gonna be quiet.

161
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,720
<4-4,Taub>很明智
<4-4,Taub>Good idea.

162
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,850
<4-5,Masters>杜根没给你们钥匙吗
<4-5,Masters>Dugan didn't give you a key?

163
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,330
<4-6,Foreman>如果病人知道我们要来
<4-6,Foreman>If patients know we're coming,

164
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,210
<4-6,Foreman>他们就会有意无意地把有关疾病的
<4-6,Foreman>they can hide something relevant to their illness

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,170
<4-6,Foreman>东西藏起来
<4-6,Foreman>intentionally or unintentionally.

166
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,870
<4-6,Foreman>让他们知道会影响调查
<4-6,Foreman>Their knowledge changes things.

167
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,160
<4-7,Taub>你是吸血鬼吗
<4-7,Taub>Are you a vampire?

168
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,470
<4-7,Taub>没关系  我们邀请你进来
<4-7,Taub>It's okay. We're inviting you in.

169
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,610
<4-8,Masters>但是我们的病人不会
<4-8,Masters>But our patient didn't.

170
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,500
<4-8,Masters>我不能这样做  对不起
<4-8,Masters>I can't do this, I'm sorry.

171
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,760
<4-9,Taub>很好  她真是帮大忙了
<4-9,Taub>Well, she's gonna be a big help.

172
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,980
<4-10,Foreman>闯进陌生人的房子
<4-10,Foreman>Yeah, what a rube being uncomfortable

173
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,550
<4-10,Foreman>是件多么鲁莽的事啊
<4-10,Foreman>breaking into a stranger's house.

174
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,700
<4-11,Taub>这就是我们工作一部分
<4-11,Taub>Part of our job description,

175
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,800
<4-11,Taub>还不算是道德最模糊的部分
<4-11,Taub>not the most morally ambiguous part.

176
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,740
<4-11,Taub>给她个机会吧
<4-11,Taub>Give her a chance.

177
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,660
<4-12,Foreman>她年轻又有激情
<4-12,Foreman>She's fresh, enthusiastic,

178
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,050
<4-12,Foreman>没有不良习惯  不用纠正
<4-12,Foreman>has no bad habits we need to reteach.

179
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,290
<4-12,Foreman>她是个没有临床经验的医学生
<4-12,Foreman>She's a med student with no practical experience.

180
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,580
<4-12,Foreman>意味着每项操作  每次抽血
<4-12,Foreman>That means every procedure, every blood draw,

181
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
<4-13,Foreman>她都需要我们其中一个看着
<4-13,Foreman>she needs one of us there to supervise.

182
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,650
<4-13,Foreman>你这样看她是不是
<4-13,Foreman>Is this attitude about her

183
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,440
<4-13,Foreman>因为她还没有获得医学博士学位
<4-13,Foreman>not having an M.D. After her name?

184
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,650
<4-13,Foreman>因为我想知道她能做点什么
<4-13,Foreman>Because I wonder if it has more to do

185
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,910
<4-13,Foreman>证明她是个小超人
<4-13,Foreman>with her being a brainiac.

186
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,860
<4-14,Taub>根本不是那么回事
<4-14,Taub>That's not it at all.

187
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,010
<4-15,Foreman>谁是最聪明的人
<4-15,Foreman>I'm not thrilled someone else

188
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,740
<4-15,Foreman>我一点也不感冒
<4-15,Foreman>might be the smartest person on the team now.

189
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,930
<4-15,Foreman>我能体会你的感受
<4-15,Foreman>I can only imagine how you feel.

190
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,380
<4-15,Foreman>你不比我聪明
<4-15,Foreman>You're not smarter than me.

191
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,130
<4-16,Foreman>是吗  你找到这个了吗
<4-16,Foreman>Oh, yeah? You find this?

192
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,410
<5-1,Foreman>一壶未经高温灭菌的苹果汁
<5-1,Foreman>A jug of unpasteurized cider.

193
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,830
<5-1,Foreman>可能沾染了大肠杆菌
<5-1,Foreman>It could be tainted with E coli,

194
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,830
<5-1,Foreman>大肠杆菌会引起肝脏损害
<5-1,Foreman>and that's what's causing the liver to shut down.

195
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,600
<5-2,House>大肠杆菌只在动物中传播
<5-2,House>E coli is found in animals.

196
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,710
<5-2,House>除非他喝了猪肉苹果汁...
<5-2,House>So unless he's drinking pork cider...

197
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,750
<5-2,House>猪肉苹果汁
<5-2,House>Pork cider!

198
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,200
<5-2,House>我需要专利局的电话
<5-2,House>I need the number of the patent office.

199
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,340
<5-3,Foreman>大肠杆菌可以通过间接方式感染
<5-3,Foreman>There are indirect ways of attracting E coli.

200
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,440
<5-4,Taub>马斯特斯拒绝和我们入室搜寻
<5-4,Taub>Masters refused to go on the search with us.

201
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,090
<5-5,House>有意思  谁挑起的这个问题
<5-5,House>Interesting. Which raises the question,

202
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,820
<5-5,House>你和她之间怎么了
<5-5,House>what is your problem with her?

203
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,170
<5-6,Foreman>他被她的高智商给吓着了
<5-6,Foreman>He is intimidated by her intelligence.

204
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,630
<5-7,House>这有什么好让陶博烦恼的
<5-7,House>Why would that bother Taub?

205
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,860
<5-7,House>他已经和比他更聪明的人
<5-7,House>He's been working with people smarter

206
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,380
<5-7,House>一起工作很久了
<5-7,House>than him for a long time.

207
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,060
<5-7,House>我觉得是一个神气的小女孩
<5-7,House>I think perky new girl

208
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,270
<5-7,House>让他觉得自己老了
<5-7,House>makes him feel old.

209
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,200
<5-8,Taub>她基本上和13岁的小女孩没差
<5-8,Taub>She's basically the same age as thirteen.

210
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,660
<5-9,House>是的  但她是个医学院学生
<5-9,House>Yeah, but she's a student.

211
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,660
<5-9,House>让你回想起你自己的学生生涯
<5-9,House>Makes you contemplate your med school days.

212
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,470
<5-9,House>那时你还没谢顶  肌肉发达
<5-9,House>Back when you had hair, muscle tone,

213
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,570
<5-9,House>也不需要定期做前列腺检查
<5-9,House>and no need for a regular prostate exam.

214
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,950
<5-9,House>有道理
<5-9,House>Makes sense.

215
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,240
<5-10,Foreman>就像大肠杆菌
<5-10,Foreman>Just like E coli.

216
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,870
<5-10,Foreman>果园将卖不出去的苹果
<5-10,Foreman>Orchards make cider out of apples

217
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,980
<5-10,Foreman>榨成汁
<5-10,Foreman>they can't sell otherwise,

218
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,990
<5-10,Foreman>比如那些掉到地上  摔坏了的
<5-10,Foreman>like if they've fallen onto the ground.

219
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,530
<5-10,Foreman>或是掉进牛粪里的
<5-10,Foreman>Like, into some cow feces.

220
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,700
<5-11,House>也就是说  我们受人尊敬的病人
<5-11,House>Which would mean our esteemed patient

221
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,300
<5-11,House>的确是满嘴大粪啊
<5-11,House>is literally full of B.S.

222
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,970
<5-11,House>酷  带上那个天真少女
<5-11,House>Cool. Go get the ingenue,

223
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,570
<5-11,House>给病人用噻肟单酰胺菌素并做血浆置换
<5-11,House>start the patient on Aztreonam and plasmapheresis.

224
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,420
<5-11,House>他说要给病人用噻肟...
<5-11,House>He said to start the patient on Aztre...

225
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,290
<6-1,Taub>细胞分选仪将血浆
<6-1,Taub>The cell sorter separates the plasma

226
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,900
<6-1,Taub>和血细胞分离开
<6-1,Taub>from the remaining cellular components,

227
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,970
<6-1,Taub>这样可以排除...
<6-1,Taub>thereby removing...

228
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,680
<6-1,Taub>毒素  抗体  冷凝球蛋白
<6-1,Taub>The toxins, antibodies, cryoglobulins.

229
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,980
<6-2,Taub>我觉得我们应该告诉病人
<6-2,Taub>I think we should tell our patient

230
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,600
<6-2,Taub>我们闯入过他家
<6-2,Taub>about breaking into his house.

231
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,660
<6-2,Taub>为什么
<6-2,Taub>Why would we do that?

232
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,030
<6-3,Masters>因为不告诉他的原因是
<6-3,Masters>Because the reason not to tell him

233
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,070
<6-3,Masters>怕他隐藏些什么东西
<6-3,Masters>was that he might hide something.

234
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,660
<6-3,Masters>而现在这个理论已经没用了
<6-3,Masters>And now that rationale is moot.

235
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,900
<6-3,Masters>现在的理论
<6-3,Masters>The rationale now

236
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,490
<6-3,Masters>是没有好处  只有坏处
<6-3,Masters>is no upside, big downside.

237
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,760
<6-4,Masters>我们怎么能让病人相信我们
<6-4,Masters>How can we ask our patients to trust us

238
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,010
<6-4,Masters>如果我们对他们不诚实?
<6-4,Masters>if we're not honest with them?

239
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,460
<6-5,Taub>我们怎么能在告诉他不能相信我们之后
<6-5,Taub>How can we ask the patient to trust us

240
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,810
<6-5,Taub>重建他对我们的信任
<6-5,Taub>after we tell him he can't trust us?

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,140
<6-5,Taub>好吧  去告诉他
<6-5,Taub>Fine. Tell him.

242
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,500
<6-5,Taub>让你的良心好受点
<6-5,Taub>Clear your conscience,

243
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,840
<6-5,Taub>因为那很重要
<6-5,Taub>because that's what's important.

244
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
<8-11,Foreman>如果你让我把那条广告播出去的话
<8-11,Foreman>Well, if you would let me run that AD,

245
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,740
<8-12,Chase>人们会转移目标去讨论移民问题
<8-12,Chase>everybody would be talking about immigration instead.

246
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,510
<8-13,House>没错  这就是我们要谈的
<8-13,House>All right, look, here's what we're gonna say.

247
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,400
<8-14,Foreman>没错  他去过伊拉克
<8-14,Foreman>Yeah, he was in Iraq,

248
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,420
<8-15,House>我们都为他的奉献感激不已
<8-15,House>and we're all grateful for his sacrifice.

249
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,670
<8-15,House>而你选择投身公共事业为国家贡献力量
<8-15,House>You chose to honor your country through public service

250
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,160
<8-15,House>而且投过46次票  建议扩大五角大楼的
<8-15,House>and have voted 46 times to expand the pentagon's budget

251
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,110
<8-15,House>工程预算  而莫尔诺则持相反意见
<8-15,House>for programs which, oh, by the way, Moreno wants to cut.

252
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,960
<8-15,House>好的  我起草个文件发给你
<8-15,House>All right. I'll draft it up, send it over.

253
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,290
<8-15,House>在你出院前
<8-15,House>You should probably slow down

254
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,150
<7-1,Masters>你应该放慢工作
<7-1,Masters>until you're out of the hospital.

255
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,610
<7-1,Masters>这周很忙
<7-1,Masters>It's a busy week.

256
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,290
<7-2,Masters>你不好奇我们是怎么做出这个诊断结果的吗
<7-2,Masters>Aren't you curious how we came up with this diagnosis?

257
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,960
<7-3,Dugan>你们是医生  你们的职责不是如此吗
<7-3,Dugan>You're doctors. Isn't that your job?

258
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,100
<7-4,Masters>但我们怎么知道你喝过苹果汁呢
<7-4,Masters>But how we knew you were drinking apple cider?

259
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,880
<7-5,Dugan>你们从我家里找到的
<7-5,Dugan>Well, you had to have found that at my house,

260
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,450
<7-5,Dugan>所以我猜你们闯入过我家了
<7-5,Dugan>so I guess you guys broke in there.

261
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,820
<7-5,Dugan>你没有因此不安吗
<7-5,Dugan>That doesn't bother you?

262
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,100
<7-6,Dugan>医学就像政治
<7-6,Dugan>Medicine's like politics.

263
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,320
<7-6,Dugan>最终要的是结果
<7-6,Dugan>At the end of the day, all that matters is results.

264
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,540
<7-7,Masters>不对
<7-7,Masters>That's not true.

265
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,910
<7-7,Masters>还应该有尊重
<7-7,Masters>Respect matters.

266
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,440
<7-7,Masters>诚实
<7-7,Masters>Honesty

267
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,910
<7-7,Masters>和廉正
<7-7,Masters>and integrity matter.

268
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,520
<7-8,Dugan>你想过从政吗
<7-8,Dugan>Have you ever thought about running for public office?

269
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,100
<7-8,Dugan>因为我太喜欢有你
<7-8,Dugan>Because I would love to have someone like you

270
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,410
<7-8,Dugan>这样的对手了
<7-8,Dugan>as an opponent.

271
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,820
<7-8,Dugan>小心别动了输液管
<7-8,Dugan>Watch the replacement fluid line.

272
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,890
<7-9,Masters>好的  对不起
<7-9,Masters>Oh, right, sorry.

273
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,160
<7-9,Masters>你难道没好奇过为什么
<7-9,Masters>You ever wonder why American voter

274
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,070
<7-9,Masters>在发达国家里  美国选民
<7-9,Masters>turnout rates are among the lowest

275
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,490
<7-9,Masters>的投票率最低吗
<7-9,Masters>in the developed world?

276
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,720
<7-10,Taub>杜根先生
<7-10,Taub>Mr. Dugan?

277
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,970
<7-10,Taub>杜根先生
<7-10,Taub>Mr. Dugan?

278
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,200
<7-10,Taub>怎么了  能听到我说话吗
<7-10,Taub>What's wrong? Can you hear me?

279
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,200
<7-10,Taub>他麻痹了
<7-10,Taub>He's paralyzed.

280
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,910
<7-10,Taub>叫福曼和奇斯来
<7-10,Taub>Call Foreman and Chase, get them down here.

281
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,450
<7-10,Taub>杜根先生
<7-10,Taub>Mr. Dugan!

282
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,720
<8-1,Chase>我们认为是短暂缺血性休克
<8-1,Chase>We thinks it's a transient ischemic attack.

283
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,760
<8-1,Chase>可能在我们找到凝块前  凝块就消了
<8-1,Chase>The clot must have broken up before we could find it.

284
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,060
<8-1,Chase>他是临时性麻痹
<8-1,Chase>He was temporarily paralyzed,

285
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,900
<8-1,Chase>但他会恢复行动和讲话能力的
<8-1,Chase>but he's regaining mobility and speech.

286
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,540
<8-2,House>那么  是什么引起皮疹
<8-2,House>So, what causes rash,

287
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,130
<8-2,House>肝功能衰竭  凝块
<8-2,House>liver failure, clots,

288
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,070
<8-2,House>还有想逃避开同事
<8-2,House>and the uncontrollable urge

289
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,310
<8-2,House>不可遏制的欲望
<8-2,House>to rat out your coworkers?

290
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,210
<8-2,House>不  等等...
<8-2,House>Oh, no, wait...

291
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,740
<8-2,House>最后一点是说你  不是说病人
<8-2,House>That last one was you, not the patient.

292
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,100
<8-3,Masters>我没想临阵脱逃
<8-3,Masters>I wasn't trying to rat.

293
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,070
<8-3,Masters>我只想忠于我的职业道德
<8-3,Masters>I was clearly trying to honor my ethical obligation.

294
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,710
<8-3,Masters>门静脉血栓
<8-3,Masters>Portal vein thrombosis

295
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,900
<8-3,Masters>可能是威尔逊氏病引起的
<8-3,Masters>could be caused by Wilson's disease.

296
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,490
<8-4,House>终于开口了
<8-4,House>You popped your cherry,

297
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,140
<8-4,House>从诊断上讲
<8-4,House>diagnostically speaking.

298
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,420
<8-4,House>不幸的是  第一次总是很糟糕
<8-4,House>Unfortunately, the first time always sucks.

299
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,040
<8-4,House>说法一点不靠谱
<8-4,House>Pitch doesn't make any sense.

300
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,630
<8-4,House>杜根的角膜很正常
<8-4,House>Dugan's cornea was normal.

301
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,380
<8-4,House>你还真聪明
<8-4,House>You're obviously brilliant.

302
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,220
<8-4,House>那么你为什么隐藏你的想法
<8-4,House>So why would you hide your mind?

303
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,640
<8-5,Masters>我是突然想出来的
<8-5,Masters>I was brainstorming.

304
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,750
<8-6,House>我不是说对病人的白痴看法
<8-6,House>I'm not talking about your stupid ideas about the patient.

305
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,500
<8-6,House>我是说对道德的白痴看法
<8-6,House>I mean your stupid ideas about morality.

306
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,670
<8-7,Masters>我白痴的看法是大多数医生遵循的
<8-7,Masters>My stupid ideas are what most doctors consider

307
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,010
<8-7,Masters>职业道德
<8-7,Masters>the rules for professional conduct.

308
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,280
<8-7,Masters>那么神经内分泌肿瘤呢
<8-7,Masters>What about a neuroendocrine tumor?

309
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,020
<8-8,Taub>思考能力还是下降了
<8-8,Taub>Not without diminished mental capacity,

310
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,440
<8-8,Taub>判断失误
<8-8,Taub>loss of judgment.

311
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,180
<8-8,Taub>弥散性血管内凝结  还说得过去
<8-8,Taub>Disseminated intravascular coagulation, however, fits.

312
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,310
<8-9,House>规矩是给白痴们定的
<8-9,House>Rules are just helpful guidelines for stupid people

313
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,450
<8-9,House>给那些没有自主思考能力的人定的
<8-9,House>who can't make up their own mind.

314
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,970
<8-9,House>很显然  你不该是那类人
<8-9,House>You obviously don't fit into that category,

315
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,950
<8-9,House>那为什么要把自己划进去
<8-9,House>so why put yourself there?

316
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,370
<8-6,House>马斯特斯说的那个
<8-6,House>Masters is right

317
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,810
<8-7,Masters>神经内分泌肿瘤的论断没错
<8-7,Masters>about a neuroendocrine tumor.

318
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,640
<8-10,Chase>因为杜根有判断力缺失
<8-10,Chase>Because yes, Dugan has had a loss of judgment.

319
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,990
<8-10,Chase>他为安德森做了这个
<8-10,Chase>He made this totally inflammatory

320
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,510
<8-10,Chase>非常有煽动性的反移民商业广告
<8-10,Chase>anti-immigration campaign commercial for Anderson.

321
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,860
<8-10,Chase>这广告刚刚在网上发布了
<8-10,Chase>It just got linked online.

322
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,380
<8-11,Foreman>你是说杜根的政治动作
<8-11,Foreman>You're arguing Dugan's politics

323
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,920
<8-11,Foreman>是他心智缺失的信号
<8-11,Foreman>are a sign that he's mentally compromised?

324
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
<8-12,Chase>不  是他的战术
<8-12,Chase>No, his tactics.

325
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,590
<8-12,Chase>他是最有可能泄露广告的
<8-12,Chase>He's most likely the one who leaked it

326
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,160
<8-12,Chase>所有评论员都在说
<8-12,Chase>and all the commentators are saying

327
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,480
<8-12,Chase>安德森要食言了
<8-12,Chase>Anderson will catch the major backwords.

328
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,170
<8-13,House>说实话  这还真是个好主意
<8-13,House>And honesty's a great idea

329
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,090
<8-13,House>除非你们的病人问
<8-13,House>until your patient asks

330
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,300
<8-13,House>她会不会因腹部膨胀而发胖了
<8-13,House>if her distended abdomen makes her looks fat.

331
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,430
<8-14,Foreman>豪斯  我不想打断你们的伦理争论
<8-14,Foreman>House, I hate to interrupt your ethics debate,

332
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
<8-14,Foreman>但现在我们桌面上摆着两种不同意见
<8-14,Foreman>but we have two solid ideas on the table.

333
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,880
<8-15,House>给他做颈部到腹部断层扫描
<8-15,House>Ct from his neck to his abdomen

334
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,500
<8-15,House>看看有没神经内分泌肿瘤
<8-15,House>for neuroendocrine tumors.

335
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,460
<8-15,House>做二聚体和纤维蛋白扩散实验
<8-15,House>Run a d-dimer and fibrinogen for D.I.C.

336
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,060
<8-15,House>马斯特斯
<8-15,House>Masters.

337
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,820
<8-16,House>如果对病人撒谎可以救命的话
<8-16,House>If lying to a patient saved their life,

338
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,190
<8-16,House>-你会撒谎吗  -不
<8-16,House>- would you do it? - No.

339
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,830
<8-18,House>这就是一句谎话
<8-18,House>That's a lie.

340
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,440
<8-18,House>如果你奶奶送给你一个很蹩脚的茶壶套
<8-18,House>If your grandma gave you a really crappy tea cozy

341
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,180
<8-18,House>做圣诞礼物  你会跟她说你喜欢吗
<8-18,House>for Christmas, would you tell her you liked it?

342
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,570
<8-19,Masters>是的  但那不一样
<8-19,Masters>Yes, but that's different.

343
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,810
<8-20,House>所以  你在无所谓的时候可以说谎
<8-20,House>So, you lie when it doesn't matter

344
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,970
<8-20,House>但有所谓时就不会
<8-20,House>but you won't when it does.

345
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,170
<8-20,House>你怎么这么不靠谱
<8-20,House>How'd you get so screwed up?

346
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,870
<9-1,House>如果我炒了马斯特斯  你会多有生气
<9-1,House>How mad would you be if I fired Masters?

347
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,240
<9-2,Cuddy>非常  除非你有理由
<9-2,Cuddy>Very. Unless you had cause.

348
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,730
<9-2,Cuddy>真正的理由
<9-2,Cuddy>Real cause.

349
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,470
<9-2,Cuddy>是人都会考虑的理由
<9-2,Cuddy>Cause that a human being would consider cause.

350
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,970
<9-3,House>那没事了
<9-3,House>Never mind, then.

351
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,780
<9-3,House>她需要监护人
<9-3,House>She's got principals.

352
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,300
<9-3,House>她就像是爱因斯坦和玛丽·波宾丝的私生子
<9-3,House>She's like the love child of Einstein and Mary Poppins.

353
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,080
<9-3,House>但没遗传爱因斯坦的发型
<9-3,House>Didn't even get Einstein's hair.

354
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,400
<9-4,Cuddy>你的团队里还是需要有个
<9-4,Cuddy>It's worth having someone on the team

355
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,990
<9-4,Cuddy>不觉得世界满是灰色阴影的成员的
<9-4,Cuddy>who doesn't see the world entirely as shades of gray.

356
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,050
<9-5,House>-就是灰色的  -对你来说
<9-5,House>- It is gray! - To you.

357
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
<9-6,Cuddy>她有新鲜的观点
<9-6,Cuddy>She has a fresh perspective.

358
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,390
<9-7,Cuddy>除非那威胁到你了
<9-7,Cuddy>Unless that threatens you.

359
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,990
<9-8,House>没有威胁...
<9-8,House>It does not...

360
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,680
<9-8,House>你以为我是在防御
<9-8,House>You thought I'd get defensive,

361
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,430
<9-8,House>让她不要骄傲
<9-8,House>keep her out of pride.

362
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,030
<9-8,House>女孩可以有希望
<9-8,House>A girl can hope.

363
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,670
<9-8,House>豪斯  这件事我想了很久
<9-8,House>House, I gave this a lot of thought.

364
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,490
<9-8,House>她值得一试
<9-8,House>She deserves a chance.

365
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,380
<9-8,House>真正的一试
<9-8,House>A real chance.

366
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,820
<9-8,House>豪斯要炒了我
<9-8,House>House is gonna fire me.

367
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,960
<10-1,Cuddy>不  他不会的
<10-1,Cuddy>No, he isn't.

368
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,190
<10-2,Masters>因为你不让他炒我吗
<10-2,Masters>Because you told him not to?

369
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,650
<10-3,Cuddy>豪斯有很强的逆反心理
<10-3,Cuddy>Butting heads with house is par for the course.

370
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,030
<10-3,Cuddy>豪斯有强烈的信念
<10-3,Cuddy>House has strong beliefs,

371
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,890
<10-3,Cuddy>而且他尊重有强烈信念的人
<10-3,Cuddy>and he respects other people with strong beliefs.

372
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,580
<10-4,Masters>我的信念倒不是问题
<10-4,Masters>It's not my beliefs that are the problem.

373
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,970
<10-4,Masters>是我的个性
<10-4,Masters>It's my personality.

374
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,470
<10-4,Masters>我不擅长和他人交往
<10-4,Masters>I'm not good at working with other people.

375
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,380
<10-5,Cuddy>你在那还没超过一天
<10-5,Cuddy>You've been in there for less than a day.

376
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,430
<10-6,Masters>我不是来寻求鼓励的
<10-6,Masters>I wasn't looking for encouragement.

377
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,340
<10-6,Masters>是事实
<10-6,Masters>It's a fact.

378
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,860
<10-6,Masters>在成长过程中  我的一生  真的
<10-6,Masters>Growing up, my whole life, really,

379
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,320
<10-6,Masters>我一直在独处
<10-6,Masters>I-I spent a lot of time by myself.

380
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,710
<10-6,Masters>高中里没有一个人想和
<10-6,Masters>And no one in high school wants to hang out

381
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
<10-6,Masters>小自己三岁的小孩儿玩
<10-6,Masters>with a kid that's three years younger than them.

382
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,090
<10-6,Masters>而阿诺索夫微分同胚研究
<10-6,Masters>And studying Anosov diffeomorphisms,

383
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,440
<10-6,Masters>说明不论一个无属性区域
<10-6,Masters>determining whether an unattributed landscape

384
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,270
<10-6,Masters>是封闭还是开放还是...
<10-6,Masters>is a blakelock or a ryder or...

385
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,850
<10-6,Masters>我现在就正在让你厌烦
<10-6,Masters>I'm actually boring you right now.

386
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,720
<10-7,Cuddy>但是你选择的是医学
<10-7,Cuddy>And yet you chose medicine

387
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
<10-7,Cuddy>就需要团队合作
<10-7,Cuddy>which is a team activity.

388
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,710
<10-7,Cuddy>真勇敢
<10-7,Cuddy>It's pretty gutsy,

389
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,220
<10-7,Cuddy>让自己远离你的舒适地带
<10-7,Cuddy>stepping so far outside your comfort zone.

390
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,140
<10-8,Masters>我不是想证明什么
<10-8,Masters>I'm not trying to prove anything.

391
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,380
<10-8,Masters>我只是想当医生
<10-8,Masters>I just wanted to be a doctor.

392
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,390
<10-8,Masters>很愚蠢吧
<10-8,Masters>It was stupid.

393
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,770
<10-8,Masters>没人能万事通
<10-8,Masters>Nobody can do everything.

394
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,040
<10-8,Masters>我曾梦想我能够胜任
<10-8,Masters>I was vain to think I could be the exception.

395
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,500
<10-8,Masters>豪斯不会在乎你善不善长团队合作
<10-8,Masters>House doesn't care if you're a team player,

396
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,960
<10-8,Masters>或者你有多么有道德
<10-8,Masters>or how ethical you are,

397
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,830
<10-8,Masters>或者你的智商有多高
<10-8,Masters>or how high your I.Q. Is.

398
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,900
<10-8,Masters>只要能解决病例
<10-8,Masters>It's all about the cases.

399
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,990
<10-8,Masters>你帮助他解决好这个病案
<10-8,Masters>You help him crack this one,

400
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,530
<10-8,Masters>你们两人就会相处好的
<10-8,Masters>you two are gonna get along just fine.

401
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,140
<11-1,Foreman>我们该给马斯特斯一点建议
<11-1,Foreman>We gotta give masters some pointers,

402
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,580
<11-1,Foreman>帮助她对付豪斯
<11-1,Foreman>help her figure out how to deal with house.

403
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,500
<11-1,Foreman>为什么要这个
<11-1,Foreman>Why would I do that?

404
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,190
<11-2,Chase>看热闹什么的  最有意思了
<11-2,Chase>The entertainment factor is off the charts.

405
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,280
<11-2,Chase>就像是看鹬蚌相争
<11-2,Chase>It's like watching a bunny hop into a buzz saw.

406
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,280
<11-2,Chase>反复来去
<11-2,Chase>Repeatedly.

407
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,110
<11-3,Foreman>如果我们不帮她  她又得离开了
<11-3,Foreman>And if we don't help her, she's out of here.

408
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,500
<11-4,Chase>不  会有东西阻止豪斯炒掉她的
<11-4,Chase>No, something else is stopping House from firing her.

409
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,070
<11-4,Chase>我猜是他想和卡迪嘿咻的渴望
<11-4,Chase>I'm guessing it's his desire to keep having sex with cuddy.

410
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,850
<11-4,Chase>你们准备好承认自己错了吗
<11-4,Chase>You guys ready to admit you were wrong yet?

411
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,550
<11-5,Dugan>抱歉你说什么
<11-5,Dugan>Excuse me?

412
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,980
<11-5,Dugan>你们要找的肿瘤  不会找到的
<11-5,Dugan>This tumor you're looking for-- you're not gonna find it.

413
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,170
<11-5,Dugan>我的判断力很健全
<11-5,Dugan>My judgment is completely sound.

414
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,580
<11-6,Chase>那你泄露那条广告的时候
<11-6,Chase>So when you leaked that AD,

415
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,750
<11-6,Chase>你是想破坏参议员的竞选吗
<11-6,Chase>you were trying to torpedo the senator's campaign?

416
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,710
<11-7,Dugan>好吧  第一  我跟你说过
<11-7,Dugan>All right, one, I told you before,

417
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,010
<11-7,Dugan>我没泄露那广告
<11-7,Dugan>I didn't leak that spot.

418
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,470
<11-9,Dugan>第二
<11-9,Dugan>And two...

419
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,550
<11-9,Dugan>不管是谁放出的广告
<11-9,Dugan>whoever did leak that ad

420
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,960
<11-9,Dugan>脑子都没进水
<11-9,Dugan>had nothing wrong with their mind either.

421
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,410
<11-9,Dugan>它会解救安德森的
<11-9,Dugan>It's gonna save Anderson.

422
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,020
<11-10,Chase>那条商业广告...
<11-10,Chase>That commercial...

423
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,170
<11-10,Chase>每个人都看明白了
<11-10,Chase>Everyone sees through it.

424
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,910
<11-10,Chase>你只是想利用人们的恐惧
<11-10,Chase>You're just trying to play to people's fears.

425
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,230
<11-11,Dugan>你说是恐惧
<11-11,Dugan>You say fears.

426
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,170
<11-11,Dugan>我说是理性的自保本能
<11-11,Dugan>I say rational, protective instincts.

427
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,270
<11-11,Dugan>从你的口音看
<11-11,Dugan>And judging by your accent,

428
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,110
<11-11,Dugan>要求你在移民问题上不偏不倚
<11-11,Dugan>immigration probably isn't an issue

429
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,600
<11-11,Dugan>不太现实
<11-11,Dugan>you can be real impartial about.

430
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,660
<11-12,Chase>我等了五年才拿到绿卡
<11-12,Chase>I waited five years to get my green card.

431
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,190
<11-12,Chase>如果有人反对在移民手续上走捷径
<11-12,Chase>If there's anyone who would resent

432
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,370
<11-12,Chase>第一个就该是我
<11-12,Chase>someone trying to skip the queue, it'd be me.

433
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,200
<11-12,Chase>只因为莫尔诺支持特赦令...
<11-12,Chase>Just because Moreno favors amnesty...

434
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,830
<11-12,Chase>他不支持
<11-12,Chase>He doesn't.

435
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,740
<11-13,Dugan>你们看过他跟墨西哥国旗一起的那张照片吧
<11-13,Dugan>You know that picture of him with the Mexican flags

436
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,080
<11-13,Dugan>看起来像是在支持移民特赦令集会吗
<11-13,Dugan>that seems to be from a pro-amnesty rally?

437
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
<11-13,Dugan>是他在国际特赦组织发表讲演
<11-13,Dugan>That's from an Amnesty International speech

438
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,390
<11-13,Dugan>反对墨西哥瓦哈卡州关押牧师的时候拍的
<11-13,Dugan>protesting the imprisonment of priests in Oaxaca.

439
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,920
<11-13,Dugan>没错  你们刚刚证实了那则广告
<11-13,Dugan>Yes, you did just prove that that AD

440
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,670
<11-13,Dugan>比你们想象得更龌龊
<11-13,Dugan>is even more disgusting than you thought.

441
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,970
<11-13,Dugan>你们还证明了那则广告的有效性
<11-13,Dugan>You also proved that AD is effective.

442
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,260
<11-13,Dugan>你们还认为我判断失灵吗
<11-13,Dugan>You still think my judgment is off?

443
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,820
<11-14,Foreman>现在不了
<11-14,Foreman>Not anymore.

444
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,420
<11-14,Foreman>没有肿瘤的迹象
<11-14,Foreman>There's no sign of a tumor.

445
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,240
<11-14,Foreman>只剩下播散性血管内凝血
<11-14,Foreman>That leaves D.I.C.

446
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,440
<11-14,Foreman>我去看看陶博血检做得怎么样了
<11-14,Foreman>I'll go check how Taub is doing with the blood work.

447
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,610
<12-1,Foreman>我猜人一上了年纪
<12-1,Foreman>I guess when you get on in years,

448
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,020
<12-1,Foreman>连做几项最简单的血检也慢起来了
<12-1,Foreman>it takes a little longer to run a few simple blood tests.

449
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,640
<12-2,Taub>考虑到我身材比你更健壮的事实
<12-2,Taub>This whole "Taub's an old man" thing kinda rings hollow,

450
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,430
<12-2,Taub>你"陶博是个老家伙"的论调听起来有点儿假
<12-2,Taub>considering I'm in better shape than you are.

451
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,260
<12-2,Taub>染色剂递我
<12-2,Taub>Pass the dye.

452
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,300
<12-3,Foreman>你身材比我圆倒是真的
<12-3,Foreman>You're in rounder shape than me.

453
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,280
<12-3,Foreman>今晚下班之后
<12-3,Foreman>Tonight after work,

454
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,810
<12-4,Foreman>体育馆篮球场见
<12-4,Foreman>meet at the basketball courts in the gym.

455
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,570
<12-4,Foreman>你知道自己身高刚够两尺半吧
<12-4,Foreman>You do realize you're two and a half feet tall, right?

456
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,470
<12-5,Taub>而且还是白人加犹太人
<12-5,Taub>And white. And Jewish.

457
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,780
<12-5,Taub>被我赢了一定相当丢脸
<12-5,Taub>It'd be very embarrassing.

458
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,100
<12-5,Taub>我明白你为什么要拒绝
<12-5,Taub>I get why you wanna say no.

459
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,730
<12-6,Foreman>今晚下班后见
<12-6,Foreman>Tonight after work.

460
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,630
<12-7,Taub>该死
<12-7,Taub>Crap.

461
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,440
<13-1,Anderson>你有没有听莫尔诺最新的政治演说
<13-1,Anderson>Did you hear Moreno's latest stump speech?

462
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,200
<13-1,Anderson>他要净化华府
<13-1,Anderson>He's gonna clean up Washington.

463
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,630
<13-1,Anderson>太对了
<13-1,Anderson>Yeah, right.

464
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,480
<13-1,Anderson>搞得好像有哪个新泽西出来的政治家
<13-1,Anderson>Like any politician from New Jersey

465
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,400
<13-1,Anderson>真正净化过...
<13-1,Anderson>has ever cleaned up...

466
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,900
<13-2,Anderson>还有谁知道那则广告是你泄露出去的
<13-2,Anderson>Who else knows that you leaked that AD?

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
<13-2,Anderson>仅有的两份拷贝在你我手里  哈尔
<13-2,Anderson>You and I had the only two copies, Hal.

468
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,100
<13-2,Anderson>我不介意你泄密
<13-2,Anderson>I don't care that you did it.

469
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,640
<13-2,Anderson>我只是想确定它起到了作用
<13-2,Anderson>I just want to make sure it worked.

470
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,810
<13-2,Anderson>今天上午的调查显示我的支持率只差两个百分点
<13-2,Anderson>This morning's tracking has me within two points.

471
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,350
<11-7,Dugan>我早说过
<11-7,Dugan>Told you.

472
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,550
<13-2,Anderson>我们一定会赢
<13-2,Anderson>We're gonna pull this thing off.

473
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,910
<13-3,Taub>你的播散性血管内凝血检验结果完全正常
<13-3,Taub>Your blood test for D.I.C. came back completely normal.

474
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,910
<13-4,Dugan>这是好消息  对吧
<13-4,Dugan>That's good news, right?

475
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
<13-5,Taub>这意味着我们的两种推测都落空了
<13-5,Taub>That means the two things we thought it could be, it's not.

476
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,640
<13-6,Foreman>我们查过你家  没找到任何毒素
<13-6,Foreman>We checked your home for toxins and didn't find any.

477
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,270
<13-6,Foreman>但不排除
<13-6,Foreman>But it's possible

478
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,040
<13-6,Foreman>你在竞选途中接触毒素的可能
<13-6,Foreman>you might've been exposed on the campaign.

479
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,980
<13-6,Foreman>你有没有走访过工业或者农业设施
<13-6,Foreman>Have you visited any industrial or agricultural facilities?

480
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,210
<13-7,Anderson>兰伯顿有个番茄农场
<13-7,Anderson>There was a tomato farm in Lumberton.

481
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,370
<13-8,Foreman>他们带你进菜田了吗
<13-8,Foreman>They take you into the fields?

482
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,980
<13-9,Dugan>没人想跟我合影  我压根儿就没下车
<13-9,Dugan>No one wants a photo op with me. I never leave the bus.

483
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,590
<13-10,Foreman>车窗当时开着吗  某些杀虫剂
<13-10,Foreman>Were the windows open? Certain pesticides...

484
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,840
<13-11,Taub>福曼
<13-11,Taub>Foreman.

485
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,030
<13-12,Dugan>什么  怎么了
<13-12,Dugan>What? What is it?

486
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,620
<13-13,Foreman>我们现在要担心的不止是你的肝脏了
<13-13,Foreman>It's not just your liver we have to worry about.

487
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,360
<13-13,Foreman>看样子你的肾脏也出了问题
<13-13,Foreman>Looks like your kidneys are having problems, too.

488
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,650
<14-1,House>这家伙穷尽一生
<14-1,House>So this guy spends his entire life

489
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,490
<14-1,House>四处奔波防止别人心灵受创
<14-1,House>campaigning against bleeding hearts.

490
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,350
<14-1,House>到头来自己的心脏不行了
<14-1,House>And it turns out he has one.

491
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,620
<14-2,Masters>尿血是肾脏问题
<14-2,Masters>Bloody urine actually is a renal problem,

492
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,690
<14-2,Masters>与心脏无关
<14-2,Masters>not a cardiac one.

493
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,680
<14-3,House>我说了不准确的话
<14-3,House>Yeah, if I say something inaccurate,

494
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,020
<14-3,House>你就该当笑话听
<14-3,House>assume it's for comic effect.

495
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,100
<14-3,House>然后大笑  因为它好笑
<14-3,House>Then laugh, because it's funny.

496
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,010
<14-3,House>可能是血栓性血小板减少性紫癜
<14-3,House>TTP makes sense.

497
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
<14-4,Chase>血小板多少
<14-4,Chase>What're his platelets?

498
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,760
<14-4,Chase>20万   不是血栓性血小板减少性紫癜
<14-4,Chase>200,000. It's not TTP.

499
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,430
<14-5,Masters>会不会是过敏性紫癜
<14-5,Masters>What about henoch-schoenlein purpura ?

500
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,310
<14-6,Taub>过敏性紫癜不会导致血栓
<14-6,Taub>H.S.P. Doesn't cause clots.

501
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,430
<14-7,Foreman>过敏性紫癜通常不会导致血栓  但也有可能
<14-7,Foreman>H.S.P. doesn't usually cause clots, but it can.

502
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,800
<14-7,Foreman>而且血管炎可以解释肾脏病变
<14-7,Foreman>And the vasculitis would explain the kidney problem.

503
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,170
<14-8,House>她连笑话都诊断不出
<14-8,House>She can't diagnose a joke,

504
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,220
<14-8,House>但她对病人的诊断有进步
<14-8,House>but she's making progress on the patient.

505
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,310
<14-9,Masters>我们给他化疗  或者用类固醇
<14-9,Masters>We treat with chemotherapy or steroids.

506
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,240
<14-10,House>我们给他化疗
<14-10,House>We treat with chemotherapy.

507
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,850
<14-11,Masters>我说了化疗
<14-11,Masters>I said chemo.

508
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,940
<14-12,House>然后你又说了"或者"
<14-12,House>Then you said, "or."

509
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,840
<14-13,Chase>又一次  乖乖兔遭遇无情打击
<14-13,Chase>Once again, the bunny meets the blade.

510
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,520
<14-14,House>通向病人死亡之路就是由各种"或者"铺就的
<14-14,House>The road to dead patients is paved with "or"s.

511
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,100
<14-14,House>化疗是更有效的治疗
<14-14,House>Chemo is the more effective treatment

512
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,370
<14-14,House>因为它能更快地验证我们的诊断
<14-14,House>which means it'll confirm our diagnosis more quickly.

513
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,160
<14-15,Masters>我同意  但还有一种办法
<14-15,Masters>I agree, but there is another option.

514
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,450
<14-16,House>办法有很多
<14-16,House>There are lots of other options.

515
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,450
<14-16,House>放血  水晶  祈祷...
<14-16,House>There's bloodletting, crystals, prayer...

516
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,270
<14-17,Masters>我指的是另一种医学公认的方法
<14-17,Masters>Another medically accepted option.

517
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,720
<14-18,House>不那么有效  也不那么吓人
<14-18,House>Which is both less effective and less scary.

518
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,350
<14-18,House>所以病人很可能会选
<14-18,House>So the patient might just choose it.

519
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,470
<14-18,House>除非我们不告诉他
<14-18,House>Unless, of course, we don't mention it to him.

520
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,620
<14-19,Masters>我们不能隐瞒信息
<14-19,Masters>We can't withhold information.

521
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,230
<14-19,Masters>如果我们把两种疗法的风险
<14-19,Masters>If we explain both the benefits

522
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,650
<14-19,Masters>和好处解释清楚
<14-19,Masters>and the risks of each treatment

523
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,410
<14-19,Masters>我确信杜根会选择化疗的
<14-19,Masters>I'm sure Dugan will choose chemo.

524
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,720
<14-20,House>只要你确信就好
<14-20,House>Well, as long as you're sure.

525
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,730
<15-1,Masters>化疗是更好的选择
<15-1,Masters>The better option is chemotherapy.

526
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,460
<15-1,Masters>见效快而且更可能治愈你
<15-1,Masters>It's faster and more likely to completely cure you.

527
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,770
<15-2,Dugan>我选类固醇
<15-2,Dugan>I'll take the steroids.

528
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,040
<15-3,House>我的天哪
<15-3,House>Oh, my goodness!

529
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,650
<15-3,House>要是某人早预料到
<15-3,House>If only someone could've predicted

530
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,300
<15-3,House>你会做这种愚蠢的选择该多好
<15-3,House>that you'd make that incredibly stupid decision.

531
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,040
<15-3,House>化疗造成的恶心和乏力
<15-3,House>The nausea and fatigue from chemo

532
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,490
<15-4,Dugan>只会持续几周
<15-4,Dugan>will only last a few weeks.

533
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,560
<15-4,Dugan>我们的民意调查下滑了
<15-4,Dugan>Our poll numbers have stalled.

534
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,540
<15-4,Dugan>距离竞选开始只剩5天
<15-4,Dugan>That's five days till the election.

535
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,690
<15-5,Anderson>医生  你能不能给他讲讲道理
<15-5,Anderson>Doctor, can you talk some sense into him?

536
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,140
<15-6,House>要是能  我会的
<15-6,House>Would that I could,

537
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,180
<15-6,House>但是道德支配我尊重他的决定
<15-6,House>but ethics dictate that it's his decision.

538
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,180
<15-6,House>所以我能做的只是回到办公室
<15-6,House>So all I can do now is return to my office

539
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,010
<15-6,House>心里知道  即便我的病人危及自身
<15-6,House>knowing, even as my patient endangers himself,

540
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,310
<15-6,House>我的正直诚实依然清白无暇
<15-6,House>my integrity remains unblemished.

541
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,070
<15-7,Masters>求你  花时间考虑一下
<15-7,Masters>Please. Take some time to think about this.

542
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,060
<15-8,Dugan>我不需要时间  我要开始用类固醇
<15-8,Dugan>I don't need any time. I want to start on the steroids.

543
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,340
<16-1,Foreman>1球1分  11分制
<16-1,Foreman>Game to 11 by ones.

544
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,920
<16-2,Taub>等等
<16-2,Taub>Uh, hold on.

545
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,030
<16-2,Taub>比投篮吗
<16-2,Taub>Wanna shoot for outs?

546
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,980
<16-3,Foreman>你投吧
<16-3,Foreman>You can have it.

547
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,240
<16-3,Foreman>1比0
<16-3,Foreman>One, nothing.

548
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,140
<16-4,Taub>你不防我吗
<16-4,Taub>You gonna guard me?

549
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,580
<16-5,Foreman>你又不能连中
<16-5,Foreman>Can't hit two in a row.

550
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,590
<16-3,Foreman>2比0
<16-3,Foreman>Two, nothing.

551
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,920
<16-4,Taub>你到底防不防我
<16-4,Taub>You gonna guard me now?

552
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,390
<16-6,Foreman>你有本事就一直投吧
<16-6,Foreman>You can have that shot all day.

553
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,890
<16-7,Taub>3比0
<16-7,Taub>Three, nothing.

554
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,870
<16-8,Foreman>1比3
<16-8,Foreman>One, three.

555
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,430
<16-9,Foreman>10比7
<16-9,Foreman>Ten, seven.

556
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,290
<16-10,Taub>不是吧
<16-10,Taub>Seriously?

557
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,860
<16-10,Taub>就这样被你赢了
<16-10,Taub>You're gonna beat me with that?

558
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,090
<16-10,Taub>好吧  我错了
<16-10,Taub>Well-- I was wrong.

559
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,550
<16-11,Taub>你没那么老
<16-11,Taub>You're not so old.

560
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,580
<16-11,Taub>谢谢
<16-11,Taub>Thank you.

561
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,440
<16-12,Foreman>现在我们只要搞清楚
<16-12,Foreman>Now all we have to do is figure out

562
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,810
<16-12,Foreman>为什么马斯特斯让你感到不安
<16-12,Foreman>why Masters is making you feel insecure.

563
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,260
<17-1,Masters>我刚才在药房
<17-1,Masters>I was just down by Dugan's room.

564
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,920
<17-1,Masters>他们正要给他用错的药
<17-1,Masters>They were ready to give him the wrong medicine.

565
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,390
<17-1,Masters>我想纠正他们  可我不是医生
<17-1,Masters>I tried to change the order, but I'm not a doctor.

566
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,930
<17-2,House>很好  错的药才是对的药
<17-2,House>Good. The wrong medicine is the right medicine.

567
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,330
<17-3,Masters>但他要的是类固醇  不是化疗
<17-3,Masters>But he wanted steroids, not chemo.

568
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,160
<17-4,House>他想活下去
<17-4,House>He wants to live.

569
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,880
<17-5,Masters>我要去告诉他真相
<17-5,Masters>I'm gonna tell him what's going on.

570
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,100
<17-6,House>不  你不能
<17-6,House>No, you're not.

571
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,280
<17-6,House>你在理论上怎样讲我不管
<17-6,House>I don't mind your morality in theory.

572
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,760
<17-6,House>你在实际操作中拿我病人的生命冒险
<17-6,House>But in practice, you're risking my patient's life.

573
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,030
<17-6,House>所以你被解雇了
<17-6,House>So you're fired.

574
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,100
<17-7,Masters>你以为解雇我我就不去告诉他了吗
<17-7,Masters>You think that's gonna stop me from telling him?

575
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,190
<17-8,House>你敢去  我保证医学院开除你
<17-8,House>If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school.

576
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,660
<17-8,House>我没做任何应当被开除的事情
<17-8,House>I haven't done anything that would merit that.

577
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,710
<17-9,House>我知道  但与你不同  我愿意撒谎
<17-9,House>I know. But unlike you, I'm willing to lie.

578
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,910
<18-1,Foreman>解雇她是个错误
<18-1,Foreman>Firing her was a mistake.

579
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,360
<18-1,Foreman>我们需要团队里有像她这样的人
<18-1,Foreman>We need someone like her on the team,

580
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,380
<18-1,Foreman>来约束我们
<18-1,Foreman>keeping us all in check.

581
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,750
<18-2,House>我做了不应当的事
<18-2,House>You're incapable of noticing

582
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,100
<18-2,House>你们会看不出来吗
<18-2,House>when I do something inappropriate?

583
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,910
<18-3,Foreman>我们就像煮了一阵子的青蛙
<18-3,Foreman>We're like the frogs who've been in the pot for a while.

584
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,750
<18-3,Foreman>已经习惯那热量了
<18-3,Foreman>We're used to the heat.

585
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,750
<18-4,Taub>长袜子皮皮出现之前  一切都好好的
<18-4,Taub>Things have been just fine without Pippi Longdivision.

586
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,990
<18-5,House>你的对手已经退出竞选
<18-5,House>Your opponent's out of the race.

587
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,780
<18-5,House>停止诽谤活动吧
<18-5,House>You can drop the smear campaign.

588
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,340
<18-5,House>杜根出现肺水肿
<18-5,House>Dugan developed pulmonary edema.

589
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,270
<18-6,Foreman>不是过敏性紫癜
<18-6,Foreman>It's not H.S.P.

590
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,530
<18-6,Foreman>马斯特斯是对的
<18-6,Foreman>Masters was right.

591
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,770
<18-6,Foreman>他不想要化疗  他也不需要化疗
<18-6,Foreman>He didn't want the chemo. He didn't need the chemo.

592
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,930
<18-7,House>马斯特斯是错的
<18-7,House>Masters was wrong.

593
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,070
<18-7,House>他没患过敏性紫癜
<18-7,House>He doesn't have H.S.P.

594
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,590
<18-7,House>而且马斯特斯已经走人了
<18-7,House>And Masters is gone.

595
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,540
<18-8,Taub>可能是感染
<18-8,Taub>Could be an infection.

596
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,280
<18-9,Chase>我们给他用了氨曲喃治疗大肠杆菌
<18-9,Chase>We had him on aztreonam for the E coli.

597
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,130
<18-9,Chase>他没见好
<18-9,Chase>He didn't respond.

598
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,480
<18-10,Taub>血吸虫病用氨曲喃自然不会见好
<18-10,Taub>Schistosomiasis wouldn't respond to aztreonam.

599
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,570
<18-11,House>真是高明想法
<18-11,House>That's a great idea,

600
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,800
<18-11,House>如果他是在非洲跑竞选的话
<18-11,House>if he was running a political campaign in Africa.

601
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,790
<18-11,House>他好多年没出过国了
<18-11,House>The guy hasn't been out of the country in years.

602
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,230
<18-12,Taub>有了大鱼缸谁还需要出国呀
<18-12,Taub>Who needs to travel when you've got a giant fish tank

603
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,520
<18-12,Taub>满缸的热带鱼  热带蜗牛
<18-12,Taub>loaded with tropical fish, tropical snails

604
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,400
<18-12,Taub>身上满是热带血吸虫之类的热带细菌
<18-12,Taub>carrying tropical bacteria like schistosomiasis.

605
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,140
<18-13,House>再去闯他家  抓两只法国蜗牛回来
<18-13,House>Well, break into his home, get me some escargot.

606
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,280
<18-13,House>除非你们想去讨病人的许可
<18-13,House>Unless you wanna ask the patient's permission

607
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,710
<18-13,House>当离职礼物送她
<18-13,House>as a tribute to the departed.

608
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,560
<18-14,Cuddy>过来一下
<18-14,Cuddy>Need a minute.

609
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,610
<19-1,Cuddy>你答应给她一次机会的
<19-1,Cuddy>You said you were gonna give her a chance.

610
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,590
<19-1,Cuddy>我给了
<19-1,Cuddy>I did!

611
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,120
<19-2,House>她利用我给的机会危害病人生命
<19-2,House>She used that opportunity to endanger our patient's life.

612
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,830
<19-3,Masters>我坚持让他得到他选择的治疗
<19-3,Masters>By insisting he receive the treatment that he asked for.

613
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,990
<19-4,House>我说的就是这个
<19-4,House>That's what I just said!

614
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,450
<19-5,Cuddy>你的团队存在就是为了挑战你
<19-5,Cuddy>Your team is there to challenge you.

615
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,750
<19-7,Cuddy>我解雇她不是因为她是个挑战
<19-7,Cuddy>I didn't fire her because she's a challenge--

616
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,060
<19-7,Cuddy>我解雇她是因为她是个顽固的障碍
<19-7,Cuddy>I fired her because she's an immutable obstacle!

617
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,040
<19-7,Cuddy>你要逼我雇佣她吗
<19-7,Cuddy>You gonna make me hire her?

618
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,140
<19-6,Masters>你觉得会有什么结果
<19-6,Masters>How do you think that'll work out?

619
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,690
<19-6,Masters>你觉得会有什么结果
<19-6,Masters>How do you think that'll work out?

620
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
<19-6,Masters>他说的对  我还是
<19-6,Masters>He's right, I'll just--

621
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,530
<19-6,Masters>你不准辞了这份工作
<19-6,Masters>You will not quit this job.

622
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,340
<19-7,Cuddy>这算什么意思啊
<19-7,Cuddy>What is going on?

623
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,280
<19-7,Cuddy>我想让她走  她也不想干
<19-7,Cuddy>I want her gone, she wants to be gone.

624
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,030
<19-7,Cuddy>你较的什么劲儿
<19-7,Cuddy>Why do you care?

625
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,840
<19-7,Cuddy>你该不会觉得
<19-7,Cuddy>You don't actually think

626
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,790
<19-7,Cuddy>她是毕业生版的你吧
<19-7,Cuddy>that she's a younger version of you?

627
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,640
<19-7,Cuddy>实话跟你说  你没她聪明
<19-7,Cuddy>Because let me tell you, you're not that smart

628
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,750
<19-7,Cuddy>也没她这么道德
<19-7,Cuddy>or moral.

629
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,970
<19-7,Cuddy>倒是可能跟她一样不善社交
<19-7,Cuddy>Socially awkward, maybe.

630
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,250
<19-7,Cuddy>她很有潜力
<19-7,Cuddy>She's a potential star,

631
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,420
<19-7,Cuddy>我想要她为我的医院效力
<19-7,Cuddy>and I want her in my hospital.

632
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,470
<19-8,House>没问题
<19-8,House>No problem.

633
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,390
<19-8,House>让她换个科室待着去
<19-8,House>Just find her a different department.

634
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,430
<20-1,Chase>我想我知道答案了
<20-1,Chase>I think I've figured it out.

635
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,170
<20-1,Chase>为什么陶博不喜欢马斯特斯
<20-1,Chase>Why taub didn't like Masters.

636
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,860
<20-2,Taub>你怎么也加入八卦队伍了
<20-2,Taub>Now you're getting involved in this, too?

637
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,910
<20-3,Chase>我的前娱乐新闻人物被解雇了
<20-3,Chase>My previous source of entertainment just got fired.

638
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,970
<20-4,Taub>没错  她走了  到此结束
<20-4,Taub>Exactly. She's gone. It's over.

639
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,970
<20-5,Chase>她品德高尚为人正直
<20-5,Chase>She's totally moral and uptight,

640
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,410
<20-5,Chase>这让陶博羞于自己出轨之事
<20-5,Chase>which made Taub feel badly about his cheating.

641
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,730
<20-6,Taub>赶紧干活好吧
<20-6,Taub>Can we get a move on?

642
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,900
<20-7,Foreman>在你见识到
<20-7,Foreman>You didn't like her

643
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,600
<20-7,Foreman>她品德高尚之前就不喜欢她了
<20-7,Foreman>even before you knew about her morals.

644
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,480
<20-7,Foreman>你第一眼看到她就不对盘
<20-7,Foreman>It's from the minute he saw her.

645
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,830
<20-7,Foreman>那么
<20-7,Foreman>So...

646
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,830
<20-8,Chase>肯定是因为她的长相了
<20-8,Chase>It's something about how she looked.

647
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,500
<20-9,Taub>行了
<20-9,Taub>All right.

648
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,770
<20-9,Taub>没有蜗牛  我们走吧
<20-9,Taub>No snails. Let's get out of here.

649
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,200
<20-10,Chase>谁啊
<20-10,Chase>Hello?

650
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,580
<21-2,Foreman>-说话  -我是福曼
<21-2,Foreman>- Yeah. - It's Foreman.

651
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,650
<21-3,House>你们有什么发现
<21-3,House>What'd you find?

652
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,630
<21-4,Foreman>没什么有建设性的  但
<21-4,Foreman>Nothing helpful, but--

653
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,580
<21-5,House>一定有原因
<21-5,House>There's gotta be something.

654
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,510
<21-5,House>杜根的病情持续恶化
<21-5,House>Dugan's going completely downhill.

655
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,580
<21-5,House>现在他胸腔开始积液了
<21-5,House>Now fluid's collecting in his chest.

656
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,430
<21-5,House>你们死哪里去了
<21-5,House>Where the hell are you guys?

657
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,810
<21-5,House>蹲拘留所了
<21-5,House>In jail.

658
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,830
<21-6,Foreman>你会来保我们出去吗
<21-6,Foreman>You gonna come bail us out?

659
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,070
<21-7,House>我  有点忙
<21-7,House>Uh... Kinda busy.

660
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,070
<21-7,House>感谢你们能在夜深时与会
<21-7,House>Thank you all for coming down here at this late hour.

661
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,400
<21-7,House>我会简明扼要
<21-7,House>I assure you I will be brief.

662
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,880
<21-7,House>本周初在网络上泄露的一段
<21-7,House>There has been a lot of discussion

663
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,930
<21-7,House>攻击他人的广告引起了广泛讨论
<21-7,House>about an attack ad that leaked online earlier this week.

664
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,120
<21-7,House>我曾多次强调
<21-7,House>As I said many times

665
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,320
<21-7,House>在过去几天
<21-7,House>over the past few days--

666
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,520
<22-1,House>你躲在这儿啊
<22-1,House>There you are.

667
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,970
<22-1,House>我正在想是不是我那"比你更圣洁器官"
<22-1,House>I was starting to think that my holier-than-thou-dar

668
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,630
<22-1,House>最近罢工了
<22-1,House>was malfunctioning.

669
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,330
<22-1,House>我们病人的肝脏
<22-1,House>Our patient's liver,

670
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,450
<22-1,House>双肾和肺部齐齐衰竭
<22-1,House>kidneys, and lungs are failing.

671
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,450
<22-1,House>我需要你帮助我找到病因
<22-1,House>I need you to help me figure out why.

672
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,710
<22-2,Masters>我记得  你有三位真正的医生手下
<22-2,Masters>As I recall, you have three actual doctors

673
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,570
<22-2,Masters>今天没被你解雇
<22-2,Masters>you haven't fired today.

674
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,950
<22-3,House>他们在拘留所里
<22-3,House>They're in jail.

675
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,130
<22-4,Masters>什么  怎么会
<22-4,Masters>What? Why?

676
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,700
<22-5,House>搞三人行
<22-5,House>Prostitution.

677
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,670
<22-5,House>所以你被重新雇佣了
<22-5,House>So you're rehired.

678
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,100
<22-5,House>一切始于肝脏  问题是肝脏哪里
<22-5,House>It all started in the liver, but where in the liver?

679
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,440
<22-6,House>如果是胆管  那就是原发性胆汁性肝硬化
<22-6,House>If in the ducts, then primary biliary cirrhosis--

680
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,140
<22-6,House>停  我不要听你的思考过程
<22-6,House>Yeah, I don't need to hear your ideas.

681
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,390
<22-6,House>直接回传[回答问题]
<22-6,House>Just return the volley.

682
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,710
<22-7,Masters>原发硬化性胆管炎
<22-7,Masters>Primary sclerosing cholangitis.

683
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,630
<22-8,House>错  他维他命A水平正常
<22-8,House>Nope. His vitamin A level is normal.

684
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,660
<22-9,Masters>胆囊问题会影响肝脏
<22-9,Masters>Gall bladder problems can affect the liver.

685
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
<22-10,House>胆囊炎
<22-10,House>Cholecystitis?

686
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,770
<22-10,House>嘘  他在说我们的病人
<22-10,House>Shh! He's talking about our patient.

687
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,220
<22-11,House>你刚才让我嘘声
<22-11,House>Did you just shush me?

688
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,470
<22-12,Masters>别说话
<22-12,Masters>Shh!

689
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,930
<22-12,Masters>我一直把他当朋友
<22-12,Masters>And thought he was a friend.

690
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,770
<22-12,Masters>直到
<22-12,Masters>That is, until...

691
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,110
<22-13,Masters>他泄露了这则令人受伤令人憎恶的广告
<22-13,Masters>He leaked this hurtful, hateful ad.

692
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,270
<22-13,Masters>我觉得他在说谎  杜根说
<22-13,Masters>I think he's lying. Dugan said--

693
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,890
<22-14,House>这术语叫做演说
<22-14,House>The technical term is speaking.

694
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,980
<22-15,Anderson>杜根辜负了我对他的信任
<22-15,Anderson>Dugan violated my trust.

695
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,180
<22-15,Anderson>因此  除了将他从我的竞选团队中除名
<22-15,Anderson>And therefore, I have no other recourse

696
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,840
<22-15,Anderson>我没有其它补救办法
<22-15,Anderson>than to fire him from my campaign.

697
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,060
<22-15,Anderson>谢谢各位  回答问题到此结束
<22-15,Anderson>Thank you, and there will be no further questions.

<22-15,Anderson>Thanks for your help.

699
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,040
<22-15,Anderson>顺便  你又被解雇了
<22-15,Anderson>Oh-- and you're fired again.

700
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,350
<23-1,House>他害了你
<23-1,House>He screwed you.

701
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,890
<23-2,Dugan>手段真他妈高明啊
<23-2,Dugan>That was a hell of a move.

702
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,520
<23-2,Dugan>利用广告做铺垫
<23-2,Dugan>Use the ad to shore up the base,

<23-3,House>He's got a red blotch on his hand.

707
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,120
<23-3,House>那是掌红斑
<23-3,House>That's palmar erythema.

708
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,290
<23-3,House>再加上他尼克松似的焦虑不安
<23-3,House>That, and the fact that he's got

709
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,190
<23-3,House>以致长年脸泛红光
<23-3,House>a permanent sheen of nixonian flop sweat.

710
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,090
<23-3,House>表明他患丙肝
<23-3,House>He's got hepatitis C

711
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,830

<23-4,Dugan>That's great,

713
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,870
<23-4,Dugan>可惜我跟议员没有性接触
<23-4,Dugan>but the senator and I have not had sex.

714
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,690
<23-5,House>那就是你们同用一根针筒注射
<23-5,House>Well, then the two of you shot up together.

715
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,130
<23-6,Dugan>你知道多少高功能海洛因吸食者呀
<23-6,Dugan>How many high-functioning heroin users do you know?

716
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,100
<23-7,House>实际上  还不少

<23-7,House>听着  我知道你有丙肝
<23-7,House>Look, I know you've got Hep C.

718
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,250
<23-7,House>所以要么你们是共枕同眠
<23-7,House>So either you shared a bed together,

720
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,680
<23-7,House>要么就是用了同一根吸管
<23-7,House>or you shared a straw.

721
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,840
<23-7,House>我在说可卡因
<23-7,House>I'm talking about coke,

722
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,520
<23-7,House>不是可乐
<23-7,House>not coke.

723
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,030
<23-8,Dugan>吸食可卡因也会得丙肝吗
<23-8,Dugan>You can get Hep C from doing cocaine?

724
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,370
<23-8,Dugan>我肯定不会承认的
<23-8,Dugan>Look, I will deny it.

725
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,230
<23-9,House>随你便
<23-9,House>Don't care.

726
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,980
<23-10,Dugan>我入院时做过测试
<23-10,Dugan>They tested me for Hep C when I came in here.

727
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,950
<23-10,Dugan>我没有丙肝
<23-10,Dugan>I don't have it.

728
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,950
<23-8,Dugan>显然你的肝脏也会几招
<23-8,Dugan>Apparently your liver picked up

729
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,950
<23-5,House>你的竞选战术
<23-5,House>a few of your campaign tactics.

730
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,990
<23-3,House>通过制造冷球蛋白
<23-3,House>It's hiding all your secrets

731
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,740
<15-4,Dugan>它掩盖了你的小秘密
<15-4,Dugan>by producing cryoglobulins

732
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,380
<15-5,Anderson>所以丙肝测试结果呈阴性
<15-5,Anderson>So the Hep C tests come back negative.

733
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,440
<15-6,House>本来我可以寻找相关毒素
<15-6,House>Now, I could look for all the associated toxins,

734
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,570
<23-4,Dugan>但血浆除去法已经把它们都排空了
<23-4,Dugan>but the plasmapheresis got rid of those.

735
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,970
<23-6,Dugan>简单来说  你生病了
<23-6,Dugan>So basically, you've got a disease,

736
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,420
<23-8,Dugan>但没法证明
<23-8,Dugan>but there's no way to prove it.

737
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,350
<23-9,House>挺有意思的对吧
<23-9,House>It's pretty cool, huh?

738
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,700
<23-11,Dugan>你在打什么
<23-11,Dugan>What is that?

739
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,670
<23-12,House>这是干扰素
<23-12,House>This is interferon.

740
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,740
<23-12,House>它可以让你迟些变僵尸
<23-12,House>It delays the onset of Rigor mortis.

741
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,830
<24-1,Chase>你律师说他什么时候来
<24-1,Chase>When did your lawyer say he was coming to get us?

742
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,850
<24-2,Taub>他说
<24-2,Taub>He said,

743
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,910
<24-2,Taub>原话重现
<24-2,Taub>and I'm quoting here,

744
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
<24-2,Taub>很快
<24-2,Taub>"Soon."

745
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,870
<24-2,Taub>我知道了
<24-2,Taub>I know.

746
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,130
<24-3,Foreman>你看马斯特斯第一眼
<24-3,Foreman>The reason you hated Masters

747
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,460
<24-3,Foreman>就讨厌她的原因
<24-3,Foreman>from the moment you saw her.

748
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,580
<24-4,Taub>有完没完
<24-4,Taub>Come on.

749
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,010
<24-5,Foreman>你之前就见过她
<24-5,Foreman>That was not the first time you saw her.

750
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,910
<24-6,Chase>真聪明
<24-6,Chase>That is brilliant.

751
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,950
<24-7,Taub>真的不是这样
<24-7,Taub>It's really not.

752
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,340
<24-7,Taub>那家伙真要在这上厕所吗
<24-7,Taub>Is that guy seriously using the toilet?

753
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,980
<24-7,Taub>老天  他坐下来了
<24-7,Taub>Oh, my god, he's sitting down.

754
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,730
<24-8,Foreman>别想岔开话题
<24-8,Foreman>Don't try to change the subject.

755
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,830
<24-8,Foreman>你跟她睡过吗
<24-8,Foreman>Did you sleep with her?

756
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,650
<24-8,Foreman>难怪他被关在拘留所
<24-8,Foreman>No wonder he's in jail.

757
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,480
<24-8,Foreman>他这么做竟然不感到羞耻
<24-8,Foreman>Anyone who would do that has no shame.

758
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,780
<24-8,Foreman>也有可能他曾试图勾引她
<24-8,Foreman>Or maybe he tried to sleep with her,

759
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,340
<24-8,Foreman>被她狠狠拒绝了
<24-8,Foreman>and she shot him down.

760
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,610
<24-8,Foreman>我不认识她
<24-8,Foreman>I don't know her.

761
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
<24-9,Foreman>他在嗯嗯吗
<24-9,Foreman>Is he grunting?

762
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,680
<24-9,Foreman>我好像听到他嗯嗯了
<24-9,Foreman>I think I hear grunting.

763
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,800
<24-9,Foreman>你该知道我们不会善罢甘休吧
<24-9,Foreman>You realize we're not gonna drop this.

764
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,090
<24-10,Taub>我没跟她睡过
<24-10,Taub>I didn't sleep with her.

765
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,670
<24-10,Taub>我给她面试进霍普金斯医学院的
<24-10,Taub>I interviewed her for Hopkins med school.

766
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,570
<24-11,Foreman>就因为她选了另一所学校
<24-11,Foreman>So you're holding a grudge,

767
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,180
<24-11,Foreman>你对她心存怨恨
<24-11,Foreman>because she chose a different school?

768
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,130
<24-12,Taub>我们对话了一个小时
<24-12,Taub>We talked for an hour.

769
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,960
<24-12,Taub>她竟然不记得我
<24-12,Taub>She didn't remember me.

770
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,050
<24-12,Taub>她记得什么数学常数第20位数字
<24-12,Taub>She remembers the 20th digit of some math constant,

771
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,320
<24-12,Taub>却不记得
<24-12,Taub>but she doesn't remember

772
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,470
<24-12,Taub>跟她一对一面谈的面试官
<24-12,Taub>a guy she had a one-on-one meeting with.

773
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,550
<24-13,Chase>我还不记得你是哪根葱呢
<24-13,Chase>Well, I barely remember you.

774
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,100
<24-14,Taub>迷题解开了
<24-14,Taub>Mystery solved.

775
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,920
<24-14,Taub>现在大家可以回到常轨了
<24-14,Taub>Now we can all go back to our lives.

776
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,520
<25-1,House>好消息
<25-1,House>Great news.

777
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,190
<25-1,House>我决定再次雇佣你
<25-1,House>I've decided to rehire you.

778
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,800
<25-2,Masters>换个人耍耍去
<25-2,Masters>Find another sounding board.

779
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,060
<25-3,House>杜根患丙肝
<25-3,House>Dugan's got Hep C.

780
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,050
<25-4,Masters>我不会搭理你的
<25-4,Masters>I'm not doing this.

781
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,900
<25-5,House>干扰素不起作用
<25-5,House>He's not responding to interferon.

782
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,120
<25-6,Masters>想必你觉得我完全没有自尊
<25-6,Masters>You must think I have absolutely no self-esteem.

783
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,040
<25-7,House>又要道德又要自尊
<25-7,House>Ethics and self-esteem?

784
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,380
<25-7,House>你还真叫人蛋疼
<25-7,House>You really are a pain in the ass.

785
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,660
<25-7,House>除了干扰素还有什么能治疗丙肝
<25-7,House>What treats Hep C besides interferon?

786
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,070
<25-8,Masters>现在你又想听我的主意了
<25-8,Masters>Now you want me to talk?

787
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,830
<25-9,House>是啊
<25-9,House>Yeah.

788
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,210
<25-10,House>得了  别假装你不想告诉我
<25-10,House>Come on, stop pretending you're not gonna do this.

789
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,970
<25-10,House>不管你多讨厌我  你更讨厌失败
<25-10,House>As much as you hate me, you hate failing more.

790
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,670
<25-11,Masters>我没有失败
<25-11,Masters>I didn't fail.

791
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,500
<25-11,Masters>是你一遍遍炒我
<25-11,Masters>You fired me. Repeatedly.

792
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,840
<25-12,House>但现在我重新雇佣你  你还要离开
<25-12,House>But if you walk away now, after I just rehired you,

793
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,580
<25-12,House>那叫辞职
<25-12,House>that's quitting.

794
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,690
<25-13,Masters>一项德国调查研究显示
<25-13,Masters>A german research study

795
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,950
<25-13,Masters>15%的丙肝患者
<25-13,Masters>showed that 15% of patients with Hep C

796
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,780
<25-13,Masters>在感染上甲肝后治愈
<25-13,Masters>were cured after contracting Hep A.

797
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,890
<25-13,Masters>当然其他研究显示
<25-13,Masters>Of course, other studies have shown

798
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,570
<25-13,Masters>85%的双重感染病患
<25-13,Masters>that up to 85% of doubly-infected patients

799
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,400
<25-13,Masters>死得更快
<25-13,Masters>die very quickly.

800
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,490
<25-13,Masters>所以理论上说  如果我们找到甲肝模拟物
<25-13,Masters>So, in theory, if we can find something that mimics Hep A--

801
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,760
<25-14,House>是有那么个甲肝模拟物
<25-14,House>There's one thing that mimics Hep A...

802
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,410
<25-14,House>甲肝呗
<25-14,House>Hep A.

803
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,080
<25-14,House>不错
<25-14,House>Good work.

804
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,710
<25-14,House>你被解雇了
<25-14,House>You're fired.

805
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,010
<25-14,House>不
<25-14,House>No!

806
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,360
<26-1,House>甲肝能治好他
<26-1,House>Hep A could cure him.

807
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,650
<26-2,Cuddy>更可能杀死他
<26-2,Cuddy>Better chance it'll kill him.

808
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,510
<26-3,House>让实验室给我个甲肝培养物
<26-3,House>Tell the lab to release a Hep A culture to me.

809
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,450
<26-3,House>看谁对谁错
<26-3,House>We'll see who's right.

810
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,760
<26-4,Cuddy>这项治疗未获批准
<26-4,Cuddy>It's not an approved treatment

811
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,160
<26-4,Cuddy>还会对我们产生不利影响
<26-4,Cuddy>and exposes us to liability.

812
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,680
<26-4,Cuddy>我不可能让你这么做
<26-4,Cuddy>There's no way I can let you do this.

813
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,660
<26-5,Masters>你这是极端畏缩的立场
<26-5,Masters>That's an extremely cowardly position.

814
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,310
<26-6,House>听听天才之言
<26-6,House>Listen to the genius.

815
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,500
<26-7,Cuddy>是你坚持要他征求我意见的
<26-7,Cuddy>You're the one that insisted he run this by me.

816
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,920
<26-8,Masters>因为这是非传统治疗的常规机制
<26-8,Masters>It's proper protocol for an unconventional treatment.

817
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,350
<26-8,Masters>可我们不该牺牲病人的安危
<26-8,Masters>But we shouldn't compromise patient care

818
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,530
<26-8,Masters>只为避免诉讼
<26-8,Masters>just to avoid lawsuits.

819
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,930
<26-9,Cuddy>现在我们无法证明他真有丙肝
<26-9,Cuddy>What about the fact that we don't

820
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,910
<26-9,Cuddy>这你又怎么说呢
<26-9,Cuddy>have any proof he actually has Hep C?

821
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,960
<26-9,Cuddy>她这反对无懈可击
<26-9,Cuddy>That is a perfectly valid objection.

822
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,760
<26-9,Cuddy>别听她的
<26-9,Cuddy>Don't listen to her.

823
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,140
<31-1,House>她又不是我的手下
<31-1,House>She doesn't even work for me.

824
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,430
<26-9,Cuddy>如果你真认为这是唯一能治愈他的办法
<26-9,Cuddy>If you really think that this is the only way to cure him,

825
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,920
<26-10,Cuddy>我愿意冒法律风险
<26-10,Cuddy>I will risk the lawsuit.

826
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,490
<26-10,Cuddy>但我需要知道他确实患有丙肝
<26-10,Cuddy>But I need to know that he actually has the disease.

827
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,560
<26-12,Cuddy>给我证据
<26-12,Cuddy>Get me proof.

828
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,530
<26-11,House>-我已经给你  -证据
<26-11,House>- I've given you-- - Proof!

829
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,580
<26-12,Cuddy>你给我他患有丙肝的证据
<26-12,Cuddy>Get me proof he has Hep C,

830
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,070
<26-12,Cuddy>我就让你给他注射甲肝病毒
<26-12,Cuddy>and then you can give him Hep A.

831
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,070
<26-13,House>我无法证明
<26-13,House>I can't.

832
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,300
<26-14,Cuddy>你会想出办法来的
<26-14,Cuddy>You'll figure something out.

833
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,330
<26-14,Cuddy>你们俩智商加起来都超过300了
<26-14,Cuddy>The two of you have a combined IQ north of 300.

834
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,640
<26-15,House>五个白痴加起来也是300
<26-15,House>That's also true of five morons.

835
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,900
<26-15,House>去干活吧
<26-15,House>Go. Work.

836
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,920
<27-1,Masters>我们现在怎么办
<27-1,Masters>So what do we do now?

837
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,870
<27-2,House>考虑到我正要
<27-2,House>Well, considering the fact

838
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,460
<27-2,House>做些不道德的事
<27-2,House>that I'm about to do something unethical--

839
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,840
<27-3,Masters>懂了  我被解雇了
<27-3,Masters>Oh, right, yeah-- I'm fired.

840
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,620
<27-4,House>想你们了
<27-4,House>Missed you.

841
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,080
<27-5,House>我们需要一份丙肝假阳性测试
<27-5,House>We need a false positive Hep C test.

842
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,870
<27-6,Foreman>我们要这个干什么
<27-6,Foreman>And why would we want to do that?

843
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,580
<27-7,House>你们蹲拘留所的时候世界变了
<27-7,House>The world changes when you're on the inside.

844
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,570
<27-7,House>出来之后你们得跟上
<27-7,House>You just gotta roll with it once you get out.

845
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,730
<27-8,Chase>你认为他的丙肝
<27-8,Chase>You think he contracted Hep C

846
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,360
<27-8,Chase>是从议员那染上的  对吧
<27-8,Chase>from the senator, right?

847
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,280
<27-8,Chase>那就测安德森
<27-8,Chase>Test Anderson.

848
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,530
<27-8,Chase>如果他是阳性  就表明杜根也患上了
<27-8,Chase>If it's positive, that's evidence Dugan has it, too.

849
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,760
<27-9,House>只是表明  不是证明
<27-9,House>Evidence, not proof.

850
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
<27-10,Taub>我们又不是呈给陪审团看
<27-10,Taub>Are we presenting this to a jury of our peers?

851
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,950
<27-10,Taub>说服卡迪应该够了
<27-10,Taub>That should be enough for Cuddy.

852
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,310
<27-11,House>应该够  但实际不够
<27-11,House>Should be, but it won't be.

853
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,380
<27-12,Taub>丙肝测试准确率是99.9%
<27-12,Taub>The test for Hep C is 99.9% accurate.

854
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,930
<27-12,Taub>这意味着一千个测试中
<27-12,Taub>That means one in every thousand tests

855
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,210
<27-12,Taub>就有一个假阳性
<27-12,Taub>is a false positive.

856
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,260
<27-12,Taub>我们多测几次  也许能碰上
<27-12,Taub>We do enough, maybe we get lucky.

857
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,610
<27-12,Taub>我浑身监狱味儿
<27-12,Taub>I smell like jail.

858
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,460
<27-13,House>假冒的假阳性
<27-13,House>False false positive.

859
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,320
<27-13,House>没有更好的办法了吗
<27-13,House>That's the best we can do?

860
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,550
<27-13,House>那好  行动吧
<27-13,House>Okay, go do it.

861
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,100
<27-13,House>我遇到个难题
<27-13,House>I have a problem.

862
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,570
<27-13,House>一个医学问题
<27-13,House>A medical problem

863
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,000
<27-13,House>可能演变成
<27-13,House>which could become...

864
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,690
<27-13,House>我骗过卡迪上万次了
<27-13,House>I have lied to Cuddy 10,000 times.

865
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,220
<27-13,House>你觉得再多骗一次她会怎么想
<27-13,House>How do you think she'd feel about 10,001?

866
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,930
<28-1,Wilson>我觉得你心里已经有数了
<28-1,Wilson>I think you probably already know the answer.

867
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,570
<28-2,House>可我想不通呀
<28-2,House>But it doesn't make any sense.

868
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,030
<28-3,Wilson>你不理解为什么男友一说谎
<28-3,Wilson>You don't understand why a woman might be upset

869
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,550
<28-3,Wilson>女人就不高兴
<28-3,Wilson>because her boyfriend lied to her?

870
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,520
<28-4,House>我不会以男友身份对她说谎
<28-4,House>I wouldn't be lying as her boyfriend.

871
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,150
<28-4,House>而是作为员工
<28-4,House>I'd be lying as her employee.

872
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,830
<28-5,Wilson>男女关系不是这么处的
<28-5,Wilson>That's not how relationships work.

873
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,730
<28-6,House>我的病人会死
<28-6,House>My patient is gonna die.

874
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,330
<28-7,Wilson>说谎能保证他活下来吗
<28-7,Wilson>Does the lie guarantee he'll live?

875
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,380
<28-8,House>不能
<28-8,House>No.

876
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,630
<28-9,Wilson>你有两个选择
<28-9,Wilson>You got two choices:

877
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,810
<28-9,Wilson>诚实  但要面对医疗后果
<28-9,Wilson>to be honest and face the medical consequences,

878
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,830
<28-9,Wilson>说谎  但要面对个人感情
<28-9,Wilson>or lie and face the personal consequences.

879
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,410
<29-1,Anderson>既然你是我的医生
<29-1,Anderson>Now that you're my doctor, you, uh...

880
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,300
<29-1,Anderson>就不可以对任何人说吧
<29-1,Anderson>You can't tell anybody, right?

881
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,540
<29-2,House>谁会到处宣传现任参议员
<29-2,House>Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator

882
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,180
<29-2,House>注射可卡因染上了丙肝呢
<29-2,House>who got Hep C from doing cocaine?

883
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,040
<29-2,House>你没有填写任何表格
<29-2,House>You didn't fill out any paperwork.

884
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,110
<29-2,House>我会帮你做匿名测试
<29-2,House>I'm gonna run this test under an assumed name.

885
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,980
<29-2,House>相信我
<29-2,House>Trust me--

886
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,460
<29-2,House>没人会知道你来过这儿
<29-2,House>no one will ever know you were here.

887
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,080
<30-1,House>血液测试证实是丙肝
<30-1,House>Blood test confirming Hep C.

888
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,060
<30-1,House>他的病情加重
<30-1,House>He got sicker,

889
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,360
<30-1,House>病毒负荷量上升
<30-1,House>his viral load came up,

890
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,420
<30-1,House>最终在测试中显现出来
<30-1,House>finally showed up on the test.

891
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,710
<30-1,House>谢谢你
<30-1,House>Thank you.

892
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,980
<30-2,Cuddy>曾几何时
<30-2,Cuddy>There was a time

893
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,980
<30-2,Cuddy>你对我的要求视而不见
<30-2,Cuddy>when you would have completely ignored my request.

894
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,090
<30-2,Cuddy>你能这么做说明很尊重我  我很高兴
<30-2,Cuddy>That means a lot that you respect me enough to do this.

895
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,730
<30-3,House>我一直在努力  宝贝儿
<30-3,House>I've come a long way, baby.

896
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,710
<30-3,House>现在就差雇佣一个新成员了
<30-3,House>Now, if you would only hire a new team member.

897
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,350
<30-4,House>我会搞定的
<30-4,House>I'm on it.

898
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,830
<31-1,House>来给我干活怎么样
<31-1,House>How'd you like to come work for me?

899
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,890
<31-2,Masters>我好像身处莫比乌斯带
<31-2,Masters>It's like I'm on a mobius strip.

900
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,180
<31-3,House>我们早就谈过了
<31-3,House>We've had this conversation.

901
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,370
<31-3,House>你想要这份工作
<31-3,House>You want this job.

902
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,410
<31-4,House>向我证明自己的能力
<31-4,House>Prove yourself to me,

903
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,760
<31-4,House>不会再耍你玩了
<31-4,House>no more games.

904
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,410
<31-4,House>至少现在这场游戏结束了
<31-4,House>At least, the current game ends.

905
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,090
<31-4,House>还会有其它的
<31-4,House>Others may start.

906
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,130
<31-4,House>虽然有漏洞  但是我向你保证
<31-4,House>You have my deeply-flawed word.

907
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,690
<31-5,Masters>我该做些什么
<31-5,Masters>What do I have to do?

908
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,050
<31-6,House>让杜根同意注射甲肝病毒
<31-6,House>Get Dugan to let us give him Hep A.

909
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,510
<31-6,House>要想找个最好的办法
<31-6,House>And while you're figuring out the best way

910
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
<31-6,House>劝诱病人进行死亡率
<31-6,House>to coax a patient into a treatment

911
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,880
<31-6,House>高达85%的治疗方案
<31-6,House>that has an 85% mortality rate,

912
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,400
<31-6,House>我建议你  别告诉他
<31-6,House>here's some advice: don't.

913
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,130
<31-7,Masters>我不会骗他的
<31-7,Masters>I'm not gonna lie to him.

914
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,310
<31-8,House>你是有数学学位人的
<31-8,House>You have a Math Degree.

915
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,980
<31-8,House>看看你能不能应用在这上面
<31-8,House>So let's see if you can follow along here.

916
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,970
<31-8,House>你对他说谎  他肯定会同意
<31-8,House>You lie to him, he definitely consents,

917
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,210
<31-8,House>也许就能活下来
<31-8,House>he might live.

918
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,910
<31-8,House>你像上次那样对他讲出实话
<31-8,House>You tell him the truth like last time,

919
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,170
<31-8,House>他可能就不会同意
<31-8,House>he might not consent,

920
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,800
<31-8,House>那他一定会死
<31-8,House>He definitely dies.

921
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,850
<31-8,House>跟我说说谎有什么不对
<31-8,House>Remind me what's so wrong about lying?

922
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,530
<32-1,Masters>我们要给你注射甲肝病毒
<32-1,Masters>We're going to inject you with Hepatitis A.

923
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,390
<32-2,Dugan>听起来不像是药
<32-2,Dugan>That doesn't sound like medicine.

924
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,990
<32-3,Masters>我知道这有违常理
<32-3,Masters>I know it seems counter-intuitive,

925
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,390
<32-3,Masters>但在一些人体内
<32-3,Masters>but in some people,

926
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,320
<32-3,Masters>这种病毒能够增强免疫力
<32-3,Masters>the virus can enhance immune function

927
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,350
<32-3,Masters>清除丙肝病毒
<32-3,Masters>and clear out the Hepatitis C.

928
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,750
<32-4,Dugan>一些人  到底是多少人
<32-4,Dugan>Some. How many we talking about?

929
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,710
<32-5,Masters>可观的数目
<32-5,Masters>A fair amount.

930
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
<32-6,Dugan>跟我说下百分比
<32-6,Dugan>Give me a percentage.

931
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,520
<32-6,Dugan>这种方法的成功率有多高
<32-6,Dugan>What are the odds of this thing working?

932
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,070
<32-7,Masters>有85%的可能会致死
<32-7,Masters>There is an 85% chance that this will kill you.

933
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,800
<32-8,Dugan>这么说
<32-8,Dugan>So, you wanna

934
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,850
<32-8,Dugan>你要给我的治疗比喝砒霜的
<32-8,Dugan>give me something that works

935
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,090
<32-8,Dugan>生还率高个15%
<32-8,Dugan>15% better than arsenic?

936
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,080
<32-9,Masters>理论上讲  生还率要高无数倍
<32-9,Masters>Well, technically, it works infinitely better

937
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,680
<32-9,Masters>因为喝砒霜活命的机会...为零
<32-9,Masters>because arsenic has a 0% ch--chance.

938
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,130
<32-9,Masters>这是你唯一的机会
<32-9,Masters>This is your only shot.

939
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,280
<32-9,Masters>我和豪斯医生都这么认为
<32-9,Masters>Both Dr. House and I believe that.

940
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,840
<32-9,Masters>为了给你批这个治疗方案
<32-9,Masters>He faked a blood test in order

941
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,060
<32-9,Masters>他伪造了血液测试
<32-9,Masters>to get you approved for this treatment.

942
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,260
<32-9,Masters>他还试图贿赂我
<32-9,Masters>And then he tried to bribe me

943
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,840
<32-9,Masters>向你隐瞒风险
<32-9,Masters>into lying to you about the risks.

944
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,270
<32-9,Masters>如果这些事情被查出来
<32-9,Masters>If either of those incidents came to light,

945
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,680
<32-9,Masters>他将会停诊
<32-9,Masters>he would be suspended

946
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,300
<32-9,Masters>很可能被吊销执照
<32-9,Masters>and probably lose his license.

947
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,030
<32-10,House>肯定还会有其他人跟着受苦
<32-10,House>Oh, I'm sure some other people would suffer.

948
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,660
<32-11,Masters>他拿自己的职业生涯作赌注换你这次机会
<32-11,Masters>He's risking his career to give you this chance.

949
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,840
<32-11,Masters>如果还有其他选择  他是不会这样做的
<32-11,Masters>He wouldn't do that if there was any other choice.

950
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,440
<32-12,Masters>我做到了  而且没说谎
<32-12,Masters>I did it. And I didn't have to lie.

951
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,950
<32-13,House>你自我感觉很好是吗
<32-13,House>And you feel good about that?

952
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,300
<32-15,House>-是的  -这么说我雇了个白痴
<32-15,House>- Yes. - So I'm hiring an idiot.

953
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,690
<32-16,Masters>你可以假装想让我说谎

<32-16,Masters>但其实不然

957
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,940
<32-16,Masters>而不是个好医生

<32-16,Masters>你雇我  因为我坚持自己的原则不妥协

<32-17,House>或者我想最先看到  有一天你清醒过来
<32-17,House>Or I want a front row seat when you wake up

960
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,620
<32-17,House>认识到你的原则有多没用
<32-17,House>and realize how useless your principals are.

<32-17,House>我不要你单纯欺骗病人
<32-17,House>I don't want you to just lie to a patient.

<33-5,Masters>但我总觉得有些尴尬
<33-5,Masters>I felt really awkward about the whole thing.
