<6-7,LAWRENCE KUTNER>你就这么彻底离开音乐事业了?
<6-7,LAWRENCE KUTNER>And you just completely/left the music business?

126
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,910
<6-8,ROZ VINER>流行音乐被认为是轻浮的
<6-8,ROZ VINER>Pop music is considered frivolous.

<6-10,LAWRENCE KUTNER>So you can never watch star wars again.

131
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,100
<7-1,GREG HOUSE>你琢磨只要答应甩掉Wilson 我就会雇你
<7-1,GREG HOUSE>You figured that I'll hire you/if you promise to dump Wilson.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,310
<7-7,GREG HOUSE>你知道不是的
<7-7,GREG HOUSE>You know it's not.

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,750
<7-7,GREG HOUSE>说明你只是想留在我的生活圈里
<7-7,GREG HOUSE>Means you just wanna stay in my orbit.

140
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,320
<7-7,GREG HOUSE>你觉得最终我会意识到自己犯了错

<7-9,GREG HOUSE>And you know it's not.

146
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,600
<7-9,GREG HOUSE>因为你知道即使我错了 也绝不会承认
<7-9,GREG HOUSE>'Cause you know that even if I made a/mistake,I'd never admit that I made a mistake.

147
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:58,060
<7-9,GREG HOUSE>说明你只是通过玩弄Wilson来玩弄我
<7-9,GREG HOUSE>Which means that you're just/toying with Wilson to toy with me.

148
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,470
<7-10,GREG HOUSE>你的目的是单纯的凶猛复仇
<7-10,GREG HOUSE>Your goal is pure feral vengeance.

<7-12,GREG HOUSE>No,that's not it.

151
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,350
<7-12,GREG HOUSE>因为燃着了的大便袋不会朝旁观者投
<7-12,GREG HOUSE>Because a bag of flaming/poop bypasses the bystander.

152
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,310
<7-12,GREG HOUSE>所以...
<7-12,GREG HOUSE>So...

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,940
<10-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>我要求换一个医生
<10-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>I want a new doctor.

221
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,540
<10-17,LISA CUDDY>我去给她上吲哚美辛/就按冷球蛋白血症来治
<10-17,LISA CUDDY>I'm stting her on indomethacin/for cryoglobulemia.

222
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,440
<10-18,GREG HOUSE>人是不会改变的
<10-18,GREG HOUSE>People don't change.

223
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,420
<10-18,GREG HOUSE>比如我就会一直重复 "人是不会改变的"
<10-18,GREG HOUSE>For example,I'm gonna/keep repeating: People don't change.

224
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,940
<10-19,LISA CUDDY>所以根本不存在经治疗而戒瘾的酗酒者?
<10-19,LISA CUDDY>So alcoholics that successfully/go through treatment don't exist.

225
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,540
<10-20,GREG HOUSE>照样是酒鬼
<10-20,GREG HOUSE>They're still alcoholics.

226
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,090
<10-20,GREG HOUSE>如果他们到死都没有再喝上一杯
<10-20,GREG HOUSE>If they never take a/drink as long as they live,

227
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,090
<10-20,GREG HOUSE>那是因为他们活得不够久
<10-20,GREG HOUSE>it's only 'cause they/didn't live long enough.

228
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,850
<10-21,LISA CUDDY>如果对自己的生活不满/精神健全的人都会寻求改变
<10-21,LISA CUDDY>If you're dissatisfied with your/life,changing it is a symptom of mental health.

229
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,630
<10-22,LISA CUDDY>我明白 你很难理解这个道理
<10-22,LISA CUDDY>I get why that concept is strange to you.

230
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,870
<11-1,THIRTEEN>氧和度85  她缺氧
<11-1,THIRTEEN>O2 sats are 85. She's hypoxic.

231
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,550
<11-1,THIRTEEN>可能需要插管
<11-1,THIRTEEN>We might need to intubate.

232
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,390
<11-2,YONATAN ARNOFF>她怎么回事?
<11-2,YONATAN ARNOFF>What's wrong with her?

233
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,200
<11-3,LISA CUDDY>绝对不是冷球蛋白血症
<11-3,LISA CUDDY>It's definitely not cryoglobulinemia.

234
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,100
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>去问上帝吧
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>Better ask him.

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,060
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>给她输了整晚的氧气
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>we kept her on oxygen overnight.

236
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,090
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>现在呼吸已经稳定 氧和度也回升到95
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>Her respiratory rate stabilized,and/her o-sat's back up to 95.

237
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,280
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>我今早看见Amber送Wilson来上班
<11-4,GREG HOUSE>I saw Amber drop off Wilson this morning.

238
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,260
<13-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>是啊 都是男人开车送女人的啦
<13-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Yes,the male always drives the female.

239
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,290
<13-2,GREG HOUSE>呼吸问题是由什么导致的呢?
<13-2,GREG HOUSE>So what caused the breathing problem?

240
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,930
<13-3,THIRTEEN>肺部问题说明不是卟啉症
<13-3,THIRTEEN>pulmonary involvement rules/out porphyria.

241
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,330
<13-4,CHRIS TAUB>谁主动去吻别的?
<13-4,CHRIS TAUB>She kiss him or he kiss her?

242
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,040
<13-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>没看到
<13-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I missed it.

243
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,180
<13-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>那个戴舌钉的实验室技术员正好也在停车
<13-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>The lab tech with the/tonguestud also pulled up.

244
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,230
<13-6,ERIC FOREMAN>韦格纳病可以解释血沉速率的升高
<13-6,ERIC FOREMAN>Wegener's would explain her/elevated sed rate.

245
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,770
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>韦格纳病不能解释精神状态的改变
<13-7,GREG HOUSE>Wegener's wouldn't explain the/changed mental status.

246
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,740
<13-8,THIRTEEN>其实我们不信服白板上的那行字
<13-8,THIRTEEN>Actually,we've been trying to/ignore that part of the whiteboard.

247
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,350
<13-9,GREG HOUSE>我是用黑笔写的
<13-9,GREG HOUSE>I wrote it in black.

248
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,660
<13-9,GREG HOUSE>我用黑笔的时候可都是很认真的
<13-9,GREG HOUSE>I'm always serious when I use black.

249
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,800
<13-10,THIRTEEN>- 红斑狼疮可以解释.../- 也许她没有改变呢
<13-10,THIRTEEN>- Lupus would explain- -/maybe she didn't change.

250
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,410
<13-11,GREG HOUSE>你是同意我呢 还是另有想法?
<13-11,GREG HOUSE>Are you agreeing with/me or you making a point?

251
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,860
<13-12,THIRTEEN>另有想法
<13-12,THIRTEEN>I'm making a point.

252
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,530
<13-13,GREG HOUSE>这下有的耗了
<13-13,GREG HOUSE>That's gonna take longer.

253
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,360
<13-14,THIRTEEN>我们怎么知道现在的Roz是伪装的/她以前是怎么样的人?
<13-14,THIRTEEN>How do we know that the real roz isn't/who she is now and who she was then?

254
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,210
<13-14,THIRTEEN>难道仅仅因为她的过去是真实的/就断定她的现在是虚伪的吗?
<13-14,THIRTEEN>Can't we say that her previous life was/true without making her present one a fraud?

255
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,870
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>"生活是一团麻" 很好
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>"Life is messy" argument. Nice.

256
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,830
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>说了等于白说
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>Explains everything/without explaining anything.

257
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,290
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>如果是红斑狼疮 那心脏可能会有问题
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>If it's lupus,there's a heart/problem we don't know about yet.

258
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,610
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>给她做应激测试
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>Run her through a stress test.

259
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,280
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>如果发生心脏病 我就是对的
<13-15,GREG HOUSE>If she has a heart attack,I'm right.

260
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,810
<13-16,CHRIS TAUB>或者也可以等等 也许...
<13-16,CHRIS TAUB>Or we could/wait,hope that--

261
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,180
<13-17,GREG HOUSE>你担心她会发生心脏病
<13-17,GREG HOUSE>you're afraid to give her a heart attack.

262
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,820
<13-18,CHRIS TAUB>- 当然担心了/- 没理由担心
<13-18,CHRIS TAUB>- Of course we're afraid-/- no reason to be afraid.

263
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,940
<13-19,GREG HOUSE>除非你觉得我是对的
<13-19,GREG HOUSE>Unless you think I'm right.

264
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,570
<13-20,CHRIS TAUB>是韦格纳病
<13-20,CHRIS TAUB>It's wegener's.

265
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,330
<13-21,CHRIS TAUB>但我们会准备急救车 以防万一
<13-21,CHRIS TAUB>But we'll have the/crash cart just in case.

266
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,950
<13-21,CHRIS TAUB>哦 我的天!
<13-21,CHRIS TAUB>Oh,my god!

<14-2,GREG HOUSE>突然间我很想凑热闹
<14-2,GREG HOUSE>I had a sudden yen for fusion.

269

<14-3,JAMES WILSON>我明明在记事本里写的另一个餐馆
<14-3,JAMES WILSON>I put a different/restaurant in my date book.

270
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,600
<14-3,JAMES WILSON>我得把我的助手炒掉
<14-3,JAMES WILSON>I'm firing my assistant.

<14-4,AMBER VOLAKIS>没事 你好啊 Greg
<14-4,AMBER VOLAKIS>That's okay. Hi,greg.

272

<14-4,AMBER VOLAKIS>我叫你Greg/因为现在我们社会地位平等了
<14-4,AMBER VOLAKIS>And I call you greg because/we're now social equals.

273

<14-5,GREG HOUSE>And I speak in latin because I/don't try to hide what an ass I am.

<14-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>看来你要和我们一起喽?
<14-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>I assume you'd like to join us?

277
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,150
<14-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>同桌的话更能方便你观察我们的交流
<14-6,AMBER VOLAKIS>It'll be easier to observe our/interaction if you're at the same table.

278
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,940
<14-7,JAMES WILSON>如果我们有桌子的话
<14-7,JAMES WILSON>If we ever get seated.

279
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,940
<14-8,AMBER VOLAKIS>失陪一下
<14-8,AMBER VOLAKIS>Excuse me.

<14-11,GREG HOUSE>any minute now,she's gonna hit/him in the face with your testicles.

282
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,920
<14-12,JAMES WILSON>她总是...
<14-12,JAMES WILSON>She tends/to treat e--

<14-12,JAMES WILSON>她对待每一件事 都不放过任何机会
<14-12,JAMES WILSON>she tends to treat every event like/it's the last copterout of saigon.

<14-13,GREG HOUSE>她就是你的反面
<14-13,GREG HOUSE>She's the anti-Wilson.

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,500
<14-13,GREG HOUSE>她邪恶无比
<14-13,GREG HOUSE>She's a force for evil.

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,120
<14-14,JAMES WILSON>她有点讨厌
<14-14,JAMES WILSON>She has an annoying quality.

287
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,220
<14-14,JAMES WILSON>也许还不止一点
<14-14,JAMES WILSON>Perhaps even two.

288
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,020
<14-14,JAMES WILSON>可惜我也不完美 所以不能要求对方完美
<14-14,JAMES WILSON>If I was perfect,I would date perfect.

289
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,050
<14-15,GREG HOUSE>你很享受嘛!
<14-15,GREG HOUSE>You like that!

<14-16,JAMES WILSON>她很讨厌 但这是她的长处
<14-16,JAMES WILSON>It's annoying,but she's good at it.

291
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,800
<14-17,GREG HOUSE>且慢
<14-17,GREG HOUSE>Wait a second.

<14-18,GREG HOUSE>这不仅仅是关于性爱的
<14-18,GREG HOUSE>This isn't just about the sex.

<14-18,GREG HOUSE>You like that she can humiliate/someone if it serves--

297
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,330
<14-19,GREG HOUSE>哦我的天
<14-19,GREG HOUSE>oh,my god.

<15-1,CHRIS TAUB>你得再快点 Roz
<15-1,CHRIS TAUB>I need you to go faster,roz.

300
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,710
<15-2,CHRIS TAUB>再用点力
<15-2,CHRIS TAUB>A little harder.

301
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,340
<15-3,ROZ VINER>我在用力了 见鬼
<15-3,ROZ VINER>I am going harder,damn it.

302
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,520
<15-4,YONATAN ARNOFF>如果House医生是对的呢?
<15-4,YONATAN ARNOFF>What if dr. House was right?

303
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,060
<15-4,YONATAN ARNOFF>Roz真的经历了巨大转变呢?
<15-4,YONATAN ARNOFF>And roz did make a radical change?

304
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,600
<15-5,CHRIS TAUB>红斑狼疮是慢性病 但可以治好
<15-5,CHRIS TAUB>Lupus is chronic but treatable.

305
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,260
<15-6,YONATAN ARNOFF>治愈之后 就会恢复原状?
<15-6,YONATAN ARNOFF>And with the treatment,it'd/undo the change?

306
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,990
<15-6,YONATAN ARNOFF>她就会变成我们相遇之前的样子?
<15-6,YONATAN ARNOFF>She'll be the way she/was before I knew her?

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,710
<15-7,CHRIS TAUB>我看不大可能
<15-7,CHRIS TAUB>I don't think it's likely.

308
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,490
<15-8,YONATAN ARNOFF>这么说你并不确定
<15-8,YONATAN ARNOFF>Then you don't know for sure.

309
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,770
<15-9,CHRIS TAUB>会有别人让你心动的
<15-9,CHRIS TAUB>You'd find someone else.

310
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,640
<15-10,YONATAN ARNOFF>没有别的人了
<15-10,YONATAN ARNOFF>There isn't someone else.

<15-11,CHRIS TAUB>你们约会才三次而已
<15-11,CHRIS TAUB>You've had three dates.

<15-14,YONATAN ARNOFF>她还是你心所属吗?
<15-14,YONATAN ARNOFF>And is she the one?

315
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,770
<15-15,CHRIS TAUB>不然我们怎么会还在一起
<15-15,CHRIS TAUB>We wouldn't still be/together if she weren'T.

316
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,210
<15-15,CHRIS TAUB>我对她的爱一如当初...
<15-15,CHRIS TAUB>I love her as much/nowas the day--

317
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,480
<15-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>可是你的爱应该更深
<15-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>well,you should love her more.

<15-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>相识越久 你的爱就应该越深
<15-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>The more you know someone,e/more you should love them.

319
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,030
<15-17,CHRIS TAUB>好的 可以了Roz
<15-17,CHRIS TAUB>Okay,that's enough,roz.

320

<15-18,CHRIS TAUB>很好 你的心脏十分强壮
<15-18,CHRIS TAUB>Okay,your heart's as/strong as a battleship.

321
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,530
<15-19,YONATAN ARNOFF>这是不是说明House诊断有误?
<15-19,YONATAN ARNOFF>Yon does this mean dr. House was wrong?

322
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,780
<15-20,ROZ VINER>哦 我的腿!
<15-20,ROZ VINER>Oh! Oh,my leg!

323
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,130
<16-1,ERIC FOREMAN>心脏很健康 说明你错了/精神状态没有改变
<16-1,ERIC FOREMAN>Heart's strong enough to prove you/wrong about the change in mental status.

324
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,850
<16-2,GREG HOUSE>只能说明不是红斑狼疮
<16-2,GREG HOUSE>Only proves this isn't lupus.

325

00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,200
<27-7,GREG HOUSE>说"干得漂亮 Chase"的时候/你要不在场就没意思了
<27-7,GREG HOUSE>Saying,"nice work,chase"when/you're not here is pointless.

640
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,320
<27-8,GREG HOUSE>说真的 我们需要你
<27-8,GREG HOUSE>Seriously,we need you.

641
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,340
<27-9,THIRTEEN>可能是肋骨畸形导致动脉扭曲/要做X线摄片确定
<27-9,THIRTEEN>We should x-ray for malformations of the/rib that could cause arterial twisting.

642
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,440
<27-10,GREG HOUSE>但畸形不会导致血尿
<27-10,GREG HOUSE>Malformations don't cause bloody urine.

643
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,970
<27-10,GREG HOUSE>她不是想自杀
<27-10,GREG HOUSE>She's not suicidal.

644
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,330
<27-11,CHRIS TAUB>她想和她的丈夫开始新的生活
<27-11,CHRIS TAUB>She made a commitment to/a new life with her husband

645
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,400
<27-11,CHRIS TAUB>她想开始有意义的人生
<27-11,CHRIS TAUB>and she wants one/meaningful experience in that life.

646
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,460
<27-12,ERIC FOREMAN>她和那男人相识没多久
<27-12,ERIC FOREMAN>She just met the guy.

647
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,230
<27-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Taub也才碰见她
<27-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>taub just met her.

648
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,300
<27-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>然后就这么相爱了/他已经准备好在她死后
<27-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>And he's already so in/love,he's ready to let her die

649
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,790
<27-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>把她带回母星球 埋葬在熔岩海里
<27-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>and take her back to the home planet/for a buria lin the lava sea of tormiad.

650
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,600
<27-14,CHRIS TAUB>也许他就是这种人
<27-14,CHRIS TAUB>It's who he might be.

651
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,530
<27-14,CHRIS TAUB>她在用心感应/她无法再拥有的时光
<27-14,CHRIS TAUB>She's connecting with all the/years she's not gonna have.

652
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,260
<27-15,GREG HOUSE>去感应倒不如去拥有
<27-15,GREG HOUSE>Better way of connecting to those/years is to actually have them.

653
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,890
<27-16,ROBERT CHASE>想争取时间?
<27-16,ROBERT CHASE>You want more time?

654
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,850
<27-17,ROBERT CHASE>约书亚祈求上帝让时间停留在白天
<27-17,ROBERT CHASE>Joshua got god to/make the sun stand still.

655
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,450
<27-17,ROBERT CHASE>没理由上帝不能让时间走快一点
<27-17,ROBERT CHASE>No reason god can't speed it up.

656
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,690
<27-17,ROBERT CHASE>说的上帝 当然我指的是你
<27-17,ROBERT CHASE>And,by god,I of course mean you.

657
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,060
<27-18,GREG HOUSE>我就说我们需要你嘛
<27-18,GREG HOUSE>Told you we needed you.

658
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,720
<28-1,CHRIS TAUB>太阳落山了 Roz
<28-1,CHRIS TAUB>It's sun down,roz.

659
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,410
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>我们要带你回房间去吃圣餐/准备好了吗?
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>We're taking you back to your room/for your candle light dinner. Ready?

660
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,040
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>一 二 三
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>One,two three.

661
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,120
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>是不是太早了
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>It's too early.

662
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,270
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>药物使你对时间的感觉模糊了
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>Your sense of time is/off because of the medication.

663
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,410
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>愿主保佑 Roz
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>Good shabbos,roz.

664
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,700
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>所以你祈祷和吃完圣餐/我们就可以做手术了?
<28-2,ERIC FOREMAN>So you pray,scarf down some/challah,then we can do this?

665
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,110
<31-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>你想见我?
<31-1,AMBER VOLAKIS>You wanted to see me?

666
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,240
<31-2,GREG HOUSE>你就来了
<31-2,GREG HOUSE>And you came.

667
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,900
<31-3,AMBER VOLAKIS>我相信会有什么有趣的事儿
<31-3,AMBER VOLAKIS>I feel pretty confident/it'll be something interesting.

668
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,010
<31-4,GREG HOUSE>搞定了这病例 工作就是你的
<31-4,GREG HOUSE>Solve this case and the job is yours.

669
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,670
<31-5,AMBER VOLAKIS>是不是有条叫做"甩掉Wilson"/的附加条款呢?
<31-5,AMBER VOLAKIS>Is there a "drop Wilson"/clause attached to this?

670
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,000
<31-6,GREG HOUSE>签统一格式的合同
<31-6,GREG HOUSE>Standard contract all employees sign.

671
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,160
<31-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>为什么你非要认为我动机不纯呢?
<31-7,AMBER VOLAKIS>Why do you have to believe I/have an ulterior motive?

672
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,370
<31-8,GREG HOUSE>跟吸毒的妓女为了毒品/跟人上床是一个道理
<31-8,GREG HOUSE>For the same reason I believe that/crack whores can have sex for crack.

673
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,140
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>我这一生中
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>All my life

674
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,310
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>一直以为我要在爱和尊重之间选择
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>I thought I had to choose/between love and respect.

675
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,960
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>而我选择了尊重
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>And I chose respect.

676
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,640
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>但是跟Wilson在一起...
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>And with Wilson...

677
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,060
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>我知道我两者都拥有了
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>I know what it's like to have both.

678
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,530
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>这比当你的下属更宝贵
<31-9,AMBER VOLAKIS>And that beats a fellowship.

679
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,600
<31-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>可能是弥漫性血管内凝血
<31-10,AMBER VOLAKIS>Could be D.I.C.

680
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,860
<31-11,GREG HOUSE>你变了
<31-11,GREG HOUSE>You've changed.

681
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,840
<31-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>但愿如此
<31-12,AMBER VOLAKIS>I hope so.

682
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,390
<31-13,GREG HOUSE>血小板计数正常/排除了弥漫性血管内凝血
<31-13,GREG HOUSE>Normal platelet count rules out D.I.C.

683
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,560
<31-13,GREG HOUSE>猜得不错
<31-13,GREG HOUSE>Good try though.

684
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,710
<34-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>我发现了个包虫囊 可能会...
<34-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>I read that a/hydatid cyst could--

685
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,570
<34-3,GREG HOUSE>可能会感染肺 但不会感染膀胱
<34-3,GREG HOUSE>would affect the lungs,not the bladder.

686
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,370
<34-4,ERIC FOREMAN>又测了一遍白细胞计数 正常
<34-4,ERIC FOREMAN>Tested her white/cell count again. Normal.

687
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,040
<34-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>还要多久能给她做手术?
<34-5,LAWRENCE KUTNER>How long till weget to cut her open?

688
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,840
<34-6,CHRIS TAUB>我离开的时候他还在唱什么eshet的东东
<34-6,CHRIS TAUB>When I left,he was/still singing eshet something.

689
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,440
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>那是丈夫在为他的妻子祈福
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>The husband's blessing of his wife.

690
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,890
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>他称她为上帝赐予的最珍贵的礼物
<34-7,GREG HOUSE>He calls her eshet/chayil,woman of valor.

691
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,860
<34-9,GREG HOUSE>"力量和荣耀是她的衣裳 她笑对人生"
<34-9,GREG HOUSE>"Strength and honor are her/clothing. She laughs at the future."

692
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,290
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>因为她就是个白痴
<34-10,GREG HOUSE>Because she's an idiot.

693
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,930
<34-11,CHRIS TAUB>小肠扭转可能会导致出血
<34-11,CHRIS TAUB>Volvulus of the small/intestine could cause bleeding.

694
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,810
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>那会有便秘
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>She would have had constipation.

695
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,060
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>她的价值也算不上"比珍珠更珍贵"
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>Her value isn't "beyond pearls" either.

696
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,790
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>因为死人没什么价值可言
<34-12,GREG HOUSE>'Cause dead people have no value.

697
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,230
<34-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>真红细胞增多症
<34-13,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Polycythemia vera.

698
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,690
<34-14,GREG HOUSE>那样红细胞计数应该是高的
<34-14,GREG HOUSE>Rbc count would be higher.

699
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,880
<35-1,ROZ VINER>我要那光照耀我的脸
<35-1,ROZ VINER>I need to bring the light to my face.

700
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,290
<35-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>血小板减少症
<35-2,LAWRENCE KUTNER>thrombocytopenia.

701
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,390
<35-3,ERIC FOREMAN>- 要是是自身免疫病的话.../- 滴度正常
<35-3,ERIC FOREMAN>- If it's autoimmune-/- titers were normal.

702
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,180
<36-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>帕金森病可以解释低体温
<36-1,LAWRENCE KUTNER>Parkinson's would/explain the hypothermia.

703
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,170
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>但解释不了血尿
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>Not the bloody urine.

704
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,130
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>那女人不光是个性虐者/她还是个伪君子
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>The woman's not just a/masochist,she's a hypocrite.

705
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,530
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>追求生命的戒律高于一切
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>The commandment to preserve/life comes before all others.

706
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,520
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>也说明了她不是个受虐者
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>Actually means she's not a masochist.

707
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,340
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>她并不守所有的戒律 只追随她所喜欢的
<36-2,GREG HOUSE>She's not following all the/rules,just the ones that please her.

708
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,700
<38-1,CHRIS TAUB>对 就这么神经兮兮来到医院/鼓吹宗教胜过生命
<38-1,CHRIS TAUB>Right,she walked in crazy and/explained how ritual trumps living,

709
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,570
<38-2,GREG HOUSE>你还觉得这是美好的生活方式
<38-2,GREG HOUSE>and you decide it's a/beautiful life style.

710
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,630
<38-3,CHRIS TAUB>我知道
<38-3,CHRIS TAUB>I know.

711
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,480
<38-3,CHRIS TAUB>她错了
<38-3,CHRIS TAUB>She's wrong.

712
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,320
<38-5,CHRIS TAUB>如果再没有--
<38-5,CHRIS TAUB>But if/there's nothing more--

713
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,110
<39-1,GREG HOUSE>唯一的意义只在此岸
<39-1,GREG HOUSE>then the only meaning is here.

714
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,320
<39-2,CHRIS TAUB>但是如果她认为上帝在守候她
<39-2,CHRIS TAUB>but if she thinks god is there for her,

715
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,170
<40-1,CHRIS TAUB>如果一生坚信上帝与她同在
<40-1,CHRIS TAUB>if she lives her life believing/that god is there--

716
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,410
<40-2,GREG HOUSE>那她就死定了
<40-2,GREG HOUSE>then she dies.

717
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,770
<40-3,GREG HOUSE>万物并不因人的意志而存在
<40-3,GREG HOUSE>Things aren't where we want them to be/just because we want them to be there.

718
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,290
<40-4,GREG HOUSE>这也不意味着它们就在原地老实待着
<40-4,GREG HOUSE>Of course,that doesn't/mean they're where they should be.

719
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,850
<41-1,GREG HOUSE>让那个犹太人拦下
<41-1,GREG HOUSE>Stop that jew.

720
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,220
<41-2,GREG HOUSE>Chase不喜欢在安息日干活
<41-2,GREG HOUSE>Chase hates working on shabbos.

721
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,210
<41-2,GREG HOUSE>给他帮个小忙 扶她站起来
<41-2,GREG HOUSE>Gonna make this easier/for him. Stand her up.

722
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,730
<41-3,THIRTEEN>她脚不好使
<41-3,THIRTEEN>She doesn't do so well on her feet.

723
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,640
<41-4,GREG HOUSE>我也是
<41-4,GREG HOUSE>Neither do I.

724
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,840
<41-4,GREG HOUSE>扶她站起来
<41-4,GREG HOUSE>Stand her up.

725
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,230
<41-5,GREG HOUSE>你可以在浸礼池前告诉/所有的女士这个故事
<41-5,GREG HOUSE>You can tell all the ladies at/the mikvah about this.

726
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,760
<41-6,ROZ VINER>你干了什么?
<41-6,ROZ VINER>what did you do?

727
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,380
<41-7,YONATAN ARNOFF>你在干什么?
<41-7,YONATAN ARNOFF>What are you doing?

728
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,620
<41-8,GREG HOUSE>把手放在这里 用力压
<41-8,GREG HOUSE>Put your hand here. Press hard.

729
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,410
<41-9,GREG HOUSE>你有肾下垂
<41-9,GREG HOUSE>You have nephroptosis.

730
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,000
<41-9,GREG HOUSE>也就是"游走肾"
<41-9,GREG HOUSE>Also known as "floating kidney."

731
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,840
<41-9,GREG HOUSE>她的肾就像个晃晃悠悠的吊灯
<41-9,GREG HOUSE>The kidney's like a chandelier.

732
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,980
<41-10,GREG HOUSE>黏在肠壁和血管做的天花板上
<41-10,GREG HOUSE>It's attached to a ceiling/of intestines and blood vessels.

733
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,910
<41-10,GREG HOUSE>但是创造你的上帝自以为是/用根劣质的链子挂你的肾
<41-10,GREG HOUSE>But your contractor--think you know who/he is-- he hung it with a cheap chain.

734
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,990
<41-10,GREG HOUSE>就这么晃晃悠悠的挂了好多年
<41-10,GREG HOUSE>It's been hanging sloppy for years.

735
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,460
<41-12,GREG HOUSE>最终被摇松了
<41-12,GREG HOUSE>Finally something shook it loose.

736
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:51,030
<41-13,GREG HOUSE>在这之后 每次你站起来/你的肾都会下坠几厘米
<41-13,GREG HOUSE>After that,every time you stood,your/kidney dropped a few centimeters,

737
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,240
<41-13,GREG HOUSE>导致了你所有的症状
<41-13,GREG HOUSE>caused all your symptoms.

738
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,640
<41-14,THIRTEEN>所有的扫描都没有发现
<41-14,THIRTEEN>None of the scans picked it up.

739
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,760
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>因为做扫描的时候病人都是躺着的
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>Because we do scans with/patients lying down.

740
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,720
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>她做手术的时候也是躺着的
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>She'd have been lyin down in surgery too.

741
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,390
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>所以从来没被发现过
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>Never have found it.

742
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,620
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>她撑不过去可能也很大
<41-15,GREG HOUSE>Good chance she'd never come out.

743
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,670
<41-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>她会好吗?
<41-16,YONATAN ARNOFF>She'll be all right?

744
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,810
<41-17,GREG HOUSE>超声确诊/告诉Chase把她那肾挂回去
