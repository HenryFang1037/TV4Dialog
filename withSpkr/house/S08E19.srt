<3-3,House>你说呢

<3-5,House>也是啊  问他就简单多了
<3-5,House>Actually, that would have been easier.

61
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,350
<3-5,House>不是  我跟踪你来的
<3-5,House>No, I followed you.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,150
<3-6,Wilson>你难道没发现
<3-6,Wilson>It didn't occur to you that that might mean

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,330
<3-6,Wilson>我不想你来搅和我的癌症治疗吗
<3-6,Wilson>I don't want you involved in my cancer treatment?

64
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,520
<3-7,House>我不是以医生的身份来的
<3-7,House>I'm not here as a doctor.

65
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,800
<3-7,House>我是来给你当支柱  给你打气的
<3-7,House>I'm here as a towering pillar of strength.

69
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,190
<3-9,House>我不想你来烦我  但你就是不放过我
<3-9,House>I wanted to be alone and you've made yourself a pain in the ass?

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,250
<3-9,House>我欠你的
<3-9,House>I owe you.

71
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,640
<3-9,House>我说到做到  不是虚言
<3-9,House>My word, not a word.

72
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,920
<3-10,Wilson>我能预感到我会后悔的
<3-10,Wilson>Realizing I'm most likely going to regret this,

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,090
<3-10,Wilson>但好吧
<3-10,Wilson>all right.

74
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,940
<3-11,Wilson>你干什么呢
<3-11,Wilson>What--what are you doing?

75
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,170
<3-12,House>我的挚友得了癌症
<3-12,House>My best friend has cancer.

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,630
<3-12,House>放我一马吧
<3-12,House>Cut me some slack.

77

79
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,240

<3-12,House>Although looking at you now, I can tell the wet t-shirt contest

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,310
<3-12,House>肯定会输
<3-12,House>is probably gonna suck.

82
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,980
<4-1,Taub>豪斯休假
<4-1,Taub>House taking time off

83
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,130
<4-1,Taub>可是个不祥的预兆
<4-1,Taub>is a bad sign.

84
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,720
<4-1,Taub>"不祥的预兆"
<4-1,Taub>"A bad sign."

85
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,760
<4-2,Adams>就因为豪斯想陪陪威尔森
<4-2,Adams>You think the apocalypse is coming

86
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,030
<4-2,Adams>你就认为世界末日要到了吗
<4-2,Adams>because House wants to be there for Wilson?

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,900
<4-3,Taub>对
<4-3,Taub>Yes.

88
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,610
<4-3,Taub>你还嫩
<4-3,Taub>You're new.

89
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,610
<4-4,Foreman>有个病例

<4-4,Foreman>毛细血管扩张性共济失调基因突变[AT]
<4-4,Foreman>a rare mutation of A-T.

94
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,240
<4-5,Elizabeth>艾米丽在其一对ATM等位基因上
<4-5,Elizabeth>Emily has a unique variant

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,170
<4-5,Elizabeth>均有一罕见的变异
<4-5,Elizabeth>on both of her ATM genes.

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,810
<4-5,Elizabeth>其表现类似AT
<4-5,Elizabeth>Her disorder mimics A-T,

97
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,240
<4-5,Elizabeth>但未表现出所有症状
<4-5,Elizabeth>but not all of the symptoms.

98
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,110
<4-6,Foreman>这位是伊丽莎白·劳森医生
<4-6,Foreman>This is Dr. Elizabeth Lawson.

<4-6,Foreman>She's a developmental geneticist

100
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,900
<4-6,Foreman>对这个女孩的状况了如指掌
<4-6,Foreman>attached to JHU and an expert on the girl's condition.

101
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,210
<4-7,Chase>伊丽莎白·劳森
<4-7,Chase>Elizabeth Lawson.

102
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,020
<4-7,Chase>艾米丽·劳森
<4-7,Chase>Emily Lawson.

103
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,310
<4-8,Elizabeth>我是以医生的身份来的  不是一个母亲
<4-8,Elizabeth>I'm here as a doctor, not a mother.

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,120
<4-9,Taub>鼻出血及气促是毛细血管扩张性
<4-9,Taub>Nosebleeds and breathing problems are common symptoms

<4-9,Taub>of ataxia telangiectasia.

106
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,880
<4-10,Park>可能我们看到的就是
<4-10,Park>We could just be seeing

107
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,200
<4-10,Park>-这一疾病的自然演进  -不是
<4-10,Park>- the natural progression-- - It's not.

108
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,620
<4-11,Elizabeth>AT患者的预期寿命为二十年
<4-11,Elizabeth>A-T patients have a life expectancy of 20 years.

109
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,720
<4-11,Elizabeth>艾米丽才六岁  肯定是别的原因
<4-11,Elizabeth>Emily is only six. It's something else.

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,640
<4-11,Elizabeth>两天前我检查过她的双肺
<4-11,Elizabeth>I examined her lungs two days ago.

111
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,040
<4-11,Elizabeth>功能正常
<4-11,Elizabeth>They're functioning normally.

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,570
<4-12,Adams>她从旋转木马上掉了下来
<4-12,Adams>It says she fell off a carousel.

<4-13,Elizabeth>- Head trauma-- - If the diagnosis was easy,

114
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,070
<4-13,Elizabeth>我就不用找你们了
<4-13,Elizabeth>I wouldn't need you people.

115
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,840
<4-13,Elizabeth>艾瑞克说你们是最棒的  所以我才来的
<4-13,Elizabeth>I'm here because, according to Eric,you're the best.

116
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,190
<4-14,Park>的确
<4-14,Park>We are.

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,210
<4-14,Park>你有没有想过韦格纳肉芽肿
<4-14,Park>Have you considered wegener's granulomatosis?

118
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,290
<4-15,Elizabeth>挺符合症状的
<4-15,Elizabeth>It's a good fit.

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,490
<4-15,Elizabeth>但她不能做X光检查
<4-15,Elizabeth>But she can't have X-rays.

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,090
<4-15,Elizabeth>AT导致她对电离辐射高敏
<4-15,Elizabeth>A-T makes her hypersensitive to ionizing radiation.

121
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,520
<4-15,Elizabeth>我给她做次核磁共振吧
<4-15,Elizabeth>I'll get her prepped for an MRI.

122
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,430
<4-16,Foreman>她比你们任何人
<4-16,Foreman>She knows more about her daughter's

123
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,540
<4-16,Foreman>都更清楚她女儿的遗传病
<4-16,Foreman>genetic condition than any of you.

124
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,460
<4-16,Foreman>她会很有帮助的
<4-16,Foreman>She'll be an asset.

125
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,330
<4-17,Chase>或者不会
<4-17,Chase>Or she won't,

126
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,240
<4-17,Chase>艾瑞克
<4-17,Chase>Eric.

127
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,340
<4-18,Foreman>这不是请求
<4-18,Foreman>This isn't a request.

128
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,410
<4-18,Foreman>用她吧
<4-18,Foreman>Use her.

129
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,640
<4-18,Foreman>肿瘤已向周边组织扩散
<4-18,Foreman>The tumor's spread to the surrounding tissue.

130
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,890
<4-18,Foreman>在手术切除前
<4-18,Foreman>We're gonna have to shrink it

131
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,640
<4-19,Wilson>我们得先将肿块缩小
<4-19,Wilson>before we remove it surgically.

132
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,310
<4-19,Wilson>我对你准备怎么做
<4-19,Wilson>I'm more interested in exactly

133
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,850
<4-19,Wilson>更感兴趣  迈克
<4-19,Wilson>how you plan to do that, Mike.

134
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,990
<4-19,Wilson>先进行保守治疗
<4-19,Wilson>We start conservative.

135
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,550
<4-20,Wilson>每日放疗  连续三周
<4-20,Wilson>Daily radiation treatments for three weeks.

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,540
<4-20,Wilson>之后如果缩小得不够
<4-20,Wilson>And, if it doesn't shrink enough after that,

137
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,550
<4-21,Wilson>我们会再进行化疗
<4-21,Wilson>we'll add the chemo--

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,820
<4-20,Wilson>如果之后缩小得再不够  我就死了
<4-20,Wilson>And, if it hasn't shrunk enough after that, I'm dead.

139
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,870
<4-20,Wilson>有超过七成半的机会
<4-20,Wilson>Look, you have over a 75% chance

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,690
<4-21,Wilson>单行放疗即可达到缩小目的
<4-21,Wilson>that the radiation alone is enough.

141
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,960
<4-21,Wilson>放松点
<4-21,Wilson>Relax.

142
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,380
<4-21,Wilson>来得急
<4-21,Wilson>Caught this in time.

143
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,870
<4-21,Wilson>在肿瘤侵及胸腺周围组织前
<4-21,Wilson>Catching it in time would have been

144
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,090
<4-21,Wilson>这么治疗还来得急
<4-21,Wilson>before it invaded the tissue around my thymus.

145
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,720
<4-21,Wilson>我要同期进行放化疗
<4-21,Wilson>I want the radiation and the chemo concurrently.

146
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,490
<4-21,Wilson>不必要地损伤免疫系统  何必呢
<4-21,Wilson>Why stress your immune system unnecessarily?

147
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,220
<4-22,Wilson>按我的方案来吧
<4-22,Wilson>Let's just go with my plan, okay?

148
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,800
<4-22,Wilson>-先放疗...  -我要询问其他医生的意见
<4-22,Wilson>- The radiation first...  - I'm gonna get a second opinion.

149
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,300
<4-22,Wilson>你是认真的吗
<4-22,Wilson>Are you serious?

150
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,920
<4-23,Wilson>你不也多次向其他病人建议
<4-23,Wilson>Look, I've seen you recommend this exact treatment

151
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,360
<4-23,Wilson>-这种治疗方案吗  -不要再说了
<4-23,Wilson>- dozens of times.  - We're done here.

152
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,950
<4-23,Wilson>我要找个真正有种的医生
<4-23,Wilson>I'll look for a doctor with some actual balls.

153
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,850
<4-18,Foreman>和你的朋友谈谈吧
<4-18,Foreman>Hey, you need to talk to your friend.

154
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,250
<4-14,Park>他这是让自己难堪
<4-14,Park>He's embarrassing himself.

155
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,430
<4-9,Taub>作为一名医生  要更从容地
<4-9,Taub>A doctor should be able to handle his own illness

156
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,790
<4-4,Foreman>面对自己的病
<4-4,Foreman>with a little bit more dignity.

157
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
<4-24,House>我同意威尔森的说法
<4-24,House>I agree with Wilson.

158
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,540
<4-24,House>我的治疗方案没问题
<4-24,House>My recommended treatment is sound.

159
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,370
<4-25,House>我是说我同意你没种
<4-25,House>No, I meant about the ball-less part.

160
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,830
<4-25,House>办公室把你暴露了
<4-25,House>Explains the office.

161
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,860
<5-1,Simon>旋转木马而已
<5-1,Simon>It was a merry-go-round.

162
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,820
<5-1,Simon>丽莎  她还是个孩子  我们玩得很开心
<5-1,Simon>She's a kid, Liz. We were having fun.

163
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,790
<5-1,Simon>你也应该不时陪她玩玩
<5-1,Simon>You should try it sometime.

164
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,790
<5-2,Elizabeth>开心  不像你  她才六岁
<5-2,Elizabeth>Fun? She's six, not you.

165
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,270
<5-2,Elizabeth>你知道她有平衡障碍的
<5-2,Elizabeth>You know she has balance issues.

166
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,340
<5-3,Simon>我知道她...
<5-3,Simon>I know that she's...

167
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,660
<5-4,Elizabeth>这是艾米丽的父亲  西蒙
<5-4,Elizabeth>This is Emily's father, Simon.

168
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,150
<5-4,Elizabeth>发病时是他陪着她
<5-4,Elizabeth>He was with her when the symptoms occurred.

169
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,010
<5-5,Simon>她在我那一个礼拜了  她很好
<5-5,Simon>I had her all week. She was fine.

170
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,540
<5-6,Taub>我们可以一会再来
<5-6,Taub>We could come back.

171
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,880
<5-7,Elizabeth>不用  患者已经准备好了
<5-7,Elizabeth>No need. Patient's ready for transport.

172
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,260
<5-8,Elizabeth>醒醒  小懒虫
<5-8,Elizabeth>Wake up, sleepy head.

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,930
<5-8,Elizabeth>我在商店看到这个
<5-8,Elizabeth>I saw it in the gift shop.

174
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,530
<5-8,Elizabeth>我知道你很喜欢它
<5-8,Elizabeth>I know how much you like them.

175
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,640
<5-9,Emily>谢谢
<5-9,Emily>Thanks.

176
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,870
<5-10,Elizabeth>医生带你去做磁共振
<5-10,Elizabeth>They're gonna take you for an MRI now.

177
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,790
<5-11,Adams>就是"魔术般神奇的照片"
<5-11,Adams>It means "Magic really cool images."

178
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,940
<5-12,Emily>那不是"磁共振成像"的缩写吗
<5-12,Emily>I thought it stood for "Magnetic resonance imaging."

179
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,210
<5-13,Simon>我们到医院是家常便饭了
<5-13,Simon>We've spent a lot of time in hospitals.

180
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,010
<6-1,House>B行第九个格
<6-1,House>B-9.

181
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,970
<6-2,Wilson>中了  我恨你
<6-2,Wilson>Hit. And I hate you.

182
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,740
<6-2,Wilson>不玩了
<6-2,Wilson>I'm done.

183
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,030
<6-3,House>我把你的战船灭了吗
<6-3,House>I sunk your battleship?

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,120
<6-4,Wilson>没有  但是我想吐
<6-4,Wilson>No. But I think I'm gonna puke.

185
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,680
<6-5,House>很好  既然你喝得差不多高了
<6-5,House>Good. Now that you're sufficiently buzzed,

186
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,490
<6-5,House>就说说对近藤发飙的真实原因吧
<6-5,House>what was the reason behind you freaking out on Kondo?

187
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,340
<6-5,House>你害怕了
<6-5,House>Are you scared?

188
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,420
<6-5,House>拒绝接受事实
<6-5,House>Are you in denial?

189
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,010
<6-6,Wilson>当别人说你有问题时
<6-6,Wilson>I know you get confused

190
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,540
<6-6,Wilson>对自己产生怀疑  我可以理解
<6-6,Wilson>any time someone thinks that you're wrong,

191
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,450
<6-6,Wilson>但我作为病人提出质疑
<6-6,Wilson>but it's not considered freaking out

192
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,630
<6-6,Wilson>就说我是发飙  也太过了吧
<6-6,Wilson>for a patient to ask for a second opinion.

193
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
<6-7,House>好吧  这就是原因
<6-7,House>Okay, well, here it is.

194
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,180
<6-7,House>近藤说对了
<6-7,House>Kondo is right.

195
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,320
<6-7,House>你必须马上接受放疗
<6-7,House>You should be in radiology right now.

196
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,980
<6-8,Wilson>不错嘛
<6-8,Wilson>Well done.

197
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,700
<6-8,Wilson>你憋了差不多两个小时才说这话
<6-8,Wilson>You've kept your word for almost two hours.

198
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,810
<6-9,House>每多等一天
<6-9,House>Every day you wait,

199
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,420
<6-9,House>你胸腔里的小瘤瘤就更大一点
<6-9,House>our pal toomie is growing larger in your chest.

200
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,400
<6-9,House>你要是不想死
<6-9,House>If you want to live,

201
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,730
<6-9,House>别纠结了  果断采取措施
<6-9,House>stop screwing around and do something about it.

202
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,680
<6-10,Wilson>好主意
<6-10,Wilson>Good idea.

203
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,390
<6-10,Wilson>我想
<6-10,Wilson>I think...

204
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,450
<6-10,Wilson>就从一个人过春假开始吧
<6-10,Wilson>I'll start with spending spring break on my own.

205
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,660
<7-1,Adams>艾米丽  感觉怎么样
<7-1,Adams>How you feeling in there, Emily?

206
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,950
<7-2,Emily>还好吧
<7-2,Emily>Good, I guess.

207
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,000
<7-3,Adams>哪里不舒服吗
<7-3,Adams>Is something wrong?

208
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,350
<7-4,Emily>刚才我在装睡
<7-4,Emily>I was only pretending to be asleep.

209
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,760
<7-4,Emily>我是个不诚实的宝宝吗
<7-4,Emily>You think that's dishonest?

210
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,630
<7-5,Adams>这...
<7-5,Adams>That's...

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,490
<7-6,Taub>我女儿也经常这样
<7-6,Taub>My daughters do that too.

212
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,130
<7-6,Taub>要知道有的时候
<7-6,Taub>But they know that sometimes,

213
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,190
<7-6,Taub>爸爸妈妈看起来像是在吵架
<7-6,Taub>when it seems like mommy and daddy are fighting,

214
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,580
<7-6,Taub>实际上不过是他们担心你罢了
<7-6,Taub>it's really only because they're worried about you.

215
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,730
<7-7,Emily>你的妻子也想离婚吗
<7-7,Emily>And does your wife ever want a divorce?

216
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,390
<7-8,Taub>没有  家里一切都好
<7-8,Taub>No. Everything's fine at home.

217
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,490
<7-8,Taub>现在开始不要动  不要讲话
<7-8,Taub>Hold still now. No more talking.

218
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,160
<7-9,Adams>你怎么看她妈妈的
<7-9,Adams>What do you think of her mother?

219
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,560
<7-9,Adams>叫自己的女儿"患者"
<7-9,Adams>She called her daughter "the patient".

220
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,010
<7-10,Taub>如果我的孩子得了绝症
<7-10,Taub>If my kids were born with an expiration date,

221
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,110
<7-11,Emily>我也不知道...
<7-11,Emily>I don't...

222
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,610
<7-13,Taub>哪里疼
<7-13,Taub>Where does it hurt?

223
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,240
<7-14,Emily>我要爸爸  爸爸在哪
<7-14,Emily>I want my daddy. Where's my daddy?

224
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,420
<8-1,Taub>在导致永久性损伤前
<8-1,Taub>We were able to restore circulation

225
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,050
<8-1,Taub>我们恢复了她手脚的末梢循环
<8-1,Taub>to her hands and feet before any permanent damage set in.

226
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,650
<8-2,Chase>是原发性雷诺综合征吗
<8-2,Chase>Primary raynaud's?

228
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,280
<8-2,Chase>可能由磁共振室的低温诱发
<8-2,Chase>The cold inside the MRI room could have set it off.

229
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,700
<8-3,Adams>幽闭恐惧的应激也可使其加重
<8-3,Adams>Stress can also precipitate the condition.

230
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,020
<8-4,Elizabeth>她对寒冷并不敏感
<8-4,Elizabeth>She's shown no evidence of cold sensitivity,

231
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,400
<8-4,Elizabeth>做磁共振也是没问题的
<8-4,Elizabeth>And she has no problems with MRI machines.

232
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,680
<8-5,Adams>还有其它的应激诱因
<8-5,Adams>There are other kinds of stress.

233
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,310
<8-5,Adams>她听到你和你丈夫吵架了
<8-5,Adams>She heard you and your husband fighting.

234
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,360
<8-6,Elizabeth>很不幸  她听过很多更糟的
<8-6,Elizabeth>Unfortunately, she's heard a lot worse than that before.

235
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,510
<8-6,Elizabeth>不是这个原因
<8-6,Elizabeth>It's not stress.

236
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,310
<8-7,Taub>也可能是继发性雷诺综合征
<8-7,Taub>Could be secondary raynaud's.

237
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,520
<8-7,Taub>系统性红斑狼疮可以解释艾米丽的症状
<8-7,Taub>Lupus is consistent with emily's symptoms.

238
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,740
<8-8,Elizabeth>她的淋巴结不大
<8-8,Elizabeth>Her lymph nodes aren't enlarged.

239
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,590
<8-8,Elizabeth>而且她没有免疫激活征象
<8-8,Elizabeth>And she has shown no signs of immune activation.

240
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,550
<8-8,Elizabeth>也可能是重金属中毒
<8-8,Elizabeth>It could be heavy metal poisoning.

241
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,010
<8-9,Park>哪来的毒  旋转木马吗
<8-9,Park>From what? The carousel?

242
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,450
<8-9,Park>她不过坐了一小会儿
<8-9,Park>She was only on it for a minute.

243
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,160
<8-10,Elizabeth>三周前  西蒙搬进了一栋旧公寓
<8-10,Elizabeth>Simon moved into an old apartment building three weeks ago.

244
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,410
<8-10,Elizabeth>他肯定不清楚
<8-10,Elizabeth>I'm sure he has no idea

245
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,890
<8-10,Elizabeth>隔热层是什么做的
<8-10,Elizabeth>what the insulation's made of,

246
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,330
<8-10,Elizabeth>墙是什么漆刷的
<8-10,Elizabeth>what kind of paint.

247
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,920
<8-10,Elizabeth>他是个好父亲
<8-10,Elizabeth>He's a good father,

248
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,080
<8-10,Elizabeth>但对艾米丽的健康问题...
<8-10,Elizabeth>but when it comes to Emily's health...

249
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,130
<8-10,Elizabeth>我去拿钥匙
<8-10,Elizabeth>I'm gonna get his keys

250
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,610
<8-10,Elizabeth>看看他家的环境
<8-10,Elizabeth>and check for environmentals.

251
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,790
<8-11,Chase>狼疮更说得通
<8-11,Chase>Lupus is a better fit.

252
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,700
<8-12,Elizabeth>我不是故意想摆架子
<8-12,Elizabeth>I don't mean to pull rank here,

253
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,550
<8-12,Elizabeth>但我是她母亲
<8-12,Elizabeth>but I am her mother.

254
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,760
<8-13,Chase>我记得你说  你是以医生的身份加入的
<8-13,Chase>I thought you said you were here as a doctor.

255
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,310
<8-14,Elizabeth>作为医生  凡事都需要监护人同意
<8-14,Elizabeth>And as a doctor, I need parental consent.

256
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,220
<8-14,Elizabeth>这事我同意了
<8-14,Elizabeth>See above.

257
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,220
<8-14,Elizabeth>我去检查时
<8-14,Elizabeth>While I'm gone,

258
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,980
<8-14,Elizabeth>请为她进行螯合疗法
<8-14,Elizabeth>please start her on chelation therapy.

259
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,670
<8-15,Chase>她是个母亲
<8-15,Chase>She's the mother.

260
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,020
<8-15,Chase>就把她当成个普通的母亲吧
<8-15,Chase>So let's treat her like any other mother.

261
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,120
<9-1,Chase>我想我们发现病人母亲的宝藏了
<9-1,Chase>I think we just hit the environmental mother lode.

262
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,470
<9-1,Chase>有意思  她怎么从没提起过
<9-1,Chase>Funny she never mentioned an entire basement

263
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,330
<9-1,Chase>这一地下室的危险化学品和药物
<9-1,Chase>full of dangerous chemicals and drugs.

264
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,250
<9-2,Adams>你说她会让艾米丽下来这里吗
<9-2,Adams>You think she'd even let Emily down here?

265
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,470
<9-3,Chase>会的
<9-3,Chase>Yeah.

266
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,150
<9-3,Chase>显然艾米丽经常来
<9-3,Chase>Apparently a lot.

267
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,920
<9-4,Adams>你听说过Lex-2这个药吗
<9-4,Adams>You ever heard of Lex-2?

268
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,330
<9-5,Chase>看到过介绍
<9-5,Chase>Read about it.

269
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,430
<9-5,Chase>是一种氨基糖苷类抗生素  还在实验阶段
<9-5,Chase>It's an experimental aminoglycoside antibiotic.

270
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,690
<9-5,Chase>号称可修复ATM基因的DNA错误
<9-5,Chase>Supposedly it can override DNA errors in the ATM gene.

271
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,820
<9-6,Adams>这不能说明她在给女儿用这个药吧
<9-6,Adams>Doesn't mean she's giving it to her daughter.

272
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,940
<9-6,Adams>每个研究AT的人  都会研究这种药物
<9-6,Adams>Anyone studying A-T would be researching it.

273
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,130
<9-6,Adams>怎么个研究法
<9-6,Adams>How?

274
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,040
<9-7,Chase>你看见有小白鼠吗
<9-7,Chase>You see any lab rats down here?

275
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,490
<9-7,Chase>这里唯一的牢笼就是那个
<9-7,Chase>The only cage I see is right there.

276
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,770
<10-1,Wilson>走开
<10-1,Wilson>Go away.

277
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,970
<10-1,Wilson>我头疼
<10-1,Wilson>I have a headache.

278
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,200
<10-1,Wilson>我们也不是非要搞基
<10-1,Wilson>We don't have to have sex.

279
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,610
<10-2,House>搂搂抱抱  说说话就足够了
<10-2,House>Sometimes it's nice just to cuddle and talk.

280
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,750
<10-2,House>我先说吧
<10-2,House>Me first.

281
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,540
<10-2,House>你根本不需要再听别人的意见
<10-2,House>You don't want a second opinion.

282
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,810
<10-2,House>你已经问了五个人了
<10-2,House>You're already on your fifth.

283
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,730
<10-2,House>你问过仁爱医院的埃文斯  县医院的肖
<10-2,House>You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County,

284
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,460
<10-2,House>约翰·霍普金斯的福斯特
<10-2,House>Foster at Johns Hopkins.

285
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,310
<10-2,House>他们给出的建议是一致的
<10-2,House>And every one of them has given you the same advice.

286
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,940
<10-2,House>你疯了
<10-2,House>You're nuts.

287
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,410
<10-2,House>你不仅仅想要做化疗
<10-2,House>You don't just want chemo.

288
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,030
<10-2,House>你想要加大剂量
<10-2,House>You want a dose so high,

289
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,390
<10-2,House>大到致死的可能性有三分之一
<10-2,House>there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright.

290
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,260
<10-2,House>问题是
<10-2,House>Question is,

291
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,020
<10-2,House>你为什么没和我说
<10-2,House>why didn't you tell me?

292
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,440
<10-2,House>因为你知道我会阻止你
<10-2,House>Because you knew I'd stop you.

293
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,760
<10-2,House>也就是说你已经找到一个
<10-2,House>Which means you've already found someone

294
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,170
<10-2,House>足够疯狂
<10-2,House>insane enough

295
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,040
<10-2,House>或足够绝望的人
<10-2,House>or desperate enough

296
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,730
<10-2,House>来给你注射致命剂量的药物
<10-2,House>to give you what amounts to a death dose of chemicals.

297
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,540
<10-2,House>但是谁会这么傻呢
<10-2,House>But who would be that stupid?

298
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,740
<10-2,House>据我猜测  那人就是你
<10-2,House>I'm thinking that the who is you.

299
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,440
<10-3,House>你到底准备
<10-3,House>Where exactly were you planning

300
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,730
<10-3,House>在哪里自杀
<10-3,House>on killing yourself?

301
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,970
<10-3,House>我认为福曼是不会让你死在医院里的
<10-3,House>'Cause I don't think Foreman is gonna let you do it here.

302
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,960
<10-4,Wilson>在我家里
<10-4,Wilson>My place.

303
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,700
<10-4,Wilson>我已经准备了不少设备  不要
<10-4,Wilson>I've been stockpiling equipment. No.

304
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,350
<10-5,Wilson>不要  住手
<10-5,Wilson>No! Stop.

305
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,150
<10-5,Wilson>我现在还算健康
<10-5,Wilson>I'm still healthy.

306
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,240
<10-5,Wilson>现在尝试极端的方法
<10-5,Wilson>Why not go the extreme route now

307
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,930
<10-5,Wilson>还能有较大的存活几率
<10-5,Wilson>when there's a better chance of surviving it?

308
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,610
<10-6,House>从统计数字上来看
<10-6,House>Statistically,

309
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,440
<10-6,House>对你来说  使用这个疗法
<10-6,House>this treatment has about the same chance

310
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,390
<10-6,House>与胸腺瘤的死亡率是相同的
<10-6,House>of killing you as the thymoma does.

311
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,670
<10-6,House>但是这样会死得更快
<10-6,House>But a hell of a lot faster.

312
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,170
<10-6,House>这是南希·威尔斯的遗物
<10-6,House>Nancy Wells,

313
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,870
<10-6,House>她患的是宫颈癌
<10-6,House>cervical cancer,

314
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,840
<10-6,House>有百分之七十的存活率
<10-6,House>70% survival rate.

315
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,490
<11-1,Chase>死于1998年11月6日
<11-1,Chase>Died November 6, 1998,

316
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,880

<11-2,Elizabeth>Bernie Jones, melanoma,

320
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,190
<18-7,John>死时五十二岁
<18-7,John>He was 52.

321
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,040
<18-8,John>约翰·泰勒
<18-8,John>John Taylor.

322
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,440
<18-9,Wilson>甲状腺癌
<18-9,Wilson>Thyroid.

323
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,570
<18-9,Wilson>有百分之九十六的存活率
<18-9,Wilson>96% survival rate.

324
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,710
<10-3,House>我向他保证过他会没事的
<10-3,House>I promised him he'd be fine.

325
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,860
<10-4,Wilson>他去世时才八岁
<10-4,Wilson>Eight years old.

326
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,900
<10-5,Wilson>我不愿意躺在病床上
<10-5,Wilson>I am not going to die slowly

327
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,240
<10-6,House>在惨白的日光灯下  慢慢等死
<10-6,House>in a hospital bed under fluorescent lighting

328
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,960
<10-7,Wilson>不愿意人们驻足在我床前
<10-7,Wilson>with people stopping by to gawk

329
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,510
<10-7,Wilson>编着谎说我气色不错
<10-7,Wilson>and lie about how I look.

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,440
<10-7,Wilson>哪怕有那么一丝可能
<10-7,Wilson>Even a small chance of that happening

331
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,880
<10-7,Wilson>都是我接受不了的
<10-7,Wilson>is too big a chance for me.

332
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,150
<10-8,House>你个白痴
<10-8,House>You're an idiot.

333
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,800
<10-8,House>我打赌你肯定没命
<10-8,House>And the odds say you're gonna die.

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,820
<10-9,House>来我家给你治疗
<10-9,House>We'll do it at my place.

335
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,180
<11-1,Chase>我们认为  唯一能导致你女儿病症的
<11-1,Chase>The only environmental factors we think

336
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,710
<11-1,Chase>环境因素就是
<11-1,Chase>caused your daughter's illness

337
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,240
<11-1,Chase>你给她注射的药物
<11-1,Chase>are the ones you shot her full of.

338
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,100
<11-2,Elizabeth>我负责试验药物
<11-2,Elizabeth>I tested the drug.

339
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,460
<11-2,Elizabeth>我干这行  已经有十年了
<11-2,Elizabeth>This is what I did for a living for ten years.

340
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,310
<11-3,Adams>她是你女儿  不是实验用的豚鼠
<11-3,Adams>She's your child, not a guinea pig.

341
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,660
<11-4,Elizabeth>给她用之前我试验过
<11-4,Elizabeth>I tested it first.

342
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,720
<11-4,Elizabeth>在我自己身上
<11-4,Elizabeth>On myself.

343
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,500
<11-4,Elizabeth>用药六个月中  我没有发现
<11-4,Elizabeth>And in six months, I didn't document

344
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,360
<11-4,Elizabeth>任何的不良反应
<11-4,Elizabeth>any adverse effects.

345
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,420
<11-5,Foreman>仅仅一例临床试验说明不了问题
<11-5,Foreman>A trial of one is basically irrelevant.

346
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,420
<11-6,Elizabeth>AT病人出现呼吸道感染很常见
<11-6,Elizabeth>Respiratory infections are common with A-T.

347
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,790
<11-6,Elizabeth>而对艾米丽的这种基因变异
<11-6,Elizabeth>With emily's mutation,

348
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,650
<11-6,Elizabeth>呼吸道感染是致命的
<11-6,Elizabeth>they are deadly,

349
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,210
<11-6,Elizabeth>而且病情每年都在恶化
<11-6,Elizabeth>and they get worse every year.

350
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,580
<11-6,Elizabeth>Lex-2至少要有五年才会被批准
<11-6,Elizabeth>Lex-2 won't be approved for at least the next five years.

351
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,290
<11-6,Elizabeth>反观艾米丽
<11-6,Elizabeth>Emily, on the other hand,

352
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,260
<11-6,Elizabeth>可能活不过这个冬天
<11-6,Elizabeth>wouldn't have survived the winter.

353
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,460
<11-6,Elizabeth>我该怎么办呢
<11-6,Elizabeth>What was I supposed to do?

354
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,450
<11-7,Foreman>新药需通过药监局的认可  这是有原因的
<11-7,Foreman>There's a reason for FDA requirements.

355
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,360
<11-7,Foreman>杰克逊纪念医院的研究...
<11-7,Foreman>A study at Jackson Memorial--

356
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,400
<11-8,Elizabeth>我知道盖恩斯的研究
<11-8,Elizabeth>I know about Gaines' research.

357
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,690
<11-8,Elizabeth>他打算下个月发表
<11-8,Elizabeth>He's publishing next month.

358
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,220
<11-9,Foreman>不会发表了  我刚和他通过电话
<11-9,Foreman>Was. I just spoke to him.

359
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,380
<11-9,Foreman>他的团队在Lex-2实验鼠上
<11-9,Foreman>His team just linked the use of Lex-2

360
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,430
<11-9,Foreman>发现了肾衰竭的症状
<11-9,Foreman>to renal failure in mice and rats.

361
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,590
<11-10,Chase>她需要B超引导下肾穿刺活检
<11-10,Chase>She needs an ultrasound guided renal biopsy

362
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,050
<11-10,Chase>来检查肾脏损伤情况
<11-10,Chase>to check the damage.

363
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,430
<11-10,Chase>希望损伤是可逆的
<11-10,Chase>Hopefully it's reversible.

364
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,270
<12-1,House>为了你的愚蠢
<12-1,House>To stupidity.

365
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,450
<12-2,House>我还没说完
<12-2,House>Mm, not quite done.

366
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,230
<12-2,House>为了即将到来的肌痛  肌痉挛
<12-2,House>To muscle aches, spasms.

367
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,560
<12-2,House>以及那种蚀骨般的
<12-2,House>To your joints feeling like they're being ripped out

368
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,850
<12-2,House>掏心之痛
<12-2,House>and replaced with shards of broken glass.

369
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,520
<12-3,Wilson>我是否应该记录下来
<12-3,Wilson>Should I be writing any of this down?

370
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,240
<12-4,House>胆汁将充满你的胃
<12-4,House>Your stomach fills with bile.

371
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,080
<12-4,House>你呕吐时  感觉就好似有人
<12-4,House>When you vomit, it feels like someone's forcing

372
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,100
<12-4,House>将烧得发红的锤子硬塞下你的食道
<12-4,House>a white hot hammer down your esophagus,

373
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,440
<12-4,House>撕扯你的食管
<12-4,House>tearing your flesh.

374
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,320
<12-4,House>鲜血顺着喉咙流下
<12-4,House>Blood's dripping down the back of your throat,

375
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,910
<12-4,House>让你哽咽窒息
<12-4,House>choking and gagging you

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,400
<12-4,House>同时  你会尝到一种油腻腻的铜臭味
<12-4,House>with the slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies.

377
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,840
<12-5,Wilson>我是肿瘤科医生  我明白--
<12-5,Wilson>I am an oncologist. I know--

378
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,590
<12-5,Wilson>如果你真明白
<12-5,Wilson>If you did,

379
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,800
<12-6,House>我们也不会在这里坐着了
<12-6,House>we wouldn't be sitting here.

380
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,080
<12-6,House>第二天  你的白细胞没了
<12-6,House>Day two, your white blood cells are gone,

381
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,850
<12-6,House>身体将暴露在各种攻击之下
<12-6,House>opening up your system to attack.

382
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,470
<12-6,House>体温直线上升
<12-6,House>Your temperature skyrockets.

383
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,630
<12-6,House>前一秒钟  你的皮肤热得像火烧
<12-6,House>One second, your skin feels like it's on fire.

384
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,500
<12-6,House>瞬间  又冷得像是掉进了冰窟窿
<12-6,House>The next second, it's entombed in ice.

385
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,050
<12-6,House>身上每个痛觉感受器
<12-6,House>Every pain sensor in your body

386
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,780
<12-6,House>都在同一时间被激发了
<12-6,House>is firing at the same time

387
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,640
<12-6,House>疼到痛苦不只是一个词或一个概念
<12-6,House>until agony isn't even a word or a concept

388
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,390
<12-6,House>而是你唯一的现实
<12-6,House>it's your only reality.

389
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,870
<12-6,House>你开始产生幻觉
<12-6,House>You hallucinate.

390
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,910
<12-6,House>你梦见死亡
<12-6,House>You dream of death.

391
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,270
<12-6,House>此刻  生存死亡的竞赛开始了
<12-6,House>And then the race begins.

392
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,080
<12-6,House>你的身体能否在有机生物和寄生虫
<12-6,House>Can your body claw its way back in time

393
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,620
<12-6,House>夺得你的生命之前
<12-6,House>before the hostile organisms and parasites

394
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,290
<12-6,House>恢复健康呢
<12-6,House>claim you permanently?

395
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,420
<12-6,House>赢了  你就活  输了  你就死
<12-6,House>Win, you live. Lose, you die.

396
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,190
<12-6,House>威尔森  我们准备怎么做呢
<12-6,House>Now what are we doing here, Wilson?

397
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
<13-1,Chase>1号肾脏看起来不错
<13-1,Chase>Kidney number one looks good.

398
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,210
<13-1,Chase>估计得从2号肾脏取活检了
<13-1,Chase>Which means we'll probably take the biopsy from two.

399
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,850
<13-2,Simon>表现很不错
<13-2,Simon>Hey, you're doing great.

400
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,820
<13-2,Simon>像往常一样勇敢
<13-2,Simon>Brave as always.

401
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,850
<13-3,Chase>挺酷的吧
<13-3,Chase>Pretty cool, eh?

402
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,690
<13-3,Chase>你想试试吗
<13-3,Chase>You want to try?

403
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,150
<13-4,Elizabeth>怎么了
<13-4,Elizabeth>What's wrong?

404
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,520
<13-5,Emily>我的胸口很痛
<13-5,Emily>My chest hurts.

405
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,850
<13-6,Chase>绝对不是肾出问题
<13-6,Chase>It's definitely not her kidneys.

406
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,600
<13-6,Chase>没事的
<13-6,Chase>It's okay.

407
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,260
<14-1,House>放心吧  这个吐出来和吃下去时
<14-1,House>Promise this'll taste just as good coming up

408
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,540
<14-1,House>味道一样好
<14-1,House>as it did going down.

409
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,980
<14-2,Wilson>万一出什么差错
<14-2,Wilson>If things go wrong,

410
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,190
<14-2,Wilson>你要知道
<14-2,Wilson>I just want you to know--

411
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,940
<14-3,House>如果你只是想说你一直对我暗怀基情
<14-3,House>If you're gonna say that you've always been secretly gay for me,

412
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,240
<14-3,House>大家其实早就知道了
<14-3,House>everyone always just kind of assumed it.

413
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,730
<14-2,Wilson>你要知道
<14-2,Wilson>I just want you to know...

414
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,030
<14-4,Wilson>我很感激你愿意冒这个风险
<14-4,Wilson>that I appreciate the risk you're taking...

415
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,520
<14-4,Wilson>在你的客厅里给活人注射
<14-4,Wilson>pumping a human being full of lethal chemicals

416
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,600
<14-4,Wilson>致命的化学药品
<14-4,Wilson>in your living room.

417
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,310
<14-4,Wilson>要是我死了  你那位监督官那儿
<14-4,Wilson>If I die, it probably won't go over well

418
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,750
<14-4,Wilson>肯定很难摆平
<14-4,Wilson>with your probation officer.

419
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,440
<14-5,House>不会有事的
<14-5,House>That's not gonna be an issue.

420
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,580
<14-6,Wilson>我很欣慰  至少你挺自信的
<14-6,Wilson>I'm glad at least one of us is confident.

421
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,530
<14-7,House>我可没有
<14-7,House>Not me.

422
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,410
<14-7,House>真要是搞砸了
<14-7,House>I've already identified

423
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,940
<14-7,House>我早已物色了几处
<14-7,House>a couple of spots to dump your body

424
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,120
<14-7,House>弃尸的好地方
<14-7,House>if this goes south.

425
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,300
<14-8,Wilson>我挺喜欢三一公园的
<14-8,Wilson>I've always enjoyed Trinity Park.

426
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,250
<14-9,House>那里离湖边倒是挺近的
<14-9,House>It does have a nice access to the lake.

427
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,460
<14-10,House>肌肉痉挛已经开始了吗
<14-10,House>Muscle spasms already?

428
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,430
<14-11,Wilson>不  这不算什么
<14-11,Wilson>No. It's nothing really.

429
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,260
<14-11,Wilson>这是好消息
<14-11,Wilson>Good news.

430
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,640
<14-12,House>大多数人需要两袋
<14-12,House>Takes most people two bags

431
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,090
<14-12,House>才会到这个阶段
<14-12,House>to get to that stage.

432
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,920
<14-12,House>你已经大大领先了
<14-12,House>You're way ahead of schedule.

433
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,940
<15-1,Wilson>你会觉得我的想法很蠢
<15-1,Wilson>You'll think it's stupid.

434
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,060
<15-2,House>那你还不是照样我行我素
<15-2,House>That hasn't stopped you before.

435
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,250
<15-3,Wilson>我一直以为
<15-3,Wilson>I just always thought,

436
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,810
<15-3,Wilson>哪一天我老了病了
<15-3,Wilson>when I got old or sick,

437
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,880
<15-3,Wilson>会有妻儿陪伴在旁照顾
<15-3,Wilson>I'd have a wife or kids to look after me.

438
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,740
<15-4,House>这个场景中
<15-4,House>And in this scenario,

439
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,080
<15-4,House>你亲爱的妻儿
<15-4,House>are your loving wife and kids

440
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,450
<15-4,House>是握着你生命维持系统的电源呢
<15-4,House>holding the life support cord,

441
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,460
<15-4,House>还是在打量着你的遗嘱
<15-4,House>or are they thumbing through your will?

442
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,400
<15-4,House>我也在场的吧
<15-4,House>I'm in it, right?

450
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,080
<16-1,Chase>她的肾没问题
<16-1,Chase>Her kidneys are fine.

451
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,780
<16-1,Chase>我认为这不是Lex-2
<16-1,Chase>I don't think we're looking at side effects

452
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,620
<16-1,Chase>产生的副作用
<16-1,Chase>from the Lex-2.

<16-3,Elizabeth>但她没有持续性咳嗽  寒战或者大量出汗
<16-3,Elizabeth>No persistent cough, chills, or excess sweating.

455
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,520
<16-4,Taub>有没有可能是肺栓塞
<16-4,Taub>What about a pulmonary embolism?

<16-5,Park>符合咯血的症状  但是血栓呢
<16-5,Park>Fits coughing up blood, but a clot?

457

458

<16-6,Taub>她从旋转木马上掉下来摔得淤青

00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,420
<16-7,Elizabeth>我们需要给她用肝素
<16-7,Elizabeth>We need to get her on heparin now.

463
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,640
<16-7,Elizabeth>再来一个血栓就可能导致心肌梗塞了
<16-7,Elizabeth>Another embolism could cause a heart attack

464
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,710
<16-7,Elizabeth>或者脑梗塞
<16-7,Elizabeth>Or a stroke.

<17-1,Elizabeth>你不能这样做

00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,220
<17-2,Simon>我要带她去仁爱医院
<17-2,Simon>I'm taking her to Mercy.

<17-2,Simon>你们所做的一切只是让她越来越糟
<17-2,Simon>Everything you people have done has just made her worse.

470
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,320
<17-3,Elizabeth>你没这权利  我们有共同监护权
<17-3,Elizabeth>You don't have the right. We have joint custody.

471
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,570
<17-4,Simon>你把她当作实验鼠时
<17-4,Simon>Where was my right when you were treating

472
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,470
<17-4,Simon>怎么没想过我的权利

<17-6,Chase>你们女儿不应受到这种对待
<17-6,Chase>Your daughter deserves better than this.

476
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,420
<17-7,Elizabeth>没事  亲爱的
<17-7,Elizabeth>It's okay, sweetie.

<17-10,Taub>还没了解情况之前她可能就没命了
<17-10,Taub>before her new doctors are even up to speed.

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,850
<17-11,Simon>是AT引发的吗

485
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,900
<17-13,Elizabeth>我们能不能停止相互指责
<17-13,Elizabeth>Now can we just stop blaming each other

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,180
<17-13,Elizabeth>做出正确的选择呢
<17-13,Elizabeth>and do the right thing here?

00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,820
<17-14,Simon>你真觉得这能一样吗
<17-14,Simon>You're really gonna equate the two?

<17-15,Elizabeth>不  你给了她几分钟的乐趣
<17-15,Elizabeth>No, you were giving her two minutes of fun.

<17-16,Simon>Why does she hate that stuffed animal you gave her?

<17-16,Simon>近来她的噩梦中总有企鹅出现
<17-16,Simon>She's been having nightmares about penguins all month.

<17-18,Simon>管他是什么  都只是数据和字母
<17-18,Simon>I don't care. Those are letters and numbers.

<17-18,Simon>-那不是她  -那么在她
<17-18,Simon>- That's not her. What about the varient

<17-19,Elizabeth>Because that's what's killing your daughter.

500
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,310
<17-19,Elizabeth>除非我能找到重新激活的方法
<17-19,Elizabeth>Unless I can find a way to reactivate it.

501
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,290
<17-20,Simon>只要让她好起来就行
<17-20,Simon>Just make her better.

502
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,180
<18-1,John>你看上去不怎么好  先生
<18-1,John>You don't look too good, mister.

503
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,170
<18-2,Wilson>你怎么进来的
<18-2,Wilson>How did you get in here?

504
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,480
<18-3,John>从门进来的
<18-3,John>The door.

505
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,870
<18-3,John>你是病了还是怎么了
<18-3,John>Are you, like, sick or something?

506
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,230
<18-4,Wilson>豪斯人呢
<18-4,Wilson>Where's House?

507
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
<18-4,Wilson>你父母呢
<18-4,Wilson>Where are your parents?

508
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,710
<18-4,Wilson>我认识你  你住在这楼里对吗
<18-4,Wilson>Oh, I know you. You live in the building, right?

509
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,230
<18-4,Wilson>你叫什么
<18-4,Wilson>What's your name?

510
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,630
<18-5,John>你不记得了吗
<18-5,John>You don't remember?

511
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,790
<18-6,Wilson>豪斯
<18-6,Wilson>House.

512
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,110
<18-7,John>你答应过我能回家的  威尔森医生
<18-7,John>You promised me I'd go home again, Dr. Wilson.

513
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,110
<18-8,John>你说过不是我的错
<18-8,John>You said it wasn't my fault.

514
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,190
<18-9,Wilson>确实不是  约翰
<18-9,Wilson>It wasn't, John.

515
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,840
<18-10,John>如果我没做错什么
<18-10,John>If I didn't do nothing wrong,

516
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,570
<18-10,John>为什么我会死
<18-10,John>why did I die?

517
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,690
<18-10,John>我不知道
<18-10,John>I don't know.

518
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,850
<18-11,Wilson>听着
<18-11,Wilson>Look...

519
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,400
<18-11,Wilson>我不该这么做的
<18-11,Wilson>I shouldn't have done this.

520
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,500
<18-11,Wilson>我死了吗
<18-11,Wilson>Am I dead?

521
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,410
<18-12,House>还没
<18-12,House>Not yet.

522
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,740
<18-12,House>只是感觉像死了一样
<18-12,House>It just feels that way.

523
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,970
<18-12,House>你还好吗
<18-12,House>Are you okay?

524
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,600
<18-12,House>我的意思是  除了疼痛呕吐腹泻抽搐以外
<18-12,House>I mean, apart from the pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?

525
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,380
<19-1,Taub>我从医学院毕业后在实验室
<19-1,Taub>I worked six months in a research lab

526
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,540
<19-1,Taub>工作了六个月
<19-1,Taub>after med school.

527
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
<19-1,Taub>在那里你的精神会高度集中
<19-1,Taub>You get so focused.

528
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,680
<19-1,Taub>有一次我两天没吃东西
<19-1,Taub>Once I didn't eat for two days.

529
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,790
<19-1,Taub>那里很容易让你忘记什么才是最重要的
<19-1,Taub>It's easy to forget what actually matters.

530
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,740
<19-1,Taub>我没有
<19-1,Taub>I didn't.

531
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,610
<19-2,Elizabeth>我给她买错玩具确实很糟但是...
<19-2,Elizabeth>Yeah, it sucks I got her the wrong doll, but...

532
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,000
<19-3,Park>好消息
<19-3,Park>Good news.

533
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,910
<19-3,Park>艾米丽的肺没问题
<19-3,Park>Emily's lungs are clear.

534
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,980
<19-4,Elizabeth>-没有凝块  -坏消息是
<19-4,Elizabeth>- No clot. - And bad news.

535
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,580
<19-4,Elizabeth>我们还是不知道她怎么了
<19-4,Elizabeth>We still don't know what's happening to her.

536
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,050
<19-5,Taub>不论怎样都与肝脏有关
<19-5,Taub>Whatever it is, there's liver involvement.

537
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,530
<19-5,Taub>她的眼睛出现了黄疸
<19-5,Taub>Her eyes are jaundiced.

538
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,120
<19-5,Taub>她的肝脏正在衰竭
<19-5,Taub>Her liver's failing.

539
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,940
<20-1,Taub>我们在她的肝静脉中发现了梗阻
<20-1,Taub>We found a blockage in her hepatic vein,

540
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,920
<20-1,Taub>这限制了血液流向她的肝脏
<20-1,Taub>which is restricting blood flow to her liver.

541
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,130
<20-2,Park>真性红细胞增多症
<20-2,Park>Polycythemia vera?

542
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,400
<20-3,Adams>红细胞计数正常
<20-3,Adams>Red blood counts are normal.

543
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,470
<20-3,Adams>可能是某种结缔组织疾病
<20-3,Adams>Could be some sort of connective tissue disorder.

544
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,800
<20-4,Elizabeth>如果说
<20-4,Elizabeth>What if--

545
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,160
<20-4,Elizabeth>如果我们只是看到了她病情发展的
<20-4,Elizabeth>What if we're just seeing the end result

546
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,280
<20-4,Elizabeth>最终结果呢
<20-4,Elizabeth>of her condition?

547
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,880
<20-4,Elizabeth>她是如此特殊
<20-4,Elizabeth>She's unique.

548
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,470
<20-4,Elizabeth>从我俩身上分别遗传了变异基因
<20-4,Elizabeth>One screwed-up gene from each of us.

549
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,340
<20-5,Taub>我们还是按照流程来吧
<20-5,Taub>Let's stick with our process.

550
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,610
<20-6,Elizabeth>我应该离场
<20-6,Elizabeth>I shouldn't be here.

551
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,280
<20-7,Chase>我们遗漏了什么
<20-7,Chase>What are we missing?

552
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,640
<20-8,Taub>重症莱姆病
<20-8,Taub>Advanced lyme disease.

553
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,600
<20-9,Park>那能在血液中发现
<20-9,Park>Would have seen it in the blood.

554
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,850
<20-10,Chase>他说了重症
<20-10,Chase>He said advanced.

555
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,560
<20-10,Chase>我们没在她的血液中发现
<20-10,Chase>We wouldn't pick it up in her blood

556
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,490
<20-10,Chase>因为病菌可能已经转移到器官或神经系统里了
<20-10,Chase>if it's in her organs and nervous system now.

557
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,880
<20-10,Chase>除了流鼻血外这符合一切症状
<20-10,Chase>It fits everything but the nosebleed.

558
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,150
<20-11,Park>但为什么现在发病呢  还是同时发病
<20-11,Park>But why is it attacking now, all at once?

559
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,850
<20-11,Park>是什么变了
<20-11,Park>What's changed?

560
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,000
<20-12,Adams>是伊丽莎白
<20-12,Adams>Elizabeth has.

561
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,980
<20-12,Adams>她停止给艾米丽注射Lex-2
<20-12,Adams>She stopped giving Emily the Lex-2.

562
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,930
<20-12,Adams>那是一种氨基糖苷类抗生素
<20-12,Adams>It's an aminoglycoside antibiotic.

563
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,430
<20-12,Adams>这是莱姆症被抑制的原因
<20-12,Adams>It's what was keeping the Lyme in check.

564
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,720
<20-13,Chase>我们得开始给她用阿莫西林
<20-13,Chase>We need to start her on amoxicillin.

565
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,560
<21-2,Wilson>你骗我
<21-2,Wilson>You lied.

566
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,790
<21-2,Wilson>这玩意儿吐出来的味道太差了
<21-2,Wilson>Doesn't taste better coming back up.

567
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,170
<21-3,House>还有个谎话  你看上去不错
<21-3,House>Here's another one. You look good.

568
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,200
<21-4,Wilson>白细胞计数到多少了
<21-4,Wilson>What's the white blood cell count?

569
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,080
<21-5,House>1000以下了  还在下降
<21-5,House>It's down to 1,000, still dropping.

570
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,030
<21-6,Wilson>我需要更多的吗啡
<21-6,Wilson>I need more morphine.

571
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,170
<21-7,House>没有了
<21-7,House>We're out.

572
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,890
<21-7,House>过去八小时你都在用
<21-7,House>You've been using my personal supply

573
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,460
<21-7,House>我私人珍藏的止痛药
<21-7,House>of painkillers for the last eight hours.

574
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,040
<21-8,Wilson>你有...你有足够我俩吃的吗
<21-8,Wilson>You have-- you have enough for both of us?

575
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,290
<21-9,House>我这的储存量够一个祈祷班吃的呢
<21-9,House>I've got enough stashed around here for a minyan.

576
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,700
<21-10,Wilson>记住这是给你的礼物
<21-10,Wilson>Just remember they're a gift.

577
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,700
<21-11,House>如果你再继续吐就太不礼貌了
<21-11,House>So it's rude to keep throwing them up.

578
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,130
<21-11,House>我是在你给我的烛台旁找到的
<21-11,House>Found that out with those candlesticks you got me.

579
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,920
<22-1,Chase>我们认为是莱姆病
<22-1,Chase>We think it's Lyme.

580
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,390
<22-2,Elizabeth>那我应该看到相应的症状
<22-2,Elizabeth>I would have seen signs of that.

581
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,910
<22-3,Adams>如果Lex-2对其有抑制作用就不会
<22-3,Adams>Not if the Lex-2 was keeping it in check.

582
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,740
<22-4,Elizabeth>我们生活在城里
<22-4,Elizabeth>We live in the city.

583
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,180
<22-4,Elizabeth>我们不养宠物
<22-4,Elizabeth>We don't have pets.

584
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,740
<22-4,Elizabeth>她也从没在森林里呆过
<22-4,Elizabeth>She's never even been in the woods.

585
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,160
<22-5,Emily>我呆过
<22-5,Emily>Yes, I have.

586
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,870
<22-5,Emily>和爸爸一起
<22-5,Emily>With daddy.

587
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,040
<22-6,Simon>我早该告诉你
<22-6,Simon>I should have told you,

588
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,590
<22-6,Simon>不过我知道你会怎么想
<22-6,Simon>but I know how you feel about it.

589
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,770
<22-6,Simon>我从小跟我爸一起打猎
<22-6,Simon>I grew up hunting with my dad.

590
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,470
<22-6,Simon>我也想和我女儿分享这经历
<22-6,Simon>I wanted to share it with my daughter

591
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,390
<22-6,Simon>哪怕一次也好
<22-6,Simon>at least once.

592
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,820
<22-7,Emily>我们只是照了照片
<22-7,Emily>We only took pictures.

593
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,310
<22-7,Emily>你不用着急
<22-7,Emily>You don't need to be mad.

594
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,180
<22-8,Adams>也许我们该出去
<22-8,Adams>Maybe we should step outside.

595
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,000
<22-8,Adams>不用
<22-8,Adams>No.

596
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,770
<22-9,Elizabeth>我们没法让她与世隔绝
<22-9,Elizabeth>We can't protect her from everything.

597
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,130
<22-9,Elizabeth>我估计你们需要做腰椎穿刺来确诊
<22-9,Elizabeth>I assume you'll need a lumbar puncture to confirm.

598
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,110
<23-1,House>你的接触片掉了吗
<23-1,House>You lost a contact?

599
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,780
<23-2,Wilson>我要去厕所
<23-2,Wilson>Going to the little boy's room.

600
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,140
<23-3,House>那些叫做成人纸尿裤是有原因的
<23-3,House>They're called adult diapers for a reason.

601
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,530
<23-3,House>用吧
<23-3,House>Use it.

602
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,680
<23-4,Wilson>我用了  如果你认为
<23-4,Wilson>I did, and if you think

603
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,830
<23-4,Wilson>我会让你改变我
<23-4,Wilson>I'm gonna let you change me--

604
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,410
<23-5,House>没事的  我是个医生
<23-5,House>It's Ok. I'm a doctor.

605
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
<23-6,Wilson>放开我
<23-6,Wilson>Just leave me alone.

606
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,130
<23-7,Wilson>太可悲了
<23-7,Wilson>It's pathetic.

607
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,720
<23-7,Wilson>我太悲剧了
<23-7,Wilson>I'm pathetic.

608
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,330
<23-7,Wilson>一个得了癌症的肿瘤学家
<23-7,Wilson>An oncologist with cancer.

609
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,130
<23-7,Wilson>世上那么多东西能杀了我...
<23-7,Wilson>Of all the things that could be killing me...

610
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,730
<23-7,Wilson>这就好像宇宙对我
<23-7,Wilson>It's like the universe is giving me

611
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,690
<23-7,Wilson>竖了个大大的中指
<23-7,Wilson>the big middle finger.

612
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,110
<23-8,House>宇宙才不关心你呢...
<23-8,House>The universe doesn't care--

613
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,190
<23-9,Wilson>为什么是我
<23-9,Wilson>Why me?

614
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,830
<23-9,Wilson>我经常对我的病人们说
<23-9,Wilson>I'm always telling my patients

615
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,220
<23-9,Wilson>不要折磨自己  因为没有答案
<23-9,Wilson>not to torture themselves, because there's no answer.

616
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,510
<23-10,House>不错的建议
<23-10,House>Sound advice.

617
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,930
<23-11,Wilson>残忍的忠告
<23-11,Wilson>It's cruel advice.

618
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,190
<23-11,Wilson>他们不过是在
<23-11,Wilson>They were just

619
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,890
<23-11,Wilson>为自己的遭遇找一个理由
<23-11,Wilson>trying to make sense of what was happening to them,

620
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,260
<23-11,Wilson>我却告诉他们别傻了
<23-11,Wilson>and I'm there telling them not to bother?

621
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,750
<23-11,Wilson>我应该像你那样生活
<23-11,Wilson>I should have spent my life being more like you.

622
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,510
<23-11,Wilson>做一个好摆布人  以自我为中心
<23-11,Wilson>Should have been a manipulative, self-centered,

623
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,120
<23-11,Wilson>自恋的混蛋
<23-11,Wilson>narcissistic ass

624
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,270
<23-11,Wilson>给身边所有人所有事带来痛苦
<23-11,Wilson>who brought misery to everything and everyone in his life.

625
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,830
<23-12,House>你还是会得癌症
<23-12,House>You'd still have cancer.

626
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,700
<23-12,House>没错
<23-12,House>Yeah!

627
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,140
<23-13,Wilson>可我会觉得自己罪有应得
<23-13,Wilson>But at least I'd feel like I deserved it.

628
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,460
<24-1,Emily>你们说我爸爸妈妈会和好吗
<24-1,Emily>Do you think my parents will get back together?

629
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,650
<24-1,Emily>我不知道
<24-1,Emily>I don't know.

630
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,960
<24-2,Chase>我想他们一定是相爱的  可是...
<24-2,Chase>I'm sure they love each other, but...

631
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,600
<24-3,Emily>他们只是因为我才吵架
<24-3,Emily>They only fight about me.

632
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,060
<24-4,Adams>因为他们太爱你了
<24-4,Adams>That's because they care so much.

633
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,640
<24-5,Emily>所以说不定我死了以后
<24-5,Emily>So maybe when I die,

634
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,230
<24-5,Emily>他们可以重归于好
<24-5,Emily>they'll get back together.

635
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,210
<24-6,Adams>艾米丽  怎么了
<24-6,Adams>Emily, what's wrong?

636
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,480
<24-7,Emily>我的手臂不能动了
<24-7,Emily>I can't move my arm.

637
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,310
<24-8,Chase>抬着手臂别放下
<24-8,Chase>Just keep your arms up for me.

638
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,760
<24-9,Simon>她怎么了
<24-9,Simon>What's happening to her?

639
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,210
<24-10,Chase>她中风了
<24-10,Chase>She's having a stroke.

640
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,160
<25-1,House>够了  你的心率上升  血压下降
<25-1,House>Okay, your heart rate's up, BP's tanking.

641
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,770
<25-1,House>白细胞500
<25-1,House>White blood count's at 500.

642
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,090
<25-2,Wilson>必须马上去医院
<25-2,Wilson>We have to go to the hospital now.

643
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,320
<25-3,House>-不  -我这里没有急救设备
<25-3,House>- No. - I don't have the equipment or the meds to handle this.

644
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,300
<25-4,Wilson>不  不胜则死
<25-4,Wilson>No. Win or lose.

645
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,520
<25-4,Wilson>不胜则死  我们说好的
<25-4,Wilson>Win or lose. That was the deal.

646
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,080
<25-5,House>我答应你是因为有赢的可能
<25-5,House>That was the deal when there was an "or".

647
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,820
<25-5,House>你赢不了的
<25-5,House>You can't win this.

648
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,990
<25-5,House>不
<25-5,House>No.

649
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,300
<25-6,Wilson>不  我宁愿死在这里
<25-6,Wilson>No. I'd rather die here.

650
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,680
<25-6,Wilson>不要死在急救车里
<25-6,Wilson>Not in an ambulance.

651
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,330
<25-6,Wilson>不要死在医院里
<25-6,Wilson>Not in a hospital.

652
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,260
<25-6,Wilson>求你
<25-6,Wilson>Please,

653
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,190
<25-6,Wilson>你不能那样对我
<25-6,Wilson>you can't do that to me.

654
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,450
<25-6,Wilson>我不能...
<25-6,Wilson>I can't...

655
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:03,950
<25-6,Wilson>豪斯
<25-6,Wilson>House...

656
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,610
<25-6,Wilson>求你
<25-6,Wilson>Please.

657
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,070
<25-6,Wilson>答应我你不会那样对我
<25-6,Wilson>Promise me that you won't do that to me.

658
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,260
<25-6,Wilson>答应我
<25-6,Wilson>Promise me.

659
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,520
<25-7,House>好  我答应你
<25-7,House>Okay, I promise.

660
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,010
<24-10,Chase>中风
<24-10,Chase>Stroke.

661
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,710
<26-1,Chase>肝静脉梗阻
<26-1,Chase>Blockage in her hepatic vein,

662
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,000
<26-1,Chase>咯血
<26-1,Chase>coughing blood,

663
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,960
<26-1,Chase>呼吸困难
<26-1,Chase>trouble breathing,

664
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,790
<26-1,Chase>雷诺氏现象
<26-1,Chase>and Raynaud's.

665
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,590
<26-2,Park>如果不是已经排除了可能
<26-2,Park>If we hadn't already ruled it out,

666
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,050
<26-2,Park>听起来倒像肺栓塞
<26-2,Park>it sounds like textbook pulmonary embolism.

667
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,090
<26-3,Chase>什么像血栓又不是血栓
<26-3,Chase>What mimics a clot but isn't a clot?

668
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,370
<26-4,Taub>真菌感染
<26-4,Taub>Fungal infection.

669
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,600
<26-5,Adams>她的脑脊液是干净的
<26-5,Adams>Her CSF was clean.

670
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,340
<26-5,Adams>没有细菌或真菌感染标志
<26-5,Adams>No bacterial or fungal markers.

671
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,730
<26-5,Adams>有谁给豪斯打过电话
<26-5,Adams>Anyone tried calling House?

672
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,460
<26-6,Taub>他不接电话
<26-6,Taub>Not picking up.

673
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,850
<26-7,Park>也不回信息
<26-7,Park>Or returning messages or texts.

674
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,580
<26-8,Chase>我们得靠自己了  说说有用的理论
<26-8,Chase>We're on our own here, so just give me some theories we can use.

675
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,780
<26-9,Park>恶性血液病
<26-9,Park>Hematologic malignancies.

676
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,720
<26-9,Park>AT病人更易患那种类型的癌症
<26-9,Park>A-T patients are more prone to that form of cancer.

677
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,070
<26-10,Taub>你认为癌症可能三天内显现症状并且致命
<26-10,Taub>You think cancer would present and kill her in three days?

678
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,510
<26-11,Chase>不是癌症
<26-11,Chase>Not cancer.

679
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,170
<26-11,Chase>而是表现像血栓的肿瘤
<26-11,Chase>But a tumor could act like a clot.

680
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,190
<26-11,Chase>心房粘液瘤
<26-11,Chase>An atrial myxoma.

681
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,350
<26-12,Chase>一种原发性心脏肿瘤
<26-12,Chase>A primary heart tumor.

682
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,310
<26-12,Chase>粘液瘤的摆动
<26-12,Chase>The swinging motion of the myxoma

683
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,060
<26-12,Chase>间歇性地阻断右心房的血流
<26-12,Chase>intermittently blocked the flow of blood through the right atrium.

684
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,810
<26-12,Chase>流入通道的梗阻阻止了肝静脉的回流
<26-12,Chase>Inflow blockage stagnated the hepatic vein,

685
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,670
<26-12,Chase>导致血栓  进而导致肝衰竭
<26-12,Chase>which clotted and caused liver failure.

686
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,070
<26-12,Chase>而流出通道的梗阻导致了雷诺氏现象和脑梗塞
<26-12,Chase>Outflow blockage caused the Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke.

687
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,830
<26-12,Chase>肿瘤脱落的碎块卡在了肺里
<26-12,Chase>pieces of the tumor broke off and lodged in the lungs,

688
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,710
<26-12,Chase>导致艾米丽呼吸困难和咯血
<26-12,Chase>causing Emily's breathing problems and the coughing blood.

689
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,730
<26-12,Chase>我们会手术切除肿瘤
<26-12,Chase>We'll remove the tumor surgically,

690
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,510
<26-12,Chase>希望活检能够显示它是良性的
<26-12,Chase>and hopefully the biopsy reveals it's benign.

691
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,490
<27-1,Wilson>你...
<27-1,Wilson>You...

692
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,760
<27-1,Wilson>你造型真是衰透了
<27-1,Wilson>You really look like crap.

693
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,090
<27-2,House>正在与感冒作斗争
<27-2,House>Been fighting a cold lately.

694
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,550
<27-2,House>等上七到十天  肿胀消退
<27-2,House>Seven to ten days for the swelling to go down.

695
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,020
<27-2,House>然后再去扫描  安排手术
<27-2,House>Then we rescan and schedule the surgery.

696
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,180
<27-3,Wilson>我好像记得
<27-3,Wilson>I seem to recall

697
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,190
<27-3,Wilson>我对你说了一些话
<27-3,Wilson>I said some things to you...

698
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,450
<27-4,House>你说了很多话
<27-4,House>You talked a lot.

699
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,890
<27-4,House>讲到你害怕海豚之后我就没再听了
<27-4,House>I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins.

700
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,580
<27-4,House>可以先把基友情意放一放吗
<27-4,House>Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches?

701
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,020
<27-4,House>我的腿疼死了
<27-4,House>My leg is killing me.

702
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,660
<27-5,Wilson>再帮最后一个忙
<27-5,Wilson>One last favor.

703
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,980
<27-5,Wilson>我好歹想自己去上次卫生间
<27-5,Wilson>I'd like to actually make it to the bathroom this time.

704
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,810
<27-6,Wilson>你不是说存了很多维科丁吗
<27-6,Wilson>I thought you said you had plenty of vicodin.

705
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,690
<27-7,House>人都会说谎
<27-7,House>Everybody lies.

706
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,160
<27-8,Wilson>这么说我经历的痛苦  你大部分时候
<27-8,Wilson>So the way I felt, you feel that, what,

707
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,400
<27-8,Wilson>都身处其中
<27-8,Wilson>most of the time?

708
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,850
<27-8,Wilson>你活得也够惨的  是不是啊
<27-8,Wilson>It really does suck being you, doesn't it?

709
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,890
<27-9,House>至少我没得癌症
<27-9,House>At least I don't have cancer.

710
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,240
<27-10,Chase>肿瘤是良性的
<27-10,Chase>The tumor was benign.

711
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,580
<27-11,Adams>我们已经把它全部摘除了
<27-11,Adams>And we were able to remove all of it.

712
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,030
<27-12,Emily>是不是我以后就不生病了
<27-12,Emily>Does this mean I'm not sick anymore?

713
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,310
<27-13,Elizabeth>不  亲爱的
<27-13,Elizabeth>No, honey.

714
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,080
<27-13,Elizabeth>你的基因问题不是肿瘤造成的
<27-13,Elizabeth>The tumor didn't cause your genetic condition.

715
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,870
<27-13,Elizabeth>你的病还没好
<27-13,Elizabeth>You're still sick.

716
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,450
<27-14,Simon>生病也阻挡不了我们  是吧
<27-14,Simon>But we never let that stop us before, right?

717
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,730
<27-14,Simon>出院以后你想去做什么
<27-14,Simon>So what do you want to do when we get out of here?

718
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,780
<27-15,Chase>去过水族馆吗
<27-15,Chase>Have you been to the aquarium?

719
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,830
<27-15,Chase>很赞的
<27-15,Chase>It's pretty cool.

720
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,180
<27-16,Emily>我们能去吗  爸爸
<27-16,Emily>Can we go, daddy?

721
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,990
<27-17,Simon>当然
<27-17,Simon>You bet.

722
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,760
<27-18,Elizabeth>我能吗
<27-18,Elizabeth>Me too?

723
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,880
<27-19,Emily>她能跟我们一起去吗
<27-19,Emily>Can she come with us?

724
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,660
<27-20,Simon>妈妈去不需要问的
<27-20,Simon>You know mommy never has to ask.

725
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,780
<28-1,Wilson>午饭见
<28-1,Wilson>I'll see you at lunch.
