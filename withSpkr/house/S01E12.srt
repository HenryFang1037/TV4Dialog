1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,100
<6-3,Hank>对毒品  你是否抱着试试看的态度呢
<6-3,Hank>Are you thinkin' about taking drugs?

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,550
<6-3,Hank>三思  因为毒品并不是归宿
<6-3,Hank>Well, think again, because drugs are not the answer.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,060
<6-3,Hank>看看我  汉克·维根
<6-3,Hank>Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,120
<6-3,Hank>不记得这个傻瓜了吗
<6-3,Hank>Oh, don't remember this ugly mug?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,310
<6-3,Hank>两年前  我还算是个明星
<6-3,Hank>Two years ago, I was a star.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,490
<6-3,Hank>能连赢9场比赛
<6-3,Hank>I won n-nine games in a row.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,920
<6-3,Hank>但八月底  我就离开了球场
<6-3,Hank>But by the end of August, I was gone-

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,580
<1-1,Bryan>停  停
<1-1,Bryan>Cut! Cut!

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,680
<1-2,Hank>不好  是吗
<1-2,Hank>Not good, huh?

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,660
<1-3,Bryan>怎么说呢  球接的还不错
<1-3,Bryan>Well, you caught the ball.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,580
<1-5,Bryan>听着  我通常不教人读台词
<1-5,Bryan>Look, I usually don't, you know, give line readings,

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,070
<1-5,Bryan>这次我来试试
<1-5,Bryan>but let me try this.

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,100
<2-1,Warner>导演沉不住气了
<2-1,Warner>Hollywood ain't holdin' its breath.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,520
<2-2,Lola>他们这套对汉克有点儿行不通
<2-2,Lola>Yeah, well, they're doin' it wrong. I mean, for Hank.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,660
<2-3,Warner>去和导演谈谈啊
<2-3,Warner>Tell the director.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,330
<2-4,Lola>我可不想刚结婚
<2-4,Lola>I thought I'd give the marriage a few months

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,480
<2-4,Lola>就变成唠唠叨叨的妻子
<2-4,Lola>before I go for the meddling wife thing.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,860
<2-5,Warner>你们一恋爱  他的状态可就回来了
<2-5,Warner>His arm came back the day after you hooked up.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,270
<2-5,Warner>去吧
<2-5,Warner>I say meddle.

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,920
<2-6,Lola>-你还好吗  -有点儿胀气
<2-6,Lola>- You okay?   - Just gas.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,130
<2-7,Warner>去帮他吧  我正好调整一下
<2-7,Warner>Go help your man. Give me a little room here to work it out.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,450
<2-8,Hank>看看我  汉克·维根
<2-8,Hank>Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,010
<2-8,Hank>-这样行吗  -不太好
<2-8,Hank>- Like that?  - No.

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,080
<2-10,Hank>-亲爱的  -嗨
<2-10,Hank>- Hey, sweetheart. - Hey.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,080
<2-11,Lola>-嗨  布莱恩  -嗨
<2-11,Lola>-Hi, Bryan. -Hey.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,720
<2-13,Lola>是不是台词说不好
<2-13,Lola>Having trouble with the big speech?

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,050
<2-14,Hank>是啊  你有办法吗
<2-14,Hank>Yeah. You got any ideas?

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,680
<2-15,Lola>都是你亲身经历的啊  展现自我就好
<2-15,Lola>It's your story. Just be yourself.

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,210
<2-15,Lola>毒品摆在那里  你没抵挡住  就是这样
<2-15,Lola>Drugs were there, you took 'em. Simple.

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,910
<2-15,Lola>为什么戒毒呢
<2-15,Lola>Why'd you get clean?

31
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,520
<2-16,Hank>因为不戒我就完了
<2-16,Hank>'Cause I was gonna die.

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,790
<2-17,Lola>到了四月  你戒毒成功
<2-17,Lola>And, come April, 'cause you're clean,

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,130
<2-17,Lola>于是在对扬基队的首场比赛中亮相
<2-17,Lola>you're starting Opening Day against the Yanks.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,000
<2-18,Bryan>-这样来一遍?  -好
<2-18,Bryan>- Try it her way? - Yeah.

35
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,010
<2-19,Hank>好  好
<2-19,Hank>Okay. Okay.

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,430
<2-20,Lola>先从第二部分开始吧
<2-20,Lola>Let's start with the second part first.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,510
<2-20,Lola>让他进到最佳状态
<2-20,Lola>That'll get him in the groove.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,600
<2-20,Lola>好
<2-20,Lola>Okay.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,670
<2-21,Bryan>我们先拍投球的镜头
<2-21,Bryan>We'll do the throwing thing first.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,740
<2-21,Bryan>人人都想做导演
<2-21,Bryan>Everybody wants to direct.

41
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,750
<2-22,Hank>-华纳还好吗  -还好
<2-22,Hank>- Warner all right? - Yeah, he's good.

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,410
<2-23,Lola>把你的故事说出来就好  亲爱的
<2-23,Lola>You just bring it, babe. Just tell your story.

43
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,580
<2-23,Lola>开摄像机
<2-23,Lola>Roll cameras.

44
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,630
<2-23,Lola>-开了  -声音  转上胶卷
<2-23,Lola>- Rolling. - Sound. Speed.

45
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,890
<2-24,Warner>加油  摆摆你对付扬基队的范儿
<2-24,Warner>Come on, kid.! Show 'em what you're gonna give the Yankees!

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,630
<2-25,Bryan>好的  开拍
<2-25,Bryan>All right, action!

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,080
<2-26,Hank>噢  天啊
<2-26,Hank>Oh, God!

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,790
<2-27,Lola>你还好吗  会没事的  会没事的
<2-27,Lola>You okay? It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

49
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,710
<3-1,Wilson>他有骨质疏松
<3-1,Wilson>He's got osteopenia.

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,410
<3-1,Wilson>骨头太细了  不能手术修复臂骨的骨折
<3-1,Wilson>His bones are too thin to fix the arm problem.

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,420
<3-2,House>不  只要有我想要的  钱不是问题
<3-2,House>No. Price is not a problem if you have what I need.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,920
<3-5,Wilson>-年轻人吧  -你怎么知道
<3-5,Wilson>- Young man? - How did you know?

53
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,090
<3-6,House>如果是老年人
<3-6,House>Well, if he's an old man,

54
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,850
<3-6,House>骨质疏松早就是家常便饭了
<3-6,House>osteopenia would just be a fact of life.

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,450
<3-6,House>你会帮他减轻痛苦  打发他回家
<3-6,House>You make him comfortable, send him home,

56
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,760
<3-6,House>而不是在这烦我
<3-6,House>which means you're just boring me.

57
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,320
<3-6,House>他很年轻  骨质疏松很可能由癌症引起
<3-6,House>So he's young, which means it's most likely caused by cancer.

58
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,080
<3-6,House>你来找我是因为你没发现肿瘤
<3-6,House>You're here because you haven't found it.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,560
<3-6,House>你有没有十分十分努力地找呢
<3-6,House>Have you looked really, really hard?

60
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,100
<3-7,Wilson>核磁共振和PET扫描都没找到
<3-7,Wilson>M.R.I. And PET scan are both negative.

61
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,000
<3-8,House>他几岁了  也许是早发性骨质疏松
<3-8,House>Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,470
<3-8,House>我来看看
<3-8,House>Ah, let's see.

63
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,570
<3-9,Wilson>77年9月21日生的
<3-9,Wilson>"Born 9/21/77."

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,130
<3-9,Wilson>汉克·维根吗
<3-9,Wilson>It's Hank Wiggen?

65
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,160
<3-10,House>他签了名  太棒了
<3-10,House>And he signed it. Sweet.

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,970
<3-10,House>"致医学界的赛·扬--杰米·威尔森"
<3-10,House>"To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine."

68
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,040
<3-10,House>-你让他写的吗  -就"杰米"两个字
<3-10,House>- Did you ask for that?  - Just the "Jimmy" Part.

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,790
<3-10,House>他的骨头太细  不能进行手术
<3-10,House>The bone's too thin to support

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,280
<3-11,Wilson>不手术他就没法再投球了
<3-11,Wilson>the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,490
<3-11,Wilson>如果我们能找到骨质疏松的原因
<3-11,Wilson>But if we figure out what's causing the osteopenia,

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,550
<3-11,Wilson>解决骨骼的问题  就可以手术了
<3-11,Wilson>we can reverse the bone damage, then do the surgery.

73
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,000
<3-12,House>然后打败扬基队
<3-12,House>Beat the Yankees

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,120
<3-12,House>拯救"自由世界"[打败霸权]
<3-12,House>and save the free world.

76
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,970
<4-1,Sharon>昨晚是顿工作餐
<4-1,Sharon>It was a working dinner.

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,870
<4-1,Sharon>还是我们公司买单
<4-1,Sharon>My work- Company pays.

78
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,540
<4-2,Foreman>还真不知道  怎么就变成这样了
<4-2,Foreman>I don't know. I just feel kind of weird after what it turned into.

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,710
<4-3,Sharon>就是后来工作结束了呗
<4-3,Sharon>Well, then it stopped being work.

80
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,120
<4-3,Sharon>要是你有负罪感
<4-3,Sharon>You know, if it'll solve your ethics problem,

81
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,090
<4-3,Sharon>把这些给报了呗
<4-3,Sharon>you can reimburse me for these.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,890
<4-3,Sharon>一共5.57美元
<4-3,Sharon>What are they, $5.57, I believe?

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,000
<4-3,Sharon>周五要是有空的话  告诉我
<4-3,Sharon>Mmm. Let me know about Friday?

84
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,300
<4-3,Sharon>-好  -嗯
<4-3,Sharon>- Yeah. - Mmm.

85
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,830
<4-3,Sharon>已经排除了常见病因
<4-3,Sharon>None of the usual suspects.

86
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,190
<5-1,Chase>不是年龄问题  受伤前身体十分健康
<5-1,Chase>Age isn't right, in apparent perfect health before this incident,

87
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,130
<5-1,Chase>核磁共振和PET扫描都没发现肿瘤
<5-1,Chase>M.R.I. And PET scan negative for tumors.

88
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,860
<5-2,Cameron>再做一遍  一定是肿瘤
<5-2,Cameron>Test him again. It's gotta be cancer.

89
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,000
<5-3,Foreman>抱歉来晚了  车在州际公路上抛锚了
<5-3,Foreman>Sorry I'm late. Car broke down on the interstate.

90
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,280
<5-3,Foreman>糊弄鬼呢  CHEM-7显示肾功能差
<5-3,Foreman>Don't believe you. CHEM-7 shows a poor kidney function.

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,610
<5-2,Cameron>为何20来岁的人肾功能那么差
<5-2,Cameron>Why would a guy in his 20s have a poor kidney function?

92
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,500
<5-2,Cameron>是癌症
<5-2,Cameron>Cancer.

93
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,680
<5-4,Cameron>先是骨骼  然后是肾脏
<5-4,Cameron>It first attacks the bones, and then the kidneys.

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,850
<5-5,House>拜托  他17胜9负  防御率2.1
<5-5,House>Come on, people. He was 17 and 7. His E.R.A. Was 2.1.

95
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,270
<5-6,Cameron>你主观希望是肾脏的问题
<5-6,Cameron>You want it to be his kidneys,

96
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,150
<5-6,Cameron>因为如果是  我们有机会治愈他
<5-6,Cameron>because if it's his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, fix it.

97
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,060
<5-6,Cameron>但如果是癌症  他就再也不能投球了
<5-6,Cameron>And if it's cancer, then he'll never pitch again.

98
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,890
<5-6,Cameron>如果是一个普通人搬箱子时胳膊断了
<5-6,Cameron>If this were a regular guy came in who broke his arm lifting a box,

99
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,120
<5-6,Cameron>你会让他马上回家
<5-6,Cameron>you would've packed him up and sent him home.

100
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,010
<5-7,House>天哪  圣人警句啊  我真是昏了头
<5-7,House>My God, you're right. I lost my head.

101
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,860
<5-7,House>忘了天赋人权了啊
<5-7,House>All life is equally sacred.

102
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,840
<5-7,House>我向你保证  下一个病人就算是针刺的小伤
<5-7,House>I promise you. The next knitting injury that comes in here,

103
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,500
<5-7,House>我也会一视同仁的好好治疗
<5-7,House>we're on it like stink on cheese.

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,670
<5-7,House>-他新秀年的时候175磅重  -停
<5-7,House>- He weighed 175 his rookie year. - Stop.

105
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,840
<5-9,House>在日本打了一年球  体重升到195磅
<5-9,House>Now he's 195 after playing a year in Japan.

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,850
<5-10,Cameron>-为什么呢  -放浪形骸
<5-10,Cameron>- Why? - He let himself go.

107
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,750
<5-11,Foreman>是类固醇  我相信
<5-11,Foreman>Steroids. The guy was a drug user.

108
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,680
<5-11,Foreman>一个瘾君子不会犹豫用药来提升自己的竞技水平
<5-11,Foreman>I'm sure he wouldn't have balked at pumping up through chemicals.

109
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,020
<5-12,Chase>可以解释体重增加和肾脏问题
<5-12,Chase>That'd explain the weight gain and the kidney problems.

110
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,920
<5-13,House>还有骨质疏松  去问问他在用什么药
<5-13,House>And the bone loss. Go ask him what he's on.

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,090
<5-13,House>死不承认的话  就采集他的尿样
<5-13,House>When he says nothing, have him pee in a cup.

112
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,130
<5-13,House>如果真是车坏了  会迟到一个小时
<5-13,House>If your car breaks down, you're an hour late,

113
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,370
<5-13,House>而不是两分钟
<5-13,House>not two minutes.

114
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,250
<5-13,House>用这样的理由来弥补两分钟的迟到
<5-13,House>And two minutes isn't late enough

115
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,070
<5-13,House>还真有点儿小才大用
<5-13,House>to use a clever excuse like car trouble.

116
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,610
<5-14,Foreman>我本来是想早来的
<5-14,Foreman>I was coming in early. Huh.

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,340
<5-15,House>说谎不打草稿  可不是什么好现象
<5-15,House>Unprompted lies. That's a bad sign.

118
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,710

<8-13,Man>But they're red.

173
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,500
<8-14,House>因为你在尝试拿掉你的角膜

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,700
<8-14,House>你哪儿不舒服
<8-14,House>What's wrong with you?

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,140
<8-19,Cuddy>也许他不好意思在公众场合讨论私人问题
<8-19,Cuddy>Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable talking about his private matters.

180
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,530
<8-20,House>如果我总是小便失禁

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
<8-20,House>你不是掉进了笑气瓶
<8-20,House>Which means you're either dipping into your own supply

184
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
<8-20,House>就是管道阀门坏了
<8-20,House>or you got a bad valve in the office.

185
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,120
<8-20,House>笑气戒毒治疗估计要比请个修理工贵
<8-20,House>Laughing gas rehab's probably more expensive than the plumber.

186
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,490
<8-20,House>还有  吃一点维生素B12
<8-20,House>Meanwhile, get yourself some B-12.

<8-21,Student>如果没有医生假条  他会给我不及格
<8-21,Student>he'd fail me next time if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.

192
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,420
<8-22,House>和牙医交个朋友  让他给你写假条呗
<8-22,House>Well, make friends with the dentist. He can give you a note,

193
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,640
<8-22,House>再给你吸点儿氮气减轻宿醉
<8-22,House>and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off.

194
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,520
<8-23,Cameron>豪斯医生

<8-24,Foreman>Elevated beta-2 proteins though.

197
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,420
<8-24,Foreman>可能是癌症  淀粉样变性  或者淋巴瘤
<8-24,Foreman>Could be cancerous- amyloidosis or lymphoma.

198
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,390
<8-25,House>或者类固醇  你们身上有钱吗
<8-25,House>Or steroids. You guys got any money on you?

199
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,400
<8-25,House>他类固醇测试呈阴性

<8-28,Foreman>were negative for the cancers, but-

203
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,370
<8-29,House>那说明只能是类固醇了
<8-29,House>That just leaves us with steroids.

204
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,430
<8-30,Cameron>类固醇检测是阴性
<8-30,Cameron>He tested negative for steroids.

205
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,370
<8-31,House>研究癌症治疗的生化学家挣的
<8-31,House>Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than

206
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,240
<8-31,House>还没有绞尽脑汁帮他隐瞒使用兴奋剂的人多
<8-31,House>by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use.

207
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,810
<8-31,House>但有一件事是他们隐瞒不了的
<8-31,House>But there is one thing they can't hide.

208
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,490
<8-31,House>嗨  我是豪斯医生

<9-3,House>Start him on Lupron right away.

217
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,270

<9-3,House>These freaks are willing to defile themselves

218

<10-3,House>对骨骼很有好处
<10-3,House>It's very good for the bones.

225
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,570
<10-3,House>基本上  从分子水平来讲

<11-5,Cuddy>Is there any way in which that is not a lie?

233
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,450
<11-6,House>长得像牛奶
<11-6,House>It's creamy.

234
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,690
<11-6,House>-不过我有三个理由  -正当理由吗
<11-6,House>- But I had three reasons. - Good ones?

235
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,100
<11-7,Cuddy>一分钟后揭晓  我正在编
<11-7,Cuddy>We'll see in a minute. I'm just making them up now.

236
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,970
<11-8,House>他先对我撒谎的
<11-8,House>He lied to me first.

237
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,760
<11-9,Cuddy>你妈妈肯定教过你两个错加不出一个对来
<11-9,Cuddy>Your mother did teach you two wrongs don't make a right.

238
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,550
<11-10,House>他骗我说没有用类固醇
<11-10,House>He lies to me about not taking steroids,

239
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,310
<11-10,House>我骗他说那药不是针对类固醇的
<11-10,House>and I lie to him about not treating steroids,

240
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,870
<11-10,House>他被治好了
<11-10,House>he's cured.

241
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,740
<11-11,Cuddy>-帮我数着  -第二个理由
<11-11,Cuddy>- Adds up for me. - Second reason.

242
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,080
<11-12,House>如果我说实话  他就不会用那药了
<11-12,House>If I told him the truth, he wouldn't have taken the stuff.

243
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,700
<11-13,Cuddy>那如果他说的是实话
<11-13,Cuddy>And if he told you the truth,

244
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,120
<11-13,Cuddy>那药会对他有什么影响
<11-13,Cuddy>what would the stuff do to him?

245
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,550
<11-14,House>-严重呼吸问题  -第三个理由呢
<11-14,House>- Severe respiratory problems. - Third reason?

246
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,250
<11-16,House>消除安慰剂效应
<11-16,House>I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.

247
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,420
<11-17,Cuddy>太棒了
<11-17,Cuddy>Excellent.

248
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,290
<11-17,Cuddy>你和你的律师可以准备打官司了
<11-17,Cuddy>You and your lawyer can write a paper.

249
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,870
<11-18,House>这点提醒了我第四个理由
<11-18,House>Which brings me to my fourth reason.

250
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,590
<11-19,Cuddy>我以为你说只有三个
<11-19,Cuddy>I thought you said there were only three.

251
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,480
<11-20,House>我以为你会买其中一个的账
<11-20,House>I thought you'd buy one of'em.

252
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,960
<11-21,Cuddy>认真地
<11-21,Cuddy>Seriously?

253
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,590
<11-22,House>他不会起诉的
<11-22,House>He's not gonna sue.

254
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,640
<11-23,Cuddy>因为他的律师是个好人
<11-23,Cuddy>Because his lawyer is a nice guy

255
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,190
<11-23,Cuddy>不会为了责怪我们
<11-23,Cuddy>who'll realize it's unfair to blame us

256
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,970
<11-23,Cuddy>而毁了这哥们儿一亿美金的身价
<11-23,Cuddy>for ruining this kid's $100 million career.

257
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,980
<11-24,House>好想法  不过不对
<11-24,House>Good guess, but no.

258
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,370
<11-24,House>如果醋酸亮丙瑞导致了呼吸问题
<11-24,House>If the Lupron causes respiratory problems,

259
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,040
<11-24,House>就说明他没有用过类固醇
<11-24,House>it means he's not on steroids.

260
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,410
<11-24,House>也就意味着他有其它的病症
<11-24,House>Which means there's something else wrong with him.

261
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,150
<11-24,House>而这个其它病
<11-24,House>And the choices for that something else

262
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,620
<11-24,House>基本都是非常糟糕的
<11-24,House>are almost universally very bad.

263
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,380
<12-1,House>骨质疏松  会严重影响他的骨骼
<12-1,House>Osteopenia, messing his bones up.

264
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,980
<12-1,House>性腺机能减退
<12-1,House>Hypogonadism,

265
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,880
<12-1,House>肝脏  肾脏功能受损
<12-1,House>impaired liver function, kidney function.

266
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,950
<12-1,House>我们可是找到了
<12-1,House>And we have managed to find

267
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,480
<12-1,House>全银河系唯一一个不用固醇类药物的
<12-1,House>the only professional athlete in the galaxy

268
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,010
<12-1,House>职业运动员啊
<12-1,House>who is not on steroids.

269
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,360
<12-1,House>不是癌症
<12-1,House>And it's not cancer.

270
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,470
<12-1,House>那是什么在摧毁他呢
<12-1,House>So what's killing him?

271
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,750
<12-1,House>有谁和我一样怀疑他的病是扬基队捣的鬼
<12-1,House>Who shares my suspicions that the Yankees were somehow involved?

272
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,730
<12-2,Cameron>睾丸缩小说明他的身体不能合成足量睾酮
<12-2,Cameron>Shrunken testicles indicate his body's not putting out enough testosterone.

273
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,870
<12-3,House>不考虑肺部问题的话
<12-3,House>Throw out the lungs.

274
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,460
<12-3,House>那是醋酸亮丙瑞导致的  我的错
<12-3,House>That was the Lupron-my fault.

275
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,540
<12-3,House>别担心  我会给他寄张不错的慰问卡
<12-3,House>Don't worry. I'll send him a nice note.

276
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,870
<12-4,Foreman>环境因素呢
<12-4,Foreman>What about something environmental?

277
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,410
<12-4,Foreman>砷  汞  他的症状由
<12-4,Foreman>Arsenic, mercury. The symptoms could indicate

278
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,170
<12-5,House>环境引起的可能相当小
<12-5,House>Pretty small environment.

279
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,990
<12-5,House>老婆没事儿  其他人没有生病的
<12-5,House>Wife's fine, no one else is sick.

280
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,810
<12-6,Chase>如果不考虑肾  其它症状都说得通
<12-6,Chase>If you throw out the kidneys, everything else adds up.

281
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,370
<12-6,Chase>睾丸  骨骼  肝脏功能损害
<12-6,Chase>The testicles, the bones, the impaired liver function

282
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,150
<12-6,Chase>全都可以由肾上腺功能减退引起
<12-6,Chase>could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.

283
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,380
<12-7,House>艾迪生病  我喜欢
<12-7,House>Addison's disease. I like it.

284
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,550
<12-7,House>一般是这样没错  但是
<12-7,House>Mainly, of course,

285
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,930
<12-7,House>因为开始的治疗是针对
<12-7,House>because the treatment is

286
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,660
<12-8,House>-类固醇  -够讽刺了吧
<12-8,House>- Steroids. - Enough irony for all of us.

287
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,320
<12-9,Foreman>治疗可以引起钠水潴留
<12-9,Foreman>Treatment would cause him to retain fluid.

288
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,490
<12-9,Foreman>再加上他的肾几乎已经不工作了
<12-9,Foreman>With the kidneys almost shut down already,

289
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,190
<12-10,House>-他会死  -所以我们得给他换个新肾
<12-10,House>- he'll die. - So we'll get him a new kidney.

290
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,800
<12-11,Foreman>你是说艾迪生病引发了
<12-11,Foreman>Your theory is that Addison's is causing all the symptoms

291
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,860
<12-11,Foreman>除了肾脏以外的所有的症状
<12-11,Foreman>except for the kidney problems.

292
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,060
<12-11,Foreman>什么引发了肾脏问题呢
<12-11,Foreman>What's causing the kidney problems?

293
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,580
<12-12,House>卡梅隆
<12-12,House>Cameron,

294
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,270
<12-12,House>如果你有讽刺意味的猜想  最好趁早
<12-12,House>if you had to make an ironic guess right about now

295
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,780
<12-14,Chase>类固醇检查阴性
<12-14,Chase>He tested negative for steroids.

296
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,630
<12-15,House>同意  他现在是没用类固醇
<12-15,House>Agreed. He's not on steroids now.

297
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,300
<12-15,House>但如果他在过去的五年里用过的话
<12-15,House>But if he was on them at any time in the last five years,

298
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,860
<12-15,House>也可以引起肾脏损伤
<12-15,House>it could have caused the kidney damage.

299
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,820
<13-1,House>你知道  腰子不戴手表
<13-1,House>You see, kidneys don't wear watches.

300
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,510
<13-1,House>当然  胆囊戴  不过它戴了也没用
<13-1,House>Sure, gall bladders do, but it doesn't matter,

301
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,040
<13-1,House>因为肾不会看表
<13-1,House>'cause kidneys can't tell time.

302
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,060
<13-1,House>类固醇损害可以持续几年时间
<13-1,House>Steroid damage could take years.

303
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,080
<13-2,Lola>我还要说多少次  他没用过类固醇
<13-2,Lola>No steroids. How many times does he have to tell you?

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,300
<13-2,Lola>我不知道
<13-2,Lola>I don't know.

305
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,590
<13-3,House>在向联盟坦白可卡因的事之前
<13-3,House>How many times did he lie about

306
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,850
<13-3,House>他撒过多少次谎
<13-3,House>cocaine before coming clean with the league?

307
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,690
<13-4,Hank>那完全是两回事
<13-4,Hank>That's completely different.

308
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,280
<13-5,House>啊  对  我想起来了
<13-5,House>Oh, that's right, I remember.

309
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,010
<13-5,House>你压根儿没去坦白从宽
<13-5,House>You never did come clean.

310
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,310
<13-5,House>是联盟伪造血液测试把你揪出来了
<13-5,House>The league was out to get you. They faked the blood tests.

311
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,320
<13-5,House>你才给自己找了个律师才有后面这一出
<13-5,House>You had to get yourself a lawyer and everything.

312
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,070
<13-6,Lola>如果汉克说他从没用过类固醇
<13-6,Lola>If Hank says he never used steroids,

313
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,090
<13-6,Lola>那就没用过
<13-6,Lola>that's the truth.

314
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,450
<13-6,Lola>那太糟糕了
<13-6,Lola>That's too bad,

315
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,060
<13-7,House>因为我们的理论是肾损伤是由A引起的
<13-7,House>because our theory is that the kidney damage is caused by "A",

316
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,760
<13-7,House>其他所有症状都由B引起
<13-7,House>and everything else is caused by "B."

317
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,800
<13-7,House>这个理论的美好在于我们能治疗A和B
<13-7,House>The beauty of this theory is that we can treat "A" And "B."

318
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,330
<13-7,House>可如果你硬要把肾症状塞进去
<13-7,House>But if you add the kidney symptoms back into the mix,

319
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,270
<13-7,House>那我们面对的就是另一个字母了
<13-7,House>then we are looking at another letter altogether,

320
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,270
<13-7,House>字母表里可能还没这字母
<13-7,House>one that is apparently not in the alphabet.

321
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,430
<13-7,House>我就不能修复骨骼
<13-7,House>We can't fix the bones,

322
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,680
<13-7,House>而你将告别棒球  停止呼吸
<13-7,House>no more baseball, no more breathing,

323
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,950
<13-7,House>大脑歇菜
<13-7,House>no more brain function.

324
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,580
<13-8,Lola>找个别的解释
<13-8,Lola>Get another explanation.

325
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,140
<13-9,House>好的  内裤里倒是有一个  您要吗
<13-9,House>Okay. I think I got one in my other pants.

326
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,620
<13-10,Hank>等等
<13-10,Hank>Hold on.

327
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,160
<13-10,Hank>五年前  在缅因州的班戈
<13-10,Hank>Five years ago. Bangor, Maine.

328
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,840
<13-10,Hank>我的投球教练让我吃了点药
<13-10,Hank>My pitching coach had me on something.

329
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,950
<13-10,Hank>不过我一直不知道是什么
<13-10,Hank>I never knew what it was.

330
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,830
<13-11,House>你也没深究过
<13-11,House>And you never tried too hard to find out either.

331
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,310
<13-12,Hank>大概四周  我增重了十二磅肌肉
<13-12,Hank>I gained twelve pounds of muscle in, like, four weeks.

332
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,670
<13-12,Hank>对不起  亲爱的
<13-12,Hank>I'm sorry, baby.

333
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,940
<13-13,Warner>最近还好吧  医生
<13-13,Warner>How ya doin', Doc?

334
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
<13-14,House>好  非常好
<13-14,House>Good. Very good.

335
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,840
<14-1,Cuddy>你想让我把汉克·维根的名字
<14-1,Cuddy>You want me to put Hank Wiggen

336
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,820
<14-1,Cuddy>加进移植登记表里
<14-1,Cuddy>on the transplant list.

337
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,480
<14-2,House>他需要一个新肾
<14-2,House>He needs a new kidney.

338
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,060
<14-2,House>我想捐肾的人可能有货
<14-2,House>I was thinking the kidney people might have some.

339
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,390
<14-3,Cuddy>他们是要把肾留着给那些
<14-3,Cuddy>They like to save them for people who have

340
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,040
<14-3,Cuddy>我该怎么说呢  肾有问题的人
<14-3,Cuddy>How do I put this? Kidney problems.

341
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,540
<14-4,House>他是个职业球员
<14-4,House>He's a professional ball player.

342
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,970
<14-4,House>给大众带来了欢乐
<14-4,House>Brings joy to millions.

343
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,200
<14-4,House>你真想医院因为把他送回家等死而出名吗
<14-4,House>Do you really want to be known as the hospital that sent him home to die?

344
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,590
<14-5,Cuddy>您的好主意
<14-5,Cuddy>That's a great idea.

345
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,640
<14-5,Cuddy>可就让咱们成为双杀医院了
<14-5,Cuddy>We could be the hospital that killed two people

346
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,670
<14-5,Cuddy>那个本应肾移植的人
<14-5,Cuddy>the guy who deserved the kidney,

347
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,010
<14-5,Cuddy>还有我们甚至还不确定病因
<14-5,Cuddy>and the ball player we bumped up the list

348
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,600
<14-5,Cuddy>就贸然加进移植登记表的球员
<14-5,Cuddy>when we weren't even sure what was wrong with him.

349
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,010
<14-6,House>其他所有症状都和艾迪生病有关
<14-6,House>Everything else is related to the Addison's.

350
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,320
<14-7,Cuddy>艾迪生病检查结果还没定论
<14-7,Cuddy>The test for Addison's was inconclusive.

351
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,190
<14-8,House>艾迪生病检查结果永远是不确定的
<14-8,House>The test for Addison's is always inconclusive.

352
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,850
<14-9,Cuddy>那我们还做它干吗  问你不就得了
<14-9,Cuddy>Why do we do it at all? We should just ask you.

353
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,900
<14-10,House>你不会把他加在登记表上
<14-10,House>You're not putting him on the list.

354
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,900
<14-11,Cuddy>你真是比福尔摩斯还福尔摩斯
<14-11,Cuddy>Your powers of deduction are breathtaking.

355
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,430
<14-12,House>拒绝我能让你得到别样的快感
<14-12,House>You take a perverse pleasure in turning me down.

356
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,510
<14-13,Cuddy>就指望它活了
<14-13,Cuddy>What I live for.

357
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,530
<14-13,Cuddy>你要是想让老娘偶尔不爽的话
<14-13,Cuddy>Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day

358
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,450
<14-13,Cuddy>说点儿靠谱的
<14-13,Cuddy>ask me something I can say "Yes" to.

359
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,850
<15-1,House>啊  很抱歉  医生
<15-1,House>Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.

360
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,850
<15-1,House>我不知道你在忙  我待会儿再来吗
<15-1,House>I didn't know you were busy. Want me to come back?

361
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,400
<15-2,Lola>-他在名单上吗  -没有
<15-2,Lola>- Is he on the list? - No.

362
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,770
<15-4,Lola>-把我的一个肾给他  -好的
<15-4,Lola>- Then I'm giving him one of mine. - Okay.

363
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,170
<15-5,House>怎么不劝我说是个坏主意
<15-5,House>You're not gonna tell me it's a bad idea?

364
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,880
<15-6,Lola>为什么要把肾给一个可能用不了的人呢
<15-6,Lola>Why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it?

365
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
<15-7,House>那不归我管
<15-7,House>Not my area.

366
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,200
<15-7,House>不过  那个可是我的椅子
<15-7,House>That is, however, my chair.

367
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,090
<15-8,Lola>什么时候手术
<15-8,Lola>When do we do it?

368
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,420
<15-9,House>真高尚
<15-9,House>Very noble gesture.

369
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,170
<15-9,House>我就好这一口
<15-9,House>My favorite kind.

370
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,010
<15-9,House>跌宕起伏  一无是处
<15-9,House>Dramatic, yet completely empty.

371
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,460
<15-9,House>异卵双胞胎移植匹配的概率
<15-9,House>The chances of nonidentical twins being a match

372
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,460
<15-11,House>-你一个人住吗  -你写书吗
<15-11,House>- You live alone? - You writing a book?

373
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,590
<15-12,Lola>我用问句只是想礼貌点
<15-12,Lola>I made it a question just 'cause it's more polite.

374
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,000
<15-12,Lola>你额头上写了个大大的"不得入内"
<15-12,Lola>You got a big "Keep out" sign stapled on your forehead.

375
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,890
<15-13,House>没错  早就说让他们挂在我门上来着
<15-13,House>That explains it. I told 'em to put it on my door.

376
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,400
<15-14,Lola>就算你不能像正常人一样交流
<15-14,Lola>Even if real human contact is something you don't have

377
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,450
<15-14,Lola>就算不想也不需要
<15-14,Lola>or even want or need,

378
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,780
<15-14,Lola>你至少应该能耳濡目染一点儿吧
<15-14,Lola>you should at least be able to see it in other people.

379
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,850
<15-15,House>是  没错
<15-15,House>Yeah. Right.

380
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,250
<15-15,House>现在器官移植确实是靠"真爱"配型的
<15-15,House>True love- that's just how we match organs these days.

<15-15,House>high school sweethearts- they're trading brains.

383

<15-16,Lola>我们会匹配的  测试吧
<15-16,Lola>We're a match. Run your tests.

<16-6,Foreman>I had car trouble.

397
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
<16-10,Foreman>他觉得能耍你的时候才和你说话
<16-10,Foreman>He won't talk to anyone unless he can jerk them around.

398

<18-2,House>我从实验室里拿到了报告

<19-2,Hank>不用移植了
<19-2,Hank>No transplant.

459
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,420
<19-2,Hank>罗拉不能流产
<19-2,Hank>Lola's not gonna have an abortion.

460
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,380
<19-3,Foreman>事实上  你妻子刚让我
<19-3,Foreman>Actually, your wife just told me

461
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,830
<19-3,Foreman>为她安排一个流产手术
<19-3,Foreman>that she was making an appointment.

462
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,040
<19-4,Hank>我不管她怎么说
<19-4,Hank>I don't care what she said.

463
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,720
<19-5,Foreman>我觉得这事儿你们得先沟通好
<19-5,Foreman>I think you two need to discuss this further.

464
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,900
<19-6,Hank>我们一直就想要个孩子
<19-6,Hank>We've been trying to get pregnant almost since we met.

465
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,060
<19-7,Foreman>不管怎样  那都是你妻子的决定
<19-7,Foreman>Well, it's your wife's decision whether or not-

466
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,160
<19-8,Hank>她想用孩子换一个肾  那是谋杀
<19-8,Hank>She wants to trade a child for a kidney. That's murder.

467
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,230
<19-8,Hank>我不会让她那么做的
<19-8,Hank>I'm not gonna let her do that.

468
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,180
<20-1,Cameron>福曼说移植手术有困难
<20-1,Cameron>Foreman says we've got a problem about the transplant.

469
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,300
<20-2,House>如果她为他流产的话
<20-2,House>If she terminates the pregnancy,

470
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,120
<20-2,House>他也应该不会自寻死路
<20-2,House>he's not gonna let himself die on principle.

471
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,120
<20-3,Cameron>你会为了你爱的人放弃一个孩子吗
<20-3,Cameron>Would you give up a baby for someone you love?

472
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,950
<20-4,House>你不是吧  非要我选的话
<20-4,House>Please tell me I don't have to decide.

473
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,330
<20-4,House>得看情况  看还能活多久
<20-4,House>It depends. How long would they live?

474
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,260
<20-5,Cameron>对你来说这是个实际的问题吗
<20-5,Cameron>This is a pragmatic question for you?

475
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,270
<20-6,House>能活五十年的话  我会
<20-6,House>Fifty years, no problem.

476
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,770
<20-6,House>六个月的话  就算了吧
<20-6,House>Six months, I say let him die.

477
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,870
<20-6,House>其实我在这个问题上思考过很久
<20-6,House>I've actually given this a lot of thought.

478
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,490
<20-6,House>我个人的底线是
<20-6,House>My personal tipping point is

479
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,100
<20-6,House>七年八个月零十四天
<20-6,House>seven years, eight months and 14 days.

480
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,770
<20-7,Cameron>我办不到
<20-7,Cameron>I couldn't do it.

481
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,920
<20-8,House>因为宗教信仰吗
<20-8,House>You found religion?

482
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,550
<20-9,Cameron>必须是信教的人才相信胚胎是一条生命吗
<20-9,Cameron>Do you have to be religious to believe a fetus is a life?

483
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,370
<20-10,House>似乎是有点儿联系
<20-10,House>There seems to be a correlation.

484
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,720
<20-10,House>我
<20-10,House>I'm...

485
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,850
<20-10,House>你喜欢大脚赛车吗
<20-10,House>Do you like monster trucks?

486
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,330
<20-11,Cameron>-那是什么  -好吧
<20-11,Cameron>- I don't know what they are. - Right.

487
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,500
<20-12,House>我有两张票  周五晚上的
<20-12,House>I got two tickets. Friday night.

488
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,920
<20-13,Cameron>你在邀请我吗
<20-13,Cameron>You asking me to go with you?

489
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,380
<20-14,House>当然  应该很好玩
<20-14,House>Sure. Sounds good.

490
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,170
<20-15,Cameron>像约会那样
<20-15,Cameron>Like a date?

491
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,240
<20-15,Cameron>没错
<20-15,Cameron>Exactly.

492
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,240
<20-16,House>只是...我俩不是去约会的
<20-16,House>Except for the... the date part.

493
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,350
<20-16,House>算了
<20-16,House>Forget it.

494
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,160
<20-17,Cameron>不是  我本打算去参加一个肿瘤学会
<20-17,Cameron>No, l... I was gonna go to the oncology dinner.

495
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,590
<20-18,House>当然了  你得去听威尔森的演讲
<20-18,House>Of course. You have to hear Wilson's lecture.

496
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,660
<20-19,Cameron>不  他好像在两周前取消了演讲
<20-19,Cameron>No. I just found out he canceled, like, two weeks ago.

497
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,610
<20-19,Cameron>那么  我穿什么去
<20-19,Cameron>So... what do I wear?

498
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,270
<21-1,Chase>-能听见吗  汉克  -对  还好
<21-1,Chase>- Still with us, Hank? - Yeah. I'm here.

499
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,780
<21-2,Hank>我胸口不舒服
<21-2,Hank>My chest feels funny.

500
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,580
<21-1,Chase>心动过速  你的心脏跳的太快了
<21-1,Chase>Tachycardia. Your heart's beating too fast.

501
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,210
<21-1,Chase>我们正在处理  你能挺住的  对吗
<21-1,Chase>We're sorting it out. But you stay with us, all right?

502
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,980
<21-1,Chase>说点什么  汉克  别停
<21-1,Chase>Keep talking to us, Hank!

503
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,520
<21-3,Hank>罗拉在哪里
<21-3,Hank>Where's Lola?

504
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,120
<21-4,Chase>注射10单位胰岛素  静脉推注吡嗪酰胺
<21-4,Chase>Ten units of insulin sub-Q. An I.V. Push D-50.

505
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,470
<21-6,Foreman>为什么体内钾含量在上升
<21-6,Foreman>Why's his potassium up?

506
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,630
<21-7,Chase>我怎么知道
<21-7,Chase>Damned if I know.

507
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,660
<21-7,Chase>再注射点降钾树脂
<21-7,Chase>Kayexalate too.

508
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,810
<21-8,Foreman>我们得降低他体内的钾含量
<21-8,Foreman>We gotta suck that potassium out of him.

509
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,760
<21-8,Foreman>让心率慢下来
<21-8,Foreman>We gotta get his heart rate down.

510
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,930
<21-9,Nurse>-我们需要急救推车  -收到
<21-9,Nurse>- We need a crash cart! - You got it.

511
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,950
<21-10,Foreman>这绝对不是爱迪生病
<21-10,Foreman>It's definitely not Addison's.

512
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,940
<21-11,Chase>也不是类固醇问题
<21-11,Chase>It's not steroids either.

513
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,380
<21-11,Chase>好了  请过来这里帮忙
<21-11,Chase>Set. Help in here, please!

514
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,680
<22-1,Cameron>他的心跳达到了130而且继续飙升
<22-1,Cameron>His heart rate is 130 and rising

515
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,710
<22-1,Cameron>就像兰迪·约翰逊投的球一样快
<22-1,Cameron>like a Randy Johnson line drives.

517
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,310
<22-2,House>你这比喻有亮点
<22-2,House>"A" for effort.

518
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,440
<22-3,Cameron>现在给他移植毫无意义
<22-3,Cameron>There's no point in doing the transplant.

519
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,520
<22-3,Cameron>即使他的身体稳定了
<22-3,Cameron>Even if he was stable enough,

520
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,980
<22-3,Cameron>明显我们还未找出病因
<22-3,Cameron>it's obvious that we have no idea what's wrong with him.

521
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,550
<22-4,Chase>刚开始心跳太快  现在又太慢
<22-4,Chase>First it's too high. Now it's too low?

522
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,910
<22-5,Foreman>他的心脏对阿托品没有反应
<22-5,Foreman>His heart's not responding to the atropine.

523
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,140
<23-2,House>-心率降到40  -我以为会升高呢
<23-2,House>- Heart rate's down to 40. - I thought it was up.

524
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,000
<23-3,Cameron>现在降了  最低的时候心率只有35
<23-3,Cameron>Now it's down. Last time he went out at 35.

525
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,420
<23-5,House>-怎么回事  -我不知道
<23-5,House>- What's wrong? - I have no idea.

526
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,860
<23-5,House>继续注射阿托品防止他的心率再降到35
<23-5,House>Hit him with the atropine before he gets to 35 again.

527
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,060
<23-6,Foreman>已经注射了三毫升了
<23-6,Foreman>We've already given him three milliliters.

528
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,230
<23-7,House>显然量还不够
<23-7,House>Apparently that's not enough.

529
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,170
<23-8,Chase>我们没法稳定他的心率
<23-8,Chase>We can't stabilize his heart rate.

530
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,170
<23-9,House>-你们做过什么  -降钾树脂
<23-9,House>- What did you do to him? - Kayexalate.

531
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,590
<23-10,Chase>他的脉搏太快了
<23-10,Chase>His pulse was through the roof.

532
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,230
<23-11,Foreman>还有他体内钾含量也过高
<23-11,Foreman>So was his potassium.

533
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,250
<23-12,Chase>不应该是这样的
<23-12,Chase>It wouldn't do this.

534
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,710
<23-13,House>肯定是哪儿出了问题
<23-13,House>Something did.

535
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,510
<23-13,House>等他稳定  或死了的时候通知我
<23-13,House>Call me when he's stable. Or dead.

536
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,700
<24-1,Warner>我还记得第一次见你
<24-1,Warner>I remember the first time.

537
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,730
<24-1,Warner>那场比赛本来不安排你投球的
<24-1,Warner>You weren't even supposed to be pitching that day.

538
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,240
<24-1,Warner>我长途跋涉飞到东京去看这个孩子
<24-1,Warner>I'd flown all the way to Tokyo to watch this kid,

539
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,370
<24-1,Warner>结果第一轮发球他就因为和教练争执挨了批评
<24-1,Warner>and he gets tossed for arguing a call in the first inning.

540
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,180
<24-1,Warner>啊  你投的球  太完美了
<24-1,Warner>Ah, your pitches... perfect.

541
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,090
<24-1,Warner>球速好像比你手臂的速度还快
<24-1,Warner>Ball seemed to go faster than your arm.

542
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,630
<24-1,Warner>球已经不按常理飞行
<24-1,Warner>It was like the rules didn't apply,

543
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,180
<24-1,Warner>势如破竹
<24-1,Warner>like physics couldn't slow you down.

544
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,460
<24-1,Warner>那简直是  太漂亮了
<24-1,Warner>Hot damn, it was beautiful.

545
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,660
<24-2,Hank>嗨  华纳
<24-2,Hank>Hey, Warner.

546
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,100
<24-3,Warner>嗨  孩子  你感觉怎样
<24-3,Warner>Hey, kid. How ya feelin'?

547
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,730
<24-4,Hank>我痛
<24-4,Hank>I hurt.

548
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,940
<24-4,Hank>手臂痛  头痛  全身都痛
<24-4,Hank>My arm, my head, everywhere.

549
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,880
<24-5,Warner>他们肯定调低了吗啡的量
<24-5,Warner>They must've dialed down the morphine.

550
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,940
<24-5,Warner>那是不对的  你正在遭受着折磨
<24-5,Warner>That's just wrong, man. You're in pain.

551
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,390
<24-5,Warner>我给你带了点儿东西
<24-5,Warner>I got somethin' for ya.

552
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,550
<24-6,Hank>不行
<24-6,Hank>No.

553
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,830
<24-7,Warner>这是其他医生给我的偏头痛药
<24-7,Warner>A doc in St. Louis gave 'em to me for migraine.

554
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,720
<24-8,Hank>我会上瘾的  我不能吃
<24-8,Hank>I'm an addict. I can't take that.

555
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,770
<24-9,Warner>罗拉也会同意用吗啡的
<24-9,Warner>Even Lola was okay with the morphine.

556
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,460
<24-9,Warner>这东西只是比吗啡强一点
<24-9,Warner>This stuff's just a little stronger.

557
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,530
<24-9,Warner>来吧
<24-9,Warner>Come on.

558
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,550
<24-10,Hank>我就吃一颗  华纳
<24-10,Hank>I'll just try one, Warner.

559
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,380
<24-10,Hank>马维尼医生  请拨分机6134号
<24-10,Hank>Dr. Mulvaney, please call extension 6134.

560
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,580
<24-11,House>马维尼医生  请拨分机6134号
<24-11,House>Dr. Mulvaney, please call extension 6134.

561
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,990
<24-11,House>又多了三个症状
<24-11,House>Three more symptoms.

562
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,760
<24-11,House>心动过速  心动过缓
<24-11,House>Heart rate up. Heart rate down.

563
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,310
<24-11,House>现在又出现幻觉
<24-11,House>Now he's hallucinating.

564
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,180
<24-12,Hank>你保证不告诉罗拉
<24-12,Hank>You gotta promise not to tell Lola.

565
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,270
<24-12,Hank>好吗  教练
<24-12,Hank>Okay, coach?

566
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,730
<24-13,Wilson>他不是在做梦吧
<24-13,Wilson>He's not just dreaming?

567
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,170
<24-14,House>没有快速眼动  他是醒着的
<24-14,House>No R.E.M. He's actually awake.

568
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,760
<24-16,House>-磕药了  -不像是迷幻反应
<24-16,House>- Drugs? - Not psychedelics.

569
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,370
<24-16,House>不然不会心律失常
<24-16,House>Not with the heart symptoms.

570
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,040
<24-17,Wilson>幻觉有可能是洋地黄导致的
<24-17,Wilson>Well, hallucinations would point to digitalis.

571
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,850
<24-17,Wilson>也可以扰乱他的心律
<24-17,Wilson>It would also mess up his heart.

572
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,550
<24-17,Wilson>但并没给他这个药啊
<24-17,Wilson>But he's not on it,

573
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,880
<24-17,Wilson>他吃这个要干什么
<24-17,Wilson>And why would he take it?

574
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,950
<24-17,Wilson>是啊
<24-17,Wilson>Yeah.

575
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,120
<24-18,House>精辟的分析
<24-18,House>Pithy analysis.

576
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,130
<24-18,House>终于明白为什么他们会请你做演讲了
<24-18,House>I can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner.

577
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,390
<24-18,House>很遗憾我不能去参加
<24-18,House>I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.

578
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,660
<24-19,Wilson>很遗憾我不能陪你去看大脚赛车
<24-19,Wilson>I'm sorry about the monster trucks.

579
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,830
<24-20,House>不  这很好  礼尚往来嘛
<24-20,House>No, I think it's great. You're giving back.

580
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:18,770
<24-21,Wilson>但是  洋地黄
<24-21,Wilson>Only thing is... uh, digitalis,

581
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,080
<24-21,Wilson>只能解释新出现的症状
<24-21,Wilson>it would only explain the later symptoms,

582
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,140
<24-21,Wilson>而不能解释最开始的
<24-21,Wilson>not the original ones.

583
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,370
<24-21,Wilson>当然  你知道  这得做一连串动作
<24-21,Wilson>Sure, you know, it's got a lot of movement.

584
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,060
<25-1,Warner>问题是  每个人都能看见这动作
<25-1,Warner>Problem is, everybody sees the movement.

585
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,760
<25-1,Warner>当你丢一个曲线球时
<25-1,Warner>You're throwin' your curveball

586
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,410
<25-1,Warner>动作就已经被别人看穿了
<25-1,Warner>like you're-you're throwin' a curveball.

587
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,890
<25-1,Warner>假动作  球行进路线一样的
<25-1,Warner>Deception. That's the- same motion.

588
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,550
<25-1,Warner>少做点动作  但不会泄露你的投球意图
<25-1,Warner>Less movement, but it won't come back at you.

589
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,150
<25-1,Warner>好了  外野手进来  到那边去
<25-1,Warner>All right, outfielders move in.! Right there.!

590
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,890
<25-1,Warner>你是怎么进来的
<25-1,Warner>How'd you get in here?

591
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,760
<25-2,House>说西班牙语
<25-2,House>Spoke Spanish.

592
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,440
<25-2,House>告诉他们我是来从多米尼加来的游击手
<25-2,House>Told them I was the new shortstop from the Dominican.

593
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,900
<25-3,Warner>-汉克怎么样了  -很糟
<25-3,Warner>- How's Hank doin'? - Lousy.

594
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,290
<25-4,House>你的指甲周围都肿胀了  医学上叫杵状指
<25-4,House>Around your fingernails, that swelling, it's called clubbing.

595
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,580
<25-4,House>希波克拉底注意到他身边很多有这种症状的朋友
<25-4,House>Hippocrates noticed that a lot of his friends

596
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,100
<25-4,House>经常抓自己的胸口最后死去了
<25-4,House>who also had that tended to frequently grab their chests and die.

597
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,270
<25-5,Warner>对  我心脏是不太好  汉克到底怎么了
<25-5,Warner>Yeah, I got a heart condition. What's wrong with Hank?

598
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,610
<25-6,House>-你在吃什么  -洋地黄
<25-6,House>- What do you take for it? - Digitalis.

599
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,670
<25-7,Warner>身上有带吗
<25-7,Warner>Got 'em with you?

600
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,980
<25-8,House>奇怪了
<25-8,House>Huh. Well, that's weird.

601
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,100
<25-9,Warner>几天前还是满的
<25-9,Warner>I just filled this prescription a couple days ago.

602
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,150
<25-9,Warner>这里还有一瓶
<25-9,Warner>There's another bottle here.

603
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,280
<25-10,House>不用麻烦了
<25-10,House>Don't bother.

604
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,190
<25-10,House>汉克·维根偷了你的药
<25-10,House>Hank Wiggen stole your pills.

605
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,120
<27-18,House>他想自杀
<27-18,House>He tried to kill himself.

606
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,970
<27-18,House>到底怎么回事
<27-18,House>So what happened?

607
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,350
<26-1,House>他去喝水的时候把药瓶落下了
<26-1,House>He left the bottle open while he went to get some water?

608
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,350
<26-1,House>下一次把整瓶都吃掉吧
<26-1,House>Next time, just take the whole bottle.

609
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,090
<26-2,Hank>嘿  伙计  你没权利
<26-2,Hank>Hey, man, you got no right.

610
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,990
<26-3,House>人们能记得他们吃了多少
<26-3,House>See, people remember how many they've got.

611
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,300
<26-3,House>日期都写在标签上的
<26-3,House>Date's right on the label,

612
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,590
<26-3,House>正常人都能对药片的数量做简单的计算
<26-3,House>number of pills- regular person can do the math.

613
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,780
<26-3,House>但瘾君子就不必了
<26-3,House>But a junkie doesn't have to,

614
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,900
<26-3,House>因为他们关心的是还剩下几片
<26-3,House>because how many pills he's got left, that's all he's thinking about.

615
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,910
<26-3,House>为了大保单?
<26-3,House>Big insurance policy?

616
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,610
<26-5,House>-和钱无关  -对你而言不是
<26-5,House>- This isn't about the money. - Not for you, no.

617
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,910
<26-5,House>多数信誉良好的商店在你死后不会兑现你的支票
<26-5,House>Most reputable stores won't cash your checks after you're dead.

618
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,710
<26-5,House>但劳拉这样的女孩  她们只关心钱
<26-5,House>But for Lola, well, girls like that, they're all about the money.

619
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,910
<26-5,House>不许这么说
<26-5,House>Don't you say that.

620
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,750
<26-6,Hank>她曾救过我的命
<26-6,Hank>She already saved my life.

621
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,640
<26-6,Hank>在日本的时候我已经完了  是她救了我回来
<26-6,Hank>I was dead in Japan. She brought me back.

622
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,600
<26-6,Hank>从那以后都是意外之福
<26-6,Hank>Everything since then, that's gravy.

623
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,090
<26-6,Hank>我已经知足了
<26-6,Hank>That's more than I deserve.

624
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,100
<26-7,House>-你欠她吗  -我的全部
<26-7,House>- You owe her?  - Everything.

625
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:55,640
<26-9,House>那你的自杀未遂  把她吓得要死
<26-9,House>Ah. So the attempted suicide, the scaring her to death-

626
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,130
<26-9,House>算什么  感激吗
<26-9,House>what is that? That's gratitude?

627
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,270
<26-9,House>爱吗
<26-9,House>Love?

628
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,370
<26-9,House>我理解
<26-9,House>Yeah, I get that.

629
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,380
<26-9,House>忘了昨天你做了什么吧
<26-9,House>Well, take out what you did to yourself yesterday

630
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,780
<26-9,House>我们回来谈肾脏和骨骼
<26-9,House>we're back to the kidneys and the bones.

631
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,450
<26-9,House>我安排了移植
<26-9,House>I'm scheduling the transplant.

632
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,690
<26-9,House>永远不要拜访病人
<26-9,House>Never visit a patient.

633
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,350
<26-10,Hank>我要孩子
<26-10,Hank>I want that baby!

634
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,330
<26-10,Hank>就算我死了  是我和劳拉的结晶
<26-10,Hank>Even if I'm gone, that's a piece of me and Lola...

635
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,200
<26-10,Hank>自由呼吸  漫步街头
<26-10,Hank>breathing, walking around town,

636
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,260
<26-10,Hank>去看棒球
<26-10,Hank>goin'to baseball games.

637
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,970
<26-10,Hank>要是你  劳拉或别人  再谈移植
<26-10,Hank>If there's any more transplant talk from you, Lola, or anybody else,

638
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,470
<26-10,Hank>我可不会再搞砸了
<26-10,Hank>I won't screw it up this time.

639
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,980
<26-10,Hank>我一定会自我了结的
<26-10,Hank>I'll take myself out for good.

640
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,920
<26-11,House>我要开始对爱迪生病治疗了
<26-11,House>I'll start treating the Addison's,

641
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,110
<26-11,House>几乎会毁掉你剩下的肾脏
<26-11,House>which will most likely destroy what's left of your kidneys.

642
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,820
<26-12,Hank>行  开始吧
<26-12,Hank>Fine. Start the treatment.

643
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,760
<27-1,Wilson>什么
<27-1,Wilson>What

644
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,140
<27-2,House>汉克·维根在我身上撒尿
<27-2,House>Hank Wiggen peed on me.

645
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,010
<27-2,House>你觉得这条裤子在易贝上能卖多少
<27-2,House>What do you think these pants are worth on eBay?

646
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
<27-3,Wilson>我办公室里有些大号尿布
<27-3,Wilson>I've got some big boy diapers in my office.

647
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
<27-3,Wilson>促销员像发糖似的散发
<27-3,Wilson>The rep hands 'em out like candy.

648
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,530
<27-4,House>那么糟糕吗
<27-4,House>Is it that bad?

649
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,230
<27-5,Wilson>不  要是你喜欢尿味的话
<27-5,Wilson>No, not if you like the smell of urine.

650
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,380
<27-6,House>当然  我为什么要相信一个
<27-6,House>Of course, why should I trust

651
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,940
<27-6,House>对于周五晚上安排撒谎的人呢
<27-6,House>someone who lies about what he's doing Friday night?

652
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,490
<27-6,House>问题是  你到底周五晚上干什么
<27-6,House>Question is, what are you really doing Friday night?

653
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,760
<27-6,House>更确切的说
<27-6,House>Or more to the point,

654
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,620
<27-6,House>还有比大脚赛车更好的事吗
<27-6,House>what could possibly be better than monster trucks?

655
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,690
<27-6,House>或者说是我们分手了
<27-6,House>Or are we breaking up?

656
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,050
<27-7,Wilson>史黛西这个周末过来
<27-7,Wilson>Stacy's coming into town this weekend.

00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,550
<27-8,House>我肯定有条裤子在这里

660
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,420
<27-8,House>等一下  史黛西是那个脱衣舞娘吗
<27-8,House>Wait a second. Is that Stacy the stripper?

<27-8,House>我听说她在大西洋城演出啊
<27-8,House>I heard she's playing Atlantic City.

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,800
<27-9,Wilson>不是  是律师史黛西
<27-9,Wilson>No, Stacy the constitutional lawyer.

663
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,580
<27-10,House>你觉得我接受不了这样的消息
<27-10,House>You thought I couldn't handle this news.

<27-13,Wilson>It's fine if you're upset.

669

<27-13,Wilson>不  是
<27-13,Wilson>No, it's-

670
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,460
<27-14,House>我没理由不高兴
<27-14,House>I have no right to be upset.

<27-16,House>我不是那个对癌症晚宴撒谎的癌症医生
<27-16,House>I'm not the cancer doctor who's lying about the cancer dinner.

676
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,760
<27-16,House>我不是那个背叛
<27-16,House>I'm not the one betraying

677
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,630
<27-16,House>所有可怜的没头发的快死的孩子的人
<27-16,House>all those poor little bald-headed dying kids.

<27-16,House>我得去搞条裤子  都发臭了
<27-16,House>I'm gonna go get some pants. I stink.

679
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,040
<27-16,House>你们虽然针对爱迪生病治疗
<27-16,House>You're treating him for Addison's

680
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,700
<27-17,Lola>却不认为会起效  是吗
<27-17,Lola>and you don't think it's gonna work?

681
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,730
<27-18,House>-他打算自杀  -我知道
<27-18,House>- He tried to kill himself. - I know.

682
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,070
<27-19,Lola>他糊涂了  我们可以再有孩子
<27-19,Lola>He's confused. We can have another baby.

<27-19,Lola>我会让他明白
<27-19,Lola>I can make him understand that.

<27-21,Lola>我能对我的身体做主
<27-21,Lola>I can make decisions about my body.

686
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,280
<27-22,House>他也能对他的身体做主  他不要你的肾
<27-22,House>And he can make decisions about his. He doesn't want your kidney.

687
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,980
<27-23,Lola>他会死吗
<27-23,Lola>So he'll die?

688
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,720
<27-24,House>可能
<27-24,House>Probably.

689
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,370
<27-25,House>要是你去做流产  他也有可能死
<27-25,House>If you keep that appointment, he'll also probably die.

690
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,350
<27-25,House>保住孩子
<27-25,House>Keep the baby.

694
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,480
<27-28,House>你闻不到吗
<27-28,House>You can't smell that?

695
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,850
<28-1,Cameron>你认为她还是会去流产  逼他就范吗
<28-1,Cameron>You think she'll abort anyway, try to force his hand?

696
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
<28-2,Chase>不  她不会冒失去他的危险
<28-2,Chase>No, she's not gonna risk losing him.

697
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,960
<28-3,Cameron>好笑吗

<28-4,Chase>不  豪斯请你去看大脚赛车  很好笑
<28-4,Chase>No, the monster trucks. House asking you, that's- that's funny.

<28-5,Cameron>我是他第一个碰到的人  他就问我了
<28-5,Cameron>I was the first person he ran into. He just asked me.

700
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,440
<28-6,Chase>对  像是个约会
<28-6,Chase>Yeah, like a date.

701
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,700
<28-7,Cameron>没错  只是我们不是约会
<28-7,Cameron>Exactly. Except for the date part.

702
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,720
<28-8,Sharon>要是病人决定做透析
<28-8,Sharon>If the patient decides to go the dialysis route,

<28-15,House>老天  告诉我那个就是你
<28-15,House>Oh, God, please tell me it's you.

<28-16,Cameron>她请客午饭  她不
<28-16,Cameron>She buys lunches. She doesn't-

717
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,130
<28-17,House>别担心  你不是同性恋  爱冒险而已
<28-17,House>Don't worry. You're not gay. You're adventurous.

718
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,080
<28-18,Chase>你觉得她出卖自己吗
<28-18,Chase>You think she's gonna prostitute herself?

719
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,860
<28-18,Chase>我们三个对她那么重要吗
<28-18,Chase>The three of us are that important to her?

720
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,800
<28-19,House>恐怕不是  不
<28-19,House>I'm afraid not, no.

721
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,040
<28-19,House>歌迷和经纪人上床就为了接近歌星
<28-19,House>The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick.

722
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,710
<28-20,Foreman>你就是那个歌星吗
<28-20,Foreman>And you're Mick?

723
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,820
<28-20,Foreman>我打比方就是这个意思  没错
<28-20,Foreman>That was the metaphor I was making, yes.

724
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,280
<28-21,Foreman>你在这里干吗
<28-21,Foreman>Why are you here?

725
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,380
<28-21,Foreman>糟糕  原来是你
<28-21,Foreman>Damn, it's you.

726
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,170
<28-22,Foreman>不是爱迪生病  新症状  嗅觉丧失
<28-22,Foreman>It's not Addison's. New symptom. Inability to smell.

727
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,960
<28-22,Foreman>我刚才在汉克的房间
<28-22,Foreman>I was just in Hank's room.

728
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,920
<28-22,Foreman>他说闻着像老兵体育场的男厕所
<28-22,Foreman>He said it smelled like the men's room at Veteran's Stadium.

729
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,460
<28-22,Foreman>他没错
<28-22,Foreman>He was right.

730
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,390
<28-23,House>我们排除了环境因素  因为太太很健康
<28-23,House>We rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy.

731
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,890
<28-23,House>其实不是  过去6个月里  她丧失了嗅觉
<28-23,House>Well, she's not. Last six months, she can't smell a thing.

732
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,040
<28-23,House>要是把他俩看成一个病人
<28-23,House>If you think of them as one single patient,

733
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,000
<28-23,House>把她的症状放到他的身上
<28-23,House>you add her symptoms to his-

734
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,570
<28-24,Chase>镉中毒
<28-24,Chase>Cadmium poisoning.

735
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,680
<28-25,House>解释全部问题
<28-25,House>It explains everything.

736
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,980
<28-25,House>包括他们的怀孕困难
<28-25,House>Even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant.

737
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,540
<28-26,Cameron>他们怎么可能接触到那么多的镉
<28-26,Cameron>How could they have gotten exposed to that much cadmium?

738
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,520
<28-27,Foreman>除非他们拿钢材和电池当早饭
<28-27,Foreman>Unless they were eating steel and batteries for breakfast.

739
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,250
<28-28,House>哪里还有镉呢
<28-28,House>So, where else is cadmium?

740
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,920
<28-29,Foreman>一些食品  被污染的地下水
<28-29,Foreman>Some foods, polluted groundwater.

741
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,620
<28-29,Foreman>我们该检查他们的住处
<28-29,Foreman>We should check their home.

742
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,890
<28-30,Chase>我想我知道是怎么回事
<28-30,Chase>I think I know how it happened.

743
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,990
<29-1,Chase>我需要另一份尿液样本
<29-1,Chase>I'm gonna need another urine sample.

744
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,230
<29-2,Lola>-为什么  -当然可以
<29-2,Lola>- What for? - Sure.

745
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,730
<29-3,Hank>想要什么都行
<29-3,Hank>Whatever you want.

746
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,500
<29-4,Chase>你之前为什么不给  现在却没有问题了
<29-4,Chase>Why wouldn't you give it to me before, but now it's no problem?

747
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,490
<29-5,Hank>我要死了  不是吗
<29-5,Hank>I'm dyin', right?

748
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,410
<29-6,Chase>所以现在你没有顾虑了
<29-6,Chase>So you've got nothing to lose this time.

749
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,210
<29-6,Chase>正面回答我  你上次担心什么
<29-6,Chase>Begs the question, what were you worried about last time?

750
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,620
<29-6,Chase>有趣的是  之前我们检查的时候
<29-6,Chase>The funny thing is, when we tested you before,

751
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,250
<29-6,Chase>我们只是查了类固醇
<29-6,Chase>we were just looking for steroids.

752
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,340
<29-6,Chase>现在我们该查什么呢  汉克
<29-6,Chase>What should we look for now, Hank?

753
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,360
<29-7,Lola>汉克  怎么一回事
<29-7,Lola>Hank, what's the story?

754
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,520
<29-8,Chase>没人的时候  时不时来点大麻
<29-8,Chase>A little weed every now and then when no one was looking?

755
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,000
<29-9,Lola>我不信
<29-9,Lola>I don't believe this.

756
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,370
<29-9,Lola>-我们戒掉了  -你戒了
<29-9,Lola>- We quit. - You did.

757
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,240
<29-10,Chase>要是你继续
<29-10,Chase>If you'd kept going,

758
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,170
<29-10,Chase>你丧失的就不止是嗅觉了
<29-10,Chase>you wouldn't have just lost your sense of smell.

759
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,880
<29-11,Hank>我戒了烈性的
<29-11,Hank>I quit the hard stuff.

760
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,140
<29-11,Hank>我就是要放松一下
<29-11,Hank>I just needed to relax.

761
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,640
<29-12,Chase>基于症状  你不仅仅是偶尔用用
<29-12,Chase>Based on the symptoms, you're a lot more than a social user.

762
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,550
<29-13,Lola>-那么你一直在骗我吗  -对不起
<29-13,Lola>- So you've been lying to me all this time? - I'm sorry.

763
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,080
<29-14,Hank>大麻生长的土壤中一定含有镉
<29-14,Hank>There must have been cadmium in the soil where the marijuana was grown.

764
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,110
<29-15,Chase>有的人钙流失
<29-15,Chase>Some people get bone loss,

765

<29-15,Chase>肾脏衰竭  有的人睾丸萎缩
<29-15,Chase>kidney failure, some people's testes shrink,

<29-15,Chase>有的人嗅觉丧失
<29-15,Chase>and some people lose their sense of smell.

767
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,830
<29-15,Chase>我们马上开始治疗
<29-15,Chase>We'll start treatment right away.

768
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,630
<29-15,Chase>开赛时你会没事的
<29-15,Chase>You should be fine by opening day.

769
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,070
<29-15,Chase>棒球在夏天  对吗
<29-15,Chase>Baseball's in the summer, right?

770
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,300
<29-16,Lola>不会影响到婴儿  会吗  镉
<29-16,Lola>It didn't hurt the baby, did it? The cadmium?

771
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,720
<29-17,Chase>要是你完全戒了  婴儿应该没事
<29-17,Chase>If you've been clean, the baby should be fine.

772
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,280
<29-18,Lola>好的
<29-18,Lola>Okay.

773
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,670
<29-19,Hank>求你了  我会都戒了的
<29-19,Hank>Please. I'll stop everything.

774
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,310
<29-19,Hank>我会  我每天去戒毒互助会
<29-19,Hank>I'll- I'll go to meetings every day.

775
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,820
<29-19,Hank>罗拉

776
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,680
<29-20,Lola>每天两次
<29-20,Lola>Twice a day.

777
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,890
<30-1,Cuddy>棒球手怎样了
<30-1,Cuddy>How's the ballplayer doing?

778
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,660
<30-3,Cuddy>-好多了  -他职业生涯就惨了
<30-3,Cuddy>- Much better. - Too bad about his career.

779
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,060
<30-4,House>什么意思
<30-4,House>What do you mean?

780
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,160
<30-5,Cuddy>棒球联盟劳资谈判决定
<30-5,Cuddy>Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement...

781
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,730
<30-5,Cuddy>要求提供全部医疗就诊记录
<30-5,Cuddy>requires medical reports on all treatment.

782
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,400
<30-5,Cuddy>鉴于汉克的记录  不可能宽大处理
<30-5,Cuddy>Given Hank's history, he's not likely to get much leniency.

783
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,410
<30-6,House>他们为何要介意他有过爱迪生病的治疗呢
<30-6,House>Why should they care that he's being treated for Addison's?

784
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,910
<30-7,Cuddy>我们没有做爱迪生病治疗
<30-7,Cuddy>You're not treating him for Addison's.

785
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,350
<30-8,House>报告是这么写的
<30-8,House>My report says I am.

786
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,440
<30-9,Cuddy>你竟敢编报告?
<30-9,Cuddy>You're lying on the report?

787
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,450
<30-10,House>人人都会犯傻
<30-10,House>Well, everybody does stupid things.

788
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,950
<30-10,House>不该因此剥夺他们全部的生活
<30-10,House>It shouldn't cost them everything they want in life.

789
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,480
<30-11,Cuddy>是不应该  不过通常都会
<30-11,Cuddy>No, it shouldn't, but it usually does.

790
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,790
<30-11,Cuddy>话说回来  除非是能打败扬基队
<30-11,Cuddy>On the other hand, if it means someone can actually beat the Yankees-

791
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,290
<31-1,Sharon>豪斯  怎么说  有办法让他参加吗
<31-1,Sharon>So what about House? Is there any way we can get him down there?

792
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,340
<31-2,Foreman>你非要谈工作吗
<31-2,Foreman>You really wanna talk about work?

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
<31-3,Sharon>不  一点不
<31-3,Sharon>No. Not at all.

794
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,940
<32-1,Cameron>不可思议啊
<32-1,Cameron>That was amazing!

795
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,300
<32-2,House>我告诉你  掘墓人队从来不会让你失望
<32-2,House>I'm telling you. Grave Digger never disappoints.

796
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,040
<32-3,Cameron>你结过婚吗
