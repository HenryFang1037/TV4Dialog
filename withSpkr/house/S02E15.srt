<2-4,Wilson>Excuse me for actually caring,what I look like.

19
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,350
<2-5,House>我觉得你应该用的词是“痴迷”
<2-5,House>I think the word,you're looking for is obsessing.

<2-13,House>What,you think,we should try counseling first?

30

<2-13,House>你到底为什么想睡在沙发上呢?,你有钱
<2-13,House>Why do you want to,sleep on a couch anyway? You got money.

31
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,150
<2-13,House>至少在离婚完成之前
<2-13,House>At least until the divorce is finalized.

32
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,550
<2-14,Wilson>明天我就不会再烦你了
<2-14,Wilson>I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.

<2-14,Wilson>What's left of it.

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,700
<3-1,Bob>那是三天前
<3-1,Bob>It was three days ago.

35
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,200
<3-1,Bob>我的喉咙变得很干
<3-1,Bob>My throat got really dry

36
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,800
<3-1,Bob>然后我的舌头就像气球一样肿起来了
<3-1,Bob>and then my tongue felt like,it was blowing up like a balloon.

37
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
<3-2,Cameron>我猜已经查过食物过敏了吧?
<3-2,Cameron>I assume somebody,checked for food allergies?

38
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
<3-3,Bob>嗯, 前两个医生, 他们都查了
<3-3,Bob>Well,the first two doctors,both did.

<3-5,Bob>The last one had no idea.Just referred us to dr. House.

42
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,700
<3-6,Cameron>病历上说发作之前,你在进行某种激烈的体力活动
<3-6,Cameron>It says the attack was preceded by,some sort of strenuous physical activity.

43
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
<3-7,Bob>呃... 是的
<3-7,Bob>Um... yeah.

<4-1,House>Awesome.A sex being with a swollen tongue.

<4-1,House>想想所有我可以让Forman去搜的地方
<4-1,House>Just think of all the places,I can make foreman search.

47
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,200
<4-2,Cameron>他不是性爱狂
<4-2,Cameron>He's not a sex being.

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,700
<4-2,Cameron>他是个幸福的已婚男人
<4-2,Cameron>He's a happily married man.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,100
<4-3,House>没这种人
<4-3,House>No such thing.

50
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,900
<4-4,Cameron>你在干什么?

<4-6,Chase>Wilson搬进去了而且很明显,他有异乎寻常吵人的习惯
<4-6,Chase>Wilson's moved in and,apparently has unusually loud toenails.

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,500
<4-7,Foreman>如果他们喜欢强奸幻想的话,菜单上也会有S&M
<4-7,Foreman>If they're into rape fantasies,,s&m is on the menu as well.

<4-8,Cameron>我没看见有外伤的迹象,而且声带明显的是张开的
<4-8,Cameron>I didn't see any sign of trauma,,and they were remarkably open.

57
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
<4-8,Cameron>我问了性传播疾病,他们..
<4-8,Cameron>I asked about stds,and they...

<4-8,Cameron>承认几个月之前参加了一次“三人行”
<4-8,Cameron>admitted participating,in a threesome a few months ago.

<4-9,House>一百元赌他们的生活跟下一对一样惨
<4-9,House>Hundred bucks says they're,as miserable as the next couple.

<4-12,Chase>如果他的婚姻不幸福的话,我想不出谁是了
<4-12,Chase>If he's not happily married,,I don't know who could be.

62
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
<4-13,House>他们在找寻什么
<4-13,House>They're looking for something.

63

<4-13,House>如果你很幸福的话,你就不用再寻找什么了
<4-13,House>If you're happy,,you got nothing to look for.

64
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,500
<4-14,Cameron>他老婆把安排这个当作周年庆礼物
<4-14,Cameron>His wife arranged it,for an anniversary present.

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,900
<4-14,Cameron>要是你问我, 如果两个人真信任彼此
<4-14,Cameron>And if you ask me,,if two people really trust each other,

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,600
<4-14,Cameron>每七年左右玩一次“三人行”,真的能对婚姻有所帮助
<4-14,Cameron>a threesome once every seven years,might actually help a marriage.

67
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,300
<4-15,House>好了, 我说我们停止鉴别诊断,开始讨论我们的意见吧
<4-15,House>Okay,I say we stop the ddx,and discuss that comment.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,100
<4-16,Cameron>我赌
<4-16,Cameron>I'll take the bet.

69
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,700
<4-17,Chase>可能第一个医生是对的
<4-17,Chase>maybe the first doctor was right.

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,700
<4-17,Chase>食物过敏解释了所有的过敏性反应
<4-17,Chase>a food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

71
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
<4-18,Foreman>可能是神经上的问题
<4-18,Foreman>Could be neurological.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
<4-18,Foreman>进行性延髓麻痹能解释这些症状
<4-18,Foreman>Progressive bulbar paralysis,would explain the symptoms.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,700
<4-19,Cameron>不可能  肌萎缩性脊髓侧索硬化症在,影响他的咽喉之前会先影响面部肌肉
<4-19,Cameron>No. Als would affect,his facial muscles before his throat.

74
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,500
<4-20,House>如果毛病不是出在他的咽喉呢?
<4-20,House>What if the problem's not in his throat?

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,500
<4-21,Chase>考虑到所有的症状都出在那儿,这么想真是有点奇怪
<4-21,Chase>That'd be a little odd considering,that's where all his symptoms are.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
<4-22,House>- 指谁?,- 病人
<4-22,House>- Says who?,- The patient.

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
<4-24,House>既然大部分病人连尺骨和肛门都分不清
<4-24,House>Since most patients,can't tell their ulna from their anus,

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,600
<4-24,House>我猜这家伙也不知道
<4-24,House>I'm guessing this guy,also doesn't know the difference

79
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
<4-24,House>噎住与窒息之间的不同
<4-24,House>between choking and suffocating.

80
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,300
<4-24,House>他的咽喉可能没事,而他的肺可能会一团糟
<4-24,House>His throat might be fine.His lungs might be messed up.

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
<4-24,House>再抽点血,做个胸部CT,还有全身的体积扫描图
<4-24,House>Get more blood,a chest ct,,and a body plethysmograph.

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,400
<4-24,House>当然了, 除非你认为我们应该先问问,病人他的肛门在哪里
<4-24,House>Unless of course,you think we should be,asking the patient where his anus is first.

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
<4-24,House>感觉, 呃, 感觉我非得上厕所,然后当我试着去小便的时候...
<4-24,House>It,uh,feels like I have to urinate,,and then when I try to go...

<5-2,House>- 是前列腺的问题, 是吗?,- 不  不是前列腺
<5-2,House>- It's prostate,isn't it?,- Nope. Not your prostate.

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,100
<5-2,House>- 是疱疹,- 疱疹?

<5-3,House>Your turn.

89
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,700
<5-3,House>如果这能让你觉得好受点
<5-3,House>If it makes you feel any better,

90
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,700
<5-3,House>到这儿来的病人,一半都有点这种真菌感染
<5-3,House>half the patients who come into this place,have some sort of crotch rot.

91
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,600
<5-3,House>呃, 不, 不是那样的
<5-3,House>Uh,no,it doesn't.

92
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,400
<5-4,House>听着, 这不可能,我结婚都二十年了
<5-4,House>Look,this is impossible.I've being married for 20 years.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,300
<5-4,House>二十年来你做过爱吗?
<5-4,House>You had any sex for 20 years?

94
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,300
<5-4,House>是啊, 当然--
<5-4,House>yes,of course-

95
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
<5-5,House>那这就是你怎么得的
<5-5,House>then that's how you got it.

<5-5,House>我只和我妻子做爱
<5-5,House>The only person,I've had sex with is my wife.

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
<5-6,House>告诉你老婆也这么做
<5-6,House>Tell your wife to do the same.

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,800
<5-6,House>这药不能治愈它,但能减少发作的频率
<5-6,House>It's not gonna cure it,,but it'll less the frequencbreaks.

101
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,000

116
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,300
<6-2,Maria>那个, 呃, 三人行
<6-2,Maria>The,um... the threesome.

117
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,500
<6-3,Cameron>还有...角色扮演
<6-3,Cameron>And... the role playing.

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,800
<6-3,Cameron>是因为生活开始变无聊了吗?
<6-3,Cameron>Is that because things get boring?

119
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,300
<6-3,Cameron>不是
<6-3,Cameron>No.

120
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,700
<6-4,Maria>我们只是在...享受我们的幻想
<6-4,Maria>We just... enjoy our fantasies.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,400
<6-4,Maria>- 你结婚了吗?,- 没
<6-4,Maria>- You married?,- No.

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,100
<6-5,Cameron>你可以重新开始做深呼吸了
<6-5,Cameron>You can go back to,taking the deep breaths now.

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,700
<6-6,Maria>婚姻失败并不是因为夫妇俩觉得厌烦了
<6-6,Maria>Marriages don't fail,because couples get bored.

124
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,600
<6-6,Maria>它们失败是因为...
<6-6,Maria>They fail because...

125
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,000
<6-6,Maria>在人们约会的时候, 会伪装成他们认为
<6-6,Maria>while they're dating,,people pretend to be the person

126
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,900
<6-6,Maria>伴侣想要的那种人而且...
<6-6,Maria>they think their partner wants and then...

127
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,600
<6-6,Maria>嗯, 你只能保持那么长时间
<6-6,Maria>well,there's only so long,you can keep that up.

128
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,000
<6-7,Cameron>也许约会的阶段他们就是那样的人,但他们会改变
<6-7,Cameron>Maybe they are that person,while they're dating,but then they change.

129
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,700
<6-8,Maria>人们觉得他们的伴侣会变?
<6-8,Maria>People thinking their partner will change?

130
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
<6-8,Maria>这是婚姻之所以失败的另一个理由
<6-8,Maria>That's another reason marriages fail.

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,300
<6-8,Maria>人们不会变的
<6-8,Maria>People don't change.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
<6-8,Maria>至少不会是实质性的改变
<6-8,Maria>At least not in any way,that really matters.

133
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
<7-1,Chase>我觉得你喝的咖啡因够用了
<7-1,Chase>I think you've had enough caffeine.

134
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,300
<7-2,Foreman>你是对的, 不是他的咽喉 是他的肺
<7-2,Foreman>You were right. It's not his throat.It's his lungs.

135
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,300
<7-3,Cameron>体积扫描图显示肺容量下降
<7-3,Cameron>Plethysmograph revealed,decreased lung capacity.

136
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,100
<7-4,Chase>CT显示肺上有斑痕
<7-4,Chase>and the ct showed lung scarring.

137
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,100
<7-5,Foreman>绝对是间质性肺纤维化
<7-5,Foreman>It's definitely,interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

138
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,700
<7-5,Foreman>不确定的是病因
<7-5,Foreman>What's not definite is the cause.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,300
<7-5,Foreman>没有关节炎, 没有结节病
<7-5,Foreman>There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.

140
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,300
<7-5,Foreman>呃, 他不服用任何处方药
<7-5,Foreman>Uh,he's not on any prescription ms.

141
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
<7-5,Foreman>而且他是个婚礼摄影师
<7-5,Foreman>And he's a wedding photographer

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
<7-5,Foreman>所以我不认为工作的时候他会暴露在,煤尘或是石棉环境中
<7-5,Foreman>so I doubt he got exposed,to coal dust or asbestos at work.

143
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,100
<7-6,Cameron>- 病因可能是先天的,- 不可能是先天的
<7-6,Cameron>- Cause could be idiopathic.- Can't be idiopathic.

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,000

<7-7,House>- Idiopathic means without a known cause.- What I meant was that-

145
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,800
<7-8,Cameron>你指的是你不知道病因是什么
<7-8,Cameron>what you meant was,you don't know what the cause is.

146
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,100
<7-9,House>说出来,  我们就可以避免这次谈话了
<7-9,House>Just say that,,and we can avoid this conversation.

147
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,600
<7-9,House>没有掌声?
<7-9,House>No applause?

148

<7-9,House>- 他现在情况怎么样了?,- 很稳定
<7-9,House>- What's his current condition?,- Stable.

149
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,500
<7-11,House>- 那我们可以等等,- 等什么?
<7-11,House>- Then we can wait.- Wait for what?

150
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,000
<7-12,Foreman>等那个你找不出来的东西,来引起其他症状
<7-12,Foreman>For whatever you can't,figure out to cause something else.

151
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
<7-13,House>你知道那会的
<7-13,House>You know it's going to.

152
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
<7-14,Foreman>间质性肺纤维化有可能会继续--
<7-14,Foreman>It's possible the ipf,could just continue to-

153
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,200
<8-1,Maria>他的皮肤有点不正常
<8-1,Maria>There's something wrong with his skin.

154
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,600
<8-3,Cameron>- 好了, 不要抓了 我得看看,- 我做不到! 这要把我逼疯了
<8-3,Cameron>- Okay,stop scratching. I gotta look at it.- I can't!This is driving me crazy.

155
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
<8-5,Cameron>- 别抓了我才能--,- 让它停下来!
<8-5,Cameron>- Stop scratching so-,- make it stop!

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
<8-3,Cameron>好的
<8-3,Cameron>Okay-

157
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
<8-3,Cameron>让它停下来 让它停下来
<8-3,Cameron>make it stop!,Make it stop.

158
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
<8-3,Cameron>现在我们有可讨论的了
<8-3,Cameron>Now we got something to discuss.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,200
<9-1,House>什么既能导致肺部斑痕也能造成,发痒的红色小水疱
<9-1,House>What causes both lung scarring,and the itchy splotchy red blotchies?

160
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
<9-2,Chase>明显不是对药物的反应
<9-2,Chase>It's obviously not a reaction to medication.

161
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
<9-2,Chase>我们还没给他药呢
<9-2,Chase>We haven't given him any yet.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,300
<9-3,House>但是除去明显不是的原因
<9-3,House>But what besides,what it's obviously not

163
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,700
<9-1,House>还有什么能引起肺部斑痕和,发痒的红色小水疱
<9-1,House>can cause both lung scarring,and the splotchies?

<9-4,Foreman>你要去哪儿?
<9-4,Foreman>Where are you going?

<9-5,House>Same color coming out as going in.

168
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
<9-5,House>你觉得这是个营销问题吗?
<9-5,House>You think that's a marketing thing?

169
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,900
<9-6,Foreman>狼疮能引起肺部斑点和皮疹
<9-6,Foreman>Lupus could cause lung scarring and a rash.

170
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,800
<9-7,Chase>或者可能还是食物过敏
<9-7,Chase>Or it could still be a food allergy.

171
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,000
<9-8,Foreman>- 我们已经排除了过敏症了,- 是吗?
<9-8,Foreman>- We've already ruled out allergies.- Did we?

172
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
<9-9,House>Cameron呢?

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,300
<9-12,Cameron>这可以稍等两分钟
<9-12,Cameron>This can wait two minutes.

176
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,300
<9-13,House>你怎么知道
<9-13,House>You don't know that.

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,600
<9-13,House>Chase认为食物过敏依旧有可能
<9-13,House>Chase thinks that food allergies,should still be on the table.

178
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,400
<9-14,Cameron>不, 那解释不通肺部斑痕
<9-14,Cameron>No,it wouldn't,explain the lung scarring.

179
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,600
<9-15,Chase>某些顺势疗法的研究发现了
<9-15,Chase>Some homeopathic studies,have found a connection

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,500
<9-15,Chase>食物过敏和自身免疫反应之间的关系
<9-15,Chase>between food allergies,and autoimmune reactions

181
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
<9-15,Chase>那可能会引发肺炎
<9-15,Chase>which could cause,lung inflammation.

182
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,400
<9-16,Cameron>是啊  还有一些顺势疗法的研究发现

<9-18,Foreman>I thought you didn't believe,there was anything wrong with this throat.

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,600
<12-10,Cameron>有区别吗?

<12-11,House>but they're more of a nuisance than,a threat. No surprise there.

<12-13,House>在度假区他吃了多少粘土?
<12-13,House>How much clay,did he eat at the resort?

<12-17,House>Run them again. Call the resort.Find some disgruntled employee to talk to.

273

<12-17,House>- 再回到他家里--,- 不是重金属
<12-17,House>- Go back to the home-,- it's not heavy metals.

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
<12-19,House>- 症状说是的,- 化验说不是的
<12-19,House>- The symptoms say it is.- The tests say it's not.

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
<12-21,House>那么, 你相信哪个?,症状还是化验结果?
<12-21,House>Well,who you gonna believe?,The symptoms or the tests?

<12-22,Chase>- 可能是次食物过敏,- Cameron说不是的
<12-22,Chase>- Could also be a food allergy.- Cameron says it's not.

277
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,100
<12-24,Chase>如果你的结果错了, 她的为什么就不能?
<12-24,Chase>If your tests can be wrong,,why can't hers?

278
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,800
<12-25,Cameron>他的饮食自从是个孩子起就没变过,他最喜欢吃玉米薄片
<12-25,Cameron>His diet hasn't changed since he was a kid.His favorite food is corn flakes.

279
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,100
<12-26,Chase>我想他就着牛奶一起吃,成人最普遍的食物中毒诱因之一
<12-26,Chase>Which I assume he eats with milk,one of,the most common adult onset food allergies.

280
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,100
<12-27,House>开始按铅中毒治疗。 这是最可能的重金属
<12-27,House>Start treating him for lead poisoning.It's the most likely heavy metal.

281
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
<12-27,House>还有, 嗯, 你可以去测他是否对,乳制品、小麦还有豆类过敏
<12-27,House>And yeah,you can test him,for allergies for dairy,wheat,and legume.

282
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,900
<12-27,House>我没跟我女儿的空手道导师有一腿
<12-27,House>I am not having an affair,with my daughter's karate instructor,

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,900
<12-27,House>也不是我传染给我丈夫疱疹的
<12-27,House>and I did not give my husband herpes.

284
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,000
<13-1,Cuddy>去找House
<13-1,Cuddy>Found out where house is.

285
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,700
<12-24,Chase>如果你确信是过敏症
<12-24,Chase>If your convinced it's allergies,

286
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,100
<14-1,Maria>为什么你给他治疗铅中毒的药?
<14-1,Maria>why're you giving him drugs,to treat lead poisoning?

287
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,700
<14-2,Chase>我们现在还不确定
<14-2,Chase>We're not convinced of anything,yet.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
<14-3,Bob>我想要别的, 这种乳霜不管用
<14-3,Bob>I think I need something else.This cream isn't working.

<14-6,Chase>- 对不起,- 不不, 不是我的背, 是我的脚
<14-6,Chase>- Sorry.- No,no,it's not my back. It's my feet.

291
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,900
<14-7,Bob>我觉得进浴室的时候踩到什么东西了
<14-7,Bob>I think I stepped in something,when I went to the bathroom.

292
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,100
<14-7,Bob>呃, 在我的袜子上 好疼啊!
<14-7,Bob>Uh,it's on my socks.It's burning!

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
<14-8,Maria>我什么也没看见
<14-8,Maria>I don't see anything.

294
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,600
<14-10,Chase>- 请把我的袜子脱下来,- 等等, 等等,等等, 等等,
<14-10,Chase>- Please take my socks off.- Wait,wait,wait,wait.

295
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
<14-11,Bob>停! 停! 停!
<14-11,Bob>Stop. Stop,stop!

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,300
<14-12,Maria>你用什么去挠他了?
<14-12,Maria>What did you just scratch him with?

297
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,700
<14-13,Chase>如果是过敏反应, 应该会出现在背上,而不是脚上
<14-13,Chase>if there was an allergic reaction,,it'd be on his back,not on his feet.

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,700
<14-13,Chase>- 疼死了! 求求你, 让它停下来,- 需要加巴喷汀（治疗神经病理性疼痛）
<14-13,Chase>- Oh,god,it's burning!Please make it stop.- Gonna need some gabapentin in here.

299
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,900
<15-1,Chase>下肢出现剧烈疼痛
<15-1,Chase>excruciating pain in the lower extremities.

300
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
<15-1,Chase>不是食物过敏的症状
<15-1,Chase>Not a sign of a food allergy.

301
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,300
<15-2,Foreman>意味着有神经问题
<15-2,Foreman>Means there's a neurological problem.

302
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
<15-3,House>更显著的是
<15-3,House>More significantly,

303
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,300
<15-3,House>这是另外一个经典的重金属中毒的标志
<15-3,House>it's yet another classic,sign of heavy metals.

304
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,300
<15-4,Cameron>我刚刚又作了一次发检和血检
<15-4,Cameron>And I just did yet another,hair and blood test for lead

305
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,200
<15-4,Cameron>来检查铅还有其他任何他可能,暴露在之下的物质
<15-4,Cameron>and everything else he,could possibly have been exposed to.

306
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,600
<15-4,Cameron>全都是阴性
<15-4,Cameron>They're all negative.

307
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,000
<15-4,Cameron>肯定是别的什么
<15-4,Cameron>It's gotta be something else.

308
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,000
<15-5,Foreman>- 狼疮可能导致,- 不是
<15-5,Foreman>- Lupus could cause-,- no.

309
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,400
<15-6,House>狼疮恶化得更缓慢,还会有关节疼痛
<15-6,House>Lupus progresses slower.There'd be joint pain.

310
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,400
<15-7,Foreman>所以这不是个典型的例子
<15-7,Foreman>So it's not a typical case.

311
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,900
<15-7,Foreman>- 我们应该做次抗核抗体检测,- 不是狼疮
<15-7,Foreman>- We should get an ana,- it's not lupus.

312
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,500
<15-8,House>症状不相符
<15-8,House>Symptoms don't match.

313
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,700
<15-9,Cameron>化验结果不符合重金属中毒
<15-9,Cameron>And the tests don't match heavy metals.

314
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
<16-1,Maria>又来了 他没法呼吸了!
<16-1,Maria>it's happening again.He's not breathing!

315
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
<16-2,Chase>舌头肿大, 气管关闭
<16-2,Chase>Tongue's swelling,airways closing.

316
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,500
<16-2,Chase>他得不到氧气了
<16-2,Chase>'S not getting any air.

317
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
<16-3,Cameron>- 他的肺没问题,- 我们必须要做气管插管
<16-3,Cameron>His lungs are clear.We're gonna have to intubate.

318
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
<16-4,Chase>Bob, 放松, 这个会帮助你呼吸的
<16-4,Chase>try to relax,bob,,this is gonna help you breathe.

319
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
<16-5,Maria>哦, 天哪!
<16-5,Maria>Oh,my god!

320
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,200
<16-6,Chase>他会吸进去的。 吸出来!
<16-6,Chase>He's gonna aspirate. Need suction!

321
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,700
<16-8,Foreman>- 怎么了?,- 吸出来!
<16-8,Foreman>- What's happening?,- Suction.

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,900
<16-9,Chase>太多呕吐物了,我们不可能插管的
<16-9,Chase>there's too much vomit.We're never going to be able to intubate.

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
<16-9,Chase>- 我们要做人造气管术,- 他不呼吸了
<16-9,Chase>- We need to trach him.- He's not breathing.

324
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,900
<17-1,Foreman>他尿里的蛋白质和红细胞含量升高了
<17-1,Foreman>his urine has elevated,proteins and red blood cells.

325
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
<17-1,Foreman>是狼疮引起的肾衰竭
<17-1,Foreman>It's lupus-induced kidney failure.

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,700
<17-2,House>- 如果我们不开始治疗的话...- 重金属的毒性会引起呕吐
<17-2,House>- If we don't start treatment..- heavy metal toxicity could cause vomiting.

327
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,700
<17-3,Foreman>狼疮肾炎也会, 而且还会导致组织肿大
<17-3,Foreman>And so would lupus nephritis,,and it also causes tissue swelling.

328
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,700
<17-4,House>他被他的舌头噎住了, 不是他的脚
<17-4,House>He's choking on his tongue,not his feet.

329
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,400
<17-5,Foreman>我们给他治疗炎症的类固醇,能引起面部肿大
<17-5,Foreman>the corticosteroids we gave him to control,the inflammation can cause facial swelling.

330
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
<17-6,House>依旧不是他的咽喉, 但你们离得很近了
<17-6,House>It's still not his throat,,but you're getting closer.

331
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
<17-7,Foreman>我要做抗核抗体检测和血清培养
<17-7,Foreman>I'm doing an ana and a serum compliment.

332
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,600
<17-8,House>如果你那么确定,干吗浪费时间做这些实验?
<17-8,House>If you'r so sure,,why we waste time with tests?

333
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
<17-8,House>开始治疗就是了
<17-8,House>Just start treatment.

334
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,300
<17-8,House>哦,等等 我们不能那么做,因为我们已经那么做了而且不起作用
<17-8,House>Oh,no,wait,we can't do that because,we already have and it's not working.

335
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,500
<17-9,Foreman>- 因此...- 类固醇不是治疗狼疮肾炎
<17-9,Foreman>- Ergo...- corticosteroids aren't the only treatment

336
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,800
<17-9,Foreman>的唯一方案
<17-9,Foreman>for lupus nephritis.

337
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,500
<17-9,Foreman>我们还可以试试环磷酰胺,或者免疫抑制剂
<17-9,Foreman>We could also try,cyclophosphamide or immunosuppressants.

338
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,800
<17-10,House>但只有我们用抗核抗体检验, 血清培养
<17-10,House>Only if we confirm the diagnosis,with an ana,serum compliment,

339
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,800
<17-10,House>抗DNA抗体检验, 静脉肾盂造影,或肾活组织切片试验确定诊断结果才行
<17-10,House>anti-dna,iv pyelogram,and kidney biopsy.

340
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,500
<17-11,Foreman>那现在突然间你又相信试验了
<17-11,Foreman>So now you suddenly believe in tests?

341
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,900
<17-12,House>- 这些症状-,- 这些症状都指向重金属中毒
<17-12,House>- The symptoms-,- the symptoms all point to heavy metal poisoning.

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,200
<17-13,Foreman>是啊, 我们都明白这个
<17-13,Foreman>Yeah,we all get it.

343
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
<17-13,Foreman>除非你有证据又能告诉我是哪种重金属
<17-13,Foreman>Unless you've got proof and can tell me,which heavy metal it is,

344
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,700
<17-13,Foreman>我就开始对狼疮的治疗方案了
<17-13,Foreman>I'm starting treatment for lupus.

345
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,700
<18-1,Foreman>全身红斑性狼疮导致免疫系统过度活跃
<18-1,Foreman>systemic lupus erythematosus causes,the immune system to become hyperactive.

346
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
<18-1,Foreman>会攻击正常的人体组织
<18-1,Foreman>Attack normal tissue.

347
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,800
<18-1,Foreman>这可能是肺部发炎和喉部肿胀的原因
<18-1,Foreman>It could be what caused the lung inflammation,as well as the swelling in his throat

348
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,000
<18-1,Foreman>并且开始破坏他的肾脏
<18-1,Foreman>and now what appears,to be damage to his kidneys.

349
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
<18-1,Foreman>通常用类固醇治疗
<18-1,Foreman>The treatment's usually steroids.

350
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,700
<18-2,Maria>但他已经在用了呀
<18-2,Maria>But he's already on steroids.

351
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,500
<18-3,Foreman>如果试验证明我们是对的
<18-3,Foreman>If the tests confirm,we're on the right track,

352
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,100
<18-3,Foreman>我们可以尝试其他的药物
<18-3,Foreman>there are other medications,we can try.

353
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,300
<18-4,Maria>如果不起作用呢?
<18-4,Maria>And if those don't work?

354
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,300
<18-5,Foreman>狼疮是慢性症状
<18-5,Foreman>Well,lupus is a chronic condition,

355
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,900
<18-5,Foreman>通常可以控制
<18-5,Foreman>but it's generally controllable.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,900
<18-6,Maria>什么叫通常?
<18-6,Maria>What do you mean,generally?

357
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,000
<18-7,Foreman>罕见的情况是心肾衰竭
<18-7,Foreman>In rare cases,it can cause,cardiovascular or renal failure.

358
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
<18-8,Maria>心以及...肾?
<18-8,Maria>Cardiovascular,and... renal.

359
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,400
<18-8,Maria>那是指心脏和肾脏对吧?
<18-8,Maria>That's,uh,the heart,and the kidneys,right?

360
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
<18-9,Foreman>是的
<18-9,Foreman>Yeah.

361
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
<18-10,Bob>不要着急
<18-10,Bob>Don't worry.

362
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,700
<18-10,Bob>会好起来的
<18-10,Bob>It'll be all right.

363
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,000
<19-1,Wilson>喜欢么?
<19-1,Wilson>Enjoying the salad?

364
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
<19-2,House>没放生菜
<19-2,House>There's no lettuce.

365
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
<19-3,Wilson>我知道里面没有生菜
<19-3,Wilson>I'm aware that there's no lettuce!

366
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
<19-3,Wilson>想知道我是怎么知道的么?
<19-3,Wilson>Do you know,when I obtained this knowledge?

367
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500

<19-5,Wilson>For myself.

369
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,800
<19-6,House>我怎么会知道?
<19-6,House>Well,how was I supposed to know?

370
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,500
<19-7,Wilson>本来我以为...
<19-7,Wilson>Well... I was hoping-

371
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
<19-7,Wilson>这个能提醒你,(纸条: "别碰我的午饭")
<19-7,Wilson>this might tip you off.

372
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,300
<19-8,House>这很自私 你不觉得么?
<19-8,House>That's kind of selfish.Don't you think?

373
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
<19-9,Wilson>我说了我帮你做一份,你说不要
<19-9,Wilson>I offered to make you some.You said no.

374
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,800
<19-10,House>呵呵,那是在我尝过烙饼以前
<19-10,House>Ah,that was before I tasted the pancakes.

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,400
<19-10,House>我这是在称赞你,你应该感到高兴
<19-10,House>It's a compliment,,you should be flattered.

<19-10,House>给你
<19-10,House>Here.

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,900
<19-11,Cuddy>Lambert太太的疱疹测试结果
<19-11,Cuddy>It's mrs. Lambert's herpes test results.

378
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
<19-12,House>谁的太太?
<19-12,House>Mrs. Who?

379
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,100
<19-13,Cuddy>你告诉过很多病人,他太太和女儿的空手道老师上过床?
<19-13,Cuddy>You've told more than one patient

381
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,600
<19-13,Cuddy>想要煽风点火就要清扫战场
<19-13,Cuddy>You wanna stir the pot,,you have to clean up the mess.

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
<19-14,House>你如果得了疱疹会怎么做?
<19-14,House>What would you do if you got herpes?

383
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
<19-15,Cuddy>她五点准时过来,不要让我来催你
<19-15,Cuddy>she's coming in at 5:00,,don't make me come looking for you.

384
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,400
<19-16,House>我知道你会怎么做
<19-16,House>actually,I know what you'd do.

385
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,600
<19-16,House>-但是我觉得一个正常的男人...- 还有别打电话过来请病假
<19-16,House>- But I mean a normal guy-,- and don't be calling in sick,

386
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,000
<19-17,Cuddy>或者说你的团队需要你
<19-17,Cuddy>or saying that your team needs you

387
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,800
<19-17,Cuddy>去做什么紧急会诊
<19-17,Cuddy>for some kind emergency consult.

388
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,200
<19-18,House>如果他怀疑他的老婆有可能也有外遇
<19-18,House>If he suspected that maybe his wife,had also been playing pickle games,

389
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,000
<19-18,House>他不会说出来
<19-18,House>he could just keep it on the down low.

390
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,900
<19-18,House>直到她也被传染
<19-18,House>At least wait till she got infected.

391
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,500
<19-19,Wilson>你把疱疹传染给妻子只为了转移视线?
<19-19,Wilson>You'd give your own wife herpes,just to shift the blame onto-

392
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,500
<19-20,Cuddy>如果他得了疱疹,甚至会传染给亲生母亲
<19-20,Cuddy>oh,he'd give his own mother herpes,if it got him out of clinic duty.

393
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,600
<19-21,House>可能就是太太出轨了
<19-21,House>Of course, maybe it was the wife.

394
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,500
<19-21,House>也许她才是...
<19-21,House>Maybe she was the one who-

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
<20-1,House>Nympho太太在哪?
<20-1,House>where's mrs. Nympho?

396
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
<20-2,Cameron>在外面,怎么了?
<20-2,Cameron>- She's waiting outside.- Why?

397
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,100
<20-3,House>好好查一查她
<20-3,House>Go search her.

398
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
<20-4,Cameron>查她的医疗记录么？
<20-4,Cameron>What,you mean her medical records?

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,500
<20-5,House>不是这个意思,这可是个搜查她的好机会
<20-5,House>If I meant that,,good chance i'd have said that.

400
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,000
<20-6,Cameron>你认为她在下毒?
<20-6,Cameron>You think she's poisoning him?

401
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
<20-7,House>他应该已经开始好转
<20-7,House>His symptoms should be,getting better the longer he's here.

402
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
<20-7,House>但是却越来越糟
<20-7,House>Instead they're getting worse.

403
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,600
<20-8,Cameron>要么她在下毒要么...
<20-8,Cameron>So either she's poisoning him or-

404
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,800
<20-8,Cameron>重金属不是病因.
<20-8,Cameron>it's not heavy metals.

405
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,200
<20-8,Cameron>我们已经排除了10种重金属了
<20-8,Cameron>We've done over ten,different heavy metal tox screens-

406
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,600
<20-9,House>再试剩下的30种也没什么意义
<20-9,House>because there's no reason,to test for the other 30.

407
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,400
<20-9,House>毒素不通过空气和食物传播,除非有人放入你的体内
<20-9,House>They don't get into the air or food.

409
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
<20-9,House>要想知道她搞什么鬼就要搜查一下
<20-9,House>And the only way,we're going to find out

411
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,500
<20-10,Cameron>我不想因为荒谬的理论指控谁谋杀亲夫
<20-10,Cameron>I am not going to accuse a woman,of trying to murder her own husband

414
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
<20-12,Cameron>已经排除了其他可能性
<20-12,Cameron>We've eliminated,every other possibility.

415
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,000
<20-12,Cameron>我们没有排除掉所有的可能性
<20-12,Cameron>We have not eliminated,every other possibility.

416
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,800
<20-13,House>狼疮疗法有任何效果么?
<20-13,House>Has he responded to,the latest lupus treatment?

417
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,100
<20-14,Cameron>只过了几个小时
<20-14,Cameron>He's only been on it,for a few hours.

418
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
<20-15,House>他没有反应因为这不是狼疮
<20-15,House>He hasn't responded,because it's not lupus.

419
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,700
<20-15,House>这不是过敏,肌肉萎缩,,关节炎或是肉状瘤病
<20-15,House>It's not allergies,als,,arthritis,or sarcoidosis.

420
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,300
<20-15,House>她才是唯一的原因
<20-15,House>She's all that's left.

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
<20-15,House>去查
<20-15,House>Do it!

422
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,400
<20-15,House>我是House医生
<20-15,House>I'm dr. House.

423
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,100
<21-1,House>我能看一下你的包吗?
<21-1,House>Mind if I take a look in your purse?

424
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
<21-2,Maria>为什么?
<21-2,Maria>Why?

425
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,900
<21-3,House>因为我要搜一下
<21-3,House>Because I'm going to,need to search it

426
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
<21-3,House>还要搜你,看你怎么下的毒
<21-3,House>and you for whatever,you're using to poison your husband.

427
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,800
<21-4,Maria>为什么我要伤害我的丈夫?
<21-4,Maria>Why would I want to hurt my husband?

428
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,800
<21-5,House>那你不会介意我搜一下吧
<21-5,House>Then you won't mind if I search your things.

429
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
<21-6,Maria>搜吧
<21-6,Maria>Go ahead.

430
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
<21-6,Maria>满意了?
<21-6,Maria>You satisfied?

431
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,100
<22-1,Cuddy>当然不行了
<22-1,Cuddy>Absolutely not.

432
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,000
<22-2,House>她同意我搜查所有地方
<22-2,House>She agreed to,let me search everywhere else,

433
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,300
<22-2,House>除了那里,你不觉得可疑吗?
<22-2,House>but this she says no to.Doesn't that tell you something?

434
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,800
<22-3,Cuddy>这说明她不想让一个神经错乱,的医生拿着手电筒在她阴道里找东西
<22-3,Cuddy>Yes,that she doesn't want some lunatic doctor,searching her vagina with a flashlight.

435
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,600
<22-4,House>- Cameron可以啊,-我才不会...
<22-4,House>- Oh,cameron could do that.- I'm not going to-

436
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,600
<22-5,Cameron>她进医院以来就没出去过
<22-5,Cameron>the woman hasn't left,the hospital since they arrived.

437
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
<22-6,House>不管她用了什么,她肯定藏起来了
<22-6,House>Whatever she's using,,she's obviously hiding somewhere.

438
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,000
<22-7,Cameron>她没有下毒
<22-7,Cameron>She's not poisoning him.

439
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,400
<22-8,House>这是唯一的解释
<22-8,House>It's the only explanation.

440
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,400
<22-9,Cameron>那只是你扭曲的头脑,能想到的唯一解释
<22-9,Cameron>No,it's the only,explanation your twisted mind

441
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
<22-9,Cameron>你对无法找到答案而暴跳如雷
<22-9,Cameron>can come up with because,you're angry that you can't find the answer,

442
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
<22-9,Cameron>想拿她出气
<22-9,Cameron>and you're taking it out on her.

443
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,100
<22-10,House>你却只是因为幼稚和浪漫维护一个陌生人
<22-10,House>And you are protecting a complete stranger,based on some childishly romantic notion

444
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,500
<22-10,House>比如婚姻总是幸福的,人们不会自相残杀
<22-10,House>that people are all so happily married,they don't want to kill each other.

445
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
<22-11,Cameron>你说我幼稚?
<22-11,Cameron>You calling me childish?

446
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,000
<22-12,House>-该长大了,-都给我闭嘴
<22-12,House>- Grow up.- Shut up. Both of you.

447
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
<22-13,Cuddy>离他老婆远点
<22-13,Cuddy>And stay away from his wife.

448
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,900
<22-13,Cuddy>对不起,我不能同意你去侵犯别人
<22-13,Cuddy>Sorry. I'm not giving you,permission to assault someone.

449
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
<22-13,Cuddy>怎么了?
<22-13,Cuddy>Let's see.

450
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,400
<22-13,Cuddy>我看到...
<22-13,Cuddy>I'm thinking...

451
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,300
<23-1,Wilson>芥末上校(美国电影clue的主角),在一个放着蜡烛架的音乐室里
<23-1,Wilson>colonel mustard in the music room,with the candlestick.

452
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,900
<23-2,House>并不是什么音乐室
<23-2,House>There's no music room.

453
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,500
<23-2,House>那是一个音乐学校
<23-2,House>It's the conservatory.

454
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,400
<23-3,Wilson>- 不一样么,-不一样
<23-3,Wilson>- Same thing.- No,it isn'T.

455
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,900
<23-4,House>如果我们找不出她到底用了什么
<23-4,House>If we don't find out,what she's using

456
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
<23-4,House>立即开始治疗,他会在一周内死亡
<23-4,House>and start treatment immediately,,he'll be dead in a week.

457
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
<23-5,Wilson>如果你是对的话
<23-5,Wilson>If you're right.

458
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,400
<23-5,Wilson>如果头是对的,你等于强奸了一个无辜的妇女
<23-5,Wilson>If foreman's right,you'd have,basically raped an innocent woman.

459
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,400
<23-5,Wilson>我妻子解雇了女佣
<23-5,Wilson>My wife fired the maid.

460
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,300
<23-5,Wilson>显然她想要使所有让她想起我的东西消失
<23-5,Wilson>Apparently she's getting rid of,everything that reminds her of me.

461
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
<23-6,House>你上了女佣?
<23-6,House>You did your maid?

462
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,900
<23-7,Wilson>只是对她很好
<23-7,Wilson>I was nice to our maid,

463
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,300
<23-7,Wilson>这使我妻子非常恼火,天晓得为什么
<23-7,Wilson>which... annoyed her.God knows why.

464
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,200
<23-8,House>-可能你妻子上了她,-没有人上她
<23-8,House>Maybe she was doing her.No one was doing her.

465
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,200
<23-9,Wilson>明白了?
<23-9,Wilson>All right?

466
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,900
<23-10,House>但是你想要对此负责
<23-10,House>But,you still feel responsible.

467
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,600
<23-10,House>即使没有人被上,这仍然是你的错
<23-10,House>Even though nothing or no one was done,,it's still your fault.

468
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,000
<23-11,Wilson>我想要继续付她工钱,直到她找到工作
<23-11,Wilson>I offered to keep paying her salary,until she found another job.

469
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,700
<23-11,Wilson>但是她不干活就坚决不收一分钱,所以...
<23-11,Wilson>But she refused to take any money,without doing any work,so-

470
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,600
<23-11,Wilson>想要雇人打扫房间么?
<23-11,Wilson>want someone to clean your apartment?

471
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
<23-11,Wilson>我付钱.
<23-11,Wilson>It's on me.

472
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,700
<23-12,House>你应该搬出去而不是搬更多的人进来
<23-12,House>You're supposed to moving out,,not moving more people in.

473
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,200
<23-13,Wilson>她不是搬进来,她只是打扫卫生
<23-13,Wilson>She's not moving in.She's gonna clean.

474
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
<23-14,House>也许我应该搬出去然后你们就可以...
<23-14,House>Maybe I should just move out,,and the the two of you-

475
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
<23-15,Maria>我的上帝
<23-15,Maria>oh,god!

476
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,100
<23-15,Maria>- 我的上帝,不,- 紧急情况!
<23-15,Maria>- Oh,god,no.- call a code!

477
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,200
<23-16,Foreman>360伏电压,给他做EPI
<23-16,Foreman>Charge it to 360.Give him epi.

478
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
<23-16,Foreman>充电完毕!
<23-16,Foreman>Clear!

479
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
<23-17,Cameron>-还是没有脉搏,- 充电
<23-17,Cameron>- Still no pulse.- Charging.

480
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
<23-18,Foreman>充电完毕!
<23-18,Foreman>Clear!

481
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
<23-19,Cameron>有脉搏了
<23-19,Cameron>I got a pulse.

482
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
<23-19,Cameron>瞳孔有反应
<23-19,Cameron>Pupils are reactive.

483
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
<23-19,Cameron>能听见么?
<23-19,Cameron>You still with us?

484
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
<23-20,Foreman>他缺氧不到一分钟
<23-20,Foreman>He was without oxygen,for less than a minute.

485
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
<23-20,Foreman>不是氧气不足
<23-20,Foreman>It can't be hypoxia.

486
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
<23-20,Foreman>可能是中风
<23-20,Foreman>Could be a stroke.

487
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,800
<23-21,Maria>亲爱的,能听见么?
<23-21,Maria>Honey,can you hear me?

488
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,500
<23-23,Maria>Bob,跟我说话. Bob?
<23-23,Maria>Bob,talk to me. Bob?

489
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
<23-23,Maria>亲爱的,求求你
<23-23,Maria>Honey,please.

490
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,800
<23-24,Cameron>Bob,能听见么?
<23-24,Cameron>Bob,can you hear me?

491
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,400
<23-25,Maria>- 他醒了,- 能听见么?
<23-25,Maria>- He's awake.- Can you hear me?

492
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,300
<23-27,Maria>亲爱的?
<23-27,Maria>Honey?

493
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,500
<23-28,Wilson>她可真是个好演员
<23-28,Wilson>Yes. She is...quite the little actress.

494
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,800
<24-1,House>那么我们假设她没有下毒
<24-1,House>So let's say,she's not poisoning him.

495
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,500
<24-2,Foreman>没什么好讨论的了
<24-2,Foreman>There's nothing more to discuss.

496
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,400
<24-2,Foreman>先是肺和肾衰竭,然后是神经性症状,现在又是心脏停止跳动
<24-2,Foreman>We've got lung and kidney failure,,neurological symptoms, and now cardiac arrest.

497
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,000
<24-2,Foreman>狼疮的定义就是影响到多器官,的系统性疾病
<24-2,Foreman>A systemic disease with multi-organ,involvement is the definition of lupus.

498
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,400
<24-3,Cameron>自动免疫性抑制没起作用
<24-3,Cameron>autoimmune suppressants aren't helping.

499
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,700
<24-4,Chase>应该试试环磷酰胺(一种抗肿瘤药),看看有没有效果
<24-4,Chase>We should start him on cyclophosphamide.See if it makes a difference.

500
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
<24-4,Chase>没错
<24-4,Chase>Yeah.

501
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
<24-5,House>还有干扰素
<24-5,House>And interferon.

502
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,900
<24-6,Foreman>干扰素可不是治疗狼疮的方法
<24-6,Foreman>Interferon isn't,an approved treatment for lupus.

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
<24-7,Cameron>你不会还以为..
<24-7,Cameron>You're not still thinking-

504
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,200
<24-8,Chase>干扰素也不是治疗重金属中毒的方法
<24-8,Chase>interferon isn't an approved,treatment for heavy metal toxicity either.

505
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,400
<24-9,House>但是这是治疗病毒感染的唯一方法
<24-9,House>But it's pretty much the only,thing we can do for a viral infection.

506
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,400
<24-10,Foreman>- 我们没有想到是因为,- 这不可能,他没有发烧
<24-10,Foreman>- We didn't consider it because-,- because it doesn't make sense. There's no fever.

507
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,200
<24-11,House>因为免疫系统已经失灵了
<24-11,House>Because he's got no immune system.

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,700
<24-11,House>这多亏了你治疗狼疮用的免疫抑制剂
<24-11,House>Thanks to the immunosuppressants,you prescribed for lupus treatment.

509
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,100
<24-12,Cameron>他刚住院时也没有发烧
<24-12,Cameron>He didn't present,with a fever either.

510
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,500
<24-13,House>因为那是在病毒引起的自免疫反应之后
<24-13,House>Because at that point,,he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction.

511
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
<24-13,House>同样地
<24-13,House>Which again-

512
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,300
<24-13,House>多亏了治疗狼疮用的免疫抑制剂
<24-13,House>thanks to the immunosuppressants,you prescribed for lupus treatment,

513
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
<24-13,House>他的免疫系统基本上成为了滋生病毒的温床
<24-13,House>his immune system basically rolled,out the red carpet for the dormant virus,

514
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,300
<24-13,House>把病毒激活,引起感染,给他用干扰素
<24-13,House>waking it up,turning it into a present,viral infection. Give him interferon.

515
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,600
<24-14,Foreman>但是如果这是狼疮,干扰素会使他更加糟糕
<24-14,Foreman>But if it is lupus,,interferon could make it worse.

516
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,200
<24-14,Foreman>会进一步抑制骨髓功能
<24-14,Foreman>Suppress his bone marrow even further.

517
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,100
<24-15,House>哪个更有可能?,使用类固醇治疗
<24-15,House>Which is more likely?,A rapidly progressing,

518
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
<24-15,House>但发作极快的自发性狼疮可能性大
<24-15,House>acute-onset lupus in a patient,who's already on steroids,

519
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,300
<24-15,House>还是一个医生团队遗漏了,病毒感染的可能性大
<24-15,House>or a team of doctors,missing a post-viral reaction?

520
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,700
<24-16,Foreman>我们并没有遗漏什么
<24-16,Foreman>We didn't miss anything.

521
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,000
<24-17,House>好吧,那我是错的,给他用干扰素!
<24-17,House>Well then,I'm wrong and you shouldn't-,give him interferon!

522
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,600
<25-1,Foreman>静脉内注射干扰素对一些,病毒感染很有效果
<25-1,Foreman>intravenous interferon has been shown,to be effective against some viral infections.

523
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,200
<25-2,Maria>但是你说过这不是感染
<25-2,Maria>But,I thought you said,it wasn't an infection.

524
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,900
<25-2,Maria>你说这是狼疮
<25-2,Maria>You said it was lupus.

525
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,600
<25-3,Foreman>越来越严重的症状让我们重新诊断
<25-3,Foreman>The increasingly rapid progression of,the symptoms has caused us to reconsider.

526
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,900
<25-4,Maria>如果你们还是错的呢?
<25-4,Maria>And what if you're wrong here too?

527
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,800
<25-4,Maria>如果并不是病毒的原因
<25-4,Maria>What if it's not a virus?

528
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,900
<25-5,Foreman>用干扰素的确存在风险
<25-5,Foreman>There are risks with interferon.

529
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,800
<25-5,Foreman>特别是对一个早就没有,免疫功能的病人来说
<25-5,Foreman>Especially in a patient,who's already immunosuppressed.

530
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,900
<25-5,Foreman>你看,现在这个时候,肺部,肾脏,还有心脏都在不断衰竭
<25-5,Foreman>Look,at this point,you're lungs,kidneys,,and heart are all failing.

531
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,200
<25-5,Foreman>我们已经没有其他选择了
<25-5,Foreman>We really don't have any choice.

532
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,800
<25-6,Bob>我作弊了
<25-6,Bob>I cheated.

533
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
<25-7,Maria>什么?
<25-7,Maria>What?

534
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,400
<25-8,Bob>9年级的时候,地理课上
<25-8,Bob>9th grade... earth science.

535
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
<25-8,Bob>Foley先生
<25-8,Bob>Mr. Foley.

536
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
<25-8,Bob>我坐在你身后,这样就可以偷看你
<25-8,Bob>I sat behind you,so I could cheat off of you.

537
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
<25-9,Maria>我让你偷看的...
<25-9,Maria>And I let you cheat...

538
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,200
<25-9,Maria>这样你就会坐在我身后
<25-9,Maria>so you'd sit behind me.

539
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
<25-10,Bob>我以为我们会白头偕老
<25-10,Bob>I thought we were,gonna grow old together.

540
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,700
<25-11,Maria>- 9年级,- 不,是10年级
<25-11,Maria>- In 9th grade?,- No. 10th.

541
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,900
<25-12,Bob>怎么,你想让我先追你?
<25-12,Bob>What,you had to,make sure I put out first?

542
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
<25-13,Maria>不
<25-13,Maria>No.

543
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,900
<25-14,Bob>我知道你在7年级就想追我
<25-14,Bob>I knew you put out in the 7th grade.

544
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,300
<25-21,Maria>我爱你
<25-21,Maria>I love you.

545
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,700
<25-15,Maria>我知道
<25-15,Maria>Yeah,I know.

546
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,500
<25-16,Bob>说你爱我
<25-16,Bob>Say you love me.

547
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,700
<25-17,Maria>我不说
<25-17,Maria>No.

548
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,100
<25-18,Bob>为什么不说
<25-18,Bob>Why not?

549
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,100
<25-19,Maria>因为你不会死的
<25-19,Maria>Because... you're not dying.

550
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,000
<25-20,Bob>说你爱我
<25-20,Bob>Say it anyway.

551
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,700
<25-20,Bob>你不想让我伤害你吧?
<25-20,Bob>You gonna make me hurt you?

552
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
<25-21,Maria>我爱你
<25-21,Maria>I love you.

553
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
<25-21,Maria>这不起作用
<25-21,Maria>it's not working.

554
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,600
<26-1,Foreman>他的肺和肾还在不断恶化
<26-1,Foreman>Both his lungs and kidneys,are continuing to deteriorate.

555
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,600
<26-3,Foreman>加大剂量,早加大了
<26-3,Foreman>Up the dose.We already have.

556
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,100
<26-4,House>显然还不够
<26-4,House>Apparently not enough.

557
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
<26-5,Foreman>我不认为是病毒
<26-5,Foreman>I don't think it's a virus. 

558
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
<26-5,Foreman>我们已经进行了所有的测定,全都是阴性
<26-5,Foreman>We've been titers for everything,we could think of. They're all negative.

559
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,600
<26-6,House>加大干扰素的剂量
<26-6,House>Increase the interferon.

560
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,900
<26-7,Foreman>House,有更好的主意么?
<26-7,Foreman>House. You got a better idea?

561
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,200
<26-8,House>- 除了狼疮?,- 没有
<26-8,House>- Other than lupus?,- No.

562
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
<26-10,House>那么加大剂量
<26-10,House>Then up the dose.

<27-2,House>你太太患有疱疹
<27-2,House>Your wife has herpes.

568
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
<27-3,House>你没有任何外遇...目前来说
<27-3,House>you haven't had an outbreak... yet.

569
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
<27-3,House>放心,你会有的
<27-3,House>Don't worry,you will.

570
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,100
<27-3,House>你这个混蛋
<27-3,House>You rutty jackass!

571
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,100
<27-4,House>我?20年来我没和任何人上过床
<27-4,House>Me? I haven't been,with anyone in 20 years!

572
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,700
<27-4,House>但你的那个上有疱疹
<27-4,House>But you're the one,with the blisters on his-

573
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,200
<27-4,House>不代表他先得病
<27-4,House>doesn't mean,that he got it first.

574
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,000
<27-4,House>并不一定要通过外遇才能传染
<27-4,House>You don't need to have an,outbreak to spread the virus.

575
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,400
<27-9,House>对阿!,你才是那个整天吵着要更多的性生活的人
<27-9,House>Yeah!And you're the one,always talking about wanting more sex.

576
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
<27-10,Cuddy>那是和你
<27-10,Cuddy>From you.

577
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
<27-4,House>如果你没有在外面胡来,可能能让我满足
<27-4,House>And maybe I'd get more if you,weren't actually getting it somewhere else.

578
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
<27-5,House>好吧,看来你们显然有好多话想说
<27-5,House>Well,you two obviously,have a lot to talk about.

579
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,500
<27-6,Cuddy>别想把这个烂摊子推给我
<27-6,Cuddy>Don't even think about,dumping this on my lap.

580
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,300
<27-6,Cuddy>肯定有方法可以证明是他
<27-6,Cuddy>There's gotta be someway,to prove that it's him.

581
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,500
<27-7,Cuddy>我很抱歉,没有这样的测试
<27-7,Cuddy>I'm sorry. There is no test.

582
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
<27-8,House>你们有没有曾经使用过公用坐便器?
<27-8,House>Either you two ever sit on a public toilet?

00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
<27-8,House>- 有么?,- 当然有了
<27-8,House>- Well?,- Of course.

<27-9,House>疱疹病毒在短时间内可以在体外存活
<27-9,House>Herpes can live for short,periods of time outside the body.

585
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,000
<27-10,Cuddy>House医生,你知道你不会通过
<27-10,Cuddy>Dr. House,you know,you can't get herpes-

586
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,300
<27-11,House>一些小心谨慎的医生会告诉你
<27-11,House>some politically,correct doctors will tell you

587
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,500
<27-11,House>从坐便器上感染病毒是不可能的
<27-11,House>that it's impossible to,get infected by a toilet seat,

588
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,200
<27-11,House>但他们也会告诫你不要在外遇时,使用一块毛巾擦你的胯部和脸
<27-11,House>but they'll also tell you not to use,the same bath towel to dry your crotch

589
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
<27-11,House>- 发现矛盾了没?,- 我一直使用一次性纸盖
<27-11,House>and your face during an outbreak.

591
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,800
<27-12,House>- 一直?,- 是的,那当然
<27-12,House>- Always?,- Yes,of course.

592
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,300
<27-13,House>- 你呢?,- 我不会
<27-13,House>- What about you?,- No.

593
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,700
<27-13,House>我从来都不知道
<27-13,House>I never knew.

594
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,400
<27-14,House>哦,我的天,这太匪夷所思了
<27-14,House>Oh,please.This is ridiculous.

595
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,800
<27-14,House>他妈的,我确定这是个骗局
<27-14,House>Damn.I was sure it was miyagi.

596
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,100
<27-14,House>什么?
<27-14,House>What?

597
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
<27-15,House>他是相信会从坐便器传染
<27-15,House>He could believe that,you can herpes from a toilet seat,

598
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,000
<27-15,House>还是他有外遇而正好有一个很好的借口
<27-15,House>or he could be cheating on you,and just be happy to have an out.

599
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,200
<27-15,House>坐便器是一种可能性,不是么?
<27-15,House>The toilet seat makes sense,doesn't it?

600
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,900
<27-16,House>当然是,但是如果她是清白的,她一定不会相信这么完美的谎言
<27-16,House>Sure,but she'd,only refused to believe

602
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,700
<27-16,House>既然你们两个都不是清白的
<27-16,House>And since you both,can't be innocent...

603
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,500
<27-16,House>你这个混蛋
<27-16,House>you rutty jackass.

<27-18,Cuddy>Not bad.

608
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,300
<28-1,House>她是不是患有遗传性关节炎?
<28-1,House>She has a family,history of arthritis,doesn't she?

609
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000

<28-3,House>Do another heavy metal screen.Only this time,test for gold.

612
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
<28-4,Cameron>你不会还是认为她...
<28-4,Cameron>You don't still think that she-

613
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,800
<28-5,House>不要让她进卫生间
<28-5,House>and don't let her go to the bathroom.

614
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,300
<28-6,Cameron>为什么你会在意她...
<28-6,Cameron>Why would you care if she-

615
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,800
<28-6,Cameron>喂?

618
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,900
<29-4,Lady>只是打扫了一下
<29-4,Lady>I cleaned it.

619
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,800
<29-4,Lady>Wilson医生说可以打扫
<29-4,Lady>Uh,dr. Wilson said,that I could go ahead-

620
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,600
<29-5,House>这不是 Wilson医生的衣橱
<29-5,House>it's not dr. Wilson's closet!

621
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
<29-5,House>木头盒子在哪?

00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,700
<29-7,House>从我搬进来的那天就一直,放在衣橱的最里面
<29-7,House>It's been in the back of,this closet since the day I moved in.

<29-9,House>- I didn't see any kind of wood-,- you may not have seen it,

<29-9,House>但是你已经动过了,问题是在哪?
<29-9,House>but you've obviously med it.The question is where?

627
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,000

<29-10,Lady>Well,I did not move anything,,I just-

<29-11,House>look,it was in this closet.Then you came now it's not in this closet.

<29-13,House>棕色的木头箱子,顶上有个金属把手
<29-13,House>It's a brown wood box.It's got a metal handle on the top.

631
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,000
<29-13,House>看起来就像...就像是一个工具箱
<29-13,House>It looks like a-,like a tackle or a toolbox.

632
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,200
<29-14,Lady>哦,你是说箱子吧?
<29-14,Lady>Ah,you mean the chest?

<29-14,Lady>在床底下的那个?
<29-14,Lady>The one that's under the bed?

<32-4,Cameron>- I told you not to let her.- What was I supposed to do? Tie her up?

<32-5,House>为什么不?她喜欢这一套
<32-5,House>Why not?She likes that.

644
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,600
<32-5,House>你在做什么?
<32-5,House>What are you doing?

645
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,100
<33-1,Maria>你的手是湿的
<33-1,Maria>Uh,your hand is wet.

<33-2,House>对不起,太紧张了

<33-3,Maria>什么坏消息?

<33-4,House>你丈夫肺部的损伤是永久性的
<33-4,House>The damage to your,husband's lungs is permanent.

<33-4,House>肾脏损伤可以恢复,如果治疗得当
<33-4,House>The kidney damage is reversible,,and with the right therapy,

00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,700
<33-4,House>所有的神经系统功能也能恢复
<33-4,House>he should regain full neurological function.

652
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,000
<33-4,House>如果不参加什么马拉松比赛就不会有事
<33-4,House>Us other than the fact that he's not gonna,be running any marathons,he should be fine.

653
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,700
<33-5,Maria>但是这是好消息,不是么?
<33-5,Maria>But that's good news,isn't it?

654
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,300
<33-6,House>我还没说完
<33-6,House>I'm not finished.

655
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,400
<33-6,House>小时候
<33-6,House>When I was a kid,

656
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,900
<33-6,House>我父亲在埃及的一个陆军基地里服役
<33-6,House>my dad was stationed,in a marine base in egypt.

657
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,300
<33-6,House>周围一片荒芜
<33-6,House>We were in the middle of no where,

658
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
<33-6,House>小孩没什么事情可做除了..
<33-6,House>and there was absolutely nothing,for a kid to do except...

659
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,500
<33-6,House>- 寻找木乃伊的坟墓,- 你不想让我上卫生间
<33-6,House>- look for a mummy's tomb.- You didn't want me to go to the bathroom

660
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,000
<33-7,Maria>只是因为你想说我的丈夫会康复
<33-7,Maria>because you wanted to tell me,my husband is going to be fine

661
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,000
<33-7,Maria>而你曾经住在埃及?
<33-7,Maria>and that... you used to live in egypt?

662
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
<33-7,Maria>不是不让你上厕所
<33-7,Maria>I didn't have a problem,with you going to the bathroom.

663
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,000
<33-8,House>只是不想让你洗手
<33-8,House>I just didn't want,you to wash your hands.

664
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,100
<33-8,House>事实上我从没找到过木乃伊
<33-8,House>I never actually found a mummy.

665
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,800
<33-8,House>但学到了许多古代埃及人的知识
<33-8,House>But,I did learn a fair amount,about the ancient egyptians.

666
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,500
<33-8,House>比如,他们发现氯化锡
<33-8,House>For example,they discovered,that stannous chloride

667
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,900
<33-8,House>不仅可以增加红玻璃的强度
<33-8,House>is not only great for toughening ruby glass,

668
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,200
<33-8,House>而且在混合了黄金之后会变成亮紫色
<33-8,House>but if it's mixed with gold,,it turns bright purple.

669
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,800
<33-8,House>要么你的手指是用黄金做的
<33-8,House>Now either,your fingers,actually are worth their weight in gold,

670
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,100
<33-8,House>要么你一直丈夫的麦片里,撒上硫化钠和黄金
<33-8,House>or you've been sprinkling your husband's,cereal with gold sodium thiomalate.

671
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,500
<33-8,House>这是一种关节炎疗法,不过美国已经绝迹了
<33-8,House>It's an arthritis remedy that,it's rarely used here in the in the U.S.

672
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,300
<33-8,House>但是在墨西哥还是很流行的
<33-8,House>But it's still popular in mexico.

673
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,700
<33-8,House>应该表扬一下
<33-8,House>Gotta give you props.

674
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
<33-8,House>我从没见人用黄金下毒
<33-8,House>I've never heard of,anyone using gold before.

675
