1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,510
<1-1,Joe>让我们继续菲尔和戴安的故事吧
<1-1,Joe>Let's get back to Phil and Diane.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,410
<1-1,Joe>菲尔找工作找得很辛苦
<1-1,Joe>Phil's been having a hard time finding work,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,880
<1-1,Joe>而戴安想和他聊聊
<1-1,Joe>and Diane wants him to talk to her

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,440
<1-1,Joe>排解一下他的恐惧和失望
<1-1,Joe>about his fear, his disappointment.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,240
<1-1,Joe>但是菲尔希望戴安相信他
<1-1,Joe>And Phil wants Diane to trust him

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,940
<1-1,Joe>相信他们能度过这个难关
<1-1,Joe>that they'll get through this,

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,910
<1-1,Joe>犯不着没完没了的互诉衷肠
<1-1,Joe>ideally, without having to keep discussing feelings.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,600
<1-1,Joe>我理解的大意没错吧
<1-1,Joe>Not your exact words, but am I wrong?

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,540
<1-2,Joe>大多数男人都这个样
<1-2,Joe>And most guys out there are the same way,

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,030
<1-2,Joe>而女人们呢  如果你感到沮丧
<1-2,Joe>but ladies, if you're feeling frustrated,

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,720
<1-2,Joe>记着  这不是我们男人的错
<1-2,Joe>remember, it's not our fault.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,670
<1-2,Joe>我们从小就被教育要坚强  而不是情绪化
<1-2,Joe>We were raised to be strong, not emotional,

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,750
<1-2,Joe>要拒绝软弱无能  而不是破罐破摔
<1-2,Joe>to deny vulnerability, not embrace it.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,760
<1-2,Joe>你知道那会怎么样吗
<1-2,Joe>And do you know what that makes us?

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,690
<1-2,Joe>我们就过时了
<1-2,Joe>Dinosaurs.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,890
<1-2,Joe>没人需要我们猎食
<1-2,Joe>Nobody needs us to hunt wild animals for food.

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,160
<1-2,Joe>也不需要我们砍树造屋
<1-2,Joe>Nobody needs us to cut down trees to build shelter.

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,060
<1-2,Joe>她们需要我们进化  赶上时代
<1-2,Joe>They need us to evolve, to catch up.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,440
<1-3,Joe>自上世纪60年代起  女性角色发生了根本改变
<1-3,Joe>Since the 1960s, women's roles have shifted radically.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,450
<1-3,Joe>随着她们...她们社会地位的改变
<1-3,Joe>And as--uh, as their-- in--as their roles have changed,

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,120
<1-3,Joe>那么女人们  她们...
<1-3,Joe>so have women, they've-- they've, uh,

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,120
<1-3,Joe>她们更加坚强了
<1-3,Joe>well, they've become tougher,

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,590
<1-3,Joe>对我们的要求更高了
<1-3,Joe>and more demanding of us.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,670
<1-3,Joe>她们是搭档
<1-3,Joe>They're partners.

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,110
<1-3,Joe>谁  能怪她们呢  谁能...
<1-3,Joe>And--and--who can blame them? Who--who can--

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,140
<1-3,Joe>谁能...
<1-3,Joe>who can, uh...

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,950
<1-3,Joe>希望我们...
<1-3,Joe>expecting us to...

28
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,160
<1-3,Joe>去做...
<1-3,Joe>to do this...

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,530
<1-4,Marlene>乔  乔
<1-4,Marlene>Joe! Joe!

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
<1-4,Marlene>乔
<1-4,Marlene>Joe!

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,700
<1-4,Marlene>乔
<1-4,Marlene>Joe.

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,250
<1-5,Aide>叫救护车
<1-5,Aide>We need an ambulance.

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,590
<1-5,Aide>总监：
<1-5,Aide>zlean

52
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,050
<2-1,Taub>你要吗
<2-1,Taub>You want?

53
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,860
<2-2,Adams>不用了
<2-2,Adams>I'm good.

54
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,490
<2-2,Adams>你已经基本痊愈了
<2-2,Adams>Your limp's almost gone.

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,560
<2-3,House>抱歉打断同事间的打情骂俏
<2-3,House>It pains me to interrupt the collegial banter.

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,860
<2-3,House>可要让我继续听下去就更抱歉了
<2-3,House>It pains me even more to listen to it continue.

57
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,190
<2-3,House>38岁  男性
<2-3,House>38-year-old man.

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,460
<2-3,House>在演讲时突然发烧  之后晕厥
<2-3,House>Spikes a fever and collapses during a speaking engagement.

59
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,100
<2-3,House>急诊室检查了血容量
<2-3,House>E.R. checks out blood volume,

60
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,130
<2-3,House>心功能  神经反射  都未见异常
<2-3,House>cardiac function, and autonomic reflexes, all normal.

61
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,880
<2-4,Chase>病人依靠告诉男人更娘炮一点来养家糊口
<2-4,Chase>Patient makes a living telling men to behave more like women.

62
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,700
<2-4,Chase>你竟然没有作出精神症状的鉴别诊断
<2-4,Chase>I'm surprised you didn't throw psych symptoms

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,690
<2-4,Chase>真新鲜
<2-4,Chase>into the differential.

64
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,290
<2-4,Chase>不管怎样  可能是脑动静脉畸形
<2-4,Chase>Either way, could be a cerebral AVM.

65
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,610
<2-5,Park>急诊室已进行过头颅CT
<2-5,Park>E.R. did a head CT.

66
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,160
<2-5,Park>未见脑动静脉畸形征象
<2-5,Park>No sign of AVM.

67
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,060
<2-5,Park>但是个不错的想法
<2-5,Park>Decent thought, though.

68
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,800
<2-5,Park>那病人的哲理有点道理
<2-5,Park>The patient's philosophy makes perfect sense.

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,390
<2-6,House>唯一的漏洞就是  那是不可能的
<2-6,House>Its only flaw is that it's impossible.

70
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,820
<2-6,House>物种可不会那样进化
<2-6,House>Evolution does not work that way.

71
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,940
<2-6,House>你不能就鱼谈论腿
<2-6,House>You can't talk legs onto a fish.

72
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,280
<2-6,House>我们终究会灭绝
<2-6,House>We're gonna go extinct,

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,210
<2-6,House>但我们是边喝威士忌边开超级跑车地灭绝
<2-6,House>and we're gonna do it drinking scotch and driving muscle cars.

74
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,640
<2-6,House>我说的对吧
<2-6,House>Am I right?

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,080
<2-6,House>我...  谢谢
<2-6,House>Am I-- Thank you.

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,090
<2-7,Chase>头部肌纤维发育不良呢
<2-7,Chase>Cephalic fibromuscular dysplasia?

77
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,570
<2-8,Park>解释不了发烧
<2-8,Park>It doesn't explain the fever.

78
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,240
<2-8,Park>病人是在谈论妥协
<2-8,Park>The patient's talking about compromise.

79
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,840
<2-8,Park>如果你认为那是不可能的
<2-8,Park>If you don't think that's possible,

80
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,010
<2-8,Park>那你就是认为恋爱关系是不可能的
<2-8,Park>you don't think relationships are possible.

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,180
<2-9,House>这屋里的  有人不同意这个观点吗
<2-9,House>Anyone in this room in a position to disprove that?

82
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,290
<2-10,Park>这家伙就是在忽悠他的听众
<2-10,Park>This guy's just playing to his audience.

83
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,090
<2-10,Park>目前为止  女性是"自立"产业
<2-10,Park>Women are, by far, the biggest consumers

84
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,330
<2-10,Park>最庞大的顾客群体
<2-10,Park>of the "self-help" industry.

85
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,600
<2-11,Taub>他可能有肺栓塞
<2-11,Taub>He could have a pulmonary embolism.

86
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,650
<2-11,Taub>肺内血栓增加了右心室后负荷
<2-11,Taub>Clot in his lung increases right ventricular afterload,

87
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,030
<2-11,Taub>导致脑血流减少
<2-11,Taub>drops the blood flow to his brain.

88
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,460
<2-11,Taub>应该做个肺动脉造影
<2-11,Taub>We should do a pulmonary angiogram.

89
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,260
<2-12,Adams>患者无肺栓塞常见的危险因素
<2-12,Adams>Patient lacks major risk factors for a P.E.

90
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,930
<2-12,Adams>当然还不能排除  但不是很像
<2-12,Adams>Doesn't rule it out, just makes it unlikely.

91
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,360
<2-12,Adams>先查个D-二聚体吧
<2-12,Adams>Maybe we start with a D-dimer?

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,330
<2-13,Taub>先不作造影这个侵入性检查
<2-13,Taub>Less invasive than the angiogram.

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,830
<2-13,Taub>好主意
<2-13,Taub>Good idea.

95
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,700
<2-13,Taub>好吧
<2-13,Taub>Fine.

96
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,630
<2-14,House>其实  我是来上大号的
<2-14,House>Now, I am hereby searching for a number two.

97
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,920
<2-14,House>我吃了不少粗粮
<2-14,House>So I'm eating a lot of bran.

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,170
<2-14,House>还有  我要一个领队的
<2-14,House>Also, I want a team leader.

<2-14,House>Someone to fill Foreman's old job.

100
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,860
<2-15,Chase>为什么
<2-15,Chase>Why?

101
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,280
<2-16,House>你说得对  我们不需要更多的人事结构了
<2-16,House>You're right. We don't need any more structure.

102
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,670
<2-16,House>又不是说在这里有人差点被扎死
<2-16,House>It's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.

103
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,320
<2-17,House>这不是那位乌克兰娇妻嘛
<2-17,House>Well, if it isn't the old ball and Ukraine.

<3-3,House>where they also have gangs and pruno,

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,020
<3-3,House>不过少那么一点累犯
<3-3,House>but slightly less recidivism.

<3-4,Dominika>我在做乌克兰食品的运输生意

<3-5,House>不少移民局寄来的认证信件
<3-5,House>a bunch of certified letters from Immigration.

116
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,570
<3-5,House>两者应该有关系
<3-5,House>I'm assuming there's a connection.

130

<3-9,House>但有什么好争的

141
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,530
<4-5,Joe>什么男人会认为男人应该更像女人一点呢
<4-5,Joe>What guy thinks men should be more like women?

142
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,530
<4-5,Joe>在密尔沃基的一间体育酒吧外
<4-5,Joe>A macho jerk who got a big wake-up call

143
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,200
<4-5,Joe>三个痛揍了我一顿的醉汉
<4-5,Joe>courtesy of three drunks who beat the crap outta me

144
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,740
<4-5,Joe>让我这个大男子主义的混蛋如梦初醒
<4-5,Joe>outside a sports bar in Milwaukee.

145
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,570
<4-6,Taub>我想这倒是解释了你病史上
<4-6,Taub>I'm guessing that explains the broken wrist

146
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,580
<4-6,Taub>手腕骨折这一条
<4-6,Taub>in your medical history?

147
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,280
<4-7,Joe>这三个白痴帮了我这辈子最大的一个忙
<4-7,Joe>Those morons did me the biggest favor of my life.

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,320
<4-7,Joe>我意识到
<4-7,Joe>I realized I'd sacrificed my health

149
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,890
<4-7,Joe>就为争论橄榄球问题  我不作退让
<4-7,Joe>because I couldn't back down

150
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,570
<4-7,Joe>根本就是在牺牲性命
<4-7,Joe>from an argument over football.

151
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,210
<4-7,Joe>遇见玛琳是我解开迷惑的最后一块拼图
<4-7,Joe>Meeting Marlene was the final piece in the puzzle.

152
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,560
<4-7,Joe>她改变了我的事业  我的饮食习惯
<4-7,Joe>She changed my career, my diet.

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,900
<4-7,Joe>她给了我人生的新方向
<4-7,Joe>She gave me a whole new direction in life.

154
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,390
<4-8,Taub>我们需要知道你具体是怎么改变饮食习惯的
<4-8,Taub>We'll need to know exactly how you changed your diet,

155
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,770
<4-8,Taub>还有改变的时间
<4-8,Taub>and when.

156
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,620
<5-1,House>把我公寓钥匙还我
<5-1,House>Need my apartment key back.

157
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,470
<5-2,Wilson>如果你要跟我分手
<5-2,Wilson>If you're breaking up with me,

158
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,390
<5-2,Wilson>至少先跟我谈谈吧
<5-2,Wilson>can we at least talk about it first?

159
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,070
<5-3,House>谁叫你只碎碎念却不跟我滚床单
<5-3,House>Maybe if you weren't all nag and no shag.

160
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,220
<5-4,Wilson>我不和已婚男子上床
<5-4,Wilson>I don't sleep with married men.

161
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,000
<5-5,House>回头我再配把钥匙
<5-5,House>I'll get a copy made.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,830
<5-6,Wilson>你才出狱
<5-6,Wilson>You're an ex-con.

163
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,840
<5-6,Wilson>如果你被发现向国家安全部作伪证
<5-6,Wilson>If you get caught perjuring yourself to homeland security,

164
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,500
<5-6,Wilson>就会被扔回监狱
<5-6,Wilson>you'll end up back in jail.

165
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,620
<5-7,House>所以只要有丝毫
<5-7,House>And that would be troubling

166
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,900
<5-7,House>我们被发现的可能  就很麻烦
<5-7,House>if there was the slightest chance that we'd get caught.

167
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,990
<5-8,Wilson>你们几乎互不相识
<5-8,Wilson>You barely know each other.

168
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,050
<5-8,Wilson>而你只有大约五分钟时间
<5-8,Wilson>You've got about five minutes

169
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,650
<5-8,Wilson>重塑自我变身已婚人士还要令人信服
<5-8,Wilson>to remake yourselves into a convincing married couple.

170
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,790
<5-8,Wilson>还有  这是为什么呢
<5-8,Wilson>And why?

171
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,790
<5-8,Wilson>多米尼卡能弄到张绿卡  你有什么好处
<5-8,Wilson>Dominika gets a green card. What's in this for you?

172
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,790
<5-9,House>这就是假装爱上某个女人的男人会做的事
<5-9,House>This is what men do for the women they pretend to love.

173
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,630
<5-9,House>还有  如果通过了  她会给我三万块
<5-9,House>Also, she's paying me 30,000 bucks once we pass.

174
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,520
<5-9,House>显然克尼什薄面卷很好卖啊
<5-9,House>Apparently knishes sell like hotcakes.

175
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,530
<5-10,Taub>检验结果
<5-10,Taub>Lab results.

176
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,000
<5-11,House>我得等会才能再听你唠叨了
<5-11,House>Afraid you're gonna have to finish your nag later.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,350
<5-12,Wilson>我说过我觉得这很傻吧
<5-12,Wilson>I said I think it's stupid, right?

178
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,680
<5-12,Wilson>那没其它好说的了
<5-12,Wilson>Then I think I'm done.

179
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,820
<5-13,Taub>D-二聚体正常  肺栓塞可排除
<5-13,Taub>D-dimer came back normal. Rules out pulmonary embolism.

180
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,120
<5-14,Adams>我们的病人是真心相信
<5-14,Adams>And our patient's a true believer

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,590
<5-14,Adams>大男子主义的愚蠢
<5-14,Adams>about the follies of masculinity.

182
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,430
<5-14,Adams>他在三年前经历了一次精神洗礼
<5-14,Adams>He underwent a spiritual overhaul three years ago.

183
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,230
<5-14,Adams>之后便不再吃麸质和红肉
<5-14,Adams>He also went off gluten and red meat.

184
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,730
<5-14,Adams>可惜  这些都解释不了他的症状
<5-14,Adams>Unfortunately, that doesn't explain any of his symptoms.

185
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,930
<5-15,House>他的举动还真是"一点"不荒唐啊
<5-15,House>One of those points is not absurd.

186
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,300
<5-16,Adams>改变自己的想法有什么荒唐的
<5-16,Adams>What's absurd about a change of heart?

187
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,620
<5-16,Adams>他的新理念让他变成一个更好的人
<5-16,Adams>What this guy believes is making him a better person.

188
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,600
<5-16,Adams>他在克制自己最基本的本能
<5-16,Adams>He's going against his baser instincts.

189
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,260
<5-17,House>"基本"意味着最基础的
<5-17,House>"Base" meaning foundational,

190
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,200
<5-17,House>是人天生就该做的事情
<5-17,House>meaning things we are biologically programmed to do.

191
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,030
<5-17,House>不做该做的事还真是自然而然啊
<5-17,House>Yes, perfectly natural that he stopped doing that stuff.

192
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,090
<5-17,House>就是这种心态
<5-17,House>You know, that's the kind of lapse

193
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,790
<5-17,House>会阻碍你成为队伍领袖的
<5-17,House>that could take you out of the running for team leader.

194
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,100
<5-18,Adams>好奇怪啊  我一点都不在乎
<5-18,Adams>I feel surprisingly okay with that.

195
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,530
<5-19,House>周薪会涨50块噢
<5-19,House>Comes with a 50-buck-a-week raise.

196
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,140
<5-20,Park>我参选
<5-20,Park>I'm in.

197
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,440
<5-21,Chase>你会后悔的
<5-21,Chase>You don't want to do that.

198
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,350
<5-21,Chase>你要有放弃自尊的准备
<5-21,Chase>Might need your dignity later in life.

199
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,150
<5-21,Chase>你就不必了
<5-21,Chase>You didn't.

200
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,770
<5-22,House>这样她可就要如愿以偿了
<5-22,House>And she could be on her way to living the dream

201
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,900
<5-22,House>除非你们都奋起...
<5-22,House>unless the rest of you nut up and give her--

202
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,660
<5-22,House>他的精神洗礼
<5-22,House>This spiritual overhaul...

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,580
<5-22,House>是不是出现在一次身体病变后
<5-22,House>Did it come after a physical overhaul?

204
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,830
<5-22,House>某种大创伤
<5-22,House>A major injury of some kind?

205
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
<5-23,Taub>酒吧斗殴
<5-23,Taub>Bar fight.

206
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,400
<5-23,Taub>-但骨折的手腕也解释不了  -亚当斯  跟我来
<5-23,Taub>- But there's no way a broken wrist explains-- -Adams, come with me.

207
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,140
<5-24,House>你俩都来
<5-24,House>You too.

208
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,310
<5-24,House>至于你们
<5-24,House>You guys...

209
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,060
<5-24,House>再去复刻一把
<5-24,House>Get a copy of that made.

210
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,230
<6-1,House>那些家伙是不是把你的小弟当球踢啊
<6-1,House>Did those dudes bend your ball sack like Beckham?

211
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,700
<6-1,House>三年前  酒吧斗殴
<6-1,House>Three years ago. The bar fight.

212
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,590
<6-2,Adams>这是豪斯医生  他有个理论
<6-2,Adams>This is Dr. House. He has a theory.

213
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,360
<6-3,House>亚当斯医生  帮我捡一下
<6-3,House>Oh, Dr. Adams, would you mind?

214
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,980
<6-3,House>我问了个问题  你应该能回答吧
<6-3,House>I asked you a question. I assume you know the answer.

215
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,420
<6-4,Joe>是的  我的腹股沟被膝盖顶了好几下
<6-4,Joe>Yeah, I took a couple serious knees to the groin.

216
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,750
<6-5,House>我这是怎么了
<6-5,House>What has gotten into me?

217
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,830
<6-5,House>奇斯医生
<6-5,House>Dr. Chase.

218
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,150
<6-5,House>捡起来就是了
<6-5,House>Just pick it up.

219
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
<6-6,Joe>你知道我到底怎么了吗
<6-6,Joe>Do you know what's wrong with me?

220
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,010
<6-7,House>你的问题
<6-7,House>Nothing that "The Golden Girls"

222
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,040
<6-7,House>交给"黄金女孩"  肯定立马解决
<6-7,House>couldn't have handled in 23 hilarious minutes.

223
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,390
<6-7,House>更年期综合症
<6-7,House>You had a hot flash.

224
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,100
<6-7,House>那帮人踢你的小弟
<6-7,House>Those guys kicked your guys

225
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,880
<6-7,House>踢得太重  造成了持久性损害
<6-7,House>hard enough to do lasting damage.

226
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,480
<6-7,House>你面前明明有两个
<6-7,House>You didn't even look when presented

227
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,370
<6-7,House>相当性感的臀部  你却视而不见
<6-7,House>with two reasonably attractive tuchi.

228
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,310
<6-7,House>我说了  怎么着吧
<6-7,House>Yeah, I said it!

229
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,850
<6-8,Joe>我是在听你说话
<6-8,Joe>I was listening to my doctor.

230
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,050
<6-9,House>人们通常用耳朵来听
<6-9,House>People generally listen with their ears,

231
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,650
<6-9,House>留着眼睛到处瞎看
<6-9,House>leaving their eyes free to wander.

232
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,600
<6-9,House>我猜你的睾酮水平
<6-9,House>I'm guessing that your testosterone level

233
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,300
<6-9,House>比比伯还低
<6-9,House>is just below "Bieber."

234
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,610
<6-9,House>作抽血化验以确认
<6-9,House>Do a blood test to confirm,

235
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,400
<6-9,House>再开始激素替代治疗
<6-9,House>and start hormone replacement.

236
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,660
<6-9,House>难怪你认为女性是如此的伟大
<6-9,House>It's no wonder that you think women are so great.

237
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,390
<6-9,House>你过去三年基本上就是个女人
<6-9,House>You've basically been one for the last three years.

238
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,310
<7-1,Taub>化验结果证明豪斯是对的
<7-1,Taub>Tests confirm House is right.

239
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,290
<7-1,Taub>低睾酮能解释你的所有症状
<7-1,Taub>Low testosterone explains all your symptoms.

240
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,570
<7-1,Taub>在替代治疗后  应该都会好转
<7-1,Taub>They should go away with replacement therapy.

241
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,430
<7-1,Taub>我们会先用大剂量
<7-1,Taub>We're gonna give you a fairly high dose.

242
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,560
<7-1,Taub>在你生理功能恢复后  再逐渐减量
<7-1,Taub>Over time, your personal physician may reduce it a little.

243
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,820
<7-1,Taub>麻烦你转个身
<7-1,Taub>Just need you to turn around.

244
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,710
<7-2,Marlene>这会增加他的性欲吗
<7-2,Marlene>Will the shots increase his libido?

245
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,870
<7-3,Joe>你担心这个问题吗
<7-3,Joe>Are you worried about that?

246
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,420
<7-4,Marlene>不是
<7-4,Marlene>No.

247
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,410
<7-5,Joe>-是不是我没能满足你  -不是的  只是...
<7-5,Joe>- Have you been unsatisfied? - No. No, it's just...

248
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,070
<7-6,Marlene>一直都是我主动
<7-6,Marlene>Well, it's usually me that initiates things.

249
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,920
<7-6,Marlene>有时...
<7-6,Marlene>Sometimes I...

250
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,520
<7-6,Marlene>我以为你并不是很爱我
<7-6,Marlene>I think maybe you aren't that attracted to me.

251
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,120
<7-7,Joe>说什么胡话啊
<7-7,Joe>Are you crazy?

252
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,390
<7-8,Taub>注射后  你会发现性欲增强
<7-8,Taub>With these injections, you will see an increase in sex drive.

253
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,020
<7-9,Joe>好的  很好
<7-9,Joe>Okay, great.

254
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,910
<7-12,Taub>-打完了  -好的
<7-12,Taub>- All done. - Okay.

255
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,070
<7-13,Joe>事情不太对劲
<7-13,Joe>Oh, something's wrong.

256
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,000
<7-13,Joe>我好像尿裤子了
<7-13,Joe>I think I peed myself.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,530
<7-14,Marlene>这是睾酮引起的吗
<7-14,Marlene>Is that from the testosterone?

258
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,600
<7-15,Taub>不可能
<7-15,Taub>It couldn't be.

259
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,940
<7-15,Taub>我想你还不能出院回家
<7-15,Taub>I don't think you're going home just yet.

260
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,990
<8-1,Chase>膀胱并没有问题
<8-1,Chase>It's not a plumbing problem.

261
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,960
<8-1,Chase>也就是说是神经性的
<8-1,Chase>Means it's probably neurological.

262
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,710
<8-2,House>然后呢
<8-2,House>And?

263
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,030
<8-3,Chase>说出多米尼卡三个兄弟的名字
<8-3,Chase>And name Dominika's three brothers.

264
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,400
<8-4,House>弗拉基米尔  季莫申科  还有...
<8-4,House>Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and...

265
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,490
<8-5,Adams>低睾酮并不是症状之一
<8-5,Adams>Low testosterone is off the table as a symptom.

266
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,560
<8-5,Adams>他三年前被踢了小弟弟
<8-5,Adams>Guy got his nuts cracked three years ago.

267
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,940
<8-5,Adams>不需要再往前追溯了
<8-5,Adams>Don't need to look much further than that.

268
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,450
<8-6,House>难道他只是碰巧
<8-6,House>So his hose just happens to spring a leak

269
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,760
<8-6,House>在住院时  因毫不相关的病
<8-6,House>at the same time he's in a hospital

270
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,890
<8-6,House>而随地小便吗
<8-6,House>for a totally unrelated problem.

271
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,430
<8-6,House>费奥多尔
<8-6,House>Fjodor.

272
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,660
<8-7,Chase>是费帝尔
<8-7,Chase>It's Fedir.

273
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,000
<8-8,Taub>如果低睾酮
<8-8,Taub>If low testosterone means

274
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,630
<8-8,Taub>能让我免受其它疾病
<8-8,Taub>I can't get sick with something else,

275
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,470
<8-8,Taub>谁赶紧踢我一脚
<8-8,Taub>then punch me in the junk right now.

276
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,000
<8-9,House>要不是我嫌麻烦  我肯定踢
<8-9,House>I would, if it weren't redundant.

277
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,730
<8-9,House>费帝尔是跟米科拉结婚的那个吗
<8-9,House>Is Fedir the one who married Mykola?

278
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,370
<8-10,Chase>米科拉是多米尼卡的叔叔
<8-10,Chase>Mykola is Dominika's uncle.

279
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,230
<8-11,Adams>为何你能记住我们的
<8-11,Adams>How is it you can retain every detail

280
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,470
<8-11,Adams>每个习惯和生活细节
<8-11,Adams>of our habits and personal lives,

281
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,280
<8-11,Adams>却记不住这些
<8-11,Adams>and none of this?

282
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,620
<8-12,House>因为我发现  没意思的事情
<8-12,House>'Cause I find it hard to remember things

283
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,270
<8-12,House>我完全记不住
<8-12,House>I don't give a crap about.

284
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,190
<8-12,House>我只知道  多米尼卡有个兄弟  叫某某
<8-12,House>Here go, Dominika has one brother, and his name is al.

285
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,940
<8-13,Park>也许睾丸损伤使他易发其它疾病
<8-13,Park>Maybe the testicular damage set the stage for something worse.

286
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,910
<8-13,Park>多发性硬化可导致尿失禁
<8-13,Park>Multiple sclerosis causes incontinence,

287
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,950
<8-13,Park>而低睾酮水平的男性  病情加重得更快
<8-13,Park>and progresses faster in men with low T.

288
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,580
<8-14,House>一针见血
<8-14,House>Way to stay on point.

289
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,860
<8-14,House>这种领导能力
<8-14,House>It's that kind of leadership

290
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,500
<8-14,House>能让你从众人中脱颖而出
<8-14,House>that's putting you at the head of the pack.

291
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,610
<8-15,Chase>哪来的众人  只有她一个人申请
<8-15,Chase>There is no pack. She's the only applicant.

292
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,540
<8-16,House>那就这么定了
<8-16,House>Well, that's settled, then.

293
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,380
<8-16,House>让你的下属去做腰穿
<8-16,House>Have your underlings do an LP

294
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,100
<8-16,House>以及头颅和脊髓的MRI
<8-16,House>and get a cranio-spinal MRI

295
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,340
<8-16,House>排查有无多发性硬化相关的迹象
<8-16,House>to check for plaques associated with M.S.

296
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,230
<8-16,House>我去通知福曼  你晋升了
<8-16,House>I will go tell Foreman about your promotion.

297
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,680
<8-17,Chase and Adams>等下
<8-17,Chase and Adams>Wait.

298
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,010
<9-1,Park>本来除了我  没人在乎这个头衔
<9-1,Park>So nobody cares about the job till I apply,

299
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,350
<9-1,Park>结果突然又变成了限量版的抢手货
<9-1,Park>and suddenly it's the last limited-edition lightsaber at comic-con.

300
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,420
<9-2,Chase>只是觉得  这个职位应该给...
<9-2,Chase>Just seems like it should go to someone with more...

301
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,620
<9-2,Chase>更资深的人
<9-2,Chase>Seniority.

302
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,750
<9-3,Adams>也就是你
<9-3,Adams>Meaning you.

303
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,120
<9-4,Chase>我是说"更"  不是"最"
<9-4,Chase>I said "More," not "Most."

304
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,020
<9-5,Adams>就是说你或陶博
<9-5,Adams>Meaning you or Taub.

305
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,260
<9-6,Taub>豪斯是个独裁者
<9-6,Taub>House is a dictator.

306
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,530
<9-6,Taub>二把手只是个虚职
<9-6,Taub>Second in command is a meaningless position.

307
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,160
<9-7,Park>放在简历上总归是好看的
<9-7,Park>Doesn't look meaningless on my resume.

308
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,460
<9-8,Adams>不一定就会是虚职啊
<9-8,Adams>Doesn't have to be meaningless at all.

309
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,200
<9-8,Adams>在合适的人手里  会变得有意义
<9-8,Adams>The right person could turn it into something.

310
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,900
<9-8,Adams>让部门运行得更顺畅
<9-8,Adams>Get the department running smoothly.

311
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,040
<9-9,Chase>我真好奇这"合适的人"是谁
<9-9,Chase>I wonder who that "Right person" could be.

312
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,640
<9-10,Adams>豪斯是部门主管
<9-10,Adams>House is the head of the department.

313
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,140
<9-10,Adams>只有让女性
<9-10,Adams>It's only fair that a woman

314
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,610
<9-10,Adams>当另一名主管  才公平
<9-10,Adams>should hold the other position of authority.

315
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,410
<9-11,Park>好啊  那就让平等来得更彻底一些吧
<9-11,Park>Yeah, let's go affirmative action on this,

317
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,110
<9-11,Park>那我就赢定了
<9-11,Park>because then I'll definitely win.

318
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,940
<9-12,Taub>这正是豪斯的目的
<9-12,Taub>This is what House wants.

319
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,770
<9-12,Taub>哄骗我们  看我们为空头衔抢得头破血流
<9-12,Taub>Wind us up and watch us fight over an empty title,

320
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,800
<9-12,Taub>考虑到前段时间发生的事情
<9-12,Taub>which would make us extra stupid

321
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,660
<9-12,Taub>这只会让我们显得更蠢
<9-12,Taub>because of what we've just been through.

322
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,590
<9-12,Taub>我们应该让他来选  然后忘了这事
<9-12,Taub>We should let him choose whoever he wants and move on.

323
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,740
<10-1,Joe>如果我的脑脊液里有蛋白质
<10-1,Joe>So if these proteins are in my spinal fluid,

324
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,730
<10-1,Joe>是不是就得了多发性硬化
<10-1,Joe>that means I have M.S.?

325
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,230
<10-2,Taub>蛋白质说明有多发性硬化的可能
<10-2,Taub>Proteins may indicate M.S.

326
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,760
<10-2,Taub>这种病没有检查可以确诊
<10-2,Taub>There's no one definitive test.

327
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,370
<10-2,Taub>所以豪斯医生还让你做MRI
<10-2,Taub>That's why Dr. House ordered an MRI as well.

328
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,080
<10-3,Adams>这是麻醉剂
<10-3,Adams>This is anesthetic.

329
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,940
<10-3,Adams>这个诊断确实挺吓人
<10-3,Adams>It's a scary diagnosis.

330
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,680
<10-3,Adams>但医学在进步
<10-3,Adams>But advances are being made.

331
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,950
<10-3,Adams>今年就又有几种药问世
<10-3,Adams>Several drugs approved just this year.

332
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,810
<10-4,Joe>实话实说  现在
<10-4,Joe>To be honest, at the moment,

333
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,240
<10-4,Joe>我更担心
<10-4,Joe>I'm feeling a little more worried

334
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,790
<10-4,Joe>注射的睾酮素
<10-4,Joe>about the testosterone injections.

335
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,810
<10-4,Joe>让我觉得有点...怪怪的
<10-4,Joe>It's making me feel, uh, different.

336
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,480
<10-4,Joe>有点兴奋
<10-4,Joe>Just kind of amped.

337
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,800
<10-4,Joe>我经历了人生的巨大转折
<10-4,Joe>I went through this big life change,

338
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,080
<10-4,Joe>而且觉得这个转折十分...
<10-4,Joe>and it felt really...

339
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,080
<10-4,Joe>有意义
<10-4,Joe>Meaningful.

340
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,320
<10-4,Joe>但如果它们都只是因为激素有问题呢
<10-4,Joe>But what if it was all just chemistry?

341
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,990
<10-5,Adams>缺少睾酮素可能是因素之一
<10-5,Adams>Loss of testosterone could have been a factor,

342
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,060
<10-5,Adams>但不妨把它看作是催化剂
<10-5,Adams>but think of it as a catalyst.

343
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,730
<10-5,Adams>它让你有机会重新审视人生  看清什么最重要
<10-5,Adams>It got you to reevaluate. Now you know what's important.

344
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
<10-5,Adams>你可以选择继续这样的人生
<10-5,Adams>You can choose to hold onto that.

345
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,250
<10-5,Adams>对吧
<10-5,Adams>Right?

346
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,370
<10-6,Taub>绝对值得一试
<10-6,Taub>It's certainly worth trying.

347
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,410
<10-6,Taub>深呼吸  不要动
<10-6,Taub>Deep breath, stay very still.

348
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,140
<11-1,Chase>让豪斯别再整什么领队的事了吧
<11-1,Chase>Just tell House to drop the whole team leader thing.

349
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,780
<11-1,Chase>这是唯一能够解决这件事的方法
<11-1,Chase>That's the only way it'll go away.

350
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,890
<11-2,Foreman>我倒觉得这是个不错的想法
<11-2,Foreman>I don't think it's such a bad idea.

351
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,220
<11-2,Foreman>给你们部门增设结构不是坏事
<11-2,Foreman>A little more structure in your department couldn't hurt.

352
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,850
<11-2,Foreman>没错
<11-2,Foreman>Yeah.

353
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,910
<11-3,Chase>豪斯这么做就是因为他热爱组织结构
<11-3,Chase>House is doing this because of his great love of structure,

354
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,100
<11-3,Chase>而不是因为他想让我们互相反目
<11-3,Chase>not because he wants us to turn on each other.

355
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,450
<11-4,Foreman>那就别反目啊
<11-4,Foreman>So don't do that.

356
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,020
<11-4,Foreman>多个更有责任感的人管事
<11-4,Foreman>It makes sense to have someone in there

357
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,690
<11-4,Foreman>不是坏事
<11-4,Foreman>with a little more accountability.

358
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,890
<11-5,Chase>只要不是亚当斯就行
<11-5,Chase>As long as it's not Adams.

359
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,730
<11-5,Chase>她把这件事视作依照她自己的蓝图
<11-5,Chase>She sees the whole thing as an opportunity

360
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,430
<11-5,Chase>重置整个部门的机会
<11-5,Chase>to remake the department in her image.

361
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,530
<11-5,Chase>也不该是朴克  理由很明显
<11-5,Chase>Or park, for obvious reasons.

362
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,040
<11-5,Chase>陶博又有孩子  可忙了
<11-5,Chase>And Taub's got the kids. He's pretty busy.

363
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,600
<11-6,Foreman>你真想争取这份
<11-6,Foreman>Are you seriously angling for a job

364
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,580
<11-6,Foreman>我在任时你一直嘲笑的工作吗
<11-6,Foreman>that you mocked its fate the whole time I had it?

365
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,060
<11-7,Chase>我没想要这个职位
<11-7,Chase>I don't want the job.

366
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,580
<11-8,Foreman>你只是不想让给别人罢了
<11-8,Foreman>You just don't want anyone else to have it.

367
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,150
<11-8,Foreman>这下有意思了
<11-8,Foreman>This'll be great.

368
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,120
<12-1,House>你祖母挺性感啊
<12-1,House>Your grandmother's kind of sexy.

369
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,520
<12-2,Dominika>这是塔拉斯·舍甫琴科  伟大的乌克兰诗人
<12-2,Dominika>That is Taras Shevchenko, the greatest Ukrainian poet.

370
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,730
<12-3,House>就是他创作的
<12-3,House>Is he the guy behind

371
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,310
<12-3,House>"旧日有朋自克列缅丘格来"吗
<12-3,House>"There once was a man from kremenchuk"?

372
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,660
<12-4,Dominika>帮我搬这个咖啡桌
<12-4,Dominika>Help me move coffee table.

373
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,280
<12-5,House>那我们在哪儿喝咖啡啊
<12-5,House>Well, then where will we have coffee?

374
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,080
<12-5,House>我说的咖啡是指威士忌
<12-5,House>And by "Coffee" I mean scotch.

375
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,530
<12-6,Dominika>咖啡和酒对我来说不够真实
<12-6,Dominika>Coffee and booze are artificial high for me.

376

423
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,420
<14-3,Adams>肯定不是脑部肿瘤  否则扫描就能看到
<14-3,Adams>It's not a brain tumor or we would've seen it on the scans.

424
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,880
<14-3,Adams>眼睛检查也没发现异样
<14-3,Adams>Eye exam didn't offer anything conclusive.

434
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,890
<14-10,Park>或是明晃晃地事业线秀
<14-10,Park>Or a blatant flaunting of cleavage.

435
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,060
<14-10,Park>比如那个
<14-10,Park>Like those.

436
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,870
<14-11,Taub>说好的不让豪斯离间我们呢
<14-11,Taub>What happened to not letting House get to you?

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,290
<14-11,Taub>你们就跟旅鼠一样
<14-11,Taub>You're like lemmings,

438
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,170
<14-11,Taub>排着队的要接受羞辱的洗礼
<14-11,Taub>marching off the cliff of competitive humiliation.

<14-12,Adams>House has indicated that he considers me attractive.

441
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,460
<14-12,Adams>利用自身优势
<14-12,Adams>There's nothing wrong with me

442
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,110
<14-12,Adams>来提升自己  何错之有
<14-12,Adams>using my strengths to my advantage.

443
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,170
<14-13,Park>这么说来
<14-13,Park>With an argument like that,

444
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,380
<14-13,Park>你要不就跪下...
<14-13,Park>maybe you should just drop down to your knees and--

445
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,030
<14-13,Park>除非这不是你的优势
<14-13,Park>I mean, unless that's not your strength.

<14-15,Taub>Could've been triggered when his T got really low.

453
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,120
<14-16,Dominika>那个小个子
<14-16,Dominika>Ooh, a little one.

<14-17,House>漂亮
<14-17,House>Smooth.

456
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,460
<14-17,House>你让其他人相互竞争
<14-17,House>You let the rest of them compete,

457
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,470
<14-17,House>鹬蚌相争  渔翁得利啊
<14-17,House>tear each other to pieces, then you swoop in with a save.

<14-17,House>Start the patient on ivig and plasmapheresis.

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,780
<14-18,Taub>你能来做这个吗
<14-18,Taub>Can you handle that, please?

<14-19,House>-我要和你谈谈  -那抓紧时间
<14-19,House>- I need a minute. - Well, make it quick.

<14-19,House>我们要拍在孟菲斯的照片了
<14-19,House>We're doin' Memphis.

462
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,480
<15-1,Taub>你觉得你想要这样  但这其实是个糟糕的主意
<15-1,Taub>You think you want this, but it's a bad idea.

463
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
<15-2,House>我本来想做多莉山主题公园主题的
<15-2,House>I was gonna go Dollywood,

464
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,510
<15-2,House>但我想那假发不适合我
<15-2,House>but I'm not sure I could pull off that wig.

465
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,220
<15-3,Taub>本来每个人都相处融洽
<15-3,Taub>Everybody was playing nice,

466
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,990
<15-3,Taub>在你的世界里  融洽却无法解决病例
<15-3,Taub>and in your world, nice doesn't solve cases,

467
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,920
<15-3,Taub>但在那件事发生后
<15-3,Taub>but after what happened,

468
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,140
<15-3,Taub>有几分团结也是好事
<15-3,Taub>a little bonding is a good thing.

469
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,790
<15-3,Taub>我们仍就有想法  各执一词
<15-3,Taub>We still have ideas, we still argue.

470
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,130
<15-3,Taub>可能当我们相互欣赏时  能更好得协作
<15-3,Taub>Maybe it could work better if we appreciate each other.

471
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,530
<15-4,House>精彩的演说
<15-4,House>That was impressive.

472
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,820
<15-4,House>你说这番话时怎么嘴皮子都没动一下
<15-4,House>You said that whole thing without once moving your lips.

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,910
<15-4,House>你不能动的那里
<15-4,House>The ones you're not moving.

474
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,710
<15-5,Taub>我明白了
<15-5,Taub>Oh. I get it.

475
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,520
<15-5,Taub>我不参与你这愚蠢的游戏
<15-5,Taub>I won't play along with your stupid games,

476
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,240
<15-5,Taub>所以我就不是男人了
<15-5,Taub>so I'm no longer a man.

477
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,860
<15-5,Taub>聪明
<15-5,Taub>Clever.

478
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,040
<15-6,House>事实上  你不愿意参与我这愚蠢的游戏
<15-6,House>Actually, you won't play along with my stupid games

479
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,230
<15-6,House>是因为你已经不是男人了
<15-6,House>because you're no longer a man.

480
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,410
<15-6,House>尽管还很聪明
<15-6,House>Still clever, though.

481
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,560
<15-6,House>研究表明抚养孩子
<15-6,House>Studies have shown that raising kids

482
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,970
<15-6,House>会降低睾酮素水平
<15-6,House>lowers testosterone levels in men.

483
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,160
<15-6,House>你投入越多激素水平就越低
<15-6,House>The more involved you are, the lower it gets.

484
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,980
<15-7,Taub>没错  有了孩子让我变中性了
<15-7,Taub>Right. Having kids has neutered me.

485
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,290
<15-7,Taub>又或者正因如此我才成熟了
<15-7,Taub>Or maybe it's helped me finally grow up.

486
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,300
<16-1,Adams>感觉如何
<16-1,Adams>How are you feeling?

487
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,900
<16-2,Joe>只要我把眼睛闭起来就挺好
<16-2,Joe>As long as I keep my eyes closed, pretty good.

488
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,570
<16-2,Joe>应该说是相当不错
<16-2,Joe>Really good, actually.

489
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,480
<16-2,Joe>我充满活力  感觉自信  头脑清晰
<16-2,Joe>I got energy, I feel confident, clear.

490
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,250
<16-3,Adams>睾酮素确实会让你振作起来
<16-3,Adams>Testosterone does tend to perk you up.

491
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,220
<16-4,Marlene>亲爱的  我给你买了汉堡
<16-4,Marlene>Hey, hon. I brought you a burger.

492
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,100
<16-5,Joe>是吗
<16-5,Joe>Really?

493
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,740
<16-6,Marlene>你住院了  想吃什么吃什么
<16-6,Marlene>You're in the hospital. Eat whatever you want.

494
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,900
<16-7,Joe>你是世上最好的老婆
<16-7,Joe>You're the best wife ever.

495
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,320
<16-7,Joe>我这么说
<16-7,Joe>And I'm not just saying that

496
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,780
<16-7,Joe>不只因为你牛仔裤下的翘臀如此性感
<16-7,Joe>because of how great your ass looks in those jeans.

497
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,640
<16-7,Joe>不好意思  我只是...
<16-7,Joe>I'm sorry. That was--

498
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,270
<16-8,Marlene>没关系
<16-8,Marlene>No, it's okay.

499
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,350
<16-8,Marlene>女人们都喜欢知道自己有魅力
<16-8,Marlene>Girl likes to know she's appreciated.

500
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,050
<16-9,Joe>过来
<16-9,Joe>Come here.

501
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,830
<16-9,Joe>我认为我们应该和高层们
<16-9,Joe>So I think we should talk to leading lights

502
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,710
<16-9,Joe>聊聊讲座和DVD的事了
<16-9,Joe>about seminars and DVDs.

503
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,840
<16-10,Marlene>你确定吗
<16-10,Marlene>Are you sure?

504
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,540
<16-10,Marlene>你一直都挺犹豫的
<16-10,Marlene>You were worried about the commitment.

505
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,790
<16-11,Joe>没错  不过做生意没理由半途而废嘛
<16-11,Joe>Yeah, there's no point in being in business with them halfway.

506
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,930
<16-11,Joe>你觉得可以吗
<16-11,Joe>You okay with that?

507
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,390
<16-12,Marlene>我很高兴你终于下定决心了
<16-12,Marlene>It's good to finally have a decision.

508
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,350
<16-12,Marlene>好的
<16-12,Marlene>Okay.

509
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,690
<17-1,House>费帝尔是最让她操心的弟弟
<17-1,House>Fedir is the brother she worries about the most.

510
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,440
<17-1,House>自从路巴去世以后
<17-1,House>Ever since Luba passed.

511
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,800
<17-1,House>不好意思
<17-1,House>Sorry.

512
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,200
<17-1,House>不过这是我们能找到的
<17-1,House>But this is the closest we could find

513
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,440
<17-1,House>最像冰冷无情政府办公室的地方了
<17-1,House>to the cold, soulless offices of a government bureaucracy.

514
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,640
<17-2,Wilson>如果你不用你的办公室  我去用
<17-2,Wilson>If you're not using your office, I will.

515
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,840
<17-3,Park>多米尼卡和她的高中朋友还有联系吗
<17-3,Park>Does Dominika still communicate with her high school friends?

516
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,730
<17-4,House>维斯莉  还有
<17-4,House>Uh, Vasyl, yes.

517
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,550
<17-4,House>奥克萨娜就没有了 自从她亲了帕傅洛后就断了
<17-4,House>Oksana, no. Not since she kissed Pavlo.

518
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,080
<17-4,House>因为那贱人知道多米尼卡也喜欢他
<17-4,House>'cause that bitch knew that Dominika liked him.

519
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,170
<17-5,Wilson>不对
<17-5,Wilson>Wrong.

520
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,110
<17-6,Dominika>奥克萨娜是个荡妇  我跟她绝交了
<17-6,Dominika>Oh, Oksana is a slut. Dead to me.

521
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,040
<17-7,Wilson>正确的答案反而是错误的答案
<17-7,Wilson>The right answer is the wrong answer.

522
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,380
<17-7,Wilson>不会有丈夫对妻子朋友的
<17-7,Wilson>No husband would pay that much attention

523
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,480
<17-7,Wilson>八卦如此感兴趣的
<17-7,Wilson>to his wife's friend dramas.

524
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,340
<17-8,Park>你不是已经离过三次婚了吗
<17-8,Park>Haven't you been divorced three times?

525
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,570
<17-9,Wilson>在几次离婚中间  我的婚龄  照实算
<17-9,Wilson>In-between those divorces, I was married, non-fraudulently,

526
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,870
<17-9,Wilson>已经十二年了
<17-9,Wilson>for 12 years total,

527
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,300
<17-9,Wilson>比屋里所有人都要长12年
<17-9,Wilson>which is 12 years longer than anyone in this room.

528
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,920
<17-9,Wilson>让开
<17-9,Wilson>Move.

529
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,310
<18-1,Park>你也打算去争取组长的位置吗
<18-1,Park>So are you going for this team leader thing?

530
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,610
<18-2,Chase>也许
<18-2,Chase>Probably.

531
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,740
<18-3,Park>你应得的
<18-3,Park>You deserve it.

532
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,560
<18-3,Park>你比我经验多得多
<18-3,Park>You have way more experience than me.

533
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,380
<18-4,Chase>你要放弃吗
<18-4,Chase>You're giving up?

534
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,280
<18-5,Park>我想要那职位
<18-5,Park>I wish.

535
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,250
<18-5,Park>我还有医学院的贷款要还
<18-5,Park>I still have a lot of med school debt,

536
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,830
<18-5,Park>我父母的房屋抵押贷款也许要我帮忙
<18-5,Park>and my parents need help with their mortgage.

537
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,410
<18-5,Park>因此我急需用钱
<18-5,Park>So I could kinda use the money.

538
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,960
<18-6,Joe>过去一小时所有东西我都只能看到一个了
<18-6,Joe>As of an hour ago, I'm just seeing one of everything.

539
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,310
<18-6,Joe>看来你们猜对了...
<18-6,Joe>Looks like you guys were right--

540
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,470
<18-7,Chase>我们马上回来
<18-7,Chase>We'll be right back.

541
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,670
<18-7,Chase>我急需用钱
<18-7,Chase>"I could use the money"?

542
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,520
<18-7,Chase>想要耍我的话  得演得再像点
<18-7,Chase>You want to game me, you gotta do better than that.

543
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,540
<18-9,Chase>-奇斯  -你要是想当组长
<18-9,Chase>- Chase-- - You want to be a leader,

544
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,850
<18-9,Chase>就要知道如何操纵他人
<18-9,Chase>you have to know how to manipulate.

545
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,540
<18-9,Chase>你不能轻易泄露...
<18-9,Chase>You can't just spill--

546
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,570
<18-10,Park>我觉得他的眼白是黄色的
<18-10,Park>I think the whites of his eyes were yellow.

547
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,320
<18-11,Joe>一切还好吧
<18-11,Joe>Everything okay?

548
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,570
<18-12,Chase>黄疸
<18-12,Chase>Jaundice.

549
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,780
<18-13,Park>你的肝脏有问题
<18-13,Park>There's something wrong with your liver.

550
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,590
<19-1,Chase>肝功能检测确定了他的酶指标
<19-1,Chase>Liver function tests confirm his enzymes

551
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,010
<19-1,Chase>完全是一团糟
<19-1,Chase>are totally out of whack.

552
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,760
<19-2,Park>那么肯定不是重症肌无力了
<19-2,Park>So much for myasthenia gravis.

553
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
<19-3,House>我们能快点吗
<19-3,House>Can we hurry this up?

554
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,270
<19-3,House>我中午还有个政府官员要去骗
<19-3,House>I have a government to defraud at noon.

555
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,770
<19-4,Adams>如果有必要  你应该马上走
<19-4,Adams>If you need to leave, you should.

556
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,340
<19-4,Adams>我有足够理由相信我们的病人患的是结节病
<19-4,Adams>I'm fairly confident our patient's got sarcoidosis.

557
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,700
<19-5,Park>你说的话很有权威的感觉
<19-5,Park>Wow, you said that with so much authority.

558
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,050
<19-5,Park>有没有人瑟瑟发抖啦
<19-5,Park>Did anyone else get chills?

559
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,860
<19-6,Chase>不过我发现病人
<19-6,Chase>Just until I realized our patient has

560
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,140
<19-6,Chase>没有肺实质病变的迹象
<19-6,Chase>no sign of parenchymal lung abnormalities,

561
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,010
<19-6,Chase>说明结节病可能性不大
<19-6,Chase>which makes sarcoidosis a long shot.

562
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,850
<19-6,Chase>照搬书本也没比露乳有用
<19-6,Chase>And bookkeeping isn't gonna get you any farther than boobs.

563
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,980
<19-7,House>客观来说  春光确实很有帮助
<19-7,House>Though in fairness, the boobs were really, really helping.

564
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,650
<19-8,Taub>我还认为是重症肌无力
<19-8,Taub>I still think it's myasthenia gravis.

565
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,600
<19-9,Park>你是不是忘记刚才的总结了
<19-9,Park>Did you miss the recap?

566
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
<19-9,Park>我们对那进行了治疗  出现了肝损伤
<19-9,Park>We treated for that. The liver tanked.

567
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,950
<19-10,Taub>但他的视觉恢复了
<19-10,Taub>But his vision got better.

568
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,650
<19-11,Adams>肝脏问题可能是乳糜泻的标志
<19-11,Adams>Liver problems could be a sign of celiac.

569
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,490
<19-11,Adams>住院以来他又开始吃麸质了
<19-11,Adams>He's been back on gluten since he's been in the hospital.

570
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,470
<19-11,Adams>昨天他还吃了个汉堡
<19-11,Adams>Yesterday he had a burger.

571
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,410
<19-12,Taub>这可能使乳糜泻变成导火索
<19-12,Taub>That would've kicked the celiac into gear,

572
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,640
<19-12,Taub>从而导致肝脏问题
<19-12,Taub>causing the liver problems.

573
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
<19-13,Chase>那你的理论是他得了两种不相干的病
<19-13,Chase>So your theory is that he has two unrelated diseases.

574
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,300
<19-13,Chase>而同时他的睾酮素水平还过低
<19-13,Chase>And he's already got low testosterone.

575
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,360
<19-13,Chase>我好想记得豪斯很讨厌这种巧合
<19-13,Chase>I seem to remember something about House hating coincidences.

576
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,410
<19-14,House>没错
<19-14,House>It's true.

577
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,010
<19-15,Park>我认为是莱姆病
<19-15,Park>I think it's Lyme disease.

578
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,410
<19-15,Park>只得了一种病叫做莱姆
<19-15,Park>One single disease named "Lyme."

579
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,370
<19-16,Adams>没有起皮疹
<19-16,Adams>Without a rash.

580
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,590
<19-17,Chase>这种病有百分之十的患者不起皮疹
<19-17,Chase>10% of cases present without a rash.

581
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,550
<19-18,House>那就是莱姆病
<19-18,House>Lyme disease it is.

582
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,470
<19-18,House>给病人用抗生素
<19-18,House>Start the patient on antibiotics.

583
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,840
<19-18,House>现在我得赶紧回家以防我的假妻子真生气
<19-18,House>Now I have to get home before my fake wife gets real annoyed.

584
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,760
<20-1,Chase>有什么事困扰你吗
<20-1,Chase>Something bothering you?

585
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,260
<20-2,Joe>我让护士去再拿个枕头
<20-2,Joe>I asked the nurse for an extra pillow.

586
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,570
<20-2,Joe>已经半小时过去了
<20-2,Joe>That was half an hour ago.

587
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,800
<20-3,Chase>不好意思
<20-3,Chase>Sorry.

588
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,020
<20-3,Chase>这的事有点多
<20-3,Chase>Things can get pretty hectic.

589
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,740
<20-4,Joe>只是个枕头而已
<20-4,Joe>It was a pillow.

590
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,090
<20-4,Joe>我是说  拿个枕头能有多难...
<20-4,Joe>I mean, how hard can a pil--

591
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,730
<20-4,Joe>听听看  我就像个混蛋
<20-4,Joe>Listen to me. I'm being a jerk.

592
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,290
<20-5,Chase>睾酮素会使你脾气变差
<20-5,Chase>Testosterone can give you a shorter temper

593
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,370
<20-5,Chase>就算你没病也是如此
<20-5,Chase>even when you're not sick.

594
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,700
<20-5,Chase>你注意到了并做出了调整  这很好
<20-5,Chase>You noticed and adjusted. That's a good thing.

595
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,260
<20-6,Marlene>刚接到我们律师的电话
<20-6,Marlene>Just got a call from our lawyer.

596
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,060
<20-6,Marlene>你更改了我们给高管们的报价
<20-6,Marlene>You changed our counter to leading lights?

597
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,800
<20-7,Joe>在第二任期你理应获得
<20-7,Joe>You deserve proper billing

598
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,660
<20-7,Joe>合适的收入和工资增长
<20-7,Joe>and a salary bump in the second term.

599
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,560
<20-8,Marlene>我们聊过这个问题了
<20-8,Marlene>We talked about this.

600
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,280
<20-8,Marlene>我们认为冒着破坏交易的风险不值得
<20-8,Marlene>We decided it wasn't worth potentially blowing the deal.

601
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,380
<20-9,Joe>没事的
<20-9,Joe>It'll be fine.

602
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,420
<20-10,Marlene>我还有些工作要做
<20-10,Marlene>I've got to get some work done.

603
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,510
<21-1,Dominika>这些是你每周五给我买的鲜花
<21-1,Dominika>These are such pretty flowers you buy for me

604
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,720
<21-1,Dominika>每次都从爱迪生街和康韦街交口处
<21-1,Dominika>every Friday, from Japanese florist,

605
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,150
<21-1,Dominika>的日本花店里买
<21-1,Dominika>on corner of Edison and Conway.

606
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,430
<21-2,House>还差一件事
<21-2,House>Just one more thing.

607
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,460
<21-2,House>带上这戒指  我们就是夫妻了
<21-2,House>With this ring, I thee wedded.

608
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,250
<21-2,House>你和男友突然离开时把它落在这里了
<21-2,House>You left it here when you skipped town with your boyfriend.

609
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,160
<21-3,Dominika>你一直留着戒指
<21-3,Dominika>You kept the rings.

610
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,380
<21-4,House>实际上  我试图用它和
<21-4,House>Actually, I tried to trade them to a hooker

611
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,120
<21-4,House>一个妓女做笔交易
<21-4,House>for unspecified favors,

612
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,190
<21-4,House>但结果发现她不收锌制品
<21-4,House>but it turns out she doesn't accept zinc.

613
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,240
<21-5,Dominika>就像现代童话似的
<21-5,Dominika>Like modern fairytale.

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,750
<22-1,Chase>给他点时间
<22-1,Chase>Give him time.

619
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,290
<22-1,Chase>我十四岁时
<22-1,Chase>When I was 14,

620
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,770
<22-1,Chase>有个我想追的女孩
<22-1,Chase>there was a girl I wanted to impress,

621
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,540
<22-1,Chase>我跳到她家的屋顶
<22-1,Chase>so I jumped off the roof of her house.

622
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,760
<22-1,Chase>结果扭到了脚
<22-1,Chase>Broke my ankle.

623
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,680
<22-1,Chase>乔基本上算是在经历青春期
<22-1,Chase>Joe's basically going through puberty.

624
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,790
<22-1,Chase>需要一段时间进行调整
<22-1,Chase>It'll take him a while to adjust.

625
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,720
<22-2,Marlene>我看了一个乔以前
<22-2,Marlene>I-I tracked down a video

626
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,290
<22-2,Marlene>进行经商培训的演讲
<22-2,Marlene>from one of Joe's business coaching seminars

627
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,720
<22-2,Marlene>是在我认识他以前的
<22-2,Marlene>from before I knew him.

628
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,990
<22-2,Marlene>最近常听人谈论妥协的价值
<22-2,Marlene>I'm hearing a lot about the value of compromise.

629
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,740
<22-3,Joe>可我们并不生活在《芝麻街》
<22-3,Joe>We don't live on Sesame Street.

630
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,190
<22-3,Joe>我们生活在现实世界中  这是一个生意场
<22-3,Joe>We live in the real world, the business world.

631
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,030
<22-3,Joe>不能成王  即为败寇
<22-3,Joe>If you're not a winner, you're a loser.

632
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,230
<22-3,Joe>如果你无法接受这样的事实
<22-3,Joe>If you aren't comfortable with that,

633
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,160
<22-3,Joe>就回家种田去吧
<22-3,Joe>go open a pottery studio.

634
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,790
<22-4,Marlene>我永远不会和视频中的这类男人约会
<22-4,Marlene>I never would have gone out with the guy in this video.

635
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,620
<23-1,Weinmann>你记得她最后一次见维斯莉是什么时候吗
<23-1,Weinmann>Uh, do you remember the last time she visited Vasyl?

636
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,420
<23-2,House>我想下  应该是...
<23-2,House>Uh, let me see, that would be...

637
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,430
<23-2,House>是八月吧
<23-2,House>August?

638
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,460
<23-2,House>不对  是七月
<23-2,House>No. No, July.

639
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,580
<23-2,House>因为我记得正好是在我们半周年纪念日之后
<23-2,House>'Cause I remember it was right after our half-anniversary,

640
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,840
<23-2,House>我还忘记在她的旅行箱中藏礼物了
<23-2,House>and I forgot to put a gift in her suitcase.

641
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,030
<23-2,House>之后她总是对此耿耿于怀
<23-2,House>And...I've never heard the end of that one.

642
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,360
<23-3,Dominika>豪斯家特制
<23-3,Dominika>House specialty.

643
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,410
<23-3,Dominika>我想出来的双关
<23-3,Dominika>I made up this pun.

644

<23-8,Weinmann>这个是
<23-8,Weinmann>Is it...

<23-9,Dominika>谢谢
<23-9,Dominika>Thank you.

646
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,800
<23-6,House>亲爱的  你干嘛难为我啊
<23-6,House>Honey, why do you do this to me?

647
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,970
<23-6,House>明知道我要控制体重
<23-6,House>You know I'm watching my weight.

648
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,470
<23-7,Dominika>那你可以不要半夜起来
<23-7,Dominika>Then maybe you'll stop eating cheese

649
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,610
<23-7,Dominika>开冰箱偷吃奶酪啊
<23-7,Dominika>in front of open fridge in middle of the night.

650
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,410
<23-8,Weinmann>这真好吃
<23-8,Weinmann>This is delicious.

<23-9,Dominika>谢谢
<23-9,Dominika>Thank you.

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,350
<23-10,Weinmann>你们这里看上去很不错
<23-10,Weinmann>So everything looks good in here.

653
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,620
<23-10,Weinmann>我只要再找个邻居
<23-10,Weinmann>I'm just gonna step out and get a corroborating interview

654
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,040
<23-10,Weinmann>确认下你们的情况就可以了
<23-10,Weinmann>from one of the neighbors.

655
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,510
<23-11,Dominika>邻居
<23-11,Dominika>Neighbors?

656

<23-11,Dominika>这大白天的
<23-11,Dominika>It's... it's middle of the day.

657
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,990
<23-11,Dominika>我想别人都在工作吧
<23-11,Dominika>I-I-I think everybody's at work.

658
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,890
<23-12,Weinmann>那我就如实写上去
<23-12,Weinmann>Yeah, then they're at work.

659
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,090
<23-12,Weinmann>我就需要在表格上打几个钩
<23-12,Weinmann>I just got a form to check off,

660
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,110
<23-12,Weinmann>你很有希望获得永久居住权
<23-12,Weinmann>and you will be on your way to permanent status.

661
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,990
<23-13,Weinmann>先生  打扰了
<23-13,Weinmann>Excuse me, sir.

662
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,850
<23-13,Weinmann>你有空吗
<23-13,Weinmann>Do you have a minute?

663
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,030
<24-1,Wilson>有什么事吗
<24-1,Wilson>How can I help you?

664
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,730
<24-2,Weinmann>你认识豪斯医生和他夫人吗
<24-2,Weinmann>Do you know Dr. And Mrs. House?

665
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,800
<24-3,Wilson>当然  我和他们做了
<24-3,Wilson>Of course, they've been my neighbors

666
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,730
<24-3,Wilson>两年的邻居了
<24-3,Wilson>about two years, now.

667
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,740
<24-3,Wilson>他俩人很好
<24-3,Wilson>Lovely couple.

668
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,430
<24-3,Wilson>几乎每天晚上都能见到他们
<24-3,Wilson>I see them almost every night.

669
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,790
<24-3,Wilson>小两口如胶似漆的
<24-3,Wilson>They seem always to be together.

670
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,370
<24-4,Weinman>好的  谢谢你
<24-4,Weinman>Great, well, thanks for your help.

671
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,410
<24-5,Wilson>再见
<24-5,Wilson>Cheerio.

672
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,930
<24-6,Hastings>你在我家门口偷偷摸摸干嘛
<24-6,Hastings>Hey, what're you doing? That's my door.

673
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,570
<24-7,Wilson>我在为新开的中餐馆发广告
<24-7,Wilson>Handing out menus for a new Chinese place.

674
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,900
<24-8,Hastings>你就是那个每周六晚上
<24-8,Hastings>You're that guy that plays noisy video games

675
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,450
<24-8,Hastings>和豪斯一起玩电子游戏的人  吵死了
<24-8,Hastings>with House on Saturday nights.

676
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,550
<24-9,House>我的解释很简单
<24-9,House>There's a simple explanation.

677
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,440
<24-10,Weinmann>明早十点到我办公室来
<24-10,Weinmann>Be at my office tomorrow at 10:00.

678
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,900
<25-1,Taub>病人不见一丝好转
<25-1,Taub>The patient's shown zero improvement.

679
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,220
<25-2,Chase>因为他才用了一个晚上的抗生素
<25-2,Chase>Because he's only been on the antibiotics overnight.

680
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,520
<25-3,Taub>也可能他得的不是莱姆病
<25-3,Taub>Or because he doesn't have Lyme disease.

681
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,310
<25-3,Taub>你人在哪里
<25-3,Taub>Where are you?

682
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,440
<25-3,Taub>没事瞎转悠
<25-3,Taub>Oh, just chillin'.

683
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
<25-3,Taub>我在美国移民局
<25-3,Taub>U.S. Citizenship at Immigration.

684
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,380
<25-3,Taub>和我老婆与律师一起就移民诈骗等待谈话呢
<25-3,Taub>Waiting on my fraud interview with my wife and my attorney.

685
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,920
<25-3,Taub>-没啥大事儿  -豪斯
<25-3,Taub>- No big. - House.

686
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,190
<26-1,Ayres>别打电话了
<26-1,Ayres>Hang up.

688
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,120
<26-1,Ayres>我还是觉得病人得的是重症肌无力和乳糜泻
<26-1,Ayres>I still think it's myasthenia gravis plus celiac.

689
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,940
<27-1,Taub>他的饮食结构变化有很大的影响
<27-1,Taub>His change in diet has to be significant.

690
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,420
<27-2,Adams>只需要做一个肠道活检就能确诊
<27-2,Adams>We just need to do an intestinal biopsy to confirm.

691
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,540
<27-3,Chase>介于他血小板计数低
<27-3,Chase>With his low platelet count,

692
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,610
<27-3,Chase>做活检可能会
<27-3,Chase>a biopsy puts him at risk

693
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,440
<27-3,Chase>引起腹腔出血  危及生命
<27-3,Chase>for an abdominal bleed, which puts him at risk of death.

694
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,450
<28-1,Ayres>你别再打了
<28-1,Ayres>Either you're done,

695
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,180
<28-1,Ayres>否则我不陪你进去
<28-1,Ayres>or you're walking in there without a lawyer.

696
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,900
<28-2,House>懂了  这听上去像电话铃
<28-2,House>I know, it sounds like a phone,

697
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,850
<28-2,House>其实是为开会前提醒我撒尿设的闹铃
<28-2,House>but it's a timer to remind me to pee before our meeting.

698
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,680
<28-2,House>你好  老伙计
<28-2,House>Hello, old chap.

699
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,230
<28-2,House>你要自救啊
<28-2,House>You need to save yourself.

700
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,130
<28-2,House>我昨晚一夜未眠
<28-2,House>I was up last night

701
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,240
<29-1,Wilson>想找个新的托辞  可是找不到
<29-1,Wilson>trying to find another angle, but I can't.

702
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,860
<29-1,Wilson>就和移民局的人说  你和多米尼卡相爱过
<29-1,Wilson>Tell immigration you were in love with Dominika,

703
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,280
<29-1,Wilson>但是你们的婚姻破碎了
<29-1,Wilson>but your marriage fell apart,

704
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,190
<29-1,Wilson>所以才一直分居
<29-1,Wilson>and that's why you haven't been living together.

705
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,810
<29-2,House>她会被永久驱逐的
<29-2,House>She'll be deported permanently.

706
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,990
<29-3,Wilson>豪斯  我知道你喜欢多米尼卡
<29-3,Wilson>House, I know you like Dominika,

707
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,250
<29-3,Wilson>你和她一起很开心  但是你被人逮到了
<29-3,Wilson>you have fun with her, but you got caught.

708
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,270
<29-3,Wilson>除此之外  别无他法
<29-3,Wilson>There's no getting out of this.

709
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,190
<29-3,Wilson>你不回监狱就是最好的结果了
<29-3,Wilson>The best you could hope for is that you don't go back to jail.

710
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,210
<29-4,House>让我的小组  别做活检
<29-4,House>Tell my team to... to skip the biopsy

711
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,160
<29-4,House>继续用抗生素
<29-4,House>and give the antibiotics more time.

712
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,800
<29-5,Ayres>轮到我们了
<29-5,Ayres>They're ready for us.

713
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,630
<30-1,Joe>我表明了立场  获得了胜利
<30-1,Joe>I drew a line in the sand, and I won.

714
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,230
<30-1,Joe>我们应该庆祝胜利
<30-1,Joe>We should be celebrating.

715
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,920
<30-2,Adams>要再给你们几分钟时间吗
<30-2,Adams>Do you need a few minutes?

716
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,320
<30-3,Joe>是的  我感觉好多了
<30-3,Joe>You're right. I keep getting better.

717
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,720
<30-4,Marlene>就这样了
<30-4,Marlene>That's just it.

718
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,810
<30-4,Marlene>你是赢了
<30-4,Marlene>You won.

719
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,070
<30-4,Marlene>你提出的要求可能会使交易泡汤
<30-4,Marlene>You made a demand that could've blown up the deal,

720
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,750
<30-4,Marlene>而且你也没征询过我的意见
<30-4,Marlene>and you never even asked me.

721
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,500
<30-5,Joe>交易没有泡汤  他们妥协了
<30-5,Joe>Deal didn't blow up. They caved.

722
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,090
<30-6,Marlene>乔  是你在研讨会上说的
<30-6,Marlene>Joe, you say it in your seminars.

723
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,650
<30-6,Marlene>过程与结果同样重要
<30-6,Marlene>Process matters just as much as results.

724
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,410
<30-7,Joe>你就因为我在这件小事上没和你商量
<30-7,Joe>Are you seriously busting my chops

725
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,050
<30-7,Joe>所以就给我脸色看吗
<30-7,Joe>because I made one little move without you?

726
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,530
<30-7,Joe>你就不能闪一边去  让我
<30-7,Joe>How 'bout stepping aside and letting me

727
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,930
<30-7,Joe>像个男人那样做次主不行吗
<30-7,Joe>be the man in this relationship for a change?

728
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,950
<30-8,Marlene>你现在真是不可理喻
<30-8,Marlene>I really can't talk to you right now.

729
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,630
<30-9,Joe>我不知道怎么会说出这种话
<30-9,Joe>I don't know why I said that.

730
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,480
<30-9,Joe>就感觉非常生气
<30-9,Joe>Just I got so angry.

731
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,700
<30-10,Adams>希望这次的药用完
<30-10,Adams>Hopefully after this dose,

732
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,150
<30-10,Adams>你的情况能好转  可以出院回家
<30-10,Adams>you'll start to feel better, and we can get you home.

733
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,180
<30-10,Adams>我还有个检查想做
<30-10,Adams>But I'd like to do one more test.

734
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,800
<31-1,Ayres>不能仅凭一个近视的愤怒邻居的证词
<31-1,Ayres>The testimony of one angry, nearsighted neighbor

735
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,520
<31-1,Ayres>就无视其它的证据吧
<31-1,Ayres>shouldn't outweigh all other evidence.

736
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,000
<31-1,Ayres>有照片  水电煤的账单...
<31-1,Ayres>Photos, utility bills...

737
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,690
<31-2,Weinmann>搞得好像你的委托人从没造过假似的
<31-2,Weinmann>Yes, because your clients would never fake anything.

738
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,730
<31-3,Ayres>我们承认假扮邻居是个错误
<31-3,Ayres>Uh, we acknowledge the neighbor thing was a mistake,

739
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,960
<31-3,Ayres>但并不是说所有其他的证明
<31-3,Ayres>but that doesn't mean that all of the other documentation

740
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,120
<31-3,Ayres>就是一纸空文了
<31-3,Ayres>should just be thrown out.

741
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,170
<31-4,Weinman>听着  我知道你是出于本职工作
<31-4,Weinman>Look, look, you know, I get that it's your job

742
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,410
<31-4,Weinman>竭尽全力想要立案  但是请你闭嘴
<31-4,Weinman>to try to act like there's a case here, but shut up.

743
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,060
<31-5,Ayres>好的
<31-5,Ayres>Okay.

744
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,870
<31-6,Weinmann>美国公民及移民服务局将会
<31-6,Weinmann>USCIS will be denying

745
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,750
<31-6,Weinmann>拒绝佩特洛娃小姐的绿卡申请
<31-6,Weinmann>Miss Petrova's green card application.

746
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,750
<31-6,Weinmann>你会被转去移民庭
<31-6,Weinmann>You'll be referred to immigration court

747
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,970
<31-6,Weinmann>准备离境手续
<31-6,Weinmann>for deportation proceedings.

748
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,760
<31-6,Weinmann>同时  我们会把你诈骗的事实
<31-6,Weinmann>And we're gonna inform your parole officer

749
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,480
<31-6,Weinmann>告知你的假释官
<31-6,Weinmann>about evidence of fraud.

750
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,400
<31-6,Weinmann>所以  如果没有人还要补充的话...
<31-6,Weinmann>So unless anybody has anything else to add...

751
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,580
<31-7,Dominika>我求你了  别把他送回监狱
<31-7,Dominika>Please, I am begging, do not send him back to jail.

752
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,750
<31-7,Dominika>或许我们没有共同生活过...
<31-7,Dominika>Maybe we have not lived together all these...

753
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,390
<31-8,Weinmann>豪斯夫人  我建议你别说下去了
<31-8,Weinmann>Mrs. House, I have to advise you not to continue.

754
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,560
<31-9,Dominika>我和这个男人
<31-9,Dominika>This man and I,

755
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,150
<31-9,Dominika>我们的结合是因为爱情吗
<31-9,Dominika>did we marry for love?

756
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,460
<31-9,Dominika>不是
<31-9,Dominika>No.

757
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,400
<31-9,Dominika>但是在过去的一周里
<31-9,Dominika>But this past week,

758
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,480
<31-9,Dominika>我们过得非常快乐
<31-9,Dominika>we have a lot of fun.

759
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,500
<31-9,Dominika>为了欺骗美国政府我们真是挤尽脑汁啊  是不是
<31-9,Dominika>Working really hard to fool the U.S. Government, right?

760
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,320
<31-10,Ayres>别回答她
<31-10,Ayres>Don't answer that.

761
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,520
<31-11,House>你说晚了
<31-11,House>Way ahead of you.

762
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,320
<31-12,Dominika>我们的婚姻是虚假的
<31-12,Dominika>It was fake, but...

763
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,090
<31-12,Dominika>但是这感觉却是真实的
<31-12,Dominika>It felt real.

764
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,510
<31-12,Dominika>或许是因为这婚姻开始变得真实了
<31-12,Dominika>Maybe because it become real.

765
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,770
<31-12,Dominika>这个男人
<31-12,Dominika>This man...

766
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,490
<31-12,Dominika>我丈夫
<31-12,Dominika>My husband.

767
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,530
<31-12,Dominika>我想要和他共同生活  但是如果做不到
<31-12,Dominika>I want to stay with him, but if I cannot,

768
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,910
<31-12,Dominika>请你们把我送走  给他自由吧
<31-12,Dominika>please send me away, and let him be free.

769
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,380
<31-12,Dominika>我爱他
<31-12,Dominika>I love him.

770
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,510
<31-13,Weinmann>你说的我一个字都不信
<31-13,Weinmann>I didn't buy a word you said.

771
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,230
<31-13,Weinmann>但是法官可能信
<31-13,Weinmann>But a judge might.

772
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,620
<31-13,Weinmann>我让你留下
<31-13,Weinmann>I'm gonna let you stay.

773
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,620
<31-13,Weinmann>但是在未来六个月里
<31-13,Weinmann>But for the next six months,

774
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,210
<31-13,Weinmann>我不会忘了你们这事儿
<31-13,Weinmann>I'm gonna hold onto this file.

775
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,400
<31-13,Weinmann>无论凌晨还是深夜
<31-13,Weinmann>And our investigators are gonna show up unannounced

776
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,700
<31-13,Weinmann>我们的调查员都可能突然到访
<31-13,Weinmann>6:00 a.m., 11:00 at night, and they better find

777
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,030
<31-13,Weinmann>最好让他们看到你们俩坐在沙发上
<31-13,Weinmann>the two of you sitting on the couch watching NCIS

778
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,550
<31-13,Weinmann>看看电视  吃吃冰激凌  亲密无间
<31-13,Weinmann>eating ice cream from the same spoon.

779
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,840
<31-13,Weinmann>否则你们两个都别想
<31-13,Weinmann>Or both of you will be sent to places

780
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,180
<31-13,Weinmann>再过现在这样的好日子
<31-13,Weinmann>far less pleasant than New Jersey.

781
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,160
<31-14,House>你前面说的...
<31-14,House>What you just said in there...

782
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,980
<31-15,Dominika>别担心
<31-15,Dominika>Don't worry.

783
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,180
<31-15,Dominika>我聪明得很  才不会爱上你
<31-15,Dominika>I'm much too smart to be falling in love with you.

784
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,800
<31-15,Dominika>卫生间里给我加个置物架
<31-15,Dominika>I will be needing extra shelf in bathroom.

785
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,200
<32-1,Adams>腹腔活检发现小肠绒毛扁平
<32-1,Adams>Abdominal biopsy showed flattened villi.

786
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,330
<32-1,Adams>看来你关于乳糜泻的推测是对的
<32-1,Adams>Looks like you were right about celiac.

787
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,050
<32-2,Taub>奇斯违背豪斯安排活检被刺了一刀
<32-2,Taub>You do remember Chase got stabbed

788
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,790
<32-2,Taub>这事你没忘吧
<32-2,Taub>doing a test House didn't order?

789
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,420
<32-3,Adams>类比得当  因为两位病人
<32-3,Adams>Good comparison, since both patients

790
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,400
<32-3,Adams>都被类固醇折磨得不行
<32-3,Adams>were tweaked on steroids.

791
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,350
<32-4,Taub>你这样做不过是为了盖过奇斯和朴克的风头
<32-4,Taub>You only did this to score points over Chase and Park.

792
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,100
<32-5,Adams>我们猜对了
<32-5,Adams>We were right.

793
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,850
<32-5,Adams>我证明了  病人也没有大出血
<32-5,Adams>I proved it, and the patient didn't bleed out.

794
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,490
<32-5,Adams>你为什么揪住这事不放
<32-5,Adams>Why are you being a jerk about this?

795
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,510
<32-5,Adams>我们去看看豪斯回来没有
<32-5,Adams>Let's go see if House is back.

796
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,250
<32-6,Taub>病人出现呼吸困难
<32-6,Taub>Patient's having trouble breathing.

797
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,650
<32-7,Adams>那就不是乳糜泻了
<32-7,Adams>So much for celiac.

798
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,800
<33-1,Taub>呼吸已经平稳
<33-1,Taub>His breathing is stabilized,

799
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,630
<33-1,Taub>可是肺功能只有60%  而且肝脏积水
<33-1,Taub>but his lung function is at 60%, and his liver is tanking.

800
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,420
<33-2,Adams>还具有乳糜泻的主要症状
<33-2,Adams>And he has major symptoms of celiac

801
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,860
<33-2,Adams>但是没有患乳糜泻
<33-2,Adams>without actually having celiac.

802
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,960
<33-3,Chase>可能是惠普尔氏病
<33-3,Chase>Could be Whipple's.

803
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,090
<33-4,Taub>不能解释失禁
<33-4,Taub>Doesn't explain the incontinence.

804
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,380
<33-4,Taub>小肠淋巴瘤呢
<33-4,Taub>Intestinal lymphoma?

805
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,480
<33-5,Chase>不能解释视物重影
<33-5,Chase>Doesn't explain the double vision.

806
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,440
<33-5,Chase>随时欢迎加入讨论
<33-5,Chase>Any time you want to jump in.

807
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,260
<33-6,House>真有有氧操这种东西吗
<33-6,House>Is Dance Aerobics even a thing?

808
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,200
<33-6,House>有助美臀
<33-6,House>It's good for the butt.

809
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,380
<33-7,Adams>会不会是寄生虫感染
<33-7,Adams>What about a parasitic infection?

810
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,580
<33-7,Adams>类圆线虫属寄生虫感染能破坏小肠
<33-7,Adams>Strongyloides is known to damage the small intestine.

811
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,120
<33-8,Chase>在美国感染线虫跟中彩差不多是一个几率
<33-8,Chase>In this country, he's about as likely to get that as win powerball.

812
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,390
<33-9,Park>总有人中彩嘛  每周都有
<33-9,Park>Someone does win powerball. Every week.

813
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,440
<33-9,Park>病人数月前去过波多黎各
<33-9,Park>The patient went to Puerto Rico a few months ago.

814
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,960
<33-9,Park>美国少数几个有可能感染线虫
<33-9,Park>One of the few places in the U.S.

815
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,520
<33-9,Park>的地区之一
<33-9,Park>you could pick up strongyloides.

816
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,450
<33-10,Taub>治疗需用伊维菌素
<33-10,Taub>Treatment is ivermectin.

817
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,440
<33-10,Taub>此药用于肝功能障碍患者
<33-10,Taub>We give that to someone with liver problems,

818
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,100
<33-10,Taub>可能导致他癫痫发作  甚至更糟
<33-10,Taub>he could have seizures, or worse.

819
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,720
<33-11,House>治吧
<33-11,House>Do it.

820
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,330
<34-1,Joe>最近常听人谈论妥协的价值
<34-1,Joe>I'm hearing a lot about the value of compromise.

821
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,520
<34-1,Joe>可我们并不生活在《芝麻街》
<34-1,Joe>But we don't live on Sesame Street,

822
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,830
<34-1,Joe>我们生活在现实...
<34-1,Joe>we live in the real--

823
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,330
<34-2,Taub>我在想我们或许是忽略了某种病征
<34-2,Taub>I was wondering if maybe we overlooked a symptom,

824
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,470
<34-2,Taub>或者别的什么
<34-2,Taub>or something.

825
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,730
<34-3,House>非常有道理
<34-3,House>Makes perfect sense.

826
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,450
<34-3,House>比如我们忽略了你的娘娘腔症状
<34-3,House>If you're the patient, and "pantywaist" is the symptom.

827
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,890
<34-4,Taub>我和亚当斯都认为病人可能患有乳糜泻
<34-4,Taub>Adams and I both thought the patient could have celiac,

828
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,510
<34-4,Taub>可是她甘冒奇险  做了活检
<34-4,Taub>but only she was willing to go out on a limb and run the test.

829
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,810
<34-4,Taub>我放弃
<34-4,Taub>I gave up.

830
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,210
<34-5,House>所以你在这里看励志演讲
<34-5,House>Now you're in here watching a motivational speech.

831
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,540
<34-5,House>连你试图重拾自信的方法都缺乏自信
<34-5,House>Even your attempt to get your balls back lacks balls.

832
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,290
<34-6,Joe>世界中  这是一个生意场
<34-6,Joe>--world, the business world.

833
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,190
<34-6,Joe>不能成王  即为败寇
<34-6,Joe>If you're not a winner, you're a loser.

834
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,180
<34-7,Taub>他的声音  比现在要低沉
<34-7,Taub>His voice--it's lower than it is now.

835
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,530
<34-8,House>职业演说家的声音
<34-8,House>If only there was a good reason

836
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,560
<34-8,House>为什么会嘶哑  真是个问题
<34-8,House>for a professional speaker to be hoarse.

837
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,520
<34-9,Joe>回家种田去吧
<34-9,Joe>Go open a pottery studio.

838
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,770
<34-10,Taub>有道理
<34-10,Taub>Good point.

839
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,120
<34-11,House>不是有道理  是真知灼见
<34-11,House>It's not a good point. It's a decent point.

840
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,930
<34-11,House>你又犯了  还有别的视频吗
<34-11,House>You're doing it again. You have any other videos?

841
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,920
<34-11,House>演讲片段
<34-11,House>Other seminars?

842
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,600
<34-12,Taub>有几段
<34-12,Taub>A couple.

843
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,270
<34-13,Joe>发现弱点的时候
<34-13,Joe>When you see a weakness,

844
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,000
<34-13,Joe>就是拿出勇气的时候
<34-13,Joe>that's a time for strength.

845
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
<34-13,Joe>许多人会说  "我很生气
<34-13,Joe>A lot of people say, "Oh, I feel bad about it.

846
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,150
<34-13,Joe>是旁人犯了错"
<34-13,Joe>The other guy made a mistake."

847
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,200
<34-14,House>你过早放弃了自己的观点
<34-14,House>You bailed too early.

848
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,770
<34-14,House>现在功劳是我一个人的了
<34-14,House>Now I get all the credit.

849
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,870
<35-1,House>慢性声音嘶哑
<35-1,House>Chronic hoarseness

850
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,510
<35-1,House>是一种病的症状
<35-1,House>is a symptom of a condition called

851
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,900
<35-1,House>静息性甲状腺炎
<35-1,House>Silent thyroiditis.

852
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,880
<35-2,Joe>-可是我没有声音嘶哑  -没错
<35-2,Joe>- But I'm not hoarse. - Exactly.

853
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,680
<35-2,Joe>可你三年前声音嘶哑
<35-2,Joe>But you were three years ago.

854
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,440
<35-3,House>静息性甲状腺炎出现又消失
<35-3,House>Silent thyroiditis comes and goes.

855
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,210
<35-3,House>此病正是另一病症的症状
<35-3,House>And it, in turn, is a symptom

856
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,980
<35-3,House>多腺体自身免疫综合征3型
<35-3,House>of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 3,

857
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,260
<35-3,House>所以注射类固醇实在要不得
<35-3,House>Which makes this a really bad idea.

858
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,230
<35-3,House>病症攻击自身的内分泌系统
<35-3,House>Pas 3 attacks the body's own endocrine system,

859
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,700
<35-3,House>接二连三地破坏腺体
<35-3,House>moving from gland to gland.

860
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,170
<35-3,House>从甲状腺开始
<35-3,House>It started in the thyroid,

861
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,040
<35-3,House>而且很可能由于你睾酮素水平低的原因
<35-3,House>and probably helped along by your low testosterone,

862
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,830
<35-3,House>轻易影响到内脏
<35-3,House>moved on to the gut.

863
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,440
<35-4,Taub>造成了乳糜泻
<35-4,Taub>Where it caused celiac disease,

864
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,920
<35-4,Taub>或者说  如果你摄入麸质  会造成乳糜泻
<35-4,Taub>or it would've if you weren't on a gluten-free diet.

865
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,200
<35-4,Taub>我是对的
<35-4,Taub>I was right.

866
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,590
<35-5,House>真是相当有用的线索
<35-5,House>This is incredibly relevant.

867
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,260
<35-5,House>随着时间推进  病症侵害你的胸腺
<35-5,House>Eventually, pas 3 attacked your thymus gland.

868
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,270
<35-5,House>造成重症肌无力  终于导致你入院
<35-5,House>You developed myasthenia gravis, which landed you in here,

869
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,880
<35-5,House>而你又开始吃麸质  让病情变得更糟
<35-5,House>And you started eating gluten, which only made things worse.

870
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,370
<35-6,Joe>我会好起来吧
<35-6,Joe>So am I gonna be okay?

871
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,410
<35-7,Taub>我们会用大剂量类固醇
<35-7,Taub>We'll treat the various conditions

872
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,400
<35-7,Taub>治疗各种症状
<35-7,Taub>with high-dose steroids.

873
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,310
<35-7,Taub>如果有效  你就没事了
<35-7,Taub>Assuming they respond, you should be fine.

874
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,220
<35-8,Marlene>那睾酮素呢
<35-8,Marlene>And the testosterone?

875
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,600
<35-9,House>蛋被踢了就是被踢了
<35-9,House>Kicked in the nuts is kicked in the nuts.

876
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,230
<36-1,House>过去的一周里
<36-1,House>Over the past week,

877
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,490
<36-1,House>你们都有得意之时  也有失意之刻
<36-1,House>you've all had good moments and bad.

878
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,260
<36-1,House>竞选者中无一胜出
<36-1,House>No one candidate has prevailed.

879
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,030
<36-1,House>所以现在  我们开展竞赛
<36-1,House>And so now, we embark upon a contest

880
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,780
<36-1,House>考验医术  耐心和技巧
<36-1,House>of medical strength, stamina, and skill.

881
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,020
<36-2,Chase>能不能跳过这段
<36-2,Chase>Can we just get this over with?

882
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,500
<36-3,House>如果澳大利亚代表
<36-3,House>If the competitor representing Australia

883
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,760
<36-3,House>有意主动扣掉一分
<36-3,House>would like to take a point deduction,

884
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,280
<36-3,House>他大可以继续嘀咕
<36-3,House>he should, by all means, continue yapping.

885
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,370
<36-4,Park>你得意的样子快让我们觉得
<36-4,Park>Your glee is on the verge of making this

886
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,920
<36-4,Park>不值得继续下去了
<36-4,Park>not worth it for any of us.

887
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,160
<36-5,House>至少让我点燃火炬吧
<36-5,House>Can I at least light the torch?

895
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,870
<37-2,Joe>或者降低剂量

<37-6,Joe>我愿意冒这个险
